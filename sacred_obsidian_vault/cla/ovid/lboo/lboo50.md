 <p>AND who now attaches any value to the liberal arts, or looks on poetry as   worth a straw? Time was when genius was held more precious than gold; now, if   you've no money, you are accounted the veriest barbarian! My books have the   good fortune to please my mistress. They have the entrée to her; I,   alas, have not. She has given high praise to the poetry, but on the poet she   has shut her door. I am told that I'm a genius, yet they leave me to cool my   heels where I can. Any rich parvenu who has swash-bucklered his way to wealth   is set above me.</p>   
 <p>Can you, my life, really be so scatter-brained as to put your arms about   him? Can you, my life, let him put his arms about you? Let me tell you, in   case you know it not, that that head of his was recently covered by a helmet,   and that a sword hung from that side which now is so devoted to you. His left   hand, with the gold ring which fits it so ill, bore a shield; touch his Tight   hand, and you'll find it bathed with blood. The man's a murderer! Can you   really hold his hand? What has become of that soft heart of yours? Count   those scars, the records of the fights that he's been through. All that he   has, he won at the price of his blood. Perhaps he will tell you how many   throats he has cut. And are you so greedy for money that you can touch such   cruel hands, while I, innocent priest of Apollo and the Muses, vainly lay my   verses at your unheeding door?</p>

 <p>You, who are wise, learn not our useless poet's lore; learn rather to   march with noisy troops and to follow the career of war. Instead of trying to   be a poet, learn to be a soldier. Even if you were Homer himself, only thus   could you obtain the favours of the fair. Jupiter knew well enough that   nothing is so powerful as gold, and he won the virgin on whom be had cast his   eye by changing himself to gold. So long as gold was not forthcoming he found   himself face to face with an obdurate father, an inflexible damsel, doors of   brass and a tower of iron; but no sooner did the would-be seducer arrive with   presents than she unveiled her bosom, and forthwith gave--what she was asked   to give.</p>   
 <p>It was not thus in aged Saturn's reign. Then all the metals were buried   deep within the bowels of the earth. Bronze and silver, gold and heavy iron   to the shades he had committed. In those olden days no treasure heaps were   seen. But better things earth gave than that, rich harvests from the   unlaborious earth, fruits in abundance and stores of honey laid in the hollow   oak. None ever broke the soil with the patient plough, no land surveyor   parcelled out the soil; no oars smote the tossing waves. For mortals, then,   the shores of the sea were barriers impassable. Against thyself, O Man, hast   thou turned thy powers of invention, and used thy genius to invent evils   untold. What hath it availed thee to girdle your cities. round with towers   and ramparts, and among men to stir up armed war? What is the sea to thee?   The earth might have sufficed thee. There is another realm to conquer--the   sky; wherefore attack it not? To the heavens, too, thou dost aspire, so far   as thou Mayest. Quirinus, Bacchus, Alcides, and, now, Cæsar have each   their temple.</p>   
 <p>We dig the earth for gold instead of golden harvests. The soldier   possesses wealth obtained by blood. The Senate shuts its doors against the   poor; money paves the way to honours. Money makes the solemn judge, the</p>

 <p>haughty knight. Let them have everything; let them lord it over the Campus   Martius and the Forum; let them decide on peace or war; but in their   greediness let them draw the line at robbing me of my mistress, and I shall   be content. They must leave something to the poor man.</p>   
 <p>But nowadays, any woman, be she as prudish as the Sabines, is treated like   a chattel-slave by any man who can throw about his money. Now, I'm always   stopped by this keeper fellow, and she says that she's in mortal terror of   her husband. If I could afford costly presents, both of them would disappear   as by magic. Oh, if there be a god who will avenge the unrequited lover, let   him reduce such ill-gotten wealth to dust.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
