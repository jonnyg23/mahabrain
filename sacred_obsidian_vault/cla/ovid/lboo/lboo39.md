 <p>IF anyone deems it a disgrace to be the slave of a beautiful woman, well   then, I will plead guilty to the charge. Let him declare me an infamous   fellow if he will, only let the goddess who rules over Paphos and wave-girt   Cythera treat me a little more gently. Ali, would that I had fallen captive   to a sweet and gentle woman, since I was fated to fall to a</p>

 <p>lovely one. Beauty engenders pride. Corinna is so fair, there's no   managing her. Poor devil that I am, would she did not know how lovely she is!   It is her mirror that makes her so conceited, and she never looks in it until   her toilet is complete. Even if your charms do make you proud and promise   conquests, charms that were born to captivate my eyes, that is no reason why   you should treat me with disdain. High and low may mate together. They tell   that the nymph Calypso, fired with love for a mortal, made him tarry with her   against his will. ’Tis well known, too, that a daughter of Nereus did   not disdain to lie with the King of Phthia, Egeria with Numa the just, and   Venus with Vulcan, limping withal and dirty as he came straight from his   forge. These lines are not of equal length, yet the heroic metre matches well   its shorter fellow.</p>   
 <p>Dear heart, take me on whatsoever terms thou wilt. Throned high upon thy   bed, be pleased to let me know thy laws. I'll never raise an accusing finger at   you; you'll never have to disavow our love.</p>   
 <p>Let my verses be to you instead of riches. More than one woman owes her   fame to me. I know of one who everywhere gives out that she's Corinna. What   would she not give to be Corinna in very sooth? But even as we see not the   cool Eurotas and the poplar-fringed Po gliding along between the self-same   banks, so none but thou shalt be the subject of my song, and thou alone shalt   be my inspiration.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
