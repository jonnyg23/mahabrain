HE GIVES HIS MISTRESS, A CODE BY WHICH THEY CAN TESTIFY THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER, BENEATH HER HUSBAND'S VERY EYES.</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="45%">   
 <p>YOUR husband will be at our supper. May that supper be his last. So I   shall only be looking on my beloved as any other of the guests might look on   her. The right to caress her belongs to another. Voluptuously lying at   another's feet, his is the bosom thou wilt warm. And when he will, he may pat   and stroke thy neck. Marvel no more that, her bridal banquet over, the fair   Hippodamia excites the monstrous race of the Centaurs to the combat. I dwell   not, as do they, in the forests, nor, as they, am I half-man, half-horse; yet   it would, I trow, be full hard for me to restrain my ardour and my jealousy.   Now learn what it will behove thee to do and suffer not the winds, neither   Eurus nor the warm-breathing Notus, to whirl away my words.</p>   
 <p>See to it that thou comest before thy husband. I do not surely foresee   what, if thou dost so, may befall; yet be there before him. When he shall   have lain him down beside the table, go thou, with mien demure, and lay thee   at his side, but forget not, as thou passest, to rub my foot, but, secretly,   so that he shall not see. Never take thine eyes off me; take heed of all my   movements and note the discourse of my eyes. Secretly receive, and secretly   send forth, these signals of our love. Though they utter no word, my eyebrows   shall speak to thee; my fingers, aye, and the very wine itself shall have   their language. When thou bethinkest thee of the delights we taste together,   thou and I, pass thy dainty hand o’er the roses of thy cheeks, If there   is aught wherewith thou wouldst secretly reproach me, softly, with thy   fingers, touch the tip of thine ear. When the signs I make, or</p>   
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>   
 <p>the words I speak, delight thee, then be sure, my starry one, to twist thy   ring about thy finger.</p>   
 <p>Touch the table as the priest toucheth the altar, when thou wouldst call   down well-merited evils on thy husband. When he shall pour out wine for thee,   bid him quaff it himself; then whisper softly to the slave and bid him bring   thee the wine thou dost prefer. The cup which thou givest him back, I will   drink therefrom, and the place thy lips have touched, there shall my lips   touch also. If, peradventure, he offer thee a dish whereof he hath already   tasted, put it from, thee. Suffer him not to shower upon thee his unworthy   caresses. Lean not thy dainity head upon his uncouth breast; let not his   roving fingers touch thy lovely breast; and above all, see that there be no   kissing. If thou but give him a single one, I will proclaim myself thy lover;   I will say, "These kisses are mine," and I'll clap a heavy hand   upon him.</p>   
 <p>These caresses at least I shall behold with mine eyes, but the fondlings   that the table-cover shall conceal from my sight, they are the hidden things   that will put my soul to the rack. Put not thy thighs nor thy legs nigh to   thy husband, nor touch with thy dainty toes his hard and clumsy foot.</p>   
 <p>Ah, hapless me; countless are the things of this kind that I dread, for   countless are the times I have myself indulged in them. All that I myself   have experienced with thee, comes back to-day to torture me. Often times my   mistress and I, feeling with our hands beneath our sheltering raiment, have   forestalled the sweet moment of delight. Thus thou shalt not do, but so thou   mayest free me from the merest shadow of misgiving, lay bare thy shoulders   from the mantle that enshrouds them. Cease not to bid thy husband drink; but   add no kisses to thy prayers; and so long as he shall be able to swallow,   stint not secretly to fill his cup with strong wine. When he is overcome by   sleep and liquor, we ourselves will do what the place and the circumstances   permit.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>   
 <p>When thou risest up to return home, all the company will rise with thee;   remember then to place thyself in the midst of the throng. There shalt thou   find me, or I thee, and then whatsoever part of me thou canst touch, lay thy   hand upon it.</p>   
 <p>Ay me! These my behests can serve but for an hour or two. The imperious   night is at hand that severs me from my mistress. Her husband will have her   in keep and hold till the day cometh, and I, weeping sad tears, can but   follow her to that cruel door. He will taste her lips, and anon far more than   her lips. What thou grantest me in secret, he will demand as his right. But   this, at least, give him with reluctance, thus much thou canst do, and as one   yielding to superior force. Silent be thy caresses and let Venus be niggard   with him. If thou fulfillest my behests, he will taste no delight, and thou   at least will feel none in his arms. Howbeit, whatsoever may betide to-night,   assure me on the morrow that he hath had no joy of thee.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="10%">
