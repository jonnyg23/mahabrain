 <p></p>  <h2 align="center">ELEGY XIV:</h2>  <h3 align="center">TO HIS MISTRESS, WHO, CONTRARY TO HIS COUNSEL, DYED HER HAIR WITH NOXIOUS COMPOSITIONS, AND HAS NEARLY BECOME BALD.</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="44%">   
 <p>DID I not say to thee, "Cease to dye thy hair?" And now thou   hast no longer any hair to dye. Nevertheless, hadst thou not been stubborn,   where was there anything more beautiful than thy hair? It came down to thy   knees, so fine thou wast afraid to comb it. No finer is the tissue with which   the dark-skinned Seres clothe themselves; no finer is the thread which, with   her dainty legs, the spider, swaying from her lonely beam, draws out to weave   her airy web. Howbeit its colour was not black as ebony, nor was it golden.   ’Twas a mixture of the two. Such is the colour of the tall cedar in the   cool valleys of Mount Ida, when its bark is stripped away.</p>   
 <p>So soft, so tractable it was that thou couldst bind it in countless   different ways, without the smallest trouble. Never did the comb's tooth tear   thy tresses; thy tire-woman was never fearful of a slapping. Many a time have   I been present at my mistress's toilet and never did she seize the bodkin to   prick her woman's arms. Sometimes of a morning, her hair still in disorder,   she would</p>   
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>   
 <p>lie, half turned over, on the purple bed. And even then, in her careless   abandon, she was lovely, lovely with the loveliness of an o’er-wearied   Bacchanal who has cast herself, heedless of her posture, on the green grass.</p>   
 <p>Then her tresses were soft as down. How often, alas, have I seen them put   to the torture, compelled patiently to endure both iron and fire, to make   them stay in little rounded curls. "’Tis a crime," I cried,   "a crime to scorch that hair of thine; it falls beautifully of its own   accord. Cruel one, have mercy on thine own head. Away with such violent   treatment. This is not the sort of hair to scorch. Thy hair itself instructs   the bodkin where to go."</p>   
 <p>Gone are those lovely tresses which Apollo, which Bacchus, might have   envied; such tresses as Dione, coming naked from the foam, upheld with her   dripping hands.</p>   
 <p>Why, since they pleased thee not, dost thou lament the ruin of thy   tresses? Wherefore, stupid one, dost thou thrust aside so mournfully thy   mirror? No longer doth it please thee, remembering what thou wast, to gaze   therein.</p>   
 <p>Howbeit ’tis not to magic herbs culled by a jealous rival, nor to   water drawn by some treacherous witch from Hæmonian springs, that their   fall is due. ’Tis not the effect of some dire malady (the gods keep   thee from that), no, nor a rival's jealous tongue, envious of their beauty.   No, thine is the crime, and thine own the hand that wrought the loss thou   mournest; thine own the hand that poured the poison on thy head. Now Germany   will send you some slave-girl's hair; a vanquished nation shall furnish thy   adornments. Alas, how oft, when thou shalt hear men praise the beauty of thy   hair, wilt thou tell thyself with a blush, "’Tis purchased   merchandise that makes me comely in their sight to-day; of some unknown   Sygambrian girl my friends the praises sing. Yet I remember the day when that   glory was my own."</p>   
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>   
 <p>Heavens, what have I said? See, she can scarce restrain her tears. She   buries her face in her hands, and look how she is blushing. She steals a   glance at one of her fallen tresses lying in her lap, a treasure, alas I not   fitted for that place. Nay, come then, soothe thy heart and clear thy brow.   The loss is not irreparable. Ere long with thine own hair, thou wilt be   beauteous as of yore.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
