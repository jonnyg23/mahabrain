 <p>THY lover is a soldier, and Cupid hath his camp. Aye, believe me, Atticus,   every lover is a soldier. The age which suiteth war is also favourable to   Venus. A fig for an elderly soldier! A fig for an elderly lover! The age   which generals demand in a brave soldier is the age which a fair young woman   demands in the possessor of her charms. Soldier and lover have, each, their   vigil to keep; both couch upon the hard ground; both have their watch to   keep, the one at the door of his mistress, the other at the door of his   general. What a weary way the soldier hath to march! And the lover, when his   mistress is exiled, will follow her, with a stout heart, to the uttermost   limits of the world. He will fare over the loftiest mountains and over rivers   swollen with rains; he will cleave his way through the snowdrifts. Is he   compelled to cross the seas? He will not plead that the tempests are let   loose; nor will he wait till the weather be propitious for setting sail. Who   but a soldier or a lover will brave the chill nights and the torrents of   mingled snow and rain? The one is sent forward as a scout towards the enemy;   the other keepeth watch upon his rival as upon a foe. The one lays siege to   warlike cities, the other to the dwelling of his inexorable mistress. One   beats down gates, the other doors.</p>   
 <p>Oftentimes it hath brought victory to catch the foe asleep, and to   slaughter, sword in hand, an unarmed host. Thus did the fierce battalions of   Thracian Rhesus fall and you, ye captured steeds, forsook your lord. So, too,   a lover oft is able to profit by the husband's slumbers and to turn his arms   against the sleeping foe. To elude the vigilance of watchmen and sentinels is   ever the perilous task alike of the soldier and the lover.</p>   
 <p>Mars is uncertain and in Venus there is nothing sure. The conquered rise   up again, and those you would deem could never be o’erthrown, fall in   their turn. No longer</p>

 <p>then let love be held a little thing. Love demandeth a resourceful mind.   Achilles burns for Briseis torn from his embraces. Trojans, while his grief   allows, smite ye the Grecian host. Fresh from Andromache's embraces, Hector   went forth to battle. ’Twas his spouse who placed his helmet on his   head. When he beheld the daughter of Priam, her tresses floating in the wind,   the son of Atreus, the first of all the Grecian chiefs, stood, they say, lost   in admiration. Mars himself was caught in the chains which Vulcan had forged.   No tale made a greater stir in heaven than this. I myself was slothful and   not born for work. My bed and sleep had softened my spirit. But love for a   comely young woman set a term to my indolence. She enjoined me to make my   first campaign in her service. Since then, thou seest. me ever active and   always busy with some nocturnal adventure. Thou wouldst not be a sluggard? Well   then, love a woman.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
