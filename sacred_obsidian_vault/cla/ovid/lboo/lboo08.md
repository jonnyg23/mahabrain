 <p>WHO is it that can tell me why my bed seems so is hard and why the   bedclothes will not stay upon it? Wherefore has this night--and oh, how long   it was!--dragged on, bringing no sleep to my eyes? Why are my weary limbs   visited with restlessness and pain? If it were Love that had come to make me   suffer, surely I should know it. Or stay, what if he slips in like a thief,   what if he comes, without a word of warning, to wound me with his cruel arts?   Yes, ’tis he! His slender arrows have pierced my heart, and fell Love   holds it like a conquered land. Shall I yield me to him? Or shall I strive   against him, and so add fuel to this sudden flame? Well, I will yield;   burdens willingly borne do lighter weigh. I know that the flames will leap   from the shaken torch and die away in the one you leave alone. The young oxen   which rebel against the yoke are more often beaten than those which willingly   submit. And if a horse be fiery, harsh is the bit that tames him. When he   takes to -the fray with a will, he feels the curb less galling. And so it is   with Love; for hearts that struggle and rebel against him, he is more   implacable and stern than for such as willingly confess his sway.</p>

 <p>conqueror. What is the use of fighting? Pardon and peace is what I ask.   And little, I trow, would it redound to your glory, armed as you are, to   strike down a defenceless man. Crown thy brows with myrtle and thy mother's   doves yoke to thy car. Thy step-father will give thee the chariot that befits   thee, and upon that chariot, amid the acclamations of the throng, thou shalt   stand a conqueror, guiding with skill thy harnessed birds. Captives in thy   train, youths and maidens shall follow, and splendid shall be thy triumph.   And I, thy latest victim, shall be there with my fresh wound, and with   submissive mien I will bear my new-wrought fetters. Prudence shall be led   captive with hands bound behind her back, and Modesty, and whatsoever else is   an obstacle to Love. All things shall be in awe of thee, and stretching forth   their arms towards thee the throng with mighty voice shall thunder "Io   Triumphe!" Caresses shall be thy escort, and Illusion and Madness, a   troop that ever follows in thy train. With these fighting on thy side, nor   men nor gods shall stand against thee; but if their aid be lacking, naked   shalt thou be. Proud to behold thy triumph, thy mother will applaud thee from   High Olympus and scatter roses on thy upturned face. Thy wings and thy locks   shall be adorned with precious stones, and all with gold resplendent shalt   thou drive thy golden car. Then too, if I know thee well, thou wilt set   countless other hearts on fire, and many a wound shalt deal as thou passest on   thy way. Repose, even when thou art fain to rest, cometh not to thine arrows.   Thy ardent flame turns water itself to vapour. Such was Bacchus when he   triumphed over the land of the Ganges. Thou art drawn along by doves; his car   was drawn by tigers. Since, then, I am to have a part in thy godlike triumph,   lose not the rights which thy victory gives thee over me. Bethink thee of the   victories of thy kinsman Cæsar; he shields the conquered with the very   hand that conquers them.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
