 </p><h3 align="CENTER"><i>XIII. Theoretical writings on Architecture.</i></h3>
 <p>
 Leonardo's original writings on the theory of Architecture have come
 down to us only in a fragmentary state; still, there seems to be no
 doubt that he himself did not complete them. It would seem that
 Leonardo entertained the idea of writing a large and connected book
 on Architecture; and it is quite evident that the materials we
 possess, which can be proved to have been written at different
 periods, were noted down with a more or less definite aim and
 purpose. They might all be collected under the one title: "Studies
 on the Strength of Materials". Among them the investigations on the
 subject of fissures in walls are particularly thorough, and very
 fully reported; these passages are also especially interesting,
 because Leonardo was certainly the first writer on architecture who
 ever treated the subject at all. Here, as in all other cases
 Leonardo carefully avoids all abstract argument. His data are not
 derived from the principles of algebra, but from the laws of
 mechanics, and his method throughout is strictly experimental.
 </p><p>
 Though the conclusions drawn from his investigations may not have
 that precision which we are accustomed to find in Leonardo's
 scientific labours, their interest is not lessened. They prove at
 any rate his deep sagacity and wonderfully clear mind. No one
 perhaps, who has studied these questions since Leonardo, has
 combined with a scientific mind anything like the artistic delicacy
 of perception which gives interest and lucidity to his observations.
 </p><p>
 I do not assert that the arrangement here adopted for the passages
 in question is that originally intended by Leonardo; but their
 distribution into five groups was suggested by the titles, or
 headings, which Leonardo himself prefixed to most of these notes.
 Some of the longer sections perhaps should not, to be in strict
 agreement with this division,
 </p><p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>
 <p><i>have been reproduced in their entirety
 in the place where they occur. But the comparatively small amount of
 the materials we possess will render them, even so, sufficiently
 intelligible to the reader; it did not therefore seem necessary or
 desirable to subdivide the passages merely for the sake of strict
 classification.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The small number of chapters given under the fifth class, treating
 on the centre of gravity in roof-beams, bears no proportion to the
 number of drawings and studies which refer to the same subject. Only
 a small selection of these are reproduced in this work since the
 majority have no explanatory text.</i>
