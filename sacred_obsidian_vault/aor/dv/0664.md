 <p><a name="fn_302"></a><a href="0664.htm#fr_302">345:300</a> : These eleven lines of text are by the side of the pen and
 ink drawing of a man hanged--<a href="pl062.htm#img_pl062">Pl. LXII</a>, No. 1. This drawing was
 exhibited in 1879 at the <i>Ecole des Beaux-Arts</i> in Paris and the
 compilers of the catalogue amused themselves by giving the victim's
 name as follows: "<i>Un pendu, vetu d'une longue robe, les mains liées
 sur le dos ... Bernardo di Bendino Barontigni, marchand de
 pantalons</i>" (see <i>Catalogue descriptif des Dessins de Mailres
 anciens exposes a l'Ecole des Beaux Arts</i>, Paris 1879; No. 83, pp.
 9-10). Now, the criminal represented here, is none other than
 Bernardino di Bandino Baroncelli the murderer of Giuliano de'Medici,
 whose name as a coadjutor in the conspiracy of the Pazzi has gained
 a melancholy notoriety by the tragedy of the 26th April 1478.
 Bernardo was descended from an ancient family and the son of the man
 who, under King Ferrante, was President of the High Court of Justice
 in Naples. His ruined fortunes, it would seem, induced him to join
 the Pazzi; he and Francesco Pazzi were entrusted with the task of
 murdering Giuliano de'Medici on the fixed day. Their victim not
 appearing in the cathedral at the hour when they expected him, the
 two conspirators ran to the palace of the Medici and induced him to
 accompany them. Giuliano then took his place in the chancel of the
 Cathedral, and as the officiating priest raised the Host--the sign
 agreed upon--Bernardo stabbed the unsuspecting Giuliano in the
 breast with a short sword; Giuliano stepped backwards and fell dead.
 The attempt on Lorenzo's life however, by the other conspirators at
 the same moment, failed of success. Bernardo no sooner saw that
 Lorenzo tried to make his escape towards the sacristy, than he
 rushed upon him, and struck down Francesco Nori who endeavoured to
 protect Lorenzo. How Lorenzo then took refuge behind the brazen
 doors of the sacristy, and how, as soon as Giuliano's death was made
 known, the further plans of the conspirators were defeated, while a
 terrible vengeance overtook all the perpetrators and accomplices,
 this is no place to tell. Bernardo Bandini alone seemed to be
 favoured by fortune; he hid first in the tower of the Cathedral, and
 then escaped undiscovered from Florence. Poliziano, who was with
 Lorenzo in the Cathedral, says in his 'Conjurationis Pactianae
 Commentarium': "<i>Bandinus fugitans in Tiphernatem incidit, a quo in
 aciem receptus Senas pervenit</i>." And Gino Capponi in summing up the
 reports of the numerous contemporary narrators of the event, says:
 "<i>Bernardo Bandini ricoverato in Costantinopoli, fu per ordine del
 Sultano preso e consegnato a un Antonio di Bernardino dei Medici,
 che Lorenzo aveva mandato apposta in Turchia: così era grande la
 potenza di quest' uomo e grande la voglia di farne mostra e che non
 restasse in vita chi aveagli ucciso il fratello, fu egli applicato
 appena giunto</i>" (<i>Storia della Republica di Firenze II</i>, 377, 378).
 Details about the dates may be found in the <i>Chronichetta di
 Belfredello Strinati Alfieri</i>: "<i>Bernardo di Bandino Bandini
 sopradetto ne venne preso da Gostantinopoti a dì 14. Dicembre 1479 e
 disaminato, che fu al Bargello, fu impiccato alle finestre di detto
 Bargello allato alla Doana a dì 29. Dicembre MCCCCLXXIX che pochi dì
 stette</i>." It may however be mentioned with reference to the mode of
 writing the name of the assassin that, though most of his
 contemporaries wrote Bernardo Bandini, in the <i>Breve Chronicon
 Caroli Petri de Joanninis</i> he is called Bernardo di Bandini
 Baroncelli; and, in the <i>Sententiae Domini Matthaei de Toscana</i>,
 Bernardus Joannis Bandini de Baroncellis, as is written on
 Leonardo's drawing of him when hanged. Now VASARI, in the life of
 <i>Andrea del Castagno</i> (Vol. II, 680; ed. Milanesi 1878), tells us
 that in 1478 this painter was commissioned by order of the Signoria
 to represent the members of the Pazzi conspiracy as traitors, on the
 facade of the Palazzo del Podestà--the Bargello. This statement is
 obviously founded on a mistake, for Andrea del Castagno was already
 dead in 1457. He had however been commissioned to paint Rinaldo
 degli Albizzi, when declared a rebel and exiled in 1434, and his
 adherents, as hanging head downwards; and in consequence he had
 acquired the nickname of Andrea degl' Impiccati. On the 21st July
 1478 the Council of Eight came to the following resolution: "<i>item
 servatis etc. deliberaverunt et santiaverunt Sandro Botticelli pro
 ejus labore in pingendo proditores flor. quadraginta largos</i>" (see
 G. MILANESI, <i>Arch. star. VI</i> (1862) p. 5 note.)
 </p><p>
 As has been told, Giuliano de' Medici was murdered on the 26th April
 1478, and we see by this that only three months later Botticelli was
 paid for his painting of the "<i>proditores</i>". We can however hardly
 suppose that all the members of the conspiracy were depicted by him
 in fresco on the facade of the palace, since no fewer than eighty
 had been condemned to death. We have no means of knowing whether,
 besides Botticelli, any other painters, perhaps Leonardo, was
 commissioned, when the criminals had been hanged in person out of
 the windows of the Palazzo del Podestà to represent them there
 afterwards in effigy in memory of their disgrace. Nor do we know
 whether the assassin who had escaped may at first not have been
 provisionally represented as hanged in effigy. Now, when we try to
 connect the historical facts with this drawing by Leonardo
 reproduced on <a href="pl062.htm#img_pl062">Pl. LXII</a>, No. I, and the full description of the
 conspirator's dress and its colour on the same sheet, there seems to
 be no reasonable doubt that Bernardo Bandini is here represented as
 he was actually hanged on December 29th, 1479, after his capture at
 Constantinople. The dress is certainly not that in which he
 committed the murder. A long furred coat might very well be worn at
 Constantinople or at Florence in December, but hardly in April. The
 doubt remains whether Leonardo described Bernardo's dress so fully
 because it struck him as remarkable, or whether we may not rather
 suppose that this sketch was actually made from nature with the
 intention of using it as a study for a wall painting to be executed.
 It cannot be denied that the drawing has all the appearance of
 having been made for this purpose. Be this as it may, the sketch
 under discussion proves, at any rate, that Leonardo was in Florence
 in December 1479, and the note that accompanies it is valuable as
 adding one more characteristic specimen to the very small number of
 his MSS. that can be proved to have been written between 1470 and
 1480.</p>
