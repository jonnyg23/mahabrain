 </p><h3 align="CENTER"><i>Introductory Observations on the Architectural Designs (XII), and Writings on Architecture (XIII).</i></h3>
 <p>
 <i>Until now very little has been known regarding Leonardo's labours
 in the domain of Architecture. No building is known to have been
 planned and executed by him, though by some contemporary writers
 incidental allusion is made to his occupying himself with
 architecture, and his famous letter to Lodovico il Moro,--which has
 long been a well-known document,--in which he offers his service as
 an architect to that prince, tends to confirm the belief that he was
 something more than an amateur of the art. This hypothesis has
 lately been confirmed by the publication of certain documents,
 preserved at Milan, showing that Leonardo was not only employed in
 preparing plans but that he took an active part, with much credit,
 as member of a commission on public buildings; his name remains
 linked with the history of the building of the Cathedral at Pavia
 and that of the Cathedral at Milan.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo's writings on Architecture are dispersed among a large
 number of MSS., and it would be scarcely possible to master their
 contents without the opportunity of arranging, sorting and comparing
 the whole mass of materials, so as to have some comprehensive idea
 of the whole. The sketches, when isolated and considered by
 themselves, might appear to be of but little value; it is not till
 we understand their general purport, from comparing them with each
 other, that we can form any just estimate of their true worth.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo seems to have had a project for writing a complete and
 separate treatise on Architecture, such as his predecessors and
 contemporaries had composed--Leon Battista Alberti, Filarete,
 Francesco di Giorgio and perhaps also Bramante. But, on the other
 hand, it cannot be denied that possibly no such scheme was connected
 with the isolated notes and researches, treating on special
 questions, which are given in this work; that he was merely working
 at problems in which, for some reason or other he took a special
 interest.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>A great number of important buildings were constructed in Lombardy
 during the period between </i>1472<i> and </i>1499<i>, and among them there are
 several by unknown architects,</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>
 <p><i>of so high an artistic merit, that it
 is certainly not improbable that either Bramante or Leonardo da
 Vinci may have been, directly or indirectly, concerned in their
 erection.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Having been engaged, for now nearly twenty years, in a thorough
 study of Bramante's life and labours, I have taken a particular
 interest in detecting the distinguishing marks of his style as
 compared with Leonardo's. In 1869 I made researches about the
 architectural drawings of the latter in the Codex Atlanticus at
 Milan, for the purpose of finding out, if possible the original
 plans and sketches of the churches of Santa Maria delle Grazie at
 Milan, and of the Cathedral at Pavia, which buildings have been
 supposed to be the work both of Bramante and of Leonardo. Since </i>1876<i>
 I have repeatedly examined Leonardo's architectural studies in the
 collection of his manuscripts in the Institut de France, and some of
 these I have already given to the public in my work on</i> "Les Projets
 Primitifs pour la Basilique de St. Pierre de Rome", <i>Pl. </i>43<i>. In </i>1879<i>
 I had the opportunity of examining the manuscript in the Palazzo
 Trivulzio at Milan, and in 1880 Dr Richter showed me in London the
 manuscripts in the possession of Lord Ashburnham, and those in the
 British Museum. I have thus had opportunities of seeing most of
 Leonardo's architectural drawings in the original, but of the
 manuscripts tliemselves I have deciphered only the notes which
 accompany the sketches. It is to Dr Richter's exertions that we owe
 the collected texts on Architecture which are now published, and
 while he has undertaken to be responsible for the correct reading of
 the original texts, he has also made it his task to extract the
 whole of the materials from the various MSS. It has been my task to
 arrange and elucidate the texts under the heads which have been
 adopted in this work. MS. B. at Paris and the Codex Atlanticus at
 Milan are the chief sources of our knowledge of Leonardo as an
 architect, and I have recently subjected these to a thorough
 re-investigation expressly with a view to this work.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>A complete reproduction of all Leonardo's architectural sketches
 has not, indeed, been possible, but as far as the necessarily
 restricted limits of the work have allowed, the utmost completeness
 has been aimed at, and no efforts have been spared to include every
 thing that can contribute to a knowledge of Leonardo's style. It
 would have been very interesting, if it had been possible, to give
 some general account at least of Leonardo's work and studies in
 engineering, fortification, canal-making and the like, and it is
 only on mature reflection that we have reluctantly abandoned this
 idea. Leonardo's occupations in these departments have by no means
 so close a relation to literary work, in the strict sense of the
 word as we are fairly justified in attributing to his numerous notes
 on Architecture.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo's architectural studies fall naturally under two heads:</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>I. Those drawings and sketches, often accompanied by short remarks
 and explanations, which may be regarded as designs for buildings or
 monuments intended to be built. With these there are occasionally
 explanatory texts.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>II. Theoretical investigations and treatises. A special interest
 attaches to these because they discuss a variety of questions which
 are of practical importance to this day. Leonardo's theory as to the
 origin and progress of cracks in buildings is perhaps to be
 considered as unique in its way in the literature of Architecture.</i>
