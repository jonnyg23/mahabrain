 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Draft of letter to be sent to Piacenza (1346. 1347).</font></span>Magnificent Commissioners of Buildings I, understanding that your
 Magnificencies have made up your minds to make certain great works
 in bronze, will remind you of certain things: first that you should
 not be so hasty or so quick to give the commission, lest by this
 haste it should become impossible to select a good model and a good
 master; and some man of small merit may be chosen, who by his
 insufficiency may cause you to

 <p>be abused by your descendants, judging that this age
 was but ill supplied with men of good counsel and with good masters;
 seeing that other cities, and chiefly the city of the Florentines,
 has been as it were in these very days, endowed with beautiful and
 grand works in bronze; among which are the doors of their
 Baptistery. And this town of Florence, like Piacenza, is a place of
 intercourse, through which many foreigners pass; who, seeing that
 the works are fine and of good quality, carry away a good
 impression, and will say that that city is well filled with worthy
 inhabitants, seeing the works which bear witness to their opinion;
 and on the other hand, I say seeing so much metal expended and so
 badly wrought, it were less shame to the city if the doors had been
 of plain wood; because, the material, costing so little, would not
 seem to merit any great outlay of skill...
 </p><p>
 Now the principal parts which are sought for in cities are their
 cathedrals, and of these the first things which strike the eye are
 the doors, by which one passes into these churches.
 </p><p>
 Beware, gentlemen of the Commission, lest too great speed in your
 determination, and so much haste to expedite the entrusting of so
 great a work as that which I hear you have ordered, be the cause
 that that which was intended for the honour of God and of men should
 be turned to great dishonour of your judgments, and of your city,
 which, being a place of mark, is the resort and gathering-place of
 innumerable foreigners. And this dishonour would result if by your
 lack of diligence you were to put your trust in some vaunter, who by
 his tricks or by favour shown to him here should obtain such work
 from you, by which lasting and very great shame would result to him
 and to you. Thus I cannot help being angry when I consider what men
 those are who have conferred with you as wishing to undertake this
 great work without thinking of their sufficiency for it, not to say
 more. This one is a potter, that one a maker of cuirasses, this one
 is a
 </p><p><a name="page_402"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 402</font></a></p>
 <p>bell-founder, another a bell ringer, and one is even a
 bombardier; and among them one in his Lordship's service, who
 boasted that he was the gossip of Messer Ambrosio Ferrere  <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">681</font></a>
 , who has some power
 and who has made him some promises; and if this were not enough he
 would mount on horseback, and go to his Lord and obtain such letters
 that you could never refuse [to give] him the work. But consider
 where masters of real talent and fit for such work are brought when
 they have to compete with such men as these. Open your eyes and look
 carefully lest your money should be spent in buying your own
 disgrace. I can declare to you that from that place you will procure
 none but average works of inferior and coarse masters. There is no
 capable man,--[33] and you may believe me,--except Leonardo the
 Florentine, who is making the equestrian statue in bronze of the
 Duke Francesco and who has no need to bring himself into notice,
 because he has work for all his life time; and I doubt, whether
 being so great a work, he will ever finish it [34].

 The miserable painstakers ... with what hope may they expect a
 reward of their merit?

 spoken of in this letter, is no doubt Lodovico il Moro. One may
 infer from the concluding sentence (No. 1346, l. 33. 34 and No.
 1347), that Leonardo, who no doubt compiled this letter, did not
 forward it to Piacenza himself, but gave it to some influential
 patron, under whose name and signature a copy of it was sent to the
 Commission.</p>

 Duke. Piacenza at that time belonged to Milan.</p>
