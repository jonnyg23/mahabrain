 The razor having one day come forth from the handle which serves as
 its sheath and having placed himself in the sun, saw the sun
 reflected in his body, which filled him with great pride. And
 turning it over in his thoughts he began to say to himself: "And
 shall I return again to that shop from which I have just come?
 Certainly not; such splendid beauty shall not, please God, be turned
 to such base uses. What folly it would be that could lead me to
 shave the lathered beards of rustic peasants and perform such menial
 service! Is this body destined for such work? Certainly not. I will
 hide myself in some retired spot and
 </p><p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a></p>
 <p>there pass my life in tranquil
 repose." And having thus remained hidden for some months, one day he
 came out into the air, and issuing from his sheath, saw himself
 turned to the similitude of a rusty saw while his surface no longer
 reflected the resplendent sun. With useless repentance he vainly
 deplored the irreparable mischief saying to himself: "Oh! how far
 better was it to employ at the barbers my lost edge of such
 exquisite keenness! Where is that lustrous surface? It has been
 consumed by this vexatious and unsightly rust."
 </p><p>
 The same thing happens to those minds which instead of exercise give
 themselves up to sloth. They are like the razor here spoken of, and
 lose the keenness of their edge, while the rust of ignorance spoils
 their form.

 A stone of some size recently uncovered by the water lay on a
 certain spot somewhat raised, and just where a delightful grove
 ended by a stony road; here it was surrounded by plants decorated by
 various flowers of divers colours. And as it saw the great quantity
 of stones collected together in the roadway below, it began to wish
 it could let itself fall down there, saying to itself: "What have I
 to do here with these plants? I want to live in the company of
 those, my sisters." And letting itself fall, its rapid course ended
 among these longed for companions. When it had been there sometime
 it began to find itself constantly toiling under the wheels of the
 carts the iron-shoed feet of horses and of travellers. This one
 rolled it over, that one trod upon it; sometimes it lifted itself a
 little and then it was covered with mud or the dung of some animal,
 and it was in vain that it looked at the spot whence it had come as
 a place of solitude and tranquil place.
 </p><p>
 Thus it happens to those who choose to leave a life of solitary
 comtemplation, and come to live in cities among people full of
 infinite evil.
