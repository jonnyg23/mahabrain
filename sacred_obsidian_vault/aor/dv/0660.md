 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the history of painting (660. 661).</font></span>Hence the painter will produce pictures of small merit if he takes
 for his standard the pictures of others. But if he will study from
 natural objects he will bear good fruit; as was seen in the painters

 <p>these came Giotto the
 Florentine who--not content with imitating the works of Cimabue his
 master--being born in the mountains and in a solitude inhabited only
 by goats and such beasts, and being guided by nature to his art,
 began by drawing on the rocks the movements of the goats of which he
 was keeper. And thus he began to draw all the animals which were to
 be found in the country, and in such wise that after much study he
 excelled not only all the masters of his time but all those of many
 bygone ages. Afterwards this art declined again, because everyone
 imitated the pictures that were already done; thus it went on from
 century to century until Tomaso, of Florence, nicknamed Masaccio,
 showed by his perfect works how those who take for their standard
 any one but nature--the mistress of all masters--weary themselves in
 vain. And, I would say about these mathematical studies that those
 who only study the authorities and not the works of nature are
 descendants but not sons of nature the mistress of all good authors.
 Oh! how great is the folly of those who blame those who learn from

 ,
 setting aside those authorities who themselves were the disciples of
 nature.

 observation we may detect an indirect evidence that Leonardo
 regarded his knowledge of natural history as derived from his own
 investigations, as well as his theories of perspective and optics.
