 <i>An artist's manuscript notes can hardly be expected to contain any
 thing more than incidental references to those masterpieces of his
 work of which the fame, sounded in the writings of his
 contemporaries, has left a glorious echo to posterity. We need not
 therefore be surprised to find that the texts here reproduced do not
 afford us such comprehensive information as we could wish. On the
 other hand, the sketches and studies prepared by Leonardo for the
 two grandest compositions he ever executed: The Fresco of the Last
 Supper in the Refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie at Milan, and
 the Cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari, for the Palazzo della
 Signoria at Florence--have been preserved; and, though far from
 complete, are so much more numerous than the manuscript notes, that
 we are justified in asserting that in value and interest they amply
 compensate for the meagerness of the written suggestions.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The notes for the composition of the Last Supper, which are given
 under nos.</i> 665 <i>and</i> 666 <i>occur in a MS. at South Kensington, II2,
 written in the years</i> 1494-1495. <i>This MS. sketch was noted down not
 more than three or four years before the painting was executed,
 which justifies the inference that at the time when it was written
 the painter had not made up his mind definitely even as to the
 general scheme of the work; and from this we may also conclude that
 the drawings of apostles' heads at Windsor, in red chalk, must be
 ascribed to a later date. They are studies for the head of St.
 Matthew, the fourth figure on Christ's left hand--see <a href="pl047.htm#img_pl047">Pl. XLVII</a>,
 the sketch (in black chalk) for the head of St. Philip, the third
 figure on the left hand--see <a href="pl048.htm#img_pl048">Pl. XLVIII</a>, for St. Peter's right
 arm--see <a href="pl049.htm#img_pl049">Pl. XLIX</a>, and for the expressive head of Judas which has
 unfortunately somewhat suffered by subsequent restoration of
 outlines,--see <a href="pl050.htm#img_pl050">Pl. L</a>. According to a tradition, as unfounded as it
 is improbable, Leonardo made use of the head of Padre Bandelli, the
 prior of the convent, as the prototype of his Judas; this however
 has already been contradicted by Amoretti "Memorie storiche" cap.
 XIV. The study of the head of a criminal on <a href="pl051.htm#img_pl051">Pl. LI</a> has, it seems to
 me, a better claim to be regarded as one of the preparatory sketches
 for the head of Judas. The</i>

 <p><i>Windsor collection contains two old
 copies of the head of St. Simon, the figure to the extreme left of
 Christ, both of about equal merit (they are marked as Nos.</i> 21 <i>and</i>
 36<i>)--the second was reproduced on <a href="pl008.htm#img_pl008">Pl. VIII</a> of the Grosvenor
 Gallery Publication in</i> 1878. <i>There is also at Windsor a drawing in
 black chalk of folded hands (marked with the old No.</i> 212; <i>No. LXI
 of the Grosvenor Gallery Publication) which I believe to be a copy
 of the hands of St. John, by some unknown pupil. A reproduction of
 the excellent drawings of heads of Apostles in the possession of H.
 R. H. the Grand Duchess of Weimar would have been out of my province
 in this work, and, with regard to them, I must confine myself to
 pointing out that the difference in style does not allow of our
 placing the Weimar drawings in the same category as those here
 reproduced. The mode of grouping in the Weimar drawings is of itself
 sufficient to indicate that they were not executed before the
 picture was painted, but, on the contrary, afterwards, and it is, on
 the face of it, incredible that so great a master should thus have
 copied from his own work.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The drawing of Christ's head, in the Brera palace at Milan was
 perhaps originally the work of Leonardo's hand; it has unfortunately
 been entirely retouched and re-drawn, so that no decisive opinion
 can be formed as to its genuineness.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The red chalk drawing reproduced on <a href="pl046.htm#img_pl046">Pl. XLVI</a> is in the Accademia at
 Venice; it was probably made before the text, Nos.</i> 664 <i>and</i> 665,
 <i>was written.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The two pen and ink sketches on <a href="pl045.htm#img_pl045">Pl. XLV</a> seem to belong to an even
 earlier date; the more finished drawing of the two, on the right
 hand, represents Christ with only St. John and Judas and a third
 disciple whose action is precisely that described in No.</i> 666,
 <i>Pl.</i> 4. <i>It is hardly necessary to observe that the other sketches
 on this page and the lines of text below the circle (containing the
 solution of a geometrical problem) have no reference to the picture
 of the Last Supper. With this figure of Christ may be compared a
 similar pen and ink drawing reproduced on page</i> 297 <i>below on the
 left hand; the original is in the Louvre. On this page again the
 rest of the sketches have no direct bearing on the composition of
 the Last Supper, not even, as it seems to me, the group of four men
 at the bottom to the right hand--who are listening to a fifth, in
 their midst addressing them. Moreover the writing on this page (an
 explanation of a disk shaped instrument) is certainly not in the
 same style as we find constantly used by Leonardo after the year</i> 1489.
 </p><p>
 <i>It may be incidentally remarked that no sketches are known for the
 portrait of "Mona Lisa", nor do the MS. notes ever allude to it,
 though according to Vasari the master had it in hand for fully four
 years.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo's cartoon for the picture of the battle of Anghiari has
 shared the fate of the rival work, Michaelangelo's "Bathers summoned
 to Battle". Both have been lost in some wholly inexplicable manner.
 I cannot here enter into the remarkable history of this work; I can
 only give an account of what has been preserved to us of Leonardo's
 scheme and preparations for executing it. The extent of the material
 in studies and drawings was till now quite unknown. Their
 publication here may give some adequate idea of the grandeur of this
 famous work. The text given as No.</i> 669 <i>contains a description of
 the particulars of the battle, but for the reasons given in the note
 to this text, I must abandon the idea of taking this passage as the
 basis of my attempt to reconstruct the picture as the artist
 conceived and executed it.</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>I may here remind the reader that Leonardo prepared the cartoon in
 the Sala del Papa of Santa Maria Novella at Florence and worked
 there from the end of October 1503 till February 1504, and then was
 busied with the painting in the Sala del Consiglio in the Palazzo
 della Signoria, till the work was interrupted at the end of May
 1506. (See Milanesi's note to Vasari pp. 43--45 Vol. IV ed. 1880.)
 Vasari, as is well known, describes only one scene or episode of the
 cartoon--the Battle for the Standard in the foreground of the
 composition, as it would seem; and this only was ever finished as a
 mural decoration in the Sala del Consiglio. This portion of the
 composition is familiar to all from the disfigured copy engraved by
 Edelinck. Mariette had already very acutely observed that Edelinck
 must surely have worked from a Flemish copy of the picture. There is
 in the Louvre a drawing by Rubens (No. 565) which also represents
 four horsemen fighting round a standard and which agrees with
 Edelinck's engraving, but the engraving reverses the drawing. An
 earlier Flemish drawing, such as may have served as the model for
 both Rubens and Edelinck, is in the Uffizi collection (see
 Philpots's Photograph, No. 732). It seems to be a work of the second
 half of the XVIth century, a time when both the picture and the
 cartoon had already been destroyed. It is apparently the production
 of a not very skilled hand. Raphael Trichet du Fresne, 1651,
 mentions that a small picture by Leonardo himself of the Battle of
 the Standard was then extant in the Tuileries; by this he probably
 means the painting on panel which is now in the possession of Madame
 Timbal in Paris, and which has lately been engraved by Haussoullier
 as a work by Leonardo. The picture, which is very carefully painted,
 seems to me however to be the work of some unknown Florentine
 painter, and probably executed within the first ten years of the
 XVIth century. At the same time, it would seem to be a copy not from
 Leonardo's cartoon, but from his picture in the Palazzo della
 Signoria; at any rate this little picture, and the small Flemish
 drawing in Florence are the oldest finished copies of this episode
 in the great composition of the Battle of Anghiari.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>In his Life of Raphael, Vasari tells us that Raphael copied certain
 works of Leonardo's during his stay in Florence. Raphael's first
 visit to Florence lasted from the middle of October 1504 till July
 1505, and he revisited it in the summer of 1506. The hasty sketch,
 now in the possession of the University of Oxford and reproduced on
 page 337 also represents the Battle of the Standard and seems to
 have been made during his first stay, and therefore not from the
 fresco but from the cartoon; for, on the same sheet we also find,
 besides an old man's head drawn in Leonardo's style, some studies
 for the figure of St. John the Martyr which Raphael used in 1505 in
 his great fresco in the Church of San Severo at Perugia.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Of Leonardo's studies for the Battle of Anghiari I must in the first
 place point to five, on three of which--<a href="pl052.htm#img_pl052">Pl. LII</a> 2, <a href="pl053.htm#img_pl053">Pl. LIII</a>, <a href="pl056.htm#img_pl056">Pl. LVI</a>--we find studies for the episode of the Standard. The standard
 bearer, who, in the above named copies is seen stooping, holding on
 to the staff across his shoulder, is immediately recognisable as the
 left-hand figure in Raphael's sketch, and we find it in a similar
 attitude in Leonardo's pen and ink drawing in the British
 Museum--<a href="pl052.htm#img_pl052">Pl. LII</a>, 2--the lower figure to the right. It is not
 difficult to identify the same figure in two more complicated groups
 in the pen and ink drawings, now in the Accademia at Venice--<a href="pl053.htm#img_pl053">Pl. LIII</a>, and <a href="pl054.htm#img_pl054">Pl. LIV</a>--where we also find some studies of foot soldiers
 fighting. On the sheet in the British Museum--<a href="pl052.htm#img_pl052">Pl. LII</a>, 2--we find,
 among others, one group of three horses galloping forwards: one</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 337</font></a></p>
 <p><i>horseman is thrown and protects himself with his buckler against the
 lance thrusts of two others on horseback, who try to pierce him as
 they ride past. The same action is repeated, with some variation, in
 two sketches in pen and ink on a third sheet, in the Accademia at
 Venice, <a href="pl055.htm#img_pl055">Pl. LV</a>; a coincidence which suggests the probability of such
 an incident having actually been represented on the cartoon. We are
 not, it is true, in a position to declare with any certainty which
 of these three dissimilar sketches may have been the nearest to the
 group finally adopted in executing the cartoon.</i>

 <p>
 <i>With regard, however, to one of the groups of horsemen it is
 possible to determine with perfect certainty not only which
 arrangement was preferred, but the position it occupied in the
 composition. The group of horsemen on <a href="pl057.htm#img_pl057">Pl. LVII</a> is a drawing in black
 chalk at Windsor, which is there attributed to Leonardo, but which
 appears to me to be the work of Cesare da Sesto, and the
 Commendatore Giov. Morelli supports me in this view. It can hardly
 be doubted that da Sesto, as a pupil of Leonardo's, made this
 drawing from his master's cartoon, if we compare it with the copy
 made by Raphael--here reproduced,</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a></p>
 <p><i>for just above the fighting
 horseman in Raphael's copy it is possible to detect a horse which is
 seen from behind, going at a slower pace, with his tail flying out
 to the right and the same horse may be seen in the very same
 attitude carrying a dimly sketched rider, in the foreground of
 Cesare da Sesto's drawing.</i>

 <p>
 <i>If a very much rubbed drawing in black chalk at Windsor--<a href="pl056.htm#img_pl056">Pl. LVI</a>--is, as it appears to be, the reversed impression of an original
 drawing, it is not difficult to supplement from it the portions
 drawn by Cesare da Sesto. Nay, it may prove possible to reconstruct
 the whole of the lost cartoon from the mass of materials we now have
 at hand which we may regard as the nucleus of the composition. A
 large pen and ink</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a></p>
 <p><i>drawing by Raphael in the Dresden collection,
 representing three horsemen fighting, and another, by Cesare da
 Sesto, in the Uffizi, of light horsemen fighting are a further
 contribution which will help us to reconstruct it.</i>

 <p>
 <i>The sketch reproduced on <a href="pl055.htm#img_pl055">Pl. LV</a> gives a suggestive example of the
 way in which</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 340</font></a></p>
 <p><i>foot-soldiers may have been introduced into the cartoon
 as fighting among the groups of horsemen; and I may here take the
 opportunity of mentioning that, for reasons which it would be out of
 place to enlarge upon here, I believe the two genuine drawings by
 Raphael's hand in his "Venetian sketch-book" as it is called--one of
 a standard bearer marching towards the left, and one of two
 foot-soldiers armed with spears and fighting with a horseman--to be
 undoubtedly copies from the cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo's two drawings, preserved in the museum at Buda-Pesth and
 reproduced on pages 338 and 339 are preliminary studies for the
 heads of fighting warriors. The two heads drawn in black chalk (pg.
 338) and the one seen in profile, turned to the left, drawn in red
 chalk (pg. 339), correspond exactly with those of two horsemen in
 the scene of the fight round the standard as we see them in Madame
 Timbal's picture and in the other finished copies. An old copy of
 the last named drawing by a pupil of Leonardo is in MS. C. A. 187b;
 561b (See Saggio, Tav. XXII). Leonardo used to make such finished
 studies of heads as those, drawn on detached sheets, before
 beginning his pictures from his drawings--compare the preparatory
 studies for the fresco of the Last Supper, given on <a href="pl047.htm#img_pl047">Pl. XLVII</a> and
 <a href="pl050.htm#img_pl050">Pl. L</a>. Other drawings of heads, all characterised by the expression
 of vehement excitement that is appropriate to men fighting, are to
 be seen at Windsor (No. 44) and at the Accademia at Venice (IV, 13);
 at the back of one of the drawings at Buda-Pesth there is the bust
 of a warrior carrying a spear on his left shoulder, holding up the
 left arm (See Csatakepek a XVI--lk Szazadbol osszeallitotta Pvlszky
 Karoly). These drawings may have been made for other portions of the
 cartoon, of which no copies exist, and thus we are unable to
 identify these preparatory drawings. Finally I may add that a sketch
 of fighting horse and foot soldiers, formerly in the possession of
 M. Thiers and published by Charles Blanc in his "Vies des Peintres"
 can hardly be accepted as genuine. It is not to be found, as I am
 informed, among the late President's property, and no one appears to
 know where it now is.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>An attempted reconstruction of the Cartoon, which is not only
 unsuccessful but perfectly unfounded, is to be seen in the
 lithograph by Bergeret, published in Charles Blanc's "Vies des
 peintres" and reprinted in "The great Artists. L. da Vinci", p. 80.
 This misleading pasticcio may now be rejected without hesitation.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>There are yet a few original drawings by Leonardo which might be
 mentioned here as possibly belonging to the cartoon of the Battle;
 such as the pen and ink sketches on <a href="pl021.htm#img_pl021">Pl. XXI</a> and on <a href="pl038.htm#img_pl038">Pl. XXXVIII</a>, No.
 3, but we should risk too wide a departure from the domain of
 ascertained fact.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>With regard to the colours and other materials used by Leonardo the
 reader may be referred to the quotations from the accounts for the
 picture in question given by Milanesi in his edition of Vasari (Vol.
 IV, p. 44, note) where we find entries of a similar character to
 those in Leonardo's note books for the year 1505; S. K. M. 12 (see
 No. 636).</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>That Leonardo was employed in designing decorations and other
 preparations for high festivals, particularly for the court of
 Milan, we learn not only from the writings of his contemporaries but
 from his own incidental allusions; for instance in MS. C. l5b (1),
 l. 9. In the arrangement of the texts referring to this I have
 placed those first, in which historical personages are named--Nos.
 670-674. Among the descriptions of Allegorical subjects two texts
 lately found at Oxford have been included, Nos. 676 and 677. They
 are particularly interesting because they are accompanied by large
 sketches which render the meaning of the texts perfectly clear. It
 is very intelligible that in other cases, where</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a></p>
 <p><i>there are no
 illustrative sketches, the notes must necessarily remain obscure or
 admit of various interpretations. The literature of the time affords
 ample evidence of the use of such allegorical representations,
 particularly during the Carnival and in Leonardo's notes we find the
 Carnival expressly mentioned--Nos. 685 and 704. Vasari in his Life
 of Pontormo, particularly describes that artist's various
 undertakings for Carnival festivities. These very graphic
 descriptions appear to me to throw great light in more ways than one
 on the meaning of Leonardo's various notes as to allegorical
 representations and also on mottoes and emblems--Nos. 681-702. In
 passing judgment on the allegorical sketches and emblems it must not
 be overlooked that even as pictures they were always accompanied by
 explanations in words. Several finished drawings of allegorical
 compositions or figures have been preserved, but as they have no
 corresponding explanation in the MSS. they had no claim to be
 reproduced here. The female figure on <a href="pl026.htm#img_pl026">Pl. XXVI</a> may perhaps be
 regarded as a study for such an allegorical painting, of which the
 purport would have been explained by an inscription.</i>
