 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF JUDGING YOUR OWN PICTURES.</h3>
 <p>
 We know very well that errors are better recognised in the works of
 others than in our own; and that often, while reproving little
 faults in others, you may ignore great ones in yourself. To avoid
 such ignorance, in the first place make yourself a master of
 perspective, then acquire perfect knowledge of the proportions of
 men and other animals, and also, study good architecture, that is so
 far as concerns the forms of buildings and other objects which are
 on the face of the earth; these forms are infinite, and the better
 you know them the more admirable will your work be. And in cases
 where you lack experience do not shrink from drawing them from
 nature. But, to carry out my promise above [in the title]--I say
 that when you paint you should have a flat mirror and often look at
 your work as reflected in it, when you will see it reversed, and it
 will appear to you like some other painter's work, so you will be
 better able to judge of its faults than in any other way. Again, it
 is well that you should often leave off work and take a little
 relaxation, because, when you come back to it you are a better
 judge; for sitting too close at work may greatly deceive you. Again,
 it is good to retire to a distance because the work looks smaller
 and your eye takes in more of it at a glance and sees more easily
 the discords or disproportion in the limbs and colours of the
 objects.
