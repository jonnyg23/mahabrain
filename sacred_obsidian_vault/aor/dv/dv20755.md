 <i>The incidental memoranda scattered here and there throughout the
 MSS. can have been for the most part intelligible to the writer
 only; in many cases their meaning and connection are all the more
 obscure because we are in ignorance about the persons with whom
 Leonardo used to converse nor can we say what part he may have
 played in the various events of his time. Vasari and other early
 biographers give us a very superficial and far from accurate picture
 of Leonardo's private life. Though his own memoranda, referring for
 the most part to incidents of no permanent interest, do not go far
 towards supplying this deficiency, they are nevertheless of some
 importance and interest as helping us to solve the numerous
 mysteries in which the history of Leonardo's long life remains
 involved. We may at any rate assume, from Leonardo's having
 committed to paper notes on more or less trivial matters on his
 pupils, on his house-keeping, on various known and unknown
 personages, and a hundred other trifies--that at the time they must
 have been in some way important to him.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>I have endeavoured to make these 'Miscellaneous Notes' as complete
 as possible, for in many cases an incidental memorandum will help to
 explain the meaning of some other note of a similar kind. The first
 portion of these notes (Nos. l379--l457), as well as those referring
 to his pupils and to other artists and artificers who lived in his
 house (1458--1468,) are arranged in chronological order. A
 considerable proportion of these notes belong to the period between
 1490 and 1500, when Leonardo was living at Milan under the patronage
 of Lodovico il Moro, a time concerning which we have otherwise only
 very scanty information. If Leonardo did really--as has always been
 supposed,--spend also the greater part of the preceding decade in
 Milan, it seems hardly likely that we should not find a single note
 indicative of the fact, or referring to any event of that period, on
 the numerous loose leaves in his writing that exist. Leonardo's life
 in Milan between 1489 and 1500 must have been comparatively
 uneventful. The MSS. and memoranda of those years seem to prove that
 it was a tranquil period of intellectual and artistic labour rather
 than of bustling court life. Whatever may</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_420"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 420</font></a></p>
 <p><i>have been the fate of the
 MSS. and note books of the foregoing years--whether they were
 destroyed by Leonardo himself or have been lost--it is certainly
 strange that nothing whatever exists to inform us as to his life and
 doings in Milan earlier than the consecutive series of manuscripts
 which begin in the year 1489.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>There is nothing surprising in the fact that the notes regarding
 his pupils are few and meagre. Excepting for the record of money
 transactions only very exceptional circumstances would have prompted
 him to make any written observations on the persons with whom he was
 in daily intercourse, among whom, of course, were his pupils. Of
 them all none is so frequently mentioned as Salai, but the character
 of the notes does not--as it seems to me--justify us in supposing
 that he was any thing more than a sort of factotum of Leonardo's
 (see 1519, note).</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo's quotations from books and his lists of titles supply
 nothing more than a hint as to his occasional literary studies or
 recreations. It was evidently no part of his ambition to be deeply
 read (see Nrs. 10, 11, 1159) and he more than once expressly states
 (in various passages which will be found in the foregoing sections)
 that he did not recognise the authority of the Ancients, on
 scientific questions, which in his day was held paramount.
 Archimedes is the sole exception, and Leonardo frankly owns his
 admiration for the illustrious Greek to whose genius his own was so
 much akin (see No. 1476). All his notes on various authors,
 excepting those which have already been inserted in the previous
 section, have been arranged alphabetically for the sake of
 convenience (1469--1508).</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The passages next in order contain accounts and inventories
 principally of household property. The publication of these--often
 very trivial entries--is only justifiable as proving that the
 wealth, the splendid mode of life and lavish expenditure which have
 been attributed to Leonardo are altogether mythical; unless we put
 forward the very improbable hypothesis that these notes as to money
 in hand, outlay and receipts, refer throughout to an exceptional
 state of his affairs, viz. when he was short of money.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The memoranda collected at the end (No. 1505--1565) are, in the
 original, in the usual writing, from left to right. Besides, the
 style of the handwriting is at variance with what we should expect
 it to be, if really Leonardo himself had written these notes. Most
 of them are to be found in juxtaposition with undoubtedly authentic
 writing of his. But this may be easily explained, if we take into
 account the fact, that Leonardo frequently wrote on loose sheets. He
 may therefore have occasionally used paper on which others had made
 short memoranda, for the most part as it would seem, for his use. At
 the end of all I have given Leonardo's will from the copy of it
 preserved in the Melzi Library. It has already been printed by
 Amoretti and by Uzielli. It is not known what has become of the
 original document.</i>
