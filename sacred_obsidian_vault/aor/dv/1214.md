 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF SPIRITS.</h3>
 <p>
 We have said, on the other side of this page, that the definition of
 a spirit is a power conjoined to a body; because it cannot
 </p><p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a></p>
 <p>move of
 its own accord, nor can it have any kind of motion in space; and if
 you were to say that it moves itself, this cannot be within the
 elements. For, if the spirit is an incorporeal quantity, this
 quantity is called a vacuum, and a vacuum does not exist in nature;
 and granting that one were formed, it would be immediately filled up
 by the rushing in of the element in which the vacuum had been
 generated. Therefore, from the definition of weight, which is
 this--Gravity is an accidental power, created by one element being
 drawn to or suspended in another--it follows that an element, not
 weighing anything compared with itself, has weight in the element
 above it and lighter than it; as we see that the parts of water have
 no gravity or levity compared with other water, but if you draw it
 up into the air, then it would acquire weight, and if you were to
 draw the air beneath the water then the water which remains above
 this air would acquire weight, which weight could not sustain itself
 by itself, whence collapse is inevitable. And this happens in water;
 wherever the vacuum may be in this water it will fall in; and this
 would happen with a spirit amid the elements, where it would
 continuously generate a vacuum in whatever element it might find
 itself, whence it would be inevitable that it should be constantly
 flying towards the sky until it had quitted these elements.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">AS TO WHETHER A SPIRIT HAS A BODY AMID THE ELEMENTS.</h3>
 <p>
 We have proved that a spirit cannot exist of itself amid the
 elements without a body, nor can it move of itself by voluntary
 motion unless it be to rise upwards. But now we will say how such a
 spirit taking an aerial body would be inevitably melt into air;
 because if it remained united, it would be separated and fall to
 form a vacuum, as is said above; therefore it is inevitable, if it
 is to be able to remain suspended in the air, that it should absorb
 a certain quantity of air; and if it were mingled with the air, two
 difficulties arise; that is to say: It must rarefy that portion of
 the air with which it mingles; and for this cause the rarefied air
 must fly up of itself and will not
 </p><p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 307</font></a></p>
 <p>remain among the air that is
 heavier than itself; and besides this the subtle spiritual essence
 disunites itself, and its nature is modified, by which that nature
 loses some of its first virtue. Added to these there is a third
 difficulty, and this is that such a body formed of air assumed by
 the spirits is exposed to the penetrating winds, which are
 incessantly sundering and dispersing the united portions of the air,
 revolving and whirling amidst the rest of the atmosphere; therefore
 the spirit which is infused in this
