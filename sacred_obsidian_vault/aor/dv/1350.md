 Magnificent President:--Having ofttimes remembered the proposals
 made many times to me by your Excellency, I take the liberty of
 writing to remind your Lordship of the promise made to me at my last
 departure, that is the possession of the twelve inches of water
 granted to me by the most Christian King. Your Lordship knows that I
 did not enter into possession, because at that time when it was
 given to me there was a dearth of water in the canal, as well by
 reason of the great drought as also because the outlets were not
 regulated; but your Excellency promised me that as soon as this was
 done, I should have my rights. Afterwards hearing that the canal was
 complete I wrote several times to your Lordship and to Messer
 Girolamo da Cusano,who has in his keeping the deed of this gift; and
 so also I wrote to Corigero and never had a reply. I now send
 thither Salai, my pupil, the bearer of this, to whom your Lordship
 may tell by word of mouth all that happened in the matter about
 which I petition your Excellency. I expect to go thither this Easter
 since I am nearly at the end of my lawsuit, and I will take with me
 two pictures of our Lady which I have begun, and at the present time
 have brought them on to a very good end; nothing else occurs to me.
 </p><p>
 My Lord the love which your Excellency has always shown me and the
 benefits that I have constantly received from you I have hitherto...
 </p><p>
 I am fearful lest the small return I have made for the great
 benefits I have received from your Excellency may not have made you
 somewhat annoyed with me. And this is why, to many letters which I
 have written to your Excellency I have never had an answer. I now
 send to you Salai to explain to your Excellency that I am almost at
 the end of my litigation with my brothers, and that I hope to be
 with you this Easter and carry with me two pictures on which are two
 Madonnas of different sizes which I began for the most Christian
 King, or for whomsoever you please. I should be very glad to
 </p><p><a name="page_406"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 406</font></a></p>
 <p>know where, on my return from this place, I shall have to reside, because
 I do not wish to give more trouble to your Lordship; and then,
 having worked for the most Christian King, whether my salary is to
 be continued or not. I write to the President as to the water that
 the king granted me of which I had not been put in possession by
 reason of the dearth in the canal, caused by the great drought and
 because its outlets were not regulated; but he promised me certainly
 that as soon as the regulation was made, I should be put in
 possession of it; I therefore pray you that, if you should meet the
 said President, you would be good enough, now that the outlets are
 regulated, to remind the said President to cause me to be put in
 possession of that water, since I understand it is in great measure
 in his power. Nothing else occurs to me; always yours to command.
 </p><p>
 Good day to you Messer Francesco. Why, in God's name, of all the
 letters I have written to you, have you never answered one. Now wait
 till I come, by God, and I shall make you write so much that perhaps
 you will become sick of it.
 </p><p>
 Dear Messer Francesco. I am sending thither Salai to learn from His
 Magnificence the President to what end the regulation of the water
 has come since, at my departure this regulation of the outlets of
 the canal had been ordered, because His Magnificence the President
 promised me that as soon as this was done I should be satisfied. It
 is now some time since I heard that the canal was in order, as also
 its outlets, and I immediately wrote to the President and to you,
 and then I repeated it, and never had an answer. So you will have
 the goodness to answer me as to that which happened, and as I am not
 to hurry the matter, would you take the trouble, for the love of me,
 to urge the President a little, and also Messer Girolamo Cusano, to
 whom you will commend me and offer my duty to his Magnificence.

 youth therefore of about 17 in 1510. Leonardo addresses his young
 friend as "Messer", as being the son of a noble house. Melzi
 practised art under Leonardo as a dilettante and not as a pupil,
 like Cesare da Sesto and others (See LERMOLIEFF, <i>Die Galerien</i> &amp;c,
 p. 476).</p>
