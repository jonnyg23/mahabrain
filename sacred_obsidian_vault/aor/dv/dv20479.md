 <i>Vasari indulges in severe strictures on Leonardo's religious views.
 He speaks, among other things, of his</i> "capricci nel filosofar delle
 cose naturali" <i>and says on this point:</i> "Per il che fece nell'animo
 un concetto si eretico che e' non si accostava a qualsi voglia
 religione, stimando per avventura assai piu lo esser filosofo che
 cristiano" <i>(see the first edition of</i> 'Le Vite'<i>). But this
 accusation on the part of a writer in the days of the Inquisition is
 not a very serious one--and the less so, since, throughout the
 manuscripts, we find nothing to support it.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Under the heading of "Philosophical Maxims" I have collected all
 the passages which can give us a clear comprehension of Leonardo's
 ideas of the world at large. It is scarcely necessary to observe
 that there is absolutely nothing in them to lead to the inference
 that he was an atheist. His views of nature and its laws are no
 doubt very unlike those of his contemporaries, and have a much
 closer affinity to those which find general acceptance at the
 present day. On the other hand, it is obvious from Leonardo's will
 (see No.</i> 1566<i>) that, in the year before his death, he had
 professed to adhere to the fundamental doctrines of the Roman
 Catholic faith, and this evidently from his own personal desire and
 impulse.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The incredible and demonstrably fictitious legend of Leonardo's
 death in the arms of Francis the First, is given, with others, by
 Vasari and further embellished by this odious comment:</i> "Mostrava
 tuttavia quanto avea offeso Dio e gli uomini del mondo, non avendo
 operato nell'arte come si conveniva." <i>This last accusation, it may
 be remarked, is above all evidence of the superficial character of
 the information which Vasari was in a position to give about
 Leonardo. It seems to imply that Leonardo was disdainful of diligent
 labour. With regard to the second, referring to Leonardo's morality
 and dealings with his fellow men, Vasari himself nullifies it by
 asserting the very contrary in several passages. A further
 refutation may be found in the following sentence</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a></p>
 <p><i>from the letter in
 which Melsi, the young Milanese nobleman, announces the Master's
 death to Leonardo's brothers:</i> Credo siate certificati della morte
 di Maestro Lionardo fratello vostro, e mio quanto optimo padre, per
 la cui morte sarebbe impossibile che io potesse esprimere il dolore
 che io ho preso; e in mentre che queste mia membra si sosterranno
 insieme, io possedero una perpetua infelicita, e meritamente perche
 sviscerato et ardentissimo amore mi portava giornalmente. E dolto ad
 ognuno la perdita di tal uomo, quale non e piu in podesta della
 natura, ecc.
 </p><p>
 <i>It is true that, in April</i> 1476, <i>we find the names of Leonardo and
 Verrocchio entered in the</i> "Libro degli Uffiziali di notte e de'
 Monasteri" <i>as breaking the laws; but we immediately after find the
 note</i> "Absoluti cum condizione ut retamburentur" (Tamburini <i>was the
 name given to the warrant cases of the night police). The acquittal
 therefore did not exclude the possibility of a repetition of the
 charge. It was in fact repeated, two months later, and on this
 occasion the Master and his pupil were again fully acquitted.
 Verrocchio was at this time forty and Leonardo four-and-twenty. The
 documents referring to this affair are in the State Archives of
 Florence; they have been withheld from publication, but it seemed to
 me desirable to give the reader this brief account of the leading
 facts of the story, as the vague hints of it, which have recently
 been made public, may have given to the incident an aspect which it
 had not in reality, and which it does not deserve.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The passages here classed under the head "Morals" reveal Leonardo
 to us as a man whose life and conduct were unfailingly governed by
 lofty principles and aims. He could scarcely have recorded his stern
 reprobation and unmeasured contempt for men who do nothing useful
 and strive only for riches, if his own life and ambitions had been
 such as they have so often been misrepresented.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>At a period like that, when superstition still exercised unlimited
 dominion over the minds not merely of the illiterate crowd, but of
 the cultivated and learned classes, it was very natural that
 Leonardo's views as to Alchemy, Ghosts, Magicians, and the like
 should be met with stern reprobation whenever and wherever he may
 have expressed them; this accounts for the argumentative tone of all
 his utterances on such subjects which I have collected in
 Subdivision III of this section. To these I have added some passages
 which throw light on Leonardo's personal views on the Universe. They
 are, without exception, characterised by a broad spirit of
 naturalism of which the principles are more strictly applied in his
 essays on Astronomy, and still more on Physical Geography.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>To avoid repetition, only such notes on Philosophy, Morals and
 Polemics, have been included in this section as occur as independent
 texts in the original MSS. Several moral reflections have already
 been given in Vol. I, in section "Allegorical representations,
 Mottoes and Emblems". Others will be found in the following section.
 Nos.</i> 9 <i>to</i> 12, <i>Vol. I, are also passages of an argumentative
 character. It did not seem requisite to repeat here these and
 similar passages, since their direct connection with the context is
 far closer in places where they have appeared already, than it would
 be here.</i>
