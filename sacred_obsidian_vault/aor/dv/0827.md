 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Comparative study of the organs of sense in men and animals.</font></span>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared
 with the bodies of animals the organs of sense are duller and
 coarser. Thus it is composed of less ingenious instruments, and of
 spaces less capacious for receiving the faculties of sense. I have
 seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with
 part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils,
 which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which
 enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several
 passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.
 <p>
 The eyes in the Lion tribe have a large part of the head for their
 sockets and the optic nerves communicate at once with the brain; but
 the contrary is to be seen in man, for the sockets of the eyes are
 but a small part of the head, and the optic nerves are very fine and
 long and weak, and by the weakness of their action we see by day but
 badly at night, while these animals can see as well at night as by
 day. The proof that they can see is that they prowl for prey at
 night and sleep by day, as nocturnal birds do also.
