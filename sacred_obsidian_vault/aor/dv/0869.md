 diminished as in natural perspective, which
 diminishes them by reason of the convexity of the eye which
 necessarily intersects, at its surface, the pyramid of every image
 conveyed to the eye at a right angle on its spherical surface. But
 by the method I here teach in the margin [9] these pyramids are
 intersected at right angles close to the surface of the pupil. The
 convex pupil of the eye can take in the whole of our hemisphere,
 while this will show only a single star; but where many small stars
 transmit their images to the surface of the pupil those stars are
 extremely small; here only one star is seen but it will be large.
 And so the moon will be seen larger and its spots of a more defined
 form  <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">446</font></a>
 . You must place close to the
 eye a glass filled with the water of which mention is made in number
 4 of Book 113 "On natural substances"  <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">447</font></a>
 ; for this water makes objects which are enclosed
 in balls of crystalline glass appear free from the glass.

 Among the smaller objects presented to the pupil of the eye, that
 which is closest to it, will be least appreciable to the eye. And at
 the same time, the experiments here made with the power of sight,
 show that it is not reduced to speck if the &amp;c [32] <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">448</font></a>

 [34]Those objects are seen largest which come to the eye at the
 largest angles.
 </p><p>
 But the images of the objects conveyed to the pupil of the eye are
 distributed to the pupil exactly as they are distributed in the air:
 and the proof of this is in what follows; that when we look at the
 starry sky, without gazing more fixedly at one star than another,
 the sky appears all strewn with stars; and their proportions to the
 eye are the same as in the sky and likewise the spaces between them
 [61].
