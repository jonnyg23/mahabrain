 <i>Just as Michaelangelo's occasional poems reflect his private life
 as well as the general disposition of his mind, we may find in the
 writings collected in this section, the transcript of Leonardo's
 fanciful nature, and we should probably not be far wrong in
 assuming, that he himself had recited these fables in the company of
 his friends or at the court festivals of princes and patrons.</i> Era
 tanto piacevole nella conversazione-- <i>so relates Vasari</i>--che
 tirava a se gli animi delle genti. <i>And Paulus Jovius says in his
 short biography of the artist:</i> Fuit ingenio valde comi, nitido,
 liberali, vultu autem longe venustissimo, et cum elegantiae omnis
 deliciarumque maxime theatralium mirificus inventor ac arbiter
 esset, ad lyramque scito caneret, cunctis per omnem aetatem
 principibus mire placuit. <i>There can be no doubt that the fables are
 the original offspring of Leonardo's brain, and not borrowed from
 any foreign source; indeed the schemes and plans for the composition
 of fables collected in division V seem to afford an external proof
 of this, if the fables themselves did not render it self-evident.
 Several of them-- for instance No.</i> l279--<i>are so strikingly
 characteristic of Leonardo's views of natural science that we cannot
 do them justice till we are acquainted with his theories on such
 subjects; and this is equally true of the 'Prophecies'</i>.
 </p><p>
 <i>I have prefixed to these quaint writings the 'Studies on the life
 and habits of animals' which are singular from their peculiar
 aphoristic style, and I have transcribed them in exactly the order
 in which they are written in MS. H. This is one of the very rare
 instances in which one subject is treated in a consecutive series of
 notes, all in one MS., and Leonardo has also departed from his
 ordinary habits, by occasionally not completing the text on the page
 it is begun. These brief notes of a somewhat mysterious bearing have
 been placed here, simply because they may possibly have been
 intended to serve as hints for fables or allegories. They can
 scarcely be regarded as preparatory for a natural history, rather
 they would seem to be extracts. On the one hand the names</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 314</font></a></p>
 <p><i>of some of
 the animals seem to prove that Leonardo could not here be recording
 observations of his own; on the other hand the notes on their habits
 and life appear to me to dwell precisely on what must have
 interested him most--so far as it is possible to form any complete
 estimate of his nature and tastes.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>In No.</i> 1293 <i>lines</i> 1-10, <i>we have a sketch of a scheme for
 grouping the Prophecies. I have not however availed myself of it as
 a clue to their arrangement here because, in the first place, the
 texts are not so numerous as to render the suggested classification
 useful to the reader, and, also, because in reading the long series,
 as they occur in the original, we may follow the author's mind; and
 here and there it is not difficult to see how one theme suggested
 another. I have however regarded Leonardo's scheme for the
 classification of the Prophecies as available for that of the Fables
 and Jests, and have adhered to it as far as possible.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Among the humourous writings I might perhaps have included the</i>
 'Rebusses', <i>of which there are several in the collection of
 Leonardo's drawings at Windsor; it seems to me not likely that many
 or all of them could be solved at the present day and the MSS. throw
 no light on them. Nor should I be justified if I intended to include
 in the literary works the well-known caricatures of human faces
 attributed to Leonardo-- of which, however, it may be incidentally
 observed, the greater number are in my opinion undoubtedly spurious.
 Two only have necessarily been given owing to their presence in
 text, which it was desired to reproduce: Vol. I page</i> 326, <i>and <a href="pl122.htm#img_pl122">Pl. CXXII</a>.
 It can scarcely be doubted that some satirical intention is
 conveyed by the drawing on <a href="dv20959.htm#img_pl064">Pl. LXIV</a> (text No. </i>688<i>).
 </i></p><p>
 My reason for not presenting Leonardo to the reader as a poet is the
 fact that the maxims and morals in verse which have been ascribed to
 him, are not to be found in the manuscripts, and Prof. Uzielli has
 already proved that they cannot be by him. Hence it would seem that
 only a few short verses can be attributed to him with any
 certainty.
