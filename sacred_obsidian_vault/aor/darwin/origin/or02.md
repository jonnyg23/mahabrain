 <h3>Chapter II:  Variation Under Nature</h3>
  <p>BEFORE applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to
 organic beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether
 these latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject
 properly, a long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given; but these
 shall reserve for a future work. Nor shall I here discuss the
 various definitions which have been given of the term species. No
 one definition has satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist
 knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the
 term includes the unknown element of a distant act of creation. The
 term "variety" is almost equally difficult to define; but here
 community of descent is almost universally implied, though it can
 rarely be proved. We have also what are called monstrosities; but they
 graduate into varieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some
 considerable deviation of structure, generally injurious, or not
 useful to the species. Some authors use the term "variation" in a
 technical sense, as implying a modification directly due to the
 physical conditions of life; and "variations" in this sense are
 supposed not to be inherited; but who can say that the dwarfed
 condition of shells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or dwarfed
 plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from far
 northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least a few
 generations? And in this case I presume that the form would be
 called a variety.
   </p><p>It may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of
 structure such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions,
 more especially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a
 state of nature. Almost every part of every organic being is so
 beautifully related to its complex conditions of life that it seems as
 improbable that any part should have been suddenly produced perfect,
 as that a complex machine should have been invented by man in a
 perfect state. Under domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which
 resemble normal structures in widely different animals. Thus pigs have
 occasionally been born with a sort of proboscis, and if any wild
 species of the same genus had naturally possessed a proboscis, it
 might have been argued that this had appeared as a monstrosity; but
 I have as yet failed to find, after diligent search, cases of
 monstrosities resembling normal structures in nearly allied forms, and
 these alone bear on the question. If monstrous forms of this kind ever
 do appear in a state of nature and are capable of reproduction
 (which is not always the case), as they occur rarely and singularly,
 their preservation would depend on unusually favourable circumstances.
 They would, also, during the first and succeeding generations cross
 with the ordinary form, and thus their abnormal character would almost
 inevitably be lost. But I shall have to return in a future chapter
 to the preservation and perpetuation of single or occasional
 variations.
 
 </p><h4>Individual Differences</h4>
 
   <p>The many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the
 same parents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, from being
 observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same
 confined locality, may be called individual differences. No one
 supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in
 the same actual mould. These individual differences are of the highest
 importance for us, for they are often inherited, as must be familiar
 to every one; and they thus afford materials for natural selection
 to act on and accumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates in any
 given direction individual differences in his domesticated
 productions. These individual differences generally affect what
 naturalists consider unimportant parts; but I could show by a long
 catalogue of facts, that parts which must be called important, whether
 viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view,
 sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species. I am
 convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at
 the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of
 structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have
 collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that
 systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in
 important characters, and that there are not many men who will
 laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in
 many specimens of the same species. It would never have been
 expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great
 central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same
 species; it might have been thought that changes of this nature
 could have been effected only by slow degrees; yet Sir J. Lubbock
 has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus,
 which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of a stem of a
 tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also shown that
 the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are far from uniform.
 Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important
 organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank those parts
 as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which
 do not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance will ever be
 found of an important part varying; but under any other point of
 view many instances assuredly can be given.
   </p><p>There is one point connected with individual differences, which is
 extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been called
 "protean" or "Polymorphic," in which the species present an inordinate
 amount of variation. With respect to many of these forms, hardly two
 naturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties.
 We may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium amongst plants, several
 genera of and of brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some of
 the species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which are
 polymorphic in one country seem to be, with a few exceptions,
 polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from
 brachiopod shells, at former periods of time. These facts are very
 perplexing, for they seem to show that this kind of variability is
 independent of the conditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that
 we see, at least in some of these polymorphic genera, variations which
 are of no service or disservice to the species, and which consequently
 have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as
 hereafter to be explained.
   </p><p>Individuals of the same species often present, as is known to
 every one, great differences of structure, independently of variation,
 as in the two sexes of various animals, in the two or three castes
 of sterile females or workers amongst insects, and in the immature and
 larval states of many of the lower animals. There are, also, cases
 of dimorphism and trimorphism, both with animals and plants. Thus, Mr.
 Wallace, who has lately called attention to the subject, has shown
 that the females of certain species of butterflies, in the Malayan
 archipelago, regularly appear under two or even three conspicuously
 distinct forms, not connected by intermediate varieties. Fritz
 Muller has described analogous but more extraordinary cases with the
 males of certain Brazilian crustaceans: thus, the male of the Tanais
 regularly occurs under two distinct forms; one of these has strong and
 differently shaped pincers, and the other has antennae much more
 abundantly furnished with smelling-hairs. Although in most of these
 cases, the two or three forms, both with animals and plants are not
 now connected by intermediate gradations, it is probable that they
 were once thus connected. Mr. Wallace, for instance, describes a
 certain butterfly which presents in the same island a great range of
 varieties connected by intermediate links, and the extreme links of
 the chain closely resemble the two forms of an allied dimorphic
 species inhabiting another part of the Malay Archipelago. Thus also
 with ants, the several worker castes are generally quite distinct; but
 in some cases, as we shall hereafter see, the castes are connected
 together by finely graduated varieties. So it is, as I myself
 observed, with some dimorphic plants. It certainly at first appears
 a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly should have
 the power of producing at the same time three distinct female forms
 and a male; and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce from the
 same seed-capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing three
 different kinds of females and three or even six different kinds of
 males. Nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of the common
 fact that the female produces offspring of two sexes which sometimes
 differ from each other in a wonderful manner.
 
 </p><h4>Doubtful Species</h4>
 
   <p>The forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of
 species, but which are go closely similar to other forms, or are so
 closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do
 not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the
 most important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of
 these doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained
 their characters for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as
 have good and true species. Practically, when a naturalist can unite
 by means of intermediate links any two forms, he treats the one as a
 variety of the other; ranking the most common, but sometimes the one
 first described, as the species, and the other as the variety. But
 cases of great difficulty, which I will not here enumerate,
 sometimes arise in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a
 variety of another, even when they are closely connected by
 intermediate links; nor will the commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the
 intermediate forms always remove the difficulty. In very many cases,
 however, one form is ranked as a variety of another, not because the
 intermediate links have actually been found, but because analogy leads
 the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or
 may formerly have existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt
 and conjecture is opened.
   </p><p>Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species
 or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and
 wide experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in
 many cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked
 and well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as
 species by at least some competent judges.
   </p><p>That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon
 cannot be disputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of
 France, or of the United States, drawn up by different botanists,
 and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one
 botanist as good species, and by another as mere varieties. Mr. H.
 C. Watson, to whom I lie under deep obligation for assistance of all
 kinds, has marked for me 182 British plants, which are generally
 considered as varieties, but which have all been ranked by botanists
 as species; and, in making this list, he has omitted many trifling
 varieties, which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as
 species, and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic
 genera. Under genera, including the most polymorphic forms, Mr.
 Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr. Bentham gives only 112,- a
 difference of 139 doubtful forms! Amongst animals which unite for each
 birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by
 one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can rarely
 be found within the same country, but are common in separated areas.
 How many of the birds and insects in North America and Europe, which
 differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one
 eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as
 varieties, or, as they are often called, geographical races! Mr.
 Wallace, in several valuable papers on the various animals, especially
 on the Lepidoptera, inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan
 archipelago, shows that they may be classed under four heads,
 namely, as variable forms, as local forms, as geographical races or
 sub-species, and as true representative species. The first or variable
 forms vary much within the limits of the same island. The local
 forms are moderately constant and distinct in each separate island;
 but when all from the several islands are compared together, the
 differences are seen to be so slight and graduated, that it is
 impossible to define or describe them, though at the same time the
 extreme forms are sufficiently distinct. The geographical races or
 sub-species are local forms completely fixed and isolated; but as they
 do not differ from each other by strongly marked and important
 characters, "there is no possible test but individual opinion to
 determine which of them shall be considered as species and which as
 varieties." Lastly, representative species fill the same place in
 the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and
 sub-species; but as they are distinguished from each other by a
 greater amount of difference than that between the local forms and
 sub-species, they are almost universally ranked by naturalists as true
 species. Nevertheless, no certain criterion can possibly be given by
 which variable forms, local forms, sub-species, and representative
 species can be recognised.
   </p><p>Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds
 from the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos Archipelago,
 one with another, and with those from the American mainland, I was
 much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction
 between species and varieties. On the islets of the little Madeira
 group there are many insects which are characterised as varieties in
 Mr. Wollaston's admirable work, but which would certainly be ranked as
 distinct species by many entomologists. Even Ireland has a few
 animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but which have been
 ranked as species by some zoologists. Several experienced
 ornithologists consider our British red grouse as only a
 strongly-marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas the greater
 number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great Britain. A
 wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many
 naturalists to rank them as distinct species; but what distance, it
 has been well asked, will suffice; if that between America and
 Europe is ample, will that between Europe and the Azores, or
 Madeira, or the Canaries, or between the several islets of these small
 archipelagos, be sufficient?
   </p><p>Mr. B. D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United
 States, has described what he calls phytophagic varieties and
 phytophagic species. Most vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind
 of plant or on one group of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many
 kinds, but do not in consequence vary. In several cases, however,
 insects found living on different plants, have been observed by Mr.
 Walsh to present in their larval or mature state, or in both states,
 slight, though constant differences in colour, size, or in the
 nature of their secretions. In some instances the males alone, in
 other instances both males and females, have been observed thus to
 differ in a slight degree. When the differences are rather more
 strongly marked, and when both sexes and all ages are affected, the
 forms are ranked by all entomologists as good species. But no observer
 can determine for another, even if he can do so for himself, which
 of these phytophagic forms ought to be called species and which
 varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be supposed would
 freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear to have lost
 this power, as species. As the differences depend on the insects
 having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that
 intermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found.
 The naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to
 rank doubtful forms as varieties or species. This likewise necessarily
 occurs with closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct
 continents or islands. When, on the other hand, an animal or plant
 ranges over the same continent, or inhabits many islands in the same
 archipelago, and presents different forms in the different areas,
 there is always a good chance that intermediate forms will be
 discovered which will link together the extreme states, and these
 are then degraded to the rank of varieties.
   </p><p>Some few naturalists maintain that animals never present
 varieties; but then these same naturalists rank the slightest
 difference as of specific value; and when the same identical form is
 met with in two distant countries, or in two geological formations,
 they believe that two distinct species are hidden under the same
 dress. The term species thus comes to be a mere useless abstraction,
 implying and assuming a separate act of creation. It is certain that
 many forms, considered by highly-competent judges to be varieties,
 resemble species so completely in character, that they have been
 thus ranked by other highly-competent judges. But to discuss whether
 they ought to be called species or varieties, before any definition of
 these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air.
   </p><p>Many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species
 well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument,
 from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism,
 &amp;c., have been brought to bear in the attempt to determine their rank;
 but space does not here permit me to discuss them. Close
 investigation, in many cases, will no doubt bring naturalists to agree
 how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed that it is in the
 best-known countries that we find the greatest number of them. I
 have been struck with the fact, that if any animal or plant in a state
 of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause closely
 attracts his attention, varieties of it will almost universally be
 found recorded. These varieties, moreover, will often be ranked by
 some authors as species. Look at the common oak, how closely it has
 been studied; yet a German author makes more than a dozen species
 out of forms, which are almost universally considered by other
 botanists to be varieties; and in this country the highest botanical
 authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile
 and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere
 varieties.
   </p><p>I may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A. de
 Candolle, on the oaks of the whole world. No one ever had more ample
 materials for the discrimination of the species, or could have
 worked on them with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in detail
 all the many points of structure which vary in the several species,
 and estimates numerically the relative frequency of the variations. He
 specifies above a dozen characters which may be found varying even
 on the same branch, sometimes according to age or development,
 sometimes without any assignable reason. Such characters are not of
 course of specific value, but they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in
 commenting on this memoir, such as generally enter into specific
 definitions. De Candolle then goes on to say that he gives the rank of
 species to the forms that differ by characters never varying on the
 same tree, and never found connected by intermediate states. After
 this discussion, the result of so much labour, he emphatically
 remarks: "They are mistaken, who repeat that the greater part of our
 species are clearly limited, and that the doubtful species are in a
 feeble minority. This seemed to be true, so long as a genus was
 imperfectly known, and its species were founded upon a few
 specimens, that is to say, were provisional. Just as we come to know
 them better, intermediate forms flow in, and doubts as to specific
 limits augment." He also adds that it is the best known species
 which present the greater number of spontaneous varieties and
 sub-varieties. Thus Quercus robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of
 which, excepting six, are clustered round three sub-species, namely,
 Q. pedunculata, sessiliflora, and pubescens. The forms which connect
 these three sub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again
 remarks, if these connecting forms which are now rare, were to
 become wholly extinct, the three sub-species would hold exactly the
 same relation to each other, as do the four or five provisionally
 admitted species which closely surround the typical Quercus robur.
 Finally, De Candolle admits that out of the 300 species, which will be
 enumerated in his Prodromus as belonging to the oak family, at least
 two-thirds are provisional species, that is, are not known strictly to
 fulfil the definition above given of a true species. It should be
 added that De Candolle no longer believes that species are immutable
 creations, but concludes that the derivative theory is the most
 natural one, "and the most accordant with the known facts in
 palaeontology, geographical botany and zoology, of anatomical
 structure and classification."
   </p><p>When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of
 organisms quite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed in
 determining what differences to consider as specific, and what as
 varietal; for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation
 to which the group is subject; and this shows, at least, how very
 generally there is some variation. But if he confine his attention
 to one class within one country, he will soon make up his mind how
 to rank most of the doubtful forms. His general tendency will be to
 make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the
 pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded to, with the amount of
 difference in the forms which he is continually studying; and he has
 little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and
 in other countries, by which to correct his first impressions. As he
 extends the range of his observations, he will meet with more cases of
 difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of closely-allied
 forms. But if his observations be widely extended, he will in the
 end generally be able to make up his own mind: but he will succeed
 in this at the expense of admitting much variation,- and the truth
 of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists. When he
 comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous,
 in which case he cannot hope to find intermediate links, he will be
 compelled to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his difficulties
 will rise to a climax.
   </p><p>Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between
 species and sub-species- that is, the forms which in the opinion of
 some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the
 rank of species: or, again, between sub-species and well-marked
 varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences.
 These differences blend into each other by an insensible series; and a
 series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage.
   </p><p>Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest
 to the systematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being
 the first steps towards such slight varieties as are barely thought
 worth recording in works on natural history. And I look at varieties
 which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps
 towards more strongly-marked and permanent varieties; and at the
 latter, as leading to sub-species, and then to species. The passage
 from one stage of difference to another may, in many cases, be the
 simple result of the nature of the organism and of the different
 physical conditions to which it has long been exposed; but with
 respect to the more important and adaptive characters, the passage
 from one stage of difference to another may be safely attributed to
 the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter to be explained,
 and to the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts. A
 well-marked variety may therefore be called an incipient species;
 but whether this belief is justifiable must be judged by the weight of
 the various facts and considerations to be given throughout this work.
   </p><p>It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species
 attain the rank of species. They may become extinct, or they may
 endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the
 case by Mr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil
 land-shell in Madeira, and with plants by Gaston de Saporta. If a
 variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent
 species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as the
 variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent
 species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent species.
 But we shall hereafter return to this subject.
   </p><p>From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species
 as one arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a set of
 individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not
 essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less
 distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in
 comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied
 arbitrarily, for convenience' sake.
 
 </p><h4>Wide-ranging, much diffused, and common Species vary most</h4>
 
   <p>Guided by theoretical consideration, I thought that some interesting
 results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the
 species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several
 well-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H.
 C. Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and
 assistance on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many
 difficulties, as did subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger
 terms. I shall reserve for a future work the discussion of these
 difficulties, and the tables of the proportional numbers of the
 varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me to add that after having
 carefully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks
 that the following statements are fairly well established. The whole
 subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity,
 is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the "struggle
 for existence," "divergence of character," and other questions,
 hereafter to be discussed.
   </p><p>Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have
 very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been
 expected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as
 they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is an
 equally or more important circumstance) with different sets of organic
 beings. But my tables further show that, in any limited country, the
 species which are the most common, that is abound most in individuals,
 and the species which are most widely diffused within their own
 country (and this is a different consideration from wide range, and to
 a certain extent from commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties
 sufficiently well marked to have been recorded in botanical works.
 Hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the
 dominant species,- those which range widely, are the most diffused
 in their own country, and are the most numerous in individuals,- which
 oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as I consider them,
 incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have been anticipated; for
 as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent,
 necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the
 country, the species which are already dominant will be the most
 likely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree
 modified, still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to
 become dominant over their compatriots. In these remarks on
 predominance, it should be understood that reference is made only to
 the forms which come into competition with each other, and more
 especially to the members of the same genus or class having nearly
 similar habits of life. With respect to the number of individuals or
 commonness of species, the comparison of course relates only to the
 members of the same group. One of the higher plants may be said to
 be dominant if it be more numerous in individuals and more widely
 diffused than the other plants of the same country, which live under
 nearly the same conditions. A plant of this kind is not the less
 dominant because some conferva inhabiting the water or some
 parasitic fungus is infinitely more numerous in individuals and more
 widely diffused. But if the conferva or parasitic fungus exceeds its
 allies in the above respects, it will then be dominant within its
 own class.
 
 </p><h4>Species of the Larger Genera in each Country vary more frequently
 than the Species of the Smaller Genera.</h4>
 
   <p>If the plants inhabiting a country, as described in any Flora, be
 divided into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera (i.e.,
 those including many species) being placed on one side, and all
 those in the smaller genera on the other side, the former will be
 found to include a somewhat larger number of the very common and
 much diffused or dominant species. This might have been anticipated;
 for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any
 country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic
 conditions of that country favourable to the genus; and, consequently,
 we might have expected to have found in the larger genera or those
 including many species, a larger proportional number of dominant
 species. But so many causes tend to obscure this result, that I am
 surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the
 larger genera. I will here allude to only two causes of obscurity.
 Fresh-water and salt-loving plants generally have very wide ranges and
 are much diffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of
 the stations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the
 size of the genera to which the species belong. Again, plants low in
 the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than
 plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no close
 relation to the size of the genera. The cause of lowly-organised
 plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on Geographical
 Distribution.
   </p><p>From looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined
 varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger
 genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the
 species of the smaller genera; for wherever many closely related
 species (i.e., species of the same genus) have been formed, many
 varieties or incipient species ought, as a general rule, to be now
 forming. Where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings.
 Where many species of a genus have been formed through variation,
 circumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we might
 expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to
 variation. On the other hand, if we look at each species as a
 special act of creation, there is no apparent reason why more
 varieties should occur in a group having many species, than in one
 having few.
   </p><p>To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of
 twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts,
 into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on
 one side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it
 has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the
 species on the side of the larger genera presented varieties, than
 on the side of the smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the
 large genera which present any varieties, invariably present a
 larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small
 genera. Both these results follow when another division is made, and
 when all the least genera, with from only one to four species, are
 altogether excluded from the tables. These facts are of plain
 signification on the view that species are only strongly-marked and
 permanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus
 have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the
 manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find the
 manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason
 to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow
 one. And this certainly holds true, if varieties be looked at as
 incipient species; for my tables clearly show as a general rule
 that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed, the species
 of that genus present a number of varieties, that is of incipient
 species, beyond the average. It is not that all large genera are now
 varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their
 species, or that no small genera are now varying and increasing; for
 if this had been so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch
 as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of
 time often increased greatly in size; and that large genera have often
 come to their maxima, declined, and disappeared. All that we want to
 show is, that when many species of a genus have been formed, on an
 average many are still forming; and this certainly holds good.
 
 </p><h4>Many of the Species included within the Larger Genera resemble
 Varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other,
 and in having restricted ranges</h4>
 
   <p>There are other relations between the species of large genera and
 their recorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there
 is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and
 well-marked varieties; and when intermediate links have not been found
 between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a
 determination by the amount of difference between them, judging by
 analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the
 rank of species. Hence the amount of difference is one very
 important criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked
 as species or varieties. Now Fries has remarked in regard to plants,
 and Westwood in regard to insects, that in large genera the amount
 of difference between the species is often exceedingly small. I have
 endeavoured to test this numerically by averages, and, as far as my
 imperfect results go, they confirm the view. I have also consulted
 some sagacious and experienced observers, and, after deliberation,
 they concur in this view. In this respect, therefore, the species of
 the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species of
 the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in another way, and it
 may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a number of varieties
 or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing,
 many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent
 resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by less than the
 usual amount of difference.
   </p><p>Moreover, the species of the larger genera are related to each
 other, in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are
 related to each other. No naturalist pretends that all the species
 of a genus are equally distinct from each other; they may generally be
 divided into sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has
 well remarked, little groups of species are generally clustered like
 satellites around other species. And what are varieties but groups
 of forms, unequally related to each other, and clustered round certain
 forms- that is, round their parent-species. Undoubtedly there is one
 most important point of difference between varieties and species;
 namely, that the amount of difference between varieties, when compared
 with each other or with their parent-species, is much less than that
 between the species of the same genus. But when we come to discuss the
 principle, as I call it, of Divergence of Character, we shall see
 how this may be explained, and how the lesser differences between
 varieties tend to increase into the greater differences between
 species.
   </p><p>There is one other point which is worth notice. Varieties
 generally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed
 scarcely more than a truism, for, if a variety were found to have a
 wider range than that of its supposed parent-species, their
 denominations would be reversed. But there is reason to believe that
 the species which are very closely allied to other species, and in
 so far resemble varieties, often have much restricted ranges. For
 instance, Mr. H. C. Watson has marked for me in the well-sifted London
 Catalogue of Plants (4th edition) 63 plants which are therein ranked
 as species, but which he considers as so closely allied to other
 species as to be of doubtful value: these 63 reputed species range
 on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which Mr. Watson has
 divided Great Britain. Now, in this same Catalogue, 53 acknowledged
 varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces; whereas,
 the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces.
 So that the acknowledged varieties have nearly the same, restricted
 average range, as have the closely allied forms, marked for me by
 Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally
 ranked by British botanists as good and true species.
 
 </p><h4>Summary</h4>
 
   <p>Finally, varieties cannot be distinguished from species,- except,
 first, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and,
 secondly, by a certain indefinite amount of difference between them;
 for two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as
 varieties, notwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected;
 but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to any two
 forms the rank of species cannot be defined. In genera having more
 than the average number of species in any country, the species of
 these genera have more than the average number of varieties. In
 large genera the species are apt to be closely, but unequally,
 allied together, forming little clusters round other species.
 Species very closely allied to other species apparently have
 restricted ranges. In all these respects the species of large genera
 present a strong analogy with varieties. And we can clearly understand
 these analogies, if species once existed as varieties, and thus
 originated; whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if
 species are independent creations.
   </p><p>We have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant
 species of the larger genera within each class which on an average
 yield the greatest number of varieties; and varieties, as we shall
 hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct species.
 Thus the larger genera tend to become larger; and throughout nature
 the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more
 dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants. But by
 steps hereafter to be explained, the larger genera also tend to
 break up into smaller genera. And thus, the forms of life throughout
 the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups.
