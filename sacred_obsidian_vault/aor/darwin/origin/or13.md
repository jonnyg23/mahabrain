 <h3>Chapter XIII: Geographical Distribution Continued</h3>
 <h4>Fresh-water Productions</h4>
 
   <p>AS LAKES and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers
 of land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would
 not have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is
 apparently a still more formidable barrier, that they would never have
 extended to distant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse.
 Not only have many fresh-water species, belonging to different
 classes, an enormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable
 manner throughout the world. When first collecting in the fresh
 waters of Brazil, I well remember feeling much surprise at the
 similarity of the fresh-water insects, shells &amp;c., and at the
 dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings, compared with
 those of Britain.
   </p><p>But the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I
 think, in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in
 a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from
 pond to pond, or from stream to stream, within their own countries;
 and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as
 an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few
 cases; of these, some of the most difficult to explain are presented
 by fish. It was formerly believed that the same fresh-water species
 never existed on two continents distant from each other. But Dr.
 Gunther has lately shown that the Galaxias attenuatus inhabits
 Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and the mainland of South
 America. This is a wonderful case, and probably indicates dispersal
 from an Antarctic centre during a former warm period. This case,
 however, is rendered in some degree less surprising by the species
 of this genus having the power of crossing by some unknown means
 considerable spaces of open ocean: thus there is one species common to
 New Zealand and to the Auckland Islands, though separated by a
 distance of about 230 miles. On the same continent fresh-water fish
 often range widely, and as if capriciously; for in two adjoining
 river-systems some of the species may be the same, and some wholly
 different.
   </p><p>It is probable that they are occasionally transported by what may be
 called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely
 dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is known that the
 ova retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from
 the water. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to
 changes in the level of the land within the recent period, causing
 rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of
 this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. The
 wide difference of the fish on the opposite sides of most
 mountain-ranges, which are continuous, and which consequently must
 from an early period have completely prevented the inosculation of the
 river-systems on the two sides, leads to the same conclusion. Some
 fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there
 will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and
 consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover, Dr.
 Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer
 that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. Salt-water fish
 can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and,
 according to Valenciennes' there is hardly a single group of which
 an the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species
 belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores
 of the sea, and could, it is probable, become adapted without much
 difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.
   </p><p>Some species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and allied
 species which, on our theory, are descended from a common parent,
 and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the
 world. Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are
 not likely to be transported by birds; and the ova, as well as the
 adults, are immediately killed by sea-water. I could not even
 understand how some naturalised species have spread rapidly throughout
 the same country. But two facts, which I have observed- and many
 others no doubt will be discovered- throw some light on this
 subject. When ducks suddenly emerge from a pond covered with
 duck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to their
 backs; and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed
 from one aquarium to another, that I have unintentionally stocked
 the one with fresh-water shells from the other. But another agency
 is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the feet of a duck in an
 aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I
 found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells
 crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out
 of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more
 advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just-hatched
 molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,
 in damp air, from twelve to twenty-hours; and in this length of time a
 duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and if
 blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant
 point, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet. Sir Charles Lyell
 informs me that a Dytiscus has been caught with an Ancylus (a
 fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a
 water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board
 the "Beagle," when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how
 much farther it might have been blown by a favouring gale no one can
 tell.
   </p><p>With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous
 ranges many fresh-water, and even marsh species, have, both over
 continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. This is
 strikingly illustrated, according to Alph. de Candolle, in those large
 groups of terrestrial plants, which have very few aquatic members; for
 the latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a wide
 range. I think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I
 have before mentioned that earth occasionally adheres in some quantity
 to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy
 edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to
 have muddy feet. Birds of this order wander more than those of any
 other; and they are occasionally found on the most remote and barren
 islands of the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the
 surface of the sea, so that any dirt on their feet would not be washed
 off; and when gaining the land, they would be sure to fly to their
 natural fresh-water haunts. I do not believe that botanists are
 aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds; I have tried
 several little experiments, but will here give only the most
 striking case: I took in February three tablespoonfuls of mud from
 three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond:
 this mud when dried weighed only 63/4 ounces; I kept it covered up
 in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it
 grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in
 number; and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup!
 Considering these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable
 circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water
 plants to unstocked ponds and streams, situated at very distant
 points. The  same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some
 of the smaller fresh-water animals.
   </p><p>Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I
 have stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they
 reject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish
 swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and
 Potamogeton. Herons and other birds, century after century, have
 gone on daily devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other
 waters, or are blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds
 retain their power of germination, when rejected many hours afterwards
 in pellets or in the excrement. When I saw the great size of the seeds
 of that fine water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de
 Candolle's remarks on the distribution of this plant, I thought that
 the means of its dispersal must remain inexplicable; but Audubon
 states that he found the seeds of the great southern water-lily
 (probably, according to Dr. Hooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's
 stomach. Now this bird must often have flown with its stomach thus
 well stocked to distant ponds, and then getting a hearty meal of fish,
 analogy makes me believe that it would have rejected the seeds in a
 pellet in a fit state for germination.
   </p><p>In considering these several means of distribution, it should be
 remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance,
 on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg
 will have a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a
 struggle for life between the inhabitants of the same pond, however
 few in kind, yet as the number even in a well-stocked pond is small in
 comparison with the number of species inhabiting an equal area of
 land, the competition between them will probably be less severe than
 between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the
 waters of a foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on
 new place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should also
 remember that many fresh-water productions are low in the scale of
 nature, and we have reason to believe that such beings become modified
 more slowly than the high; and this will give time for the migration
 of aquatic species. We should not forget the probability of many
 fresh-water forms laving formerly ranged continuously over immense
 areas, and then having become extinct at intermediate points. But
 the wide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower
 animals, whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree
 modified, apparently depends in main part on the wide dispersal of
 their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds,
 which have great powers of flight, and naturally travel from one piece
 of water to another.
 
 </p><h4>On the Inhabitants of Oceanic Islands</h4>
 
   <p>We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I
 have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with
 respect to distribution, on the view that not only all the individuals
 of the same species have migrated from some one area, but that
 allied species, although now inhabiting the most distant points,
 have proceeded from a single area,- the birthplace of their early
 progenitors. I have already given my reasons for disbelieving in
 continental extensions within the period of existing species, on so
 enormous a scale that all the many islands of the several oceans
 were thus stocked with their present terrestrial inhabitants. This
 view removes many difficulties, but it does not accord with all the
 facts in regard to the productions of islands. In the following
 remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere question of
 dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing on the truth of
 the two theories of independent creation and of descent with
 modification.
   </p><p>The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in
 number compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de
 Candolle admits this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. New
 Zealand, for instance, with its lofty mountains and diversified
 stations, extending over 780 miles of latitude, together with the
 outlying islands of Auckland, Campbell and Chatham, contain altogether
 only 960 kinds of flowering plants; if we compare this moderate number
 with the species which swarm over equal areas in South-Western
 Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope, we must admit that some
 cause, independently of different physical conditions, has given
 rise to so great a difference in number. Even the uniform county of
 Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a
 few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers,
 and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. We have
 evidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed
 less than half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many species have now
 become naturalised on it, as they have in New Zealand and on every
 other oceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason
 to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or
 quite exterminated many native productions. He who admits the
 doctrine of the creation of each separate species, will have to
 admit that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and
 animals were not created for oceanic islands; for man has
 unintentionally stocked them far more fully and perfectly than did
 nature.
   </p><p>Although in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the
 proportion of endemic kinds  (i.e., those found nowhere else in the
 world) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the
 number of endemic landshells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in the
 Galapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and
 then compare the area of the island with that of the continent, we
 shall see that this is true. This fact might have been theoretically
 expected, for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving
 after long intervals of time in the new and isolated district, and
 having to compete with new associates, would be eminently liable to
 modification, and would often produce groups of modified
 descendants. But it by no means follows that, because in an island
 nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of another
 class, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and this
 difference seems to depend partly on the species which are not
 modified having immigrated in a body, so that their mutual relations
 have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent arrival of
 unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, with which the
 insular forms have intercrossed. It should be borne in mind that the
 offspring of such crosses would certainly gain in vigour, so that even
 an occasional cross would produce more effect than might have been
 anticipated. I will give a few illustrations of the foregoing remarks:
 in the Galapagos Islands there are 9.6 land-birds; of these 21 (or
 perhaps 93) are peculiar, whereas of the 11 marine birds only 2 are
 peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these
 islands much more easily and frequently than land-birds. Bermuda, on
 the other hand, which lies at about the same distance from North
 America as the Galapagos Islands do from South America, and which
 has a very peculiar soil, does not possess a single endemic
 landbird, and we know from Mr. J. M. Jones's admirable account of
 Bermuda, that very many North American birds occasionally or even
 frequently visit this, island. Almost every year, as I am informed
 by Mr. E. V. Harcourt, many European and African birds are blown to
 Madeira; this island is inhabited by 99 kinds of which one alone is
 peculiar, though very closely related to a European form; and three or
 four other species are confined to this island and to the Canaries. So
 that the islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the
 neighbouring continents with birds, which for long ages have there
 struggled together, and have become mutually co-adapted. Hence when
 settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the
 others to its proper place and habits, and will consequently have
 been but little liable to modification. Any tendency to modification
 will also have been checked by intercrossing with the unmodified
 immigrants, often arriving from the mother-country. Madeira again is
 inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not
 one species of sea-shell is peculiar to its shores: now, though we
 do not know how seashells are dispersed, yet we can see that their
 eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or
 to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported across three or four
 hundred miles of open sea far more easily than land-shells. The
 different orders of insects inhabiting Madeira present nearly
 parallel cases.
   </p><p>Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain
 whole classes, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus in
 the Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless
 birds, take, or recently took, the place of mammals. Although New
 Zealand is here spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree
 doubtful whether it should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is
 not separated from Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its
 geological character and the direction of its mountain-ranges, the
 Rev. W. B. Clarke has lately maintained that this island, as well as
 New Caledonia, should be considered as appurtenances of Australia.
 Turning to plants, Dr. Hooker has shown that in the Galapagos
 Islands the proportional numbers of the different orders are very
 different from what they are elsewhere. All such differences in
 number, and the absence of certain whole groups of animals and
 plants, are generally accounted for by supposed differences in the
 physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation is not a
 little doubtful. Facility of immigration seems to have been fully as
 important as the nature of the conditions.
   </p><p>Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the
 inhabitants of oceanic islands. For instance, in certain islands not
 tenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have
 beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than
 that hooks serve for the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of
 quadrupeds. But a hooked seed might be carried to an island by other
 means; and the plant then becoming modified would form an endemic
 species, still retaining its hooks, which would form a useless
 appendage like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers
 of many insular beetles. Again, islands often possess trees or
 bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous
 species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have,
 whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence trees would be
 little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous
 plant, which had no chance of successfully competing with the many
 fully developed trees growing on a continent, might, when
 established on an island, gain an advantage over other herbaceous
 plants by growing taller and taller and overtopping them. In this
 case, natural selection would tend to add to the stature of the plant,
 to whatever order it belonged, and thus first convert it into a bush
 and then into a tree.
 
  </p><h4>Absence of Batrachians and Terrestrial Mammals on Oceanic Islands</h4>
 
   <p>With respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on oceanic
 islands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that batrachians (frogs,
 toads, newts) are never found on any of the many islands with which
 the great oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this
 assertion, and have found it true, with the exception of New
 Zealand, New Caledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon
 Islands and the Seychelles. But I have already remarked that it is
 doubtful whether New Zealand and New Caledonia ought to be classed
 as oceanic islands; and this is still more doubtful with respect to
 the Andaman and Solomon groups and the Seychelles. This general
 absence of frogs, toads, and newts on so many true oceanic islands
 cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions: indeed it
 seems that islands are peculiarly fitted for these animals; for
 frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius,
 and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance. But as these animals
 and their spawn are immediately killed (with the exception, as far
 as known, of one Indian species) by sea-water, there would be great
 difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and therefore we can
 see why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands. But why, on the
 theory of creation, they should not have been created there, it
 would be very difficult to explain.
   </p><p>Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched
 the oldest voyages, and have not found a single instance, free from
 doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by
 the natives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a
 continent or great continental island; and many islands situated at
 a much less distance are equally barren. The Falkland Islands, which
 are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but
 this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank in
 connection with the mainland at the distance of about 280 miles;
 moreover, icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores,
 and they may have formerly transported foxes, as now frequently
 happens in the arctic regions. Yet it cannot be said that small
 islands will not support at least small mammals, for they occur in
 many parts of the world on very small islands, when lying close to a
 continent; and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller
 quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied. It
 cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has not
 been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are
 sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which
 they have suffered, and by their tertiary strata: there has also
 been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other
 classes; and on continents it is known that new species of mammals
 appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals.
 Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aerial
 mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two
 bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti
 Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne
 Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it
 may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no
 other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question can easily
 be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a
 wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been seen
 wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North American
 species either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at the
 distance of 600 miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who
 has specially studied this family, that many species have enormous
 ranges, and are found on continents and on far distant islands.
 Hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been
 modified in their new homes in relation to their new position, and
 we can understand the presence of endemic bats on oceanic islands,
 with the absence of all other terrestrial mammals.
   </p><p>Another interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of
 the sea separating islands from each other or from the nearest
 continent, and the degree of affinity of their mammalian
 inhabitants. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations on
 this head, since greatly extended by Mr. Wallace's admirable
 researches, in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is
 traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean, and this separates
 two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On either side the islands stand
 on a moderately shallow submarine bank, and these islands are
 inhabited by the same or by closely allied quadrupeds. I have not as
 yet had time to follow up this subject in all quarters of the world;
 but as far as I have gone, the relation holds good. For instance,
 Britain is separated by a shallow channel from Europe, and the mammals
 are the same on both sides; and so it is with all the islands near the
 shores of Australia. The West Indian Islands, on the other hand, stand
 on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms in depth, and here
 we find American forms, but the species and even the genera are
 quite distinct. As the amount of modification which animals of all
 kinds undergo partly depends on the lapse of time, and as the
 islands which are separated from each other or from the mainland by
 shallow channels, are more likely to have been continuously united
 within a recent period than the islands separated by deeper
 channels, we can understand how it is that a relation exists between
 the depth of the sea separating two mammalian faunas, and the degree
 of their affinity,- a relation which is quite inexplicable on the
 theory of independent acts of creation.
   </p><p>The foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic
 islands,- namely, the fewness of the species, with a large
 proportion consisting of endemic forms,- the members of certain
 groups, but not those of other groups in the same class, having been
 modified,- the absence of certain whole orders, as of batrachians
 and of terrestrial mammals, notwithstanding the presence of aerial
 bats,- the singular proportions of certain orders of plants,-
 herbaceous forms having been developed into trees, &amp;c.,- seem to me to
 accord better with the belief in the efficiency of occasional means of
 transport, carried on during a long course of time, than with the
 belief in the former connection of all oceanic islands with the
 nearest continent; for on this latter view it is probable that the
 various classes would have immigrated more uniformly, and from the
 species having entered in a body their mutual relations would not have
 been much disturbed, and consequently they would either have not
 been modified, or all the species in a more equable manner.
   </p><p>I do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in
 understanding how many Of the inhabitants of the inhabitants of the
 more remote islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or
 subsequently modified, have reached their present homes. But the
 probability of other islands having once existed as halting-places, of
 which not a wreck now remains, must not be overlooked. I will
 specify one difficult case. Almost all oceanic islands, even the
 most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by landshells, generally
 by endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere,-
 striking instances of which have been given by Dr. A. A. Gould in
 relation to the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are
 easily killed by sea-water; their eggs, at least such as I have tried,
 sink in it and are killed. Yet there must be some unknown, but
 occasionally efficient means for their transportal. Would the
 just-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet of birds roosting on
 the ground, and thus get transported? It occurred to me that
 landshells, when hibernating and having a membranous diaphragm over
 the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber
 across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I find that several
 species in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water
 during seven days: one shell, the Helix pomatia, after having been
 thus treated and again hibernating was put into sea-water for twenty
 days, and perfectly recovered. During this length of time the shell
 might have been carried by a marine current of average swiftness, to a
 distance of 660 geographical miles. As this Helix has a thick
 calcareous operculum, I removed it, and  </p><p>when it had formed a new
 membranous one, I again immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water,
 and again it recovered and crawled away. Baron Aucapitaine has since
 tried similar experiments: he placed 100 landshells, belonging to
 ten species, in a box pierced with holes, and immersed it for a
 fortnight in the sea. Out of the hundred shells, twenty-seven
 recovered. The presence of an operculum seems to have been of
 importance, as out of twelve specimens of Cyclostoma elegans, which is
 thus furnished, eleven revived. It is remarkable, seeing how well
 the Helix pomatia resisted with me the salt-water, that not one of
 fifty-four specimens belonging to four other species of Helix tried by
 Aucapitaine, recovered. It is, however, not at all probable that
 land-shells have often been thus transported; the feet of birds
 offer a more probable method.
 
 </p><h4>On the Relations of the Inhabitants of Islands to those of the
 nearest Mainland</h4>
 
   <p>The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the
 species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland,
 without being actually the same. Numerous instances could be given.
 The Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at the
 distance of between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South
 America. Here almost every product of the land and of the water
 bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are
 twenty-six land-birds; of these, twenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three
 are ranked as distinct species, and would commonly be assumed to
 have been here created; yet the close affinity of most of these
 birds to American species is manifest in every character, in their
 habits, gestures, and tones of voice. So it is with the other animals,
 and with a large proportion of the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in
 his admirable Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at
 the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant
 several hundred miles from the continent, feels that he is standing on
 American land. Why should this be so? Why should the species which are
 supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and
 nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of affinity to those created
 in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the
 geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in
 the proportions in which the several classes are associated
 together, which closely resemble; the conditions of the South American
 coast: in fact, there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these
 respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of
 resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in the climate,
 height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape
 Verde Archipelagoes: but what an entire and absolute difference in
 their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape Verde Islands are
 related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America.
 Facts such as these admit of no sort of explanation on the ordinary
 view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained,
 it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive
 colonists from America, whether by occasional means of transport or
 (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly continuous
 land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists would
 be liable to modification,- the principle of inheritance still
 betraying their original birthplace.
   </p><p>Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost
 universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related
 to those of the nearest continent, or of the nearest large island. The
 exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. Thus although
 Kerguelen Land stands nearer to Africa than to America, the plants are
 related, and that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's
 account, to those of America: but on the view that this island has
 been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on
 icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears.
 New Zealand in its endemic planes is much more closely related to
 Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is
 what might have been expected; but it is also plainly related to
 South America, which, although the next nearest continent, is so
 enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly. But this
 difficulty partially disappears on the view that New Zealand, South
 America, and the other southern lands have been stocked in part from a
 nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the antarctic
 islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, during a warmer
 tertiary period, before the commencement of the last Glacial period.
 The affinity, which though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real,
 between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia and of
 the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case; but this
 affinity is confined to the plants, and will, no doubt, some day be
 explained.
   </p><p>The same law which has determined the relationship between the
 inhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes
 displayed on a small scale, but in a most interesting manner, within
 the limits of the same archipelago. Thus each separate island of the
 Galapagos Archipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a marvellous one,
 by many different species; but these species are related to each other
 in a very much closer manner than to the inhabitants of the American
 continent, or of any other quarter of the world. This is what might
 have been expected, for islands situated so near to each other would
 almost necessarily receive immigrants from the same original source,
 and from each other. But how is it that many of the immigrants have
 been differently modified, though only in a small degree, in islands
 situated within sight of each other, having the same geological
 nature, the same height, climate, &amp;c.? This long appeared to me a
 great difficulty: but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated
 error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the
 most important; whereas it cannot be disputed that the nature of the
 other species with which each has to compete, is at least as
 important, and generally a far more important element of success.
 Now if we look to the species which inhabit the Galapagos Archipelago,
 and are likewise found in other parts of the world, we find that
 they differ considerably in the several islands. This difference might
 indeed have been expected if the islands had been stocked by
 occasional means of transport- a seed, for instance, of one plant
 having been brought to one island, and that of another plant to
 another island, though all proceeding from the same general source.
 Hence, when in former times an immigrant first settled on one of the
 islands, or when it subsequently spread from one to another, it
 would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions in the
 different islands, for it would have to compete with a different set
 of organisms; a plant, for instance, would find the ground best fitted
 for it occupied by somewhat different species in the different
 islands, and would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different
 enemies. If then it varied, natural selection would probably favour
 different varieties in the different islands. Some species, however,
 might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group,
 just as we see some species spreading widely throughout a continent
 and remaining the same.
   </p><p>The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos
 Archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is that
 each new species after being formed in any one island, did not
 spread quickly to the other islands. But the islands, though in
 sight of each other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most
 cases wider than the British Channel, and there is no reason to
 suppose that they have at any former period been continuously
 united. The currents of the sea are rapid and sweep between the
 islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the
 islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they
 appear on a map. Nevertheless some of the species, both of those found
 in other parts of the world and of those confined to the
 archipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may infer
 from their present manner of distribution, that they have spread
 from one island to the others. But we often take, I think, an
 erroneous view of the probability of closely-allied species invading
 each other's territory, when put into free intercommunication.
 Undoubtedly, if one species has any advantage over another, it will in
 a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are
 equally well fitted for their own places, both will probably hold
 their separate places for almost any length of time. Being familiar
 with the fact that many species, naturalised through man's agency,
 have spread with astonishing rapidity over wide areas, we are apt to
 infer that most species would thus spread; but we should remember that
 the species which become naturalised in new countries are not
 generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very
 distinct forms, belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown
 by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct genera. In the Galapagos
 Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well adapted for flying
 from island to island, differ on the different islands; thus there are
 three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to its
 own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to
 be blown to Charles Island, which has its own mocking-thrush, why
 should it succeed in establishing itself there? We may safely infer
 that Charles Island is well stocked with its own species, for
 annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched, than can possibly
 be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to
 Charles's Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the
 species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston
 have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject;
 namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess
 many distinct but representative species of land-shells, some of which
 live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone
 are annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this
 latter island has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species;
 nevertheless both islands have been colonised by European land-shells,
 which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. From
 these considerations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic
 species which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos
 Archipelago, not having all spread from island to island. On the
 same continent, also, preoccupation has probably played an important
 part in checking the commingling of the species which inhabit
 different districts with nearly the same physical conditions. Thus,
 the south-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the
 same physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet
 they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and
 plants; so it is, according to Mr. Bates, with the butterflies and
 other animals inhabiting the great, open, and continuous valley of the
 Amazons.
   </p><p>The same principle which governs the general character of the
 inhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source
 whence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with
 their subsequent modification, is of the widest application throughout
 nature. We see this on every mountain summit, in every lake and marsh.
 For Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same species have
 become widely spread during the Glacial epoch, are related to those of
 the surrounding lowlands; thus we have in South America, Alpine
 humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, &amp;c., all strictly
 belonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a mountain, as
 it became slowly unheaved, would be colonised from the surrounding
 lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes,
 excepting in so far as great facility of transport has allowed the
 same forms to prevail throughout large portions of the world. We see
 this same principle in the character of most of the blind animals
 inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts
 could be given. It will, I believe, be found universally true, that
 wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely
 allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be found
 some identical species; and wherever many closely-allied species
 occur, there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as
 distinct species, and others as mere varieties; these doubtful forms
 showing us the steps in the progress of modification.
   </p><p>The relation between the power and extent of migration in certain
 species, either at the present or at some former period, and the
 existence at remote points of the world of closely-allied species,
 is shown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me
 long ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world,
 many of the species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that
 this rule is generally true, though difficult of proof. Amongst
 mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in bats, and in a lesser
 degree in the Felidae and Canidae. We see the same rule in the
 distribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with most of the
 inhabitants of fresh water, for many of the genera in the most
 distinct classes range over the world, and many of the species have
 enormous ranges. It is not meant that all, but that some of the
 species have very wide ranges in the genera which range very widely.
 Nor is it meant that the species in such genera have on an average a
 very wide range; for this will largely depend on how far the process
 of modification has gone; for instance, two varieties of the same
 species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the species has an
 immense range; but, if variation were to be carried a little
 further, the two varieties would be ranked as distinct species, and
 their range would be greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that
 species which have the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging
 widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will
 necessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to range
 widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more
 important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle
 for life with foreign associates. But according to the view that all
 the species of a genus, though distributed to the most remote points
 of the world, are descended from a single progenitor, we ought to
 find, and I believe as a general rule we do find, that some at least
 of the species range very widely.
   </p><p>We should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of
 ancient origin, and the species in this case will have had ample
 time for dispersal and subsequent modification. There is also reason
 to believe from geological evidence, that within each great class
 the lower organisms change at a slower rate than the higher;
 consequently they will have had a better chance of ranging widely
 and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact,
 together with that of the seeds and eggs of most lowly organised forms
 being very minute and better fitted for distant transportal,
 probably accounts for a law which has long been observed, and which
 has lately been discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants,
 namely, that the lower any group of organisms stands the more widely
 it ranges.
   </p><p>The relations just discussed,- namely, lower organisms ranging
 more widely than the higher,- some of the species of widely-ranging
 genera themselves ranging widely,- such facts, as Alpine,
 lacustrine, and marsh productions being generally related to those
 which live on the surrounding low lands and dry lands,- the striking
 relationship between the inhabitants of islands and those of the
 nearest mainland, the still closer relationship of the distinct
 inhabitants of the islands in the same archipelago,- are
 inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation of
 each species, but are explicable if we admit colonisation from the
 nearest or readiest source, together with the subsequent adaptation of
 the colonists to their new homes.
 
 </p><h4>Summary of the last and present Chapters</h4>
 
   <p>In these chapters I have endeavoured to show, that if we make due
 allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of
 climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred
 within the recent period, and of other changes which have probably
 occurred,- if we remember how ignorant we are with respect to the many
 curious means of occasional transport,- if we bear in mind, and this
 is a very important consideration, how often a species may have ranged
 continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the
 intermediate tracts,- the difficulty is not insuperable in believing
 that all the individuals of the same species, wherever found, are
 descended from common parents. And we are led to this conclusion,
 which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of
 single centres of creation, by various general considerations, more
 especially from the importance of barriers of all kinds, and from
 the analogical distribution of subgenera, genera, and families.
   </p><p>With respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus,
 which on our theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make the
 same allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some
 forms of life have changed very slowly, enormous periods of time
 having been thus granted for their migration, the difficulties are far
 from insuperable; though in this case, as in that of the individuals
 of the same species, they are often great.
   </p><p>As exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, I
 have attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period
 has played, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which,
 during the alternations of the cold in the north and south, allowed
 the productions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of
 them stranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world. As
 showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, I
 have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of
 fresh-water productions.
   </p><p>If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long
 course of time all the individuals of the same species, and likewise
 of the several species belonging to the same genus, have proceeded
 from some one source; then all the grand leading facts of
 geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration,
 together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new
 forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether
 of land or water, in not only separating, but in apparently forming
 the several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand
 the concentration of related species within the same areas; and how it
 is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America,
 the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests,
 marshes, and deserts, are linked together in so mysterious a manner,
 and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly
 inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind that the mutual relation
 of organism to organism is of the highest importance, we can see why
 two areas having nearly the same physical conditions should often be
 inhabited by very different forms of life; for according to the length
 of time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one of the
 regions, or both; according to the nature of the communication which
 allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater or
 lesser numbers; according or not, as those which entered happened to
 come into more or less direct competition with each other and with the
 aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying
 more or less rapidly, there would ensue in the two or more regions,
 independently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified
 conditions of life,- there would be an almost endless amount of
 organic action and reaction,- and we should find some groups of beings
 greatly, and some only slightly modified,- some developed in great
 force, some existing in scanty numbers- and this we do find in the
 several great geographical provinces of the world.
   </p><p>On these same principles we can understand, as I have endeavoured to
 show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but that of
 these, a large proportion should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in
 relation to the means of migration, one group of beings should have
 all its species peculiar, and another group, even within the same
 class, should have all its species the same with those in an adjoining
 quarter of the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as
 batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic
 islands, whilst the most isolated islands should possess their own
 peculiar species of aerial mammals or bats. We can see why, in
 islands, there should be some relation between the presence of
 mammals, in a more or less modified condition, and the depth of the
 sea between such islands and the mainland. We can clearly see why
 all the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct on
 the several islets, should be closely related to each other; and
 should likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the
 nearest continent, or other source whence immigrants might have been
 derived. We can see why, if there exists very closely allied or
 representative species in two areas, however distant from each
 other, some identical species will almost always there be found.
   </p><p>As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking
 parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws
 governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the
 same with those governing at the present time the differences in
 different areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each
 species and group of species is continuous in time; for the apparent
 exceptions to the rule are so few, that they may fairly be
 attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate
 deposit certain forms which are absent in it, but which occur both
 above and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that
 the area inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is
 continuous, and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as I have
 attempted to show, be accounted for by former migrations under
 different circumstances, or through occasional means of transport,
 or by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts.
 Both in time and space species and groups of species have their points
 of maximum development. Groups of species, living during the same
 period of time, or living within the same area, are often
 characterised by trifling features in common, as of sculpture or
 colour. In looking to the long succession of past ages, as in
 looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that
 species in certain classes differ little from each other, whilst
 those in another class, or only in a different section of the same
 order, differ greatly from each other. In both time and space the
 lowly organised members of each class generally change less than the
 highly organised; but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the
 rule. According to our theory, these several relations throughout
 time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to the allied
 forms of life which have changed during successive ages, or to those
 which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters, in
 both cases they are connected by the same bond of ordinary generation;
 in both cases the laws of variation have been the same, and
 modifications  have been accumulated by the same means of natural
 selection.
