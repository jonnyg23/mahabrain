 <h3>Chapter IV: Natural Selection; Or the Survival of the Fittest</h3>
 
   <p>How will the struggle for existence, briefly discussed in the last
 chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection,
 which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under
 nature? I think we shall see that it can act most efficiently. Let the
 endless number of slight variations and individual differences
 occurring in our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, in
 those under nature, be borne in mind; as well as the strength of the
 hereditary tendency. Under domestication, it may be truly said that
 the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. But the
 variability, which we almost universally meet with in our domestic
 productions, is not directly produced, as Hooker and Asa Gray have
 well remarked, by man; he can neither originate varieties, nor prevent
 their occurrence; he can preserve and accumulate such as do occur.
 Unintentionally he exposes organic beings to new and changing
 conditions of life, and variability ensues; but similar changes of
 conditions might and do occur under nature. Let it also be borne in
 mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations
 of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions
 of life; and consequently what infinitely varied diversities of
 structure might be of use to each being under changing conditions of
 life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations
 useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations
 useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of
 life, should occur in the course of many successive generations? If
 such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals
 are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any
 advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance
 of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we
 may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would
 be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable individual
 differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are
 injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the
 Fittest. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected
 by natural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating
 element, as perhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would
 ultimately become fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the
 nature of the conditions.
   </p><p>Several writers have misapprehended or objected to the term
 Natural Selection. Some have even imagined that natural selection
 induces variability, whereas it implies only the preservation of
 such variations as arise and are beneficial to the being under its
 conditions of life. No one objects to agriculturists speaking of the
 potent effects of man's selection; and in this case the individual
 differences given by nature, which man for some object selects, must
 of necessity first occur. Others have objected that the term selection
 implies conscious choice in the animals which become modified; and
 it has even been urged that, as plants have no volition, natural
 selection is not applicable to them! In the literal sense of the word,
 no doubt, natural selection is a false term; but who ever objected
 to chemists speaking of the elective affinities of the various
 elements?- and yet an acid cannot strictly be said to elect the base
 with which it in preference combines. It has been said that I speak of
 natural selection as an active power or Deity; but who objects to an
 author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements
 of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is implied by such
 metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity.
 So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but
 I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many
 natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us.
 With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be
 forgotten.
   </p><p>We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by
 taking the case of a country undergoing some slight physical change,
 for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its
 inhabitants will almost immediately undergo a change, and some species
 will probably become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have
 seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of
 each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical
 proportions of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate
 itself, would seriously affect the others. If the country were open on
 its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this would
 likewise seriously disturb the relations of some of the former
 inhabitants. let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a
 single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case
 of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into
 which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should
 then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be
 better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some
 manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these
 same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such cases,
 slight modifications, which in any way favoured the individuals of any
 species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would
 tend to be preserved; and natural selection would have free scope
 for the work of improvement.
   </p><p>We have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter,
 that changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased
 variability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions have changed,
 and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by
 affording a better chance of the occurrence of profitable
 variations. Unless such occur, natural selection can do nothing. Under
 the term of "variations," it must never be forgotten that mere
 individual differences are included. As man can produce a great result
 with his domestic animals and plants by adding up in any given
 direction individual differences, so could natural selection, but
 far more easily from having incomparably longer time for action. Nor
 do I believe that any great physical change, as of climate, or any
 unusual degree of isolation to check immigration, is necessary in
 order that new and unoccupied places should be left, for natural
 selection to fill up by improving some of the varying inhabitants. For
 as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with
 nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the
 structure or habits of one species would often give it an advantage
 over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would
 often still further increase the advantage, as long as the species
 continued under the same conditions of life and profited by similar
 means of subsistence and defence. No country can be named in which all
 the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other
 and to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of
 them could be still better adapted or improved; for in all
 countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised
 productions, that they have allowed some foreigners to take firm
 possession of the land. And as foreigners have thus in every country
 beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the natives
 might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better resisted
 the intruders.
   </p><p>As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by
 his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not
 natural selection effect? Man can act only on external and visible
 characters: Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural
 preservation or survival of the fittest, cares nothing for
 appearances, except in so far as they are useful to any being. She can
 act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional
 difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his
 own good: Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every
 selected character is fully exercised by her, as is implied by the
 fact of their selection. Man keeps the natives of many climates in the
 same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some
 peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon
 on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged
 quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short
 wool to the same climate. He does not allow the most vigorous males to
 struggle for the females. He does not rigidly destroy all inferior
 animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as lies in
 his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection by
 some half-monstrous form; or at least by some modification prominent
 enough to catch the eye or to be plainly useful to him. Under
 nature, the slightest differences of structure or constitution may
 well turn the nicely balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so
 be preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how
 short his time! and consequently how poor will be his results,
 compared with those accumulated by Nature during whole geological
 periods! Can we wonder, then, that Nature's productions should be
 far "truer" in character than man's productions; that they should be
 infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life,
 and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship?
   </p><p>It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and
 hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations;
 rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are
 good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever
 opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in
 relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see
 nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time
 has marked the lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into
 long-past geological ages, that we see only that the forms of life are
 now different from what they formerly were.
   </p><p>In order that any great amount of modification should be effected in
 a species, a variety when once formed must again, perhaps after a long
 interval of time, vary or present individual differences of the same
 favourable nature as before; and these must be again preserved, and so
 onwards step by step. Seeing that individual differences of the same
 kind perpetually recur, this can hardly be considered as an
 unwarrantable assumption. But whether it is true, we can judge only by
 seeing how far the hypothesis accords with and explains the general
 phenomena of nature. On the other hand, the ordinary belief that the
 amount of possible variation is a strictly limited quantity is
 likewise a simple assumption.
   </p><p>Although natural selection can act only through and for the good
 of each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to
 consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we
 see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the
 alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red grouse the colour of
 heather, we must believe that these tints are of service to these
 birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not
 destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless
 numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and
 hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey- so much so, that on
 parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons,
 as being the most liable to destruction. Hence natural selection might
 be effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and
 in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. Nor
 ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of
 any particular colour would produce little effect: we should
 remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy a
 lamb with the faintest trace of black. We have seen how the colour
 of the hogs, which feed on the "paint-root" in Virginia, determines
 whether they shall live or die. In plants, the down on the fruit and
 the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of
 the most trifling importance: yet we hear from an excellent
 horticulturist, Downing, that in the United States, smooth-skinned
 fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a Curculio, than those with
 down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than
 yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches
 far more than those with other coloured flesh. If, with all the aids
 of art, these slight differences make a great difference in
 cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature,
 where the trees would have to struggle with other trees, and with a
 host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which
 variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed
 fruit, should succeed.
   </p><p>In looking at many small points of difference between species,
 which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite
 unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, &amp;c., have no doubt
 produced some direct effect. It is also necessary to bear in mind
 that, owing to the law of correlation, when one part varies, and the
 variations are accumulated through natural selection, other
 modifications, often of the most unexpected nature, will ensue.
   </p><p>As we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear
 at any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at
 the same period;- for instance, in the shape, size, and flavour of the
 seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants;
 in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the
 silk-worm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of
 their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly
 adult;- so in a state of nature natural selection will be enabled to
 act on and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of
 variations profitable at that age, and by their inheritance at a
 corresponding age. If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and
 more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater
 difficulty in this being effected through natural selection, than in
 the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in
 the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify and adapt
 the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different
 from those which concern the mature insect; and these modifications
 may affect, through correlation, the structure of the adult. So,
 conversely, modifications in the adult may affect the structure of the
 larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that they
 shall not be injurious: for if they were so, the species would
 become extinct.
   </p><p>Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation
 to the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In social
 animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit
 of the whole community, if the community profits by the selected
 change. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure
 of one species, without giving it any advantage, for the good Of
 another species; and though statements to this effect may be found
 in works of natural history, I cannot find one case which will bear
 investigation. A structure used only once in an animal's life, if of
 high importance to it, might be modified to any extent by natural
 selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain
 insects, used exclusively for opening the cocoon- or the hard tip to
 the beak of unhatched birds, used for breaking the egg. It has been
 asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater
 number perish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that
 fanciers assist in the act of hatching. Now if nature had to make
 the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird's own
 advantage, the process of modification would be very slow, and there
 would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of all the young
 birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest beaks,
 for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish; or, more delicate and
 more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the
 shell being known to vary like every other structure.
   </p><p>It may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be
 much fortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence
 on the course of natural selection. For instance a vast number of eggs
 or seeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified through
 natural selection only if they varied in some manner which protected
 them from their enemies. Yet many of these eggs or seeds would
 perhaps, if not destroyed, have yielded individuals better adapted
 to their conditions of life than any of these which happened to
 survive. So again a vast number of mature animals and plants,
 whether or not they be the best adapted to their conditions, must be
 annually destroyed by accidental causes, which would not be in the
 least degree mitigated by certain changes of structure or constitution
 which would in other ways be beneficial to the species. But let the
 destruction of the adults be ever so heavy, if the number which can
 exist in any district be not wholly kept down by such causes,- or
 again let the destruction of eggs or seeds be so great that only a
 hundredth or a thousandth part are developed,- yet of those which do
 survive, the best adapted individuals, supposing that there is any
 variability in favourable direction, will tend to propagate their kind
 in larger numbers than the less well adapted. If the numbers be wholly
 kept down by the causes just indicated, as will often have been the
 case, natural selection will be powerless in certain beneficial
 directions; but this is no valid objection to its efficiency at
 other times and in other ways; for we are far from having any reason
 to suppose that many species ever undergo modification and improvement
 at the same time in the same area.
 
  </p><h4>Sexual Selection</h4>
 
   <p>Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one
 sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, so no doubt it
 will be under nature. Thus it is rendered possible for the two sexes
 to be modified through natural selection in relation to different
 habits of life, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex to be
 modified in relation to the other sex, as commonly occurs. This
 leads me to say a few words on what I have called Sexual Selection.
 This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in
 relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a
 struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males,
 for the possession of the other sex. The result is not death to the
 unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is,
 therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most
 vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in
 nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases, victory depends
 not so much on general vigor, as on having special weapons, confined
 to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor
 chance of leaving numerous offspring. Sexual selection, by always
 allowing the victor to breed, might surely give indomitable courage,
 length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the
 spurred leg, in nearly the same manner as does the brutal
 cockfighter by the careful selection of his best cocks. How low in the
 scale of nature the law of battle descends, I know not; male
 alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling
 round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females;
 male salmons have been observed fighting all day long; male
 stagbeetles sometimes bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other
 males; the males of certain hymenopterous insects have been frequently
 seen by that inimitable observer M. Fabre, fighting for a particular
 female who sits by, an apparently unconcerned beholder of the
 struggle, and then retires with the conqueror. The war is, perhaps,
 severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem
 oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous
 animals are already well armed; though to them and to others,
 special means of defence may be given through means of sexual
 selection, as the mane of the lion, and the hooked jaw to the male
 salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword
 or spear.
   </p><p>Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character.
 All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is
 the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract,
 by singing, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise,
 and some others, congregate; and successive males display with the
 most elaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous
 plumage; they likewise perform strange antics before the females,
 which, standing by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive
 partner. Those who have closely attended to birds in confinement
 well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes:
 thus Sir R. Heron has described how a pied peacock was eminently
 attractive to all his hen birds. I cannot here enter on the
 necessary details; but if man can in a short time give beauty and an
 elegant carriage to his bantams, according to his standard of
 beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by
 selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or
 beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might
 produce a marked effect. Some well-known laws, with respect to the
 plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of
 the young, can partly be explained through the action of sexual
 selection on variations occurring at different ages, and transmitted
 to the males alone or to both sexes at corresponding ages; but I
 have not space here to enter on this subject.
   </p><p>Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any
 animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in
 structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly
 caused by sexual selection: that is, by individual males having had,
 in successive generations, some slight advantage over other males,
 in their weapons, means of defence, or charms, which they have
 transmitted to their male offspring alone. Yet, I would not wish to
 attribute all sexual differences to this agency: for we see in our
 domestic animals peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the
 male sex, which apparently have not been augmented through selection
 by man. The tuft of hair on the breast of the wild turkey-cock
 cannot be of any use, and it is doubtful whether it can be
 ornamental in the eyes of the female bird; indeed, had the tuft
 appeared under domestication, it would have been called a monstrosity.
 
 </p><h4>Illustrations of the Action of Natural Selection, or the Survival of
 the Fittest</h4>
 
   <p>In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts,
 I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations.
 Let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals,
 securing some by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and
 let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from
 any change in the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had
 decreased in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf was
 hardest pressed for food. Under such circumstances the swiftest and
 slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving and so be
 preserved or selected,- provided always that they retained strength to
 master their prey at this or some other period of the year, when
 they were compelled to prey on other animals. I can see no more reason
 to doubt that this would be the result, than that man should be able
 to improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical
 selection, or by that kind of unconscious selection which follows from
 each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying
 the breed. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two
 varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United
 States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer,
 and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently
 attacks the shepherd's flocks.
   </p><p>It should be observed that, in the above illustration, I speak of
 the slimmest individual wolves, and not of any single
 strongly-marked variation having been preserved. In former editions of
 this work I sometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had
 frequently occurred. I saw the great importance of individual
 differences, and this led me fully to discuss the results of
 unconscious selection by man, which depends on the preservation of all
 the more or less valuable individuals, and on the destruction of the
 worst. I saw, also, that the preservation in a state of nature of
 any occasional deviation of structure, such as a monstrosity, would be
 a rare event; and that, if at first preserved, it would generally be
 lost by subsequent intercrossing with ordinary individuals.
 Nevertheless, until reading an able and valuable article in the
 North British Review (1867), I did not appreciate how rarely single
 variations, whether slight or strongly-marked, could be.
 perpetuated. The author takes the case of a pair of animals, producing
 during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of which, from various
 causes of destruction, only two on an average survive to procreate
 their kind. This is rather an extreme estimate for most of the
 higher animals, but by no means so for many of the lower organisms. He
 then shows that if a single individual were born, which varied in some
 manner, giving it twice as good a chance of life as that of the
 other individuals, yet the chances would be strongly against its
 survival. Supposing it to survive and to breed, and that half its
 young inherited the favourable variation; still, as the reviewer
 goes on to show, the young would have only a slightly better chance of
 surviving and breeding; and this chance would go on decreasing in
 the succeeding generations. The justice of these remarks cannot, I
 think, be disputed. If, for instance, a bird of some kind could
 procure its food more easily by having its beak curved, and if one
 were born with its beak strongly curved, and which consequently
 flourished, nevertheless there would be a very poor chance of this one
 individual perpetuating its kind to the exclusion of the common
 form; but there can hardly be a doubt, judging by what we see taking
 place under domestication, that this result would follow from the
 preservation during many generations of a large number of
 individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the
 destruction of a still larger number with the straightest beaks.
   </p><p>It should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly
 marked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual
 differences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being
 similarly acted on- of which fact numerous instances could be given
 with our domestic productions. In such cases, if the varying
 individual did not actually transmit to its offspring its
 newly-acquired character, it would undoubtedly transmit to them, as
 long as the existing conditions remained the same, a still stronger
 tendency to vary in the same manner. There can also be little doubt
 that the tendency to vary in the same manner has often been so
 strong that all the individuals of the same species have been
 similarly modified without the aid of any form of selection. Or only a
 third, fifth, or tenth part of the individuals may have been thus
 affected, of which fact several instances could be given. Thus Graba
 estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in the Faroe
 Islands consist of a variety so well marked, that it was formerly
 ranked as a distinct species under the name of Uria lacrymans. In
 cases of this kind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature,
 the original form would soon be supplanted by the modified form,
 through the survival of the fittest.
   </p><p>To the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all
 kinds, I shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most
 animals and plants keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly
 wander about; we see this even with migratory birds, which almost
 always return to the same spot. Consequently each newly-formed variety
 would generally be at first local, as seems to be the common rule with
 varieties in a state of nature; so that similarly modified individuals
 would soon exist in a small body together, and would often breed
 together. If the new variety were successful in its battle for life,
 it would slowly spread from a central district, competing with and
 conquering the unchanged individuals on the margins of an
 ever-increasing circle.
   </p><p>It may be worth while to give another and more complex
 illustration of the action of natural selection. Certain plants
 excrete sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating
 something injurious from the sap: this is effected, for instance, by
 glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminosae and at the
 backs of the leaves of the common laurel. This juice, though small
 in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but their visits do not in
 any way benefit the plant. Now, let us suppose that the juice or
 nectar was excreted from the inside of the flowers of a certain number
 of plants of any species. Insects in seeking the nectar would get
 dusted with pollen, and would often transport it from one flower to
 another. The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species
 would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, as can be fully
 proved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings which consequently would have
 the best chance of flourishing and surviving The plants which produced
 flowers with the largest glands or nectaries, excreting most nectar,
 would oftenest be visited by insects, and would oftenest be crossed;
 and so in the long run would gain the upper hand and form a local
 variety. The flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils
 placed, in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects
 which visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of
 the pollen, would likewise be favoured. We might have taken the case
 of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen
 instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole purpose of
 fertilisation, its destruction appears to be a simple loss to the
 plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally
 and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to
 flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the
 pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant to
 be thus robbed; and the individuals which produced more and more
 pollen, and had larger anthers, would be selected.
   </p><p>When our plant, by the above process long continued, had been
 rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally
 on their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and
 that they do this effectually, I could easily show by many striking
 facts. I will give only one, as likewise illustrating one step in
 the separation of the sexes of plants. Some holly-trees bear only male
 flowers, which have four stamens producing a rather small quantity
 of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only
 female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four stamens
 with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be
 detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male
 tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different
 branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception, there
 were a few pollen grains, and on some a profusion. As the wind had set
 for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could
 not thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and
 boisterous, and therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every
 female flower which I examined had been effectually fertilised by
 the bees, which had flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. But
 to return to our imaginary case: as soon as the plant had been
 rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly
 carried from flower to flower, another process might commence. No
 naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the
 "physiological division of labour"; hence we may believe that it would
 be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or
 on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on
 another plant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions
 of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs
 become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in
 ever so slight a degree under nature, then, as pollen is already
 carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete
 separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the
 principle of the division of labour, individuals with this tendency
 more and more increased, would be continually favoured or selected,
 until at last a complete separation of the sexes might be effected. It
 would take up too much space to show the various steps, through
 dimorphism and other means, by which the separation of the sexes in
 plants of various kinds is apparently now in progress; but I may add
 that some of the species of holly in North America, are, according
 to Asa Gray, in an exactly intermediate condition, or, as he expresses
 it, are more or less dioeciously polygamous.
   </p><p>Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose the
 plant, of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued
 selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended
 in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts showing
 how anxious bees are to save time: for instance, their habit of
 cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain
 flowers, which, with a very little more trouble, they can enter by the
 mouth. Bearing such facts in mind, it may be believed that under
 certain circumstances individual differences in the curvature or
 length of the proboscis, &amp;c., too slight to be appreciated by us,
 might profit a bee or other insect, so that certain individuals
 would be able to obtain their food more quickly than others; and
 thus the communities to which they belonged would flourish and throw
 off many swarms inheriting the same peculiarities. The tubes of the
 corolla of the common red and incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense
 and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length;
 yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate
 clover, but not out of the common red clover, which is visited by
 humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of red clover offer in vain an
 abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee. That this nectar
 is much liked by the hive-bee is certain; for I have repeatedly
 seen, but only in the autumn, many hive-bees sucking the flowers
 through holes bitten in the base of the tube by humble-bees. The
 difference in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover,
 which determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling;
 for I have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the
 flowers of the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are
 visited by many hive-bees. I do not know whether this statement is
 accurate; nor whether another published statement can be trusted,
 namely, that the Ligurian bee which is generally considered a mere
 variety of the common hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it, is
 able to reach and suck the nectar of the red clover. Thus, in a
 country where this kind of clover abounded, it might be a great
 advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently
 constructed proboscis. On the other hand, as the fertility of this
 clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the flowers, if humble-bees
 were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to
 the plant to have a, shorter or more deeply divided corolla, so that
 the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers. Thus I can
 understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either
 simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each
 other in the most perfect manner, by the continued preservation of all
 the individuals which presented slight deviations of structure
 mutually favourable to each other.
 
   </p><p>I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified
 in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which
 were first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on "the
 modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology"; but we now
 seldom hear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as
 trifling or insignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of
 the deepest valleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs.
 Natural selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of
 small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being;
 and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation
 of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection
 banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings,
 or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.
 
 </p><h4>On the Intercrossing of Individuals</h4>
 
   <p>I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals and
 plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two
 individuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not
 well-understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but in
 the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless
 there is reason to believe that with all hermaphrodites two
 individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the
 reproduction of their kind. This view was long ago doubtfully
 suggested by Sprengel, Knight and Kolreuter. We shall presently see
 its importance; but I must here treat the subject with extreme
 brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an ample discussion.
 All vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large groups of
 animals, pair for each birth. Modern research has much diminished
 the number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real hermaphrodites a
 large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly unite for
 reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there are
 many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair, and
 a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be
 asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever
 concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on
 details, I must trust to some general considerations alone.
   </p><p>In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and
 made so many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost
 universal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross
 between different varieties, or between individuals of the same
 variety but of another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the
 offspring; and on the other hand, that close interbreeding
 diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me
 to believe that it is a general law of nature that no organic being
 fertilises itself for a perpetuity of generations; but that a cross
 with another individual is occasionally- perhaps at long intervals
 of time- indispensable.
   </p><p>On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think,
 understand several large classes of facts, such as the following,
 which on any other view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how
 unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower,
 yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully
 exposed to the weather! If an occasional cross be indispensable,
 notwithstanding that the plant's own anthers and pistil stand so
 near each other as almost to insure self-fertilisation, the fullest
 freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will
 explain the above state of exposure of the organs. Many flowers, on
 the other hand, have their organs of fructification closely
 enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or pea-family; but these
 almost invariably present beautiful and curious adaptations in
 relation to the visits of insects. So necessary are the visits of bees
 to many papilionaceous flowers, that their fertility is greatly
 diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it is scarcely
 possible for insects to fly from flower and flower, and not to carry
 pollen from one to the other, to the great good of the plant.
 Insects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is sufficient to ensure
 fertilisation, just to touch with the same brush the anthers of one
 flower and then the stigma of another; but it must not be supposed
 that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct
 species; for if a plant's own pollen and that from another species are
 placed on the same stigma, the former is so prepotent that it
 invariably and completely destroys, as has been shown by Gartner,
 the influence of the foreign pollen.
   </p><p>When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil,
 or slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems
 adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful
 for this end: but the agency of insects is often required to cause the
 stamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case
 with the barberry; and in this very genus, which seems to have a
 special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that,
 if closely allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it
 is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they
 naturally cross. In numerous other cases, far from
 self-fertilisation being favoured, there are special contrivances
 which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own
 flower, as I could show from the works of Sprengel and others, as well
 as from my own observations: for instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there
 is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which all the
 infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined
 anthers of each flower, before the stigma of that individual flower is
 ready to receive them; and as this flower is never visited, at least
 in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed, though by placing
 pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I raise plenty of
 seedlings. Another species of Lobelia which is visited by bees,
 seeds freely in my garden. In very many other cases, though there is
 no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma receiving
 pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more recently
 Hildebrand, and others, have shown, and as I can confirm, either the
 anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the
 stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that
 these so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and
 must habitually be crossed. So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic
 and trimorphic plants previously alluded to. How strange are these
 facts! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same
 flower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of
 self-fertilisation, should be in so many cases mutually useless to
 each other! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an
 occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or
 indispensable!
   </p><p>If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some
 other plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority
 of the seedlings thus raised turn out, as I have found, mongrels:
 for instance, I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of
 different varieties growing near each other, and of these only 78 were
 true to their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true.
 Yet the pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its
 own six stamens but by those of the many other flowers on the same
 plant; and the pollen of each flower readily gets on its own stigma
 without insect agency; for I have found that plants carefully
 protected from insects produce the full number of pods. How, then,
 comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized?
 It must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent
 effect over the flower's own pollen; and that this is part of the
 general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct
 individuals of the same species. When distinct species are crossed the
 case is reversed, for a plant's own pollen is almost always
 prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall return
 in a future chapter.
   </p><p>In the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may
 be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and
 at most only from flower to flower on the same tree; and flowers on
 the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a
 limited sense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature
 has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency
 to bear flowers with separated sexes. When the sexes are separated,
 although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree,
 pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this
 will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from
 tree to tree. That trees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more
 often separated than other plants, I find to be the case in this
 country; and at my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New
 Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray those of the United States, and the result
 was as I anticipated. On the other hand, Dr. Hooker informs me that
 the rule does not hold good in Australia but if most of the Australian
 trees are dichogamous, the same result would follow as if they bore
 flowers with separated sexes. I have made these few remarks on trees
 simply to call attention to the subject.
   </p><p>Turning for a brief space to animals: various terrestrial species
 are hermaphrodites, such as the land-mollusca and earth-worms; but
 these all pair. As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal
 which can fertilise itself. This remarkable fact, which offers so
 strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, is intelligible on the view
 of an occasional cross being indispensable; for owing to the nature of
 the fertilising element there are no means, analogous to the action of
 insects and of the wind with plants, by which an occasional cross
 could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence
 of two individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many
 self-fertilizing hermaphrodites; but here the currents of water
 offer an obvious means for an occasional cross. As in the case of
 flowers, I have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the
 highest authorities, namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single
 hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly
 enclosed that access from without, and the occasional influence of a
 distinct individual, can be shown to be physically impossible.
 Cirripedes long appeared to me to present, under this point of view, a
 case of great difficulty; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate
 chance, to prove that two individuals, though both are
 self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.
   </p><p>It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, both
 with animals and plants, some species of the same family and even of
 the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in their whole
 organisation, are hermaphrodites, and some unisexual. But if, in fact,
 all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the difference
 between them and unisexual species is, as far as function is
 concerned, very small.
   </p><p>From these several considerations and from the many special facts
 which I have collected, but which I am unable here to give, it appears
 that with animals and plants an occasional intercross between distinct
 individuals is a very general, if not universal, law of nature.
 
 </p><h4>Circumstances favourable for the production of new forms through
 Natural Selection</h4>
 
   <p>This is an extremely intricate subject. A great amount of
 variability, under which term individual differences are always
 included, will evidently be favourable. A large number of individuals,
 by giving a better chance within any given period for the appearance
 of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of
 variability in each individual, and is, I believe, a highly
 important element of success. Though Nature grants long periods of
 time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an
 indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving to seize
 on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not
 become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its
 competitors, it will be exterminated. Unless favourable variations
 be inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing can be
 effected by natural selection. The tendency to reversion may often
 check or prevent the work; but as this tendency has not prevented
 man from forming by selection numerous domestic races, why should it
 prevail against natural selection?
   </p><p>In the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some
 definite object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to
 intercross, his work will completely fail. But when many men,
 without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of
 perfection, and all try to procure and breed from the best animals,
 improvement surely but slowly follows from this unconscious process of
 selection, notwithstanding that there is no separation of selected
 individuals. Thus it will be under nature; for within a confined area,
 with some place in the natural polity not perfectly occupied, all
 the individuals varying in the right direction, though in different
 degrees, will tend to be preserved. But if the area be large, its
 several districts will almost certainly present different conditions
 of life; and then, if the same species undergoes modification in
 different districts, the newly-formed varieties will intercross on the
 confines of each. But we shall see in the sixth chapter that
 intermediate varieties, inhabiting intermediate districts, will in the
 long run generally be supplanted by one of the adjoining varieties.
 Intercrossing will chiefly affect those animals which unite for each
 birth and wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate.
 Hence with animals of this nature, for instance, birds, varieties will
 generally be confined to separated countries; and this I find to be
 the case. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only
 occasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth,
 but which wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and
 improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might
 there maintain itself in a body and afterwards spread, so that the
 individuals of the new variety would chiefly cross together. On this
 principle, nurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large body of
 plants, as the chance of intercrossing is thus lessened.
   </p><p>Even with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not
 propagate rapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would
 always eliminate the effects of natural selection; for I can bring
 forward a considerable body of facts showing that within the same
 area, two varieties of the same animal may long remain distinct,
 from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly
 different seasons, or from the individuals of each variety
 preferring to pair together.
   </p><p>Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping the
 individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and
 uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more
 efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth; but, as
 already stated, we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses
 take place with all animals and plants. Even if these take place
 only at long intervals of time, the young thus produced will gain so
 much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued
 self-fertilisation, that they will have a better chance of surviving
 and propagating their kind; and thus in the long run the influence
 of crosses, even at rare intervals, will be great. With respect to
 organic beings extremely low in the scale, which do not propagate
 sexually, nor conjugate, and which cannot possibly intercross,
 uniformity of character can be retained by them under the same
 conditions of life, only through the principle of inheritance, and
 through natural selection which will destroy any individuals departing
 from the proper type. If the conditions of life change and the form
 undergoes modification, uniformity of character can be given to the
 modified offspring, solely by natural selection preserving similar
 favourable variations.
   </p><p>Isolation, also, is an important element in the modification of
 species through natural selection. In a confined or isolated area,
 if not very large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will
 generally be almost uniform; so that natural selection will tend to
 modify all the varying individuals of the same species in the same
 manner. Intercrossing with the inhabitants of the surrounding
 districts will, also, be thus prevented. Moritz Wagner has lately
 published an interesting essay on this subject, and has shown that the
 service rendered by isolation in preventing crosses between
 newly-formed varieties is probably greater even than I supposed. But
 from reasons already assigned I can by no means agree with this
 naturalist, that migration and isolation are necessary elements for
 the formation of new species. The importance of isolation is
 likewise great in preventing, after any physical change in the
 conditions, such as of climate, elevation of the land, &amp;c., the
 immigration of better adapted organisms; and thus new places in the
 natural economy of the district will be left open to be filled up by
 the modification of the old inhabitants. Lastly, isolation will give
 time for a new variety to be improved at a slow rate; and this may
 sometimes be of much importance. If, however, an isolated area be very
 small, either from being surrounded by barriers, or from having very
 peculiar physical conditions, the total number of the inhabitants will
 be small; and this will retard the production of new species through
 natural selection, by decreasing the chances of favourable
 variations arising.
   </p><p>The mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against
 natural selection. I state this because it has been erroneously
 asserted that the element of time has been assumed by me to play an
 all-important part in modifying species, as if all the forms of life
 were necessarily undergoing change through some innate law. Lapse of
 time is only so far important, and its importance in this respect is
 great, that it gives a better chance of beneficial variations
 arising and of their being selected, accumulated, and fixed. It
 likewise tends to increase the direct action of the physical
 conditions of life, in relation to the constitution of each organism.
   </p><p>If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at
 any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the
 number of species inhabiting it is small, as we shall see in our
 chapter on Geographical Distribution; yet of these species a very
 large proportion are endemic,- that is, have been produced there and
 nowhere else in the world. Hence an oceanic island at first sight
 seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new
 species. But we may thus deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether
 small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent has been
 most favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to
 make the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of
 doing.
   </p><p>Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new
 species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of
 area is still more important, especially for the production of species
 which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of
 spreading widely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will
 there be a better chance of favourable variations, arising from the
 large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but
 the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number
 of already existing species; and if some of these many species
 become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a
 corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form,
 also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread
 over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition
 with many other forms. Moreover, great areas, though now continuous,
 will often, owing to former oscillations of level, have existed in a
 broken condition; so that the good effects of isolation will
 generally, to a certain extent, have concurred. Finally, I conclude
 that, although small isolated areas have been in some respects
 highly favourable for the production of new species, yet that the
 course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large
 areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on
 large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors,
 will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to
 the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus
 play a more important part in the changing history of the organic
 world.
   </p><p>In accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some facts
 which will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical
 Distribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the smaller
 continent of Australia now yielding before those of the larger
 Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental
 productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on
 islands. On a small island, the race for life will have been less
 severe, and there will have been less modification and less
 extermination. Hence, we can understand how it is that the flora of
 Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles to a certain extent the
 extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All fresh-water basins, taken
 together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the
 land. Consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions
 will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been
 then more slowly produced, and old forms more slowly exterminated. And
 it is in fresh-water basins that we find seven genera of Ganoid
 fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we
 find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world as the
 Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren which, like fossils, connect to a
 certain extent orders at present widely sundered in the natural scale.
 These anomalous forms may be called living fossils; they have
 endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and
 from having been exposed to less varied, and therefore less severe,
 competition.
   </p><p>To sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits,
 the circumstances favourable and unfavourable for the reduction of new
 species through natural selection. I conclude that for terrestrial
 productions a large continental area, which has undergone many
 oscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the
 production of many new forms of life, fitted to endure for a long time
 and to spread widely. Whilst the area existed as a continent, the
 inhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will
 have been subjected to severe competition. When converted by
 subsidence into large separate islands, there will still have
 existed many individuals of the same species on each island:
 intercrossing on the confines of the range of each new species will
 have been checked: after physical changes of any kind, immigration
 will have been prevented, so that new places in the polity of each
 island will have had to be filled up by the modification of the old
 inhabitants; and time will have been allowed for the varieties in each
 to become well modified and perfected. When, by renewed elevation, the
 islands were reconverted into a continental area, there will again
 have been very severe competition: the most favoured or improved
 varieties will have been enabled to spread: there will have been
 much extinction of the less improved forms, and the relative
 proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the reunited
 continent will again have been changed; and again there will have been
 a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the
 inhabitants, and thus to produce new species.
   </p><p>That natural selection generally acts with extreme slowness I
 fully admit. It can act only when there are places in the natural
 polity of a district which can be better occupied by the
 modification of some of its existing inhabitants. The occurrence of
 such places will often depend on physical changes, which generally
 take place very slowly, and on the immigration of better adapted forms
 being prevented. As some few of the old inhabitants become modified,
 the mutual relations of others will often be disturbed; and this
 will create new places, ready to be filled up by better adapted forms,
 but all this will take place very slowly. Although the individuals
 of the same species differ in some slight degree from each other, it
 would often be long before differences of the right nature in
 various parts of the organisation might occur. The result would
 often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. Many will exclaim
 that these several causes are amply sufficient to neutralise the power
 of natural selection. I do not believe so. But I do believe that
 natural selection will generally act very slowly, only at long
 intervals of time, and only on a few of the inhabitants of the same
 region. I further believe that these slow, intermittent results accord
 well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the
 inhabitants of the world have changed.
   </p><p>Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do
 much by artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of
 change, to the beauty and complexity of the coadaptations between
 all organic beings, one with another and with their physical
 conditions of life, which may have been effected in the long course of
 time through nature's power of selection, that is by the survival of
 the fittest.
 
 </p><h4>Extinction caused by Natural Selection</h4>
 
   <p>This subject will he more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology;
 but it must here be alluded to from being intimately connected with
 natural selection. Natural selection acts solely through the
 preservation of variations in some way advantageous, which
 consequently endure. Owing to the high geometrical rate of increase of
 all organic beings, each area is already fully stocked with
 inhabitants; and it follows from this, that as the favoured forms
 increase in number, so, generally, will the less favoured decrease and
 become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to
 extinction. We can see that any form which is represented by few
 individuals will run a good chance of utter extinction, during great
 fluctuations in the nature of the seasons, or from a temporary
 increase in the number of its enemies. But we may go further than
 this; for, as new forms are produced, unless we admit that specific
 forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number, many old forms must
 become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely
 increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall presently attempt to
 show why it is that the number of species throughout the world has not
 become immeasurably great.
   </p><p>We have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals
 have the best chance of producing favourable variations within any
 given period. We have evidence of this, in the facts stated in the
 second chapter showing that it is the common and diffused or
 dominant species which offer the greatest number of recorded
 varieties. Hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or
 improved within any given period; they will consequently be beaten
 in the race for life by the modified and improved descendants of the
 commoner species.
   </p><p>From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows,
 that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural
 selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.
 The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing
 modification and improvement will naturally suffer most. And we have
 seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the
 most closely-allied forms,- varieties of the same species, and species
 of the same genus or of related genera,- which, from having nearly the
 same structure, constitution, and habits, generally come into the
 severest competition with each other; consequently, each new variety
 or species, during the progress of its formation, will generally press
 hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see
 the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated
 productions, through the selection of improved forms by man. Many
 curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of
 cattle, sheep, and other animals, and varieties of flowers, take the
 place of older and inferior kinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically
 known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the
 long-horns, and that these "were swept away by the shorthorns" (I
 quote the words of an agricultural writer) "as if by some murderous
 pestilence."
 
 </p><h4>Divergence of Character</h4>
 
   <p>The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high
 importance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In
 the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having
 somewhat of the character of species- as is shown by the hopeless
 doubts in many cases how to rank them- yet certainly differ far less
 from each other than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless,
 according to my view, varieties are species in the process of
 formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient species. How,
 then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented
 into the greater difference between species? That this does habitually
 happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species
 throughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas
 varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked
 species, present slight and ill-defined differences. Mere chance, as
 we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some character
 from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ
 from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree;
 but this alone would never account for so habitual and large a
 degree of difference as that between the species of the same genus.
   </p><p>As has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head
 from our domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous.
 It will be admitted that the production of races so different as
 short-horn and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, the several
 breeds of pigeons, &amp;c., could never have been effected by the mere
 chance accumulation of similar variations during many successive
 generations. In practice, a fancier is, for instance, struck by a
 pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by
 a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged
 principle that "fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard,
 but like extremes," they both go on (as has actually occurred with the
 sub-breeds of the tumbler-pigeon) choosing and breeding from birds
 with longer and longer beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks.
 Again, we may suppose that at an early period of history, the men of
 one nation or district required swifter horses, whilst those of
 another required stronger and bulkier horses. The early differences
 would be very slight; but, in the course of time from the continued
 selection of swifter horses in the one case, and of stronger ones in
 the other, the differences would become greater, and would be noted as
 forming two sub-breeds. Ultimately, after the lapse of centuries,
 these sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established
 and distinct breeds. As the differences became greater, the inferior
 animals with intermediate characters, being neither swift nor very
 strong, would not have been used for, breeding, and will thus have
 tended to disappear. Here, then, we see in man's productions the
 action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing
 differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and
 the breeds to diverge in character, both from each other and from
 their common parent.
   </p><p>But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in
 nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it
 was a long time before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that
 the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in
 structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better
 enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity
 of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.
   </p><p>We can clearly discern this in the case of animals with simple
 habits. Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the
 number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at
 its full average. If its natural power of increase be allowed to
 act, it can succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any
 change in conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on
 places at present occupied by other animals: some of them, for
 instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead or
 alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting
 water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more
 diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous
 animals become, the more places they will be enabled to occupy. What
 applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animals-
 that is, if they vary- for otherwise natural selection can effect
 nothing. So it will be with plants. It has been experimentally proved,
 that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass, and a
 similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses, a
 greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can be
 raised in the latter than in the former case. The same has been
 found to hold good when one variety and several mixed varieties of
 wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one
 species of grass were to go on varying, and the varieties were
 continually selected which differed from each other in the same
 manner, though in a very slight degree, as do the distinct species and
 genera of grasses, a greater number of individual plants of this
 species, including its modified descendants, would succeed in living
 on the same piece of ground. And we know that each species and each
 variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and is
 thus striving, as it may be said, to the utmost to increase in number.
 Consequently, in the course of many thousand generations, the most
 distinct varieties of any one species of grass would have the best
 chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of
 supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when
 rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species.
   </p><p>The truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be
 supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many
 natural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if
 freely open to immigration, and where the contest between individual
 and individual must be very severe, we always find great diversity
 in its inhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf,
 three feet by four in size, which had been exposed for many years to
 exactly the same conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and
 these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how
 much these plants differed from each other. So it is with the plants
 and insects on small and uniform islets: also in small ponds of
 fresh water. Farmers find that they can raise most food by a
 rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature
 follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation. Most of the
 animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground,
 could live on it (supposing its nature not to be in any way peculiar),
 and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there; but, it is
 seen, that where they come into the closest competition, the
 advantages of diversification of structure, with the accompanying
 differences of habit and constitution, determine that the inhabitants,
 which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a general rule,
 belong to what we call different genera and orders.
   </p><p>The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through
 man's agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the
 plants which would succeed in becoming naturalised in any land would
 generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are
 commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own
 country. It might also, perhaps, have been expected that naturalised
 plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted
 to certain stations in their new homes. But the case is very
 different; and Alph. de Candolle has well remarked, in his great and
 admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation, proportionally
 with the number of the native genera and species far more in new
 genera than in new species. To give a single instance: in the last
 edition of Dr. Asa Gray's Manual of the Flora of the Northern United
 States, 260 naturalized plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162
 genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly
 diversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large extent, from the
 indigenes, for out of the 162 naturalised genera, no less than 100
 genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional
 addition is made to the genera now living in the United States.
   </p><p>By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in any
 country struggled successfully with the indigenes and have there
 become naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of
 the natives would have to be modified, in order to gain an advantage
 over their compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification
 of structure, amounting to new generic differences, would be
 profitable to them.
   </p><p>The advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants
 of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the
 physiological division of labour in the organs of the same
 individual body- a subject so well elucidated by Milne Edwards. No
 physiologist doubts that a stomach adapted to digest vegetable
 matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these
 substances. So in the general economy of any land, the more widely and
 perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different
 habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable
 of there supporting themselves. A set of animals, with their
 organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set
 more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be doubted, for
 instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into
 groups differing but little from each other, and feebly
 representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our
 carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully
 compete with these well-developed orders. In the Australian mammals,
 we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage
 of development.
 
 
 </p><h4>The Probable Effects of the Action of Natural Selection through
 Divergence of Character and Extinction, on the Descendants of a Common
 Ancestor</h4>
 
   <p>After the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we
 may assume that the modified descendants of any one species will
 succeed so much the better as they become more diversified in
 structure, and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by
 other beings. Now let us see how this principle of benefit being
 derived from divergence of character, combined with the principles
 of natural selection and of extinction, tends to act.
   </p><p>The accompanying diagram (See diagram) will aid us in understanding
 this rather perplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a
 genus large in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble
 each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature,
 and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at
 unequal distances. I have said a large genus, because as we saw in the
 second chapter, on an average more species vary in large genera than
 in small genera; and the varying species of the large genera present a
 greater number of varieties. We have, also, seen that the species,
 which are the commonest and the most widely diffused, vary more than
 do the rare and restricted species. Let (A) be a common,
 widely-diffused, and varying species, belonging to a genus large in
 its own country. The branching and diverging lines of unequal
 lengths proceeding from (A), may represent its varying offspring.
 The variations are supposed to be extremely slight, but of the most
 diversified nature; they are not supposed all to appear
 simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time, nor are they
 an supposed to endure for equal periods. Only those variations which
 are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected.
 And here the importance of the principle of benefit derived from
 divergence of character comes in; for this will generally lead to
 the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer
 lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection. When a
 line reaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a
 small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to
 have been accumulated to form it into a fairly well-marked variety,
 such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work.
   </p><p>The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may
 represent each a thousand or more generations. After a thousand
 generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly
 well-marked varieties, namely a1 and m1. These two varieties will
 generally still be exposed to the same conditions which made their
 parents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself
 hereditary; consequently they will likewise tend to vary, and commonly
 in nearly the same manner as did their parents. Moreover, these two
 varieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit
 those advantages which made their parent (A) more numerous than most
 of the other inhabitants of the same country; they will also partake
 of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the
 parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. And all
 these circumstances are favourable to the production of new varieties.
   </p><p>If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of
 their variations will generally be preserved during the next
 thousand generations. And after this interval, variety a1 is
 supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing
 to the principle of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety
 a1. Variety m1 is supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m2
 and s2, differing from each other, and more considerably from their
 common parent (A). We may continue the process by similar steps for
 any length of time; some of the varieties, after each thousand
 generations, producing only a single variety, but in a more and more
 modified condition, some producing two or three varieties, and some
 failing to produce any. Thus the varieties or modified descendants of
 the common parent (A), will generally go on increasing in number and
 diverging in character. In the diagram the process is represented up
 to the ten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified
 form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation.
   </p><p>But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever
 goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in
 itself made somewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it
 is far more probable that each form remains for long periods
 unaltered, and then again undergoes modification. Nor do I suppose
 that the most divergent varieties are invariably preserved: a medium
 form may often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one
 modified descendant; for natural selection will always act according
 to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not
 perfectly occupied by other beings; and this will depend on infinitely
 complex relations. But as a general rule, the more diversified in
 structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered, the
 more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their
 modified progeny will increase. In our diagram the line of succession
 is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the
 successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be
 recorded as varieties. But these breaks are imaginary, and might have
 been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to allow the
 accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation.
   </p><p>As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused
 species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the
 same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they
 will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in
 character: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent
 branches proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later
 and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is
 probable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and
 less improved branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of
 the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some
 cases no doubt the process of modification will be confined to a
 single line of descent and the number of modified descendants will not
 be increased; although the amount of divergent modification may have
 been augmented. This case would be represented in the diagram, if all
 the lines proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a1 to
 a10. In the same way the English race-horse and English pointer have
 apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their
 original stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or
 races.
   </p><p>After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have
 produced three forms, a10, f10, and m10 which, from having diverged in
 character during the successive generations, will have come to
 differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from
 their common parent. If we suppose the amount of change between each
 horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three
 forms may still be only well-marked varieties; but we have only to
 suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous
 or greater in amount, to convert these three forms into well-defined
 or at least into doubtful species. Thus the diagram illustrates the
 steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are
 increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. By
 continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (as
 shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get
 eight species, marked by the letters between a14 and m14, all
 descended from (A). Thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and
 genera are formed.
   </p><p>In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would
 vary. In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has
 produced, by analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either
 two well-marked varieties (w10 and z10) or two species, according to
 the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal
 lines. After fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by
 the letters n14 to z14, are supposed to have. been produced. In any
 genus, the species which are already very different in character
 from each other, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of
 modified descendants; for these will have the best chance of seizing
 on new and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in
 the diagram I have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly
 extreme species (I), as those which have largely varied, and have
 given rise to new varieties and species. The other nine species
 (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may for long but
 unequal periods continue to transmit unaltered descendants; and this
 is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines unequally prolonged
 upwards.
   </p><p>But during the process of modification, represented in the
 diagram, another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will
 have played an important part. As in each fully stocked country
 natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some
 advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a
 constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to
 supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors
 and their original progenitor. For it should be remembered that the
 competition will generally be most severe between those forms which
 are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution, and
 structure. Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and
 later states, that is between the less and more improved states of the
 same species, as well as the original parent-species itself, will
 generally tend to become extinct. So it probably will be with many
 whole collateral lines of descent, which will be conquered by later
 and improved lines. If, however, the modified offspring of a species
 get into some distinct country, or become quickly adapted to some
 quite new station, in which offspring and progenitor do not come
 into competition, both may continue to exist.
   </p><p>If, then, our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount
 of modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have
 become extinct, being replaced by eight new species (a14 to m14); and
 species (I) will be replaced by six (n14 to z14) new species.
   </p><p>But we may go further than this. The original species of our genus
 were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so
 generally the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to
 B, C, and D, than to the other species; and species (I) more to G,
 H, K, L, than to the others. These two species (A) and (I) were also
 supposed to be very common and widely diffused species, so that they
 must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species
 of the genus. Their modified descendants, fourteen in number at the
 fourteen-thousandth generation will probably have inherited some of
 the same advantages: they have also been modified and improved in a
 diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become
 adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their
 country. It seems, therefore, extremely probable that they will have
 taken the places of, and thus exterminated not only their parents
 (A) and (I), but likewise some of the original species which were most
 nearly related to their parents. Hence very few of the original
 species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth
 generation. We may suppose that only one, (F), of the two species (E
 and F) which were least closely related to the other nine original
 species, has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent.
   </p><p>The new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven
 species, will now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent
 tendency of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in
 character between species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that
 between the most distinct of the original eleven species. The new
 species, moreover, will be allied to each other in a widely different
 manner. Of the eight descendants from (A) the three marked a14, q14,
 p14, will be nearly related from having recently branched off from
 a10; b14, and f14, from having diverged at an earlier period from a1,
 will be in some degree distinct from the three first-named species;
 and lastly, o14, e14, and m14, will be nearly related one to the
 other, but, from having diverged at the first commencement of the
 process of modification, will be widely different from the other five
 species, and may constitute a sub-genus or a distinct genus.
   </p><p>The six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or genera. But
 as the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly
 at the extreme end of the original genus, the six descendants from (I)
 will, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight
 descendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have
 gone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species,
 also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the
 original species (A) and (I), have all become, excepting (F), extinct,
 and have left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from
 (I), and the eight descendants from (A), will have to be ranked as
 very distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families.
   </p><p>Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by
 descent with modification, from two or more species of the same genus.
 And the two or more parent-species are supposed to be descended from
 some one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram, this is
 indicated by the broken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging
 in sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point
 represents a species, the supposed progenitor of our several new
 sub-genera and genera.
   </p><p>It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the
 new species F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in
 character, but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or
 altered only in a slight degree. In this case, its affinities to the
 other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature.
 Being descended from a form which stood between the parent-species (A)
 and (I), now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some
 degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from
 these two species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in
 character from the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will
 not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of
 the two groups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases
 before his mind.
   </p><p>In the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to
 represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or
 more generations; it may also represent a section of the successive
 strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. We shall,
 when we come to our chapter on Geology, have to refer again to this
 subject, and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light
 on the affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging
 to the same orders, families, or genera, with those now living, yet
 are often, in some degree, intermediate in character between
 existing groups; and we can understand this fact, for the extinct
 species lived at various remote epochs when the branching lines of
 descent had diverged less.
   </p><p>I see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now
 explained, to the formation of genera alone. If, in the diagram, we
 suppose the amount of change, represented by each successive group of
 diverging lines to be great, the forms marked a14 to p14, those marked
 b14 and f14, and those marked o14 to m14, will form three very
 distinct genera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended
 from (I), differing widely from the descendants of (A). These two
 groups of genera will thus form two distinct families, or orders,
 according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be
 represented in the diagram. And the two new families, or orders, are
 descended from two species of the original genus, and these are
 supposed to be descended from some still more ancient and unknown
 form.
   </p><p>We have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the
 larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species.
 This, indeed, might have been expected; for, as natural selection acts
 through one form having some advantage over other forms in the
 struggle for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already
 have some advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its
 species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in
 common. Hence, the struggle for the production of new and modified
 descendants will mainly lie between the larger groups which are all
 trying to increase in number. One large group will slowly conquer
 another large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of
 further variation and improvement. Within the same large group, the
 later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and
 seizing on many new places in the polity of Nature, will constantly
 tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups.
 Small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally disappear. Looking
 to the future, we can predict that the groups of organic beings
 which are now large and triumphant, and which are least broken up,
 that is, which have as yet suffered least extinction, will, for a long
 period, continue to increase. But which groups will ultimately
 prevail, no man can predict; for we know that many groups formerly
 most extensively developed, have now become extinct. Looking still
 more remotely to the future, we may predict that, owing to the
 continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a multitude of
 smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no modified
 descendants; and consequently that, of the species living at any one
 period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote
 futurity. I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on
 Classification, but I may add that as, according to this view,
 extremely few of the more ancient species have transmitted descendants
 to the present day, and, as all the descendants of the same species
 form a class, we can understand how it is that there exist so few
 classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
 Although few of the most ancient species have left modified
 descendants' yet, at remote geological periods, the earth may have
 been almost as well peopled with species of many genera, families,
 orders, and classes, as at the present time.
 
 </p><h4>On the Degree to which Organisation tends to advance</h4>
 
   <p>Natural Selection acts exclusively by the preservation and
 accumulation of variations, which are beneficial under the organic and
 inorganic conditions to which each creature is exposed at all
 periods of life. The ultimate result is that each creature tends to
 become more and more improved in relation to its conditions. This
 improvement inevitable leads to the gradual advancement of the
 organisation of the greater number of living beings throughout the
 world. But here we enter on a very intricate subject, for
 naturalists have not defined to each other's satisfaction what is
 meant by an advance in organisation. Amongst the vertebrata the degree
 of intellect and an approach in structure to man clearly come into
 play. It might be thought that the amount of change which the
 various parts and organs pass through in their development from the
 embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but
 there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which
 several parts of the structure become less perfect, so that the mature
 animal cannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer's standard
 seems the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the amount of
 differentiation of the parts of the same organic being, in the adult
 state as I should be inclined to add, and their specialisation for
 different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would express it, the
 completeness of the division of physiological labour. But we shall see
 how obscure this subject is if we look, for instance, to fishes,
 amongst which some naturalists rank those as highest which, like the
 sharks, approach nearest to amphibians; whilst other naturalists
 rank the common bony or teleostean fishes as the highest, inasmuch
 as they are most strictly fish-like and differ most from the other
 vertebrate classes. We see still more plainly the obscurity of the
 subject by turning to plants, amongst which the standard of
 intellect is of course quite excluded; and here some botanists rank
 those plants as highest which have every organ, as sepals, petals,
 stamens, and pistils, fully developed in each flower; whereas other
 botanists, probably with more truth, look at the plants which have
 their several organs much modified and reduced in number as the
 highest.
   </p><p>If we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of
 differentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being
 when adult (and this will include the advancement of the brain for
 intellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads towards this
 standard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of
 organs, inasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better,
 is an advantage to each being; and hence the accumulation of
 variations tending towards specialisation is within the scope of
 natural selection. On the other hand, we can see, bearing in mind that
 all organic beings are striving to increase at a high ratio and to
 seize on every unoccupied or less well occupied place in the economy
 of nature, that it is quite possible for natural selection gradually
 to fit a being to a situation in which several organs would be
 superfluous or useless: in such cases there would be retrogression
 in the scale of organisation. Whether organisation on the whole has
 actually advanced from the remotest geological periods to the
 present day will be more conveniently discussed in our chapter on
 Geological Succession.
   </p><p>But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to
 rise in the scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude
 of the lowest forms still exist; and how is it that in each great
 class some forms are far more highly developed than others? Why have
 not the more highly developed forms everywhere supplanted and
 exterminated the lower? Lamarck, who believed in an innate and
 inevitable tendency towards perfection in all organic beings, seems to
 have felt this difficulty so strongly, that he was led to suppose that
 new and simple forms are continually being produced by spontaneous
 generation. Science has not as yet proved the truth of this belief,
 whatever the future may reveal. On our theory the continued
 existence of lowly organisms offers no difficulty; for natural
 selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily
 include progressive development- it only takes advantage of such
 variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its
 complex relations of life. And it may be asked what advantage, as
 far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian animalcule- to an
 intestinal worm- or even to an earthworm, to be highly organised. If
 it were no advantage, these forms would be left, by natural selection,
 unimproved or but little improved, and might remain for indefinite
 ages in their present lowly condition. And geology tells us that
 some of the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, have
 remained for an enormous period in nearly their present state. But
 to suppose that most of the many now existing low forms have not in
 the least advanced since the first dawn of life would be extremely
 rash; for every naturalist who has dissected some of the beings now
 ranked as very low in the scale, must have been struck with their
 really wondrous and beautiful organisation.
   </p><p>Nearly the same remarks are applicable if we look to the different
 grades of organisation within the same great group; for instance, in
 the vertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and fish- amongst
 mammalia, to the coexistence of man and the Ornithorhynchus- amongst
 fishes, to the co-existence of the shark and the lancelet (Amphioxus),
 which latter fish in the extreme simplicity of its structure
 approaches the invertebrate classes. But mammals and fish hardly
 come into competition with each other; the advancement of the whole
 class of mammals, or of certain members in this class, to the
 highest grade would not lead to their taking the place of fishes.
 Physiologists believe that the brain must be bathed by warm blood to
 be highly active, and this requires aerial respiration; so that
 warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting the water lie under a
 disadvantage in having to come continually to the surface to
 breathe. With fishes, members of the shark family would not tend to
 supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I hear from Fritz
 Muller, has as sole companion and competitor on the barren sandy shore
 of South Brazil, an anomalous annelid. The three lowest orders of
 mammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and rodents, co-exist in
 South America in the same region with numerous monkeys, and probably
 interfere little with each other. Although organisation, on the whole,
 may have advanced and be still advancing throughout the world, yet the
 scale will always present many degrees of perfection; for the high
 advancement of certain whole classes, or of certain members of each
 class, does not at all necessarily lead to the extinction of those
 groups with which they do not enter into close competition. In some
 cases, as we shall hereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have
 been preserved to the present day, from inhabiting confined or
 peculiar stations, where they have been subjected to less severe
 competition, and where their scanty numbers have retarded the chance
 of favourable variations arising.
   </p><p>Finally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist
 throughout the world, from various causes. In some cases variations or
 individual differences of a favourable nature may never have arisen
 for natural selection to act on and accumulate. In no case,
 probably, has time sufficed for the utmost possible amount of
 development. In some few cases there has been what we must call
 retrogression of organisation. But the main cause lies in the fact
 that under very simple conditions of life a high organisation would be
 of no service,- possibly would be of actual disservice, as being of
 a more delicate nature, and more liable to be put out of order and
 injured.
   </p><p>Looking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we
 may believe, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked,
 could the first steps in the advancement or differentiation of parts
 have arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that, as soon
 as simple unicellular organism came by growth or division to be
 compounded of several cells, or became attached to any supporting
 surface, his law "that homologous units of any order become
 differentiated in proportion as their relations to incident forces"
 would come into action. But as we have no facts to guide us,
 speculation on the subject is almost useless. It is, however, an error
 to suppose that there would be no struggle for existence, and,
 consequently, no natural selection, until many forms had been
 produced: variations in a single species inhabiting an isolated
 station might be beneficial, and thus the whole mass of individuals
 might be modified, or two distinct forms might arise. But, as I
 remarked towards the close of the Introduction, no one ought to feel
 surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the origin of
 species, if we make due allowance for our profound ignorance on the
 mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present
 time, and still more so during past ages.
 
 </p><h4>Convergence of Character</h4>
 
   <p>Mr. H. C. Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of
 divergence of character (in which, however, he apparently believes)
 and that convergence, as it may be called, has likewise played a part.
 If two species, belonging to two distinct though allied genera, had
 both produced a large number of new and divergent forms, it is
 conceivable that these might approach each other so closely that
 they would have all to be classed under the same genus; and thus the
 descendants of two distinct genera would converge into one. But it
 would in most cases be extremely rash to attribute to convergence a
 close and general similarity of structure in the modified
 descendants of widely distinct forms. The shape of a crystal is
 determined solely by the molecular forces, and it is not surprising
 that dissimilar substances should sometimes assume the same form;
 but with organic beings we should bear in mind that the form of each
 depends on an infinitude of complex relations, namely on the
 variations which have arisen, these being due to causes far too
 intricate to be followed out,- on the nature of the variations which
 have been preserved or selected, and this depends on the surrounding
 physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on the surrounding
 organisms with which each being has come into competition,- and
 lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating element) from
 innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms
 determined through equally complex relations. It is incredible that
 the descendants of two organisms, which had originally differed in a
 marked manner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead
 to a near approach to identity throughout their whole organisation. If
 this had occurred, we should meet with the same form, independently of
 genetic connection, recurring in widely separated geological
 formations; and the balance of evidence is opposed to any such an
 admission.
   </p><p>Mr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of natural
 selection, together with divergence of character, would tend to make
 an indefinite number of specific forms. As far as mere inorganic
 conditions are concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number
 of species would soon become adapted to all considerable diversities
 of heat, moisture, &amp;c.; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of
 organic beings are more important; and as the number of species in any
 country goes on increasing, the organic conditions of life must become
 more and more complex. Consequently there seems at first sight no
 limit to the amount of profitable diversification of structure, and
 therefore no limit to the number of species which might be produced.
 We do not know that even the most prolific area is fully stocked
 with specific forms: at the Cape of Good Hope and in Australia,
 which support such an astonishing number of species, many European
 plants have become naturalised. But geology shows us, that from an
 early part of the tertiary period the number of species of shells, and
 that from the middle part of this same period the number of mammals,
 has not greatly or at all increased. What then checks an indefinite
 increase in the number of species? The amount of life (I do not mean
 the number of specific forms) supported on an area must have a
 limit, depending so largely as it does on physical conditions;
 therefore, if an area be inhabited by very many species, each or
 nearly each species will be represented by few individuals; and such
 species will be liable to extermination from accidental fluctuations
 in the nature of the seasons or in the number of their enemies. The
 process of extermination in such cases would be rapid, whereas the
 production of new species must always be slow. Imagine the extreme
 case of as many species as individuals in England, and the first
 severe winter or very dry summer would exterminate thousands on
 thousands of species. Rare species, and each species will become
 rare if the number of species in any country becomes indefinitely
 increased, will, on the principle often explained, present within a
 given period few favourable variations; consequently, the process of
 giving birth to new specific forms would thus be retarded. When any
 species becomes very rare, close interbreeding will help to
 exterminate it; authors have thought that this comes into play in
 accounting for the deterioration of the aurochs in Lithuania, of red
 deer in Scotland, and of bears in Norway, &amp;e. Lastly, and this I am
 inclined to think is the most important element, a dominant species,
 which has already beaten many competitors in its own home, will tend
 to spread and supplant many others. Alph. de Candolle has shown that
 those species which spread widely, tend generally to spread very
 widely; consequently, they will tend to supplant and exterminate
 several species in several areas, and thus cheek the inordinate
 increase of specific forms throughout the world. Dr. Hooker has
 recently shown that in the S.E. corner of Australia, where,
 apparently, there are many invaders from different quarters of the
 globe, the endemic Australian species have been greatly reduced in
 number. How much weight to attribute to these several considerations I
 will not pretend to say; but conjointly they must limit in each
 country the tendency to an indefinite augmentation of specific forms.
 
 </p><h4>Summary of Chapter</h4>
 
   <p>If under changing conditions of life organic beings present
 individual differences in almost every part of their structure, and
 this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical
 rate of increase, a severe struggle for life at some age, season, or
 year, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the
 infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each
 other and to their conditions of life, causing an infinite diversity
 in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, it
 would be a most extraordinary fact if no variations had ever
 occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in the same manner as
 so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations
 useful to any organic being ever do occur, assuredly individuals
 thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the
 struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance, these
 will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle
 of preservation, or the survival of the fittest, I have called Natural
 Selection. It leads to the improvement of each creature in relation to
 its organic and inorganic conditions of life, and consequently, in
 most cases, to what must be regarded as an advance in organisation.
 Nevertheless, low and simple forms will long endure if well fitted for
 their simple conditions of life.
   </p><p>Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited
 at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily
 as the adult. Amongst many animals, sexual selection will have given
 its aid to ordinary selection, by assuring to the most vigorous and
 best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual
 selection will also give characters useful to the males alone, in
 their struggles or rivalry with other males; and these characters will
 be transmitted to one sex or to both sexes, according to the form of
 inheritance which prevails.
   </p><p>Whether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the
 various forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must
 be judged by the general tenor and balance of evidence given in the
 following chapters. But we have already seen how it entails
 extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world's
 history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection also leads to
 divergence of character; for the more organic beings diverge in
 structure, habits, and constitution, by so much the more can a large
 number be supported on the area,- of which we see proof by looking
 to the inhabitants of any small spot, and to the productions
 naturalised in foreign lands. Therefore, during the modification of
 the descendants of any one species, and during the incessant
 struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more diversified
 the descendants become, the better will be their chance of success
 in the battle for life. Thus the small differences distinguishing
 varieties of the same species, steadily tend to increase, till they
 equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or
 even of distinct genera.
   </p><p>We have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused and
 widely-ranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each
 class, which vary most; and these tend to transmit to their modified
 offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their
 own countries. Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads
 to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved
 and intermediate forms of life. On these principles, the nature of the
 affinities, and the generally well-defined distinctions between the
 innumerable organic beings in each class throughout the world, may
 be explained. It is a truly wonderful fact- the wonder of which we are
 apt to overlook from familiarity- that all animals and all plants
 throughout all time and space should be related to each other in
 groups, subordinate to groups, in the manner which we everywhere
 behold- namely, varieties of the same species most closely related,
 species of the same genus less closely and unequally related,
 forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much
 less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming
 sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes and classes. The several
 subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file, but
 seem clustered round points, and these round other points, and so on
 in almost endless cycles. If species had been independently created,
 no explanation would have been possible of this kind of
 classification; but it is explained through inheritance and the
 complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and
 divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.
   </p><p>The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes
 been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks
 the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species;
 and those produced during former years may represent the long
 succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the
 growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop
 and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as
 species and groups of species have at all times overmastered other
 species in the great battle for life. The limbs, divided into great
 branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves
 once, when the tree was young, budding twigs, and this connection of
 the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent
 the classification of all extinct and living species in groups
 subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the
 tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great
 branches, yet survive and bear the other branches; so with the species
 which lived during long-past geological periods very few have left
 living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree,
 many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these fallen
 branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders,
 families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and
 which are known to us only in a fossil state. As we here and there see
 a thin straggling branch springing from, a fork low down in a tree,
 and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its
 summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or
 Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two
 large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal
 competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise
 by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and
 overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe
 it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and
 broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with
 its everbranching and beautiful ramifications.
