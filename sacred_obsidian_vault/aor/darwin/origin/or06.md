 <h3>Chapter VI: Difficulties of the Theory</h3>
 
   <p>LONG before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a
 crowd of difficulties will have occurred to him. Some of them are so
 serious that to this day I can hardly reflect on them without being in
 some degree staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater
 number are only apparent, and those that are real are not, I think,
 fatal to the theory.
   </p><p>These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following
 heads:- First, why, if species have descended from other species by
 fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional
 forms? Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species
 being, as we see them, well defined?
   </p><p>Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the
 structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the
 modification of some other animal with widely different habits and
 structure? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the
 one hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of a
 giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, an
 organ so wonderful as the eye?
   </p><p>Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural
 selection? What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to
 make cells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries of
 profound mathematicians?
   </p><p>Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being
 sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are
 crossed, their fertility is unimpaired?
   </p><p>The two first heads will here be discussed; some miscellaneous
 objections in the following chapter; Instinct and Hybridism in the two
 succeeding chapters.
 </p><h4>On the Absence or Rarity of Transitional Varieties.</h4>
 As natural
 selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications,
 each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place
 of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent-form
 and other less favoured forms with which it comes into competition.
 Thus extinction and natural selection go hand in hand. Hence, if we
 look at each species as descended from some unknown form, both the
 parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been
 exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of
 the new form.
   <p>But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have
 existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in
 the crust of the earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this
 question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the Geological
 Record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly
 lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally
 supposed. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural
 connections have been imperfectly made, and only at long intervals
 of time.
   </p><p>But it may be urged that when several closely-allied species inhabit
 the same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time many
 transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from
 north to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive
 intervals with closely allied or representative species, evidently
 filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land.
 These representative species often meet and interlock; and as the
 one becomes rarer and rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent,
 till the one replaces the other. But if we compare these species where
 they intermingle, they are generally as absolutely distinct from
 each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from
 the metropolis inhabited by each. By my theory these allied species
 are descended from a common parent; and during the process of
 modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its
 own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original
 parent-form and all the transitional varieties between its past and
 present states. Hence we ought not to expect at the present time to
 meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region, though
 they must have existed there, and may be embedded there in a fossil
 condition. But in the intermediate region, having intermediate
 conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking
 intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite
 confounded me. But I think it can be in large part explained.
   </p><p>In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring,
 because an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous
 during a long period. Geology would lead us to believe that most
 continents have been broken up into islands even during the later
 tertiary periods; and in such islands distinct species might have been
 separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties
 existing in the intermediate zones. By changes in the form of the land
 and of climate, marine areas now continuous must often have existed
 within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition
 than at present. But I will pass over this way of escaping from the
 difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly defined species have
 been formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do not doubt that
 the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous, has played an
 important part in the formation of new species, more especially with
 freely-crossing and wandering animals.
   </p><p>In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide
 area, we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large
 territory, then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the
 confines, and finally disappearing. Hence the neutral territory
 between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison
 with the territory proper to each. We see the same fact in ascending
 mountains, and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph.
 de Candolle has observed, a common alpine species disappears. The same
 fact has been noticed by E. Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea
 with the dredge. To those who look at climate and the physical
 conditions of life as the all-important elements of distribution,
 these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth
 graduate away insensibly. But when we bear in mind that almost every
 species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in
 numbers, were it not for other competing species; that nearly all
 either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short, that each
 organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most
 important manner to other organic beings,- we see that the range of
 the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on
 insensibly changing physical conditions, but in a large part on the
 presence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is
 destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these
 species are already defined objects, not blending one into another
 by insensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as
 does on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined.
 Moreover, each species on the confines of its range, where it exists
 in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of its
 enemies or of its prey, or in the nature of the seasons, be
 extremely liable to utter extermination; and thus its geographical
 range will come to be still more sharply defined.
   </p><p>As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous
 area, are generally distributed in such a manner that each has a
 wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between
 them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as
 varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will
 probably apply to both; and if we take a varying species inhabiting
 a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large
 areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The
 intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers
 from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as I
 can make out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of
 nature. I have met with striking instances of the rule in the case
 of varieties intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus
 Balanus. And it would appear from information given me by Mr.
 Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston, that generally, when
 varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are much
 rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. Now, if we may
 trust these facts and inferences, and conclude that varieties
 linking two other varieties together generally have existed in
 lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we can
 understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very
 long periods:- why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and
 disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked
 together.
   </p><p>For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already
 remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing
 in large numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form
 would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely-allied forms
 existing on both sides of it. But it is a far more important
 consideration, that during the process of further modification, by
 which two varieties are supposed to be converted and perfected into
 two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers, from
 inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the
 intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow
 and intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger numbers will
 have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting further
 favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than will the
 rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the more common
 forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less
 common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.
 It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the
 common species in each country, as shown in the second chapter,
 presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked varieties
 than do the rarer species. I may illustrate what I mean by supposing
 three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive
 mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract;
 and a third to the wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants
 are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks
 by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of
 the great holders on the mountains or on the plains, improving their
 breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow,
 hilly tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed
 will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the
 two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will come
 into close contact with each other, without the interposition of the
 supplanted, intermediate hill variety.
   </p><p>To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably
 well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an
 inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links; first, because
 new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a slow process,
 and natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual
 differences or variations occur, and until a place in the natural
 polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of
 some one or more of its inhabitants. And such new places will depend
 on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of new
 inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on
 some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new
 forms thus produced, and the old ones acting and reacting on each
 other. So that, in any one region and at any one time, we ought to see
 only a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in
 some degree permanent; and this assuredly we do see.
   </p><p>Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the
 recent period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more
 especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander
 much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to
 rank as representative species. In this, case, intermediate
 varieties between the several representative species and their
 common parent, must formerly have existed within each isolated portion
 of the land, but these links during the process of natural selection
 will have been supplanted and exterminated, so that they will no
 longer be found in a living state.
   </p><p>Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different
 portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will,
 it is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones,
 but they will generally have had a short duration. For these
 intermediate varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely
 from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or
 representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist
 in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which
 they tend to connect. From this cause alone the intermediate varieties
 will be liable to accidental extermination; and during the process
 of further modification through natural selection, they will almost
 certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect;
 for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate,
 present more varieties, and thus be further improved through natural
 selection and gain further advantages.
   </p><p>Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory
 be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together
 all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed; but
 the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so
 often remarked, to exterminate the parent-forms and the intermediate
 links. Consequently evidence of their former existence could be
 found only amongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall
 attempt to show in a future chapter, in an extremely imperfect and
 intermittent record.
   </p><p>On the Origin and Transitions of Organic Beings with peculiar Habits
 and Structure.- It has been asked by the opponents of such views as
 I hold, how, for instance, could a land carnivorous animal have been
 converted into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in
 its transitional state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that
 there now exist carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate
 grades from strictly terrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each exists
 by a struggle for life, it is clear that each must be well adapted
 to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vision of North America,
 which has webbed feet, and which resembles an otter in its fur,
 short legs, and form of tail. During the summer this animal dives
 for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen
 waters, and preys, like other pole-cats, on mice and land animals.
 If a different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an
 insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a
 flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult to answer.
 Yet I think such difficulties have little weight.
   </p><p>Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage,
 for, out of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can only
 give one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in
 allied species; and of diversified habits, either constant or
 occasional, in the same species. And it seems to me that nothing
 less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the
 difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat.
   </p><p>Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation
 from animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from
 others, as Sir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part
 of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather
 full, to the so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have
 their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of
 skin, which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the
 air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that
 each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own
 country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, to
 collect food more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, to
 lessen the danger from occasional falls. But it does not follow from
 this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is
 possible to conceive under all possible conditions. Let the climate
 and vegetation change, let other competing rodents or new beasts of
 prey immigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would
 lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would
 decrease in numbers or become exterminated, unless they also become
 modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner.
 Therefore, I can see no difficulty, more especially under changing
 conditions of life, in the continued preservation of individuals
 with fuller and fuller flank membranes, each modification being,
 useful, each being propagated, until, by the accumulated effects of
 this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel
 was produced.
   </p><p>Now look at the Galeopithecus or so-called flying lemur, which
 formerly was ranked amongst bats, but is now believed to belong to the
 Insectivora. An extremely wide flank membrane stretches from the
 corners of the jaw to the tail, and includes the limbs with the
 elongated fingers. This flank-membrane is furnished with an extensor
 muscle. Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding
 through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other
 Insectivora, yet there is no difficulty in supposing that such links
 formerly existed, and that each was developed in the same manner as
 with the less perfectly gliding squirrels; each grade of structure
 having been useful to its possessor. Nor can I see any insuperable
 difficulty in further believing that the membrane connected fingers
 and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus might have been greatly lengthened
 by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs of flight are
 concerned, would have converted the animal into a bat. In certain bats
 in which the wing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the
 tail and includes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus
 originally fitted for gliding through the air rather than for flight.
   </p><p>If about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who would
 have ventured to surmise that birds might have existed which used
 their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck
 (Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and as front-legs on
 the land, like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and
 functionally for no purpose, like the Apteryx? Yet the structure of
 each of these birds is good for it, under the conditions of life to
 which it is exposed, for each has to live by a struggle; but it is not
 necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions. It must
 not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of
 wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the result of
 disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired their
 perfect power of flight; but they serve to show what diversified means
 of transition are at least possible.
   </p><p>Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the
 Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing
 that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most
 diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable
 that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising
 and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been
 modified into perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who
 would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they
 had been the inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their
 incipient organs of flight exclusively, as far as we know, to escape
 being devoured by other fish?
   </p><p>When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit,
 as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals
 displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have
 survived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by
 their successors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through
 natural selection. Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional
 states between structures fitted for very different habits of life
 will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers
 and under many subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary
 illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes
 capable of true flight would have been developed under many
 subordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on
 the land and in the water, until their organs of flight had come to
 a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them a decided
 advantage over other animals in the battle for life. Hence the
 chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in
 a fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed in
 lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed
 structures.
   </p><p>I will now give two or three instances both of diversified and of
 changed habits in the individuals of the same species. In either
 case it would be easy for natural selection to adapt the structure
 of the animal to its changed habits, or exclusively to one of its
 several habits. It is, however, difficult to decide, and immaterial
 for us, whether habits generally change first and structure
 afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure lead to
 changed habits; both probably often occurring almost simultaneously.
 Of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of
 the many British insects which now feed on exotic plants, or
 exclusively on artificial substances. Of diversified habits
 innumerable instances could be given: I have often watched a tyrant
 flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in South America, hovering over
 one spot and then proceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at
 other times standing stationary on the margin of water, and then
 dashing into it like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own country the
 larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches, almost
 like a creeper; it sometimes, like a shrike, kills small birds by
 blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard it hammering
 the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a
 nuthatch. In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne
 swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, almost
 like a whale, insects in the water.
   </p><p>As we sometimes see individuals following habits different from
 those proper to their species and to the other species of the same
 genus, we might expect that such individuals would occasionally give
 rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure
 either slightly or considerably modified from that of their type.
 And such instances occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of
 adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and
 seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America
 there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others with
 elongated wings which chase insects on the wing. On the plains of La
 Plata, where hardly a tree grows, there is a woodpecker (Colaptes
 campestris) which has two toes before and two behind, a long pointed
 tongue, pointed tail-feathers, sufficiently stiff to support the
 bird in a vertical position on a post, but not so stiff as in the
 typical woodpeckers, and a straight strong beak. The beak, however, is
 not so straight or so strong as in the typical woodpeckers, but it
 is strong enough to bore into wood. Hence this Colaptes in all the
 essential parts of its structure is a woodpecker. Even in such
 trifling characters as the colouring, the harsh tone of the voice, and
 undulatory flight, its close blood-relationship to our common
 woodpecker is plainly declared; yet, as I can assert, not only from my
 own observation, but from those of the accurate Azara, in certain
 large districts it does not climb trees, and it makes its nest in
 holes in banks! In certain other districts, however, this same
 woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states, frequents trees, and bores holes
 in the trunk for its nest. I may mention as another illustration of
 the varied habits of this genus, that a Mexican Colaptes has been
 described by De Saussure as boring holes into hard wood in order to
 lay up a store of acorns.
   </p><p>Petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, but in the quiet
 sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general
 habits, in its astonishing power of diving, in its manner of
 swimming and of flying when made to take flight, would be mistaken
 by any one for an auk or a grebe; nevertheless it is essentially a
 petrel, but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified in
 relation to its new habits of life; whereas the woodpecker of La Plata
 has had its structure only slightly modified. In the case of the
 waterouzel, the acutest observer by examining its dead body would
 never have suspected its subaquatic habits; yet this bird, which is
 allied to the thrush family, subsists by diving- using its wings under
 water, and grasping stones with its feet. All the members of the great
 order of hymenopterous insects are terrestrial excepting the genus
 Proctotrupes, which Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in
 its habits; it often enters the water and dives about by the use not
 of its legs but of its wings, and remains as long as four hours
 beneath the surface; yet it exhibits no modification in structure in
 accordance with its abnormal habits.
   </p><p>He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it,
 must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal
 having habits and structure not in agreement. What can be plainer than
 that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? Yet
 there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely go near the
 water; and no one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which
 has all its four toes webbed, alight on the surface of the ocean. On
 the other hand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their
 toes are only bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the
 long toes, not furnished with membrane, of the Grallatores are
 formed for walking over swamps and floating plants?- the water-hen and
 landrail are members of this order, yet the first is nearly as aquatic
 as the coot, and the second nearly as terrestrial as the quail or
 partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given, habits
 have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed
 feet of the upland goose may be said to have become almost rudimentary
 in function, though not in structure. In the frigate-bird, the
 deeply scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has
 begun to change.
   </p><p>He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation may
 say, that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being
 of one type to take the place of one belonging to another type; but
 this seems to me only re-stating the fact in dignified language. He
 who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of
 natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is
 constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one
 being varies ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus
 gains an advantage over some other inhabitant of the same country,
 it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different
 that may be from its own place. Hence it will cause him no surprise
 that there should be geese and frigatebirds with webbed feet, living
 on the dry land and rarely alighting on the water; that there should
 be long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows instead of in swamps;
 that there should be woodpeckers where hardly a tree grows; that there
 should be diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera, and petrels with the
 habits of auks.
 
 </p><h4>Organs of extreme Perfection and Complication</h4>
 
   <p>To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for
 adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different
 amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic
 aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
 freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said
 that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common
 sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of
 Vox populi, vox Dei, as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted
 in science. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple
 and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist,
 each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if
 further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is
 likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to
 any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of
 believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural
 selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be
 considered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be
 sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself
 originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms, in
 which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it
 does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their
 sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed
 with this special sensibility.
   </p><p>In searching for the gradations through which an orgain in any
 species has been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal
 progenitors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced
 to look to other species and genera of the same group, that is to
 the collateral descendants from the same parent-form, in order to
 see what gradations are possible, and for the chance of some
 gradations having been transmitted in an unaltered or little altered
 condition. But the state of the same organ in distinct classes may
 incidentally throw light on the steps by which it has been perfected.
   </p><p>The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic
 nerve, surrounded by pigment-cells, and covered by translucent skin,
 but without any lens or other refractive body. We may, however,
 according to M. Jourdain, descend even a step lower and find
 aggregates of pigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision,
 without any nerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the
 above simple nature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only
 to distinguish light from darkness. In certain star-fishes, small
 depressions in the layer of pigment which surrounds the nerve are
 filled, as described by the author just quoted, with transparent
 gelatinous matter, projecting with a convex surface, like the cornea
 in the higher animals. He suggests that this serves not to form an
 image, but only to concentrate the luminous rays and render their
 perception more easy. In this concentration of the rays we gain the
 first and by far the most important step towards the formation of a
 true, picture-forming eye; for we have only to place the naked
 extremity of the optic nerve, which in some of the lower animals
 lies deeply buried in the body, and in some near the surface, at the
 right distance from the concentrating apparatus, and an image will
 be formed on it.
   </p><p>In the great class of the Articulata, we may start from an optic
 nerve simply coated with pigment, the latter sometimes forming a
 sort of pupil, but destitute of a lens or other optical contrivance.
 With insects it is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea of
 their great compound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones include
 curiously modified nervous filaments. But these organs in the
 Articulata are so much diversified that Muller formerly made three
 main classes with seven subdivisions, besides a fourth main class of
 aggregated simple eyes.
   </p><p>When we reflect on these facts, here given much too briefly, with
 respect to the wide, diversified, and graduated range of structure
 in the eyes of the lower animals; and when we bear in mind how small
 the number of all living forms must be in comparison with those
 which have become extinct, the difficulty ceases to be very great in
 believing that natural selection may have converted the simple
 apparatus of an optic nerve, coated with pigment and invested by
 transparent membrane, into an optical instrument as perfect as is
 possessed by any member of the articulate class.
   </p><p>He who will go thus far, ought not to hesitate to go one step
 further, if he finds on finishing this volume that large bodies of
 facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of
 modification through natural selection; he ought to admit that a
 structure even as perfect as an eagle's eye might thus be formed,
 although in this case he does not know the transitional states. It has
 been objected that in order to modify the eye and still preserve it as
 a perfect instrument, many changes would have to be effected
 simultaneously, which, it is assumed, could not be done through
 natural selection; but as I have attempted to show in my work on the
 variation of domestic animals, it is not necessary to suppose that the
 modifications were all simultaneous, if they were extremely slight and
 gradual. Different kinds of modification would, also, serve for the
 same general purpose: as Mr. Wallace has remarked, "if a lens has
 too short or too long a focus, it may be amended either by an
 alteration of curvature, or an alteration of density; if the curvature
 be irregular, and the rays do not converge to a point, then any
 increased regularity of curvature will be an improvement. So the
 contraction of the iris and the muscular movements of the eye are
 neither of them essential to vision, but only improvements which might
 have been added and perfected at any stage of the construction of
 the instrument." Within the highest division of the animal kingdom,
 namely, the Vertebrata, we can start from an eye so simple, that it
 consists, as in the lancelet, of a little sack of transparent skin,
 furnished with a nerve and lined with pigment, but destitute of any
 other apparatus. In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has remarked, "the
 range of gradations of dioptric structures is very great." It is a
 significant fact that even in man, according to the high authority
 of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in the embryo
 by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like fold of
 the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic sub-cutaneous
 tissue. To arrive, however, at a just conclusion regarding the
 formation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not absolutely
 perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer
 the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be
 surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural
 selection to so startling a length.
   </p><p>It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope.
 We know that this instrument has been perfected by the
 long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we
 naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous
 process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right
 to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those
 of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we
 ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with
 spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath,
 and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing
 slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different
 densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each
 other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form.
 Further we must suppose that there is a power, represented by
 natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always intently
 watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and
 carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any
 way or in any degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must
 suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the
 million; each to be preserved until a better one is produced, and then
 the old ones to be all destroyed. In living bodies, variation will
 cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost
 infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill
 each improvement. Let this process go on for millions of years; and
 during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may
 we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed
 as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to
 those of man?
 
 </p><h4>Modes of Transition</h4>
 
   <p>If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which
 could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight
 modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find
 out no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know
 the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated
 species, round which, according to the theory, there has been much
 extinction. Or again, if we take an organ common to all the members of
 a class, for in this latter case the organ must have been originally
 formed at a remote period, since which all the many members of the
 class have been developed; and in order to discover the early
 transitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have
 to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.
   </p><p>We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could
 not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous
 cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ
 performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the
 larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobitis the alimentary canal
 respires, digests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the animal may be
 turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the
 stomach respire. In such cases natural selection might specialise,
 if any advantage were thus gained, the whole or part of an organ,
 which had previously performed two functions, for one function
 alone, and thus by insensible steps greatly change its nature. Many
 plants are known which regularly produce at the same time
 differently constructed flowers; and if such plants were to produce
 one kind alone, a great change would be effected with comparative
 suddenness in the character of the species. It is, however, probable
 that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same plant were
 originally differentiated by finely graduated steps, which may still
 be followed in some few cases.
   </p><p>Again, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very
 different forms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the
 same function, and this is an extremely important means of transition:
 to give one instance,- there are fish with gills or branchiae that
 breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they
 breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ being
 divided by highly vascular partitions and having a ductus
 pneumaticus for the supply of air. To give another instance from the
 vegetable kingdom: plants climb by three distinct means, by spirally
 twining, by clasping a support with their sensitive tendrils, and by
 the emission of aerial rootlets; these three means are usually found
 in distinct groups, but some few species exhibit two of the means,
 or even all three, combined in the same individual. In all such
 cases one of the two organs might readily be modified and perfected so
 as to perform all the work, being aided during the progress of
 modification by the other organ; and then this other organ might be
 modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be wholly
 obliterated.
   </p><p>The illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because
 it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally
 constructed for one purpose, namely, flotation, may be converted
 into one for a widely different purpose, namely, respiration. The
 swimbladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the
 auditory organs of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the
 swimbladder is homologous, or "ideally similar" in position and
 structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there
 is no reason to doubt that the swimbladder has actually been converted
 into lungs, or an organ used exclusively for respiration.
   </p><p>According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate
 animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an
 ancient and unknown prototype, which was furnished with a floating
 apparatus or swimbladder. We can thus, as I infer from Owen's
 interesting description of these parts, understand the strange fact
 that every particle of food and drink &amp; which we swallow has to pass
 over the orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the
 lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the
 glottis is closed. In the higher Vertebrate the branchiae have
 wholly disappeared- but in the embryo the slits on the sides of the
 neck and the loop-like course of the arteries still mark their
 former position. But it is conceivable that the now utterly lost
 branchiae might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for
 some distinct purpose: for instance, Landois has shown that the
 wings of insects are developed from the tracheae; it is therefore
 highly probable that in this great class organs which once served
 for respiration have been actually converted into organs for flight.
   </p><p>In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear
 in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another,
 that I will give another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two
 minute folds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve,
 through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they
 are hatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the
 whole surface of the body and of the sack, together with the small
 frena, serving for respiration. The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes,
 on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at
 the bottom of the sack, within the well-enclosed shell; but they have,
 in the same relative position with the frena, large, much-folded
 membranes, which freely communicate with the circulatory lacunae of
 the sack and body, and which have been considered by all naturalists
 to act as branchiae. Now I think no one will dispute that the
 ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the
 branchiae of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each
 other. Therefore it need not be doubted that the two little folds of
 skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise,
 very slightly aided in the act of respiration, have been gradually
 converted by natural selection into branchiae simply through an
 increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive
 glands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they
 have suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who
 would ever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family
 had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being
 washed out of the sack?
   </p><p>There is another possible mode of transition, namely, through the
 acceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction. This has
 lately been insisted on by Prof. Cope and others in the United States.
 It is now known that some animals are capable of reproduction at a
 very early age, before they have acquired their perfect characters;
 and if this power became thoroughly well developed in a species, it
 seems probable that the adult stage of development would sooner or
 later be lost; and in this case, especially if the larva differed much
 from the mature form, the character of the species would be greatly
 changed and degraded. Again, not a few animals, after arriving at
 maturity, go on changing in character during nearly their whole lives.
 With mammals, for instance, the form of the skull is often much
 altered with age, of which Dr. Murie has given some striking instances
 with seals; every one knows how the horns of stags become more and
 more branched, and the plumes of some birds become more finely
 developed, as they grow older. Prof. Cope states that the teeth of
 certain lizards change much in shape with advancing years; with
 crustaceans not only many trivial, but some important parts assume a
 new character, as recorded by Fritz Muller, after maturity. In all
 such cases,- and many could be given,- if the age for reproduction
 were retarded, the character of the species, at least in its adult
 state, would be modified; nor is it improbable that the previous and
 earlier stages of development would in some cases be hurried through
 and finally lost. Whether species have often or ever been modified
 through this comparatively sudden mode of transition, I can form no
 opinion; but if this has occurred, it is probable that the differences
 between the young and the mature, and between the mature and the
 old, were primordially acquired by graduated steps.
 
 </p><h4>Special Difficulties of the Theory Of Natural Selection</h4>
 
   <p>Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any
 organ could not have been produced by successive, small,
 transitional gradations, yet undoubtedly serious cases of difficulty
 occur.
   </p><p>One of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are often
 differently constructed from either the males or fertile females;
 but this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric
 organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty; for it is
 impossible to conceive by, what steps these wondrous organs have
 been produced. But this is not surprising, for we do not even know
 of what use they are. In the Gymnotus and torpedo they no doubt
 serve as powerful means of defence, and perhaps for securing prey; yet
 in the ray, as observed by Matteucci, an analogous organ in the tail
 manifests but little electricity, even when the animal is greatly
 irritated; so little, that it can hardly be of any use for the above
 purposes. Moreover, in the ray, besides the organ just referred to,
 there is, as Dr. R. McDonnell has shown, another organ near the
 head, not known to be electrical, but which appears to be the real
 homologue of the electric battery in the torpedo. It is generally
 admitted that there exists between these organs and ordinary muscle
 a close analogy, in intimate structure, in the distribution of the
 nerves, and in the manner in which they are acted on by various
 reagents. It should, also, be especially observed that muscular
 contraction is accompanied by an electrical discharge; and, as Dr.
 Radcliffe insists, "in the electrical apparatus of the torpedo
 during rest, there would seem be a charge in every respect like that
 which is met with in muscle and nerve during rest, and the discharge
 of the torpedo, instead of being peculiar, may be only another form of
 the discharge which depends upon the action of muscle and motor
 nerve." Beyond this we cannot at present go in the way of explanation;
 but as we know so little about the uses of these organs, and as we
 know nothing about the habits and structure of the progenitors of
 the existing electric fishes, it would be extremely bold to maintain
 that no serviceable transitions are possible by which these organs
 might have been gradually developed.
   </p><p>These organs appear at first to offer another and far more serious
 difficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish, of which
 several are widely remote in their affinities. When the same organ
 is found in several members of the same class, especially if in
 members having very different habits of life, we may generally
 attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and
 its absence in some of the members to loss through disuse or natural
 selection. So that, if the electric organs had been inherited from
 some one ancient progenitor, we might have expected that all
 electric fishes would have been specially related to each other; but
 this is far from the case. Nor does geology at all lead to the
 belief that most fishes formerly possessed electric organs, which
 their modified descendants have now lost. But when we look at the
 subject more closely, we find in the several fishes provided with
 electric organs, that these are situated in different parts of the
 body,- that they differ in construction, as in the arrangement of
 the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process or means by which
 the electricity is excited- and lastly, in being supplied with
 nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is perhaps the most
 important of all the differences. Hence in the several fishes
 furnished with electric organs, these cannot be considered as
 homologous, but only as analogous in function. Consequently there is
 no reason to suppose that they have been inherited from a common
 progenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely
 resembled each other in all respects. Thus the difficulty of an organ,
 apparently the same, arising in several remotely allied species,
 disappears, leaving only the lesser yet still great difficulty;
 namely, by what graduated steps these organs have been developed in
 each separate group of fishes.
   </p><p>The luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to
 widely different families, and which are situated in different parts
 of the body, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty
 almost exactly parallel with that of the electric organs. Other
 similar cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious
 contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with
 an adhesive gland, is apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias,-
 genera almost as remote as is possible amongst flowering plants; but
 here again the parts are not homologous. In all cases of beings, far
 removed from each other in the scale of organisation, which are
 furnished with similar and peculiar organs, it will be found that
 although the general appearance and function of the organs may be
 the same, yet fundamental differences between them can always be
 detected. For instance, the eyes of cephalopods or cuttle-fish and
 of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully alike; and in such widely
 sundered groups no part of this resemblance can be due to
 inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has advanced this
 case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to see the force of
 his argument. An organ for vision must be formed of transparent
 tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing an image at
 the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this superficial resemblance,
 there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of cuttle-fish
 and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen's admirable
 memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda. It is impossible for me
 here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points of
 difference. The crystalline lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists of
 two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having
 a very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the
 vertebrata. The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion
 of the elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included
 within the membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as
 different as it is possible to conceive, and so in other points. Hence
 it is not a little difficult to decide how far even the same terms
 ought to be employed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and
 Vertebrata. It is, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye
 in either case could have been developed through the natural selection
 of successive slight variations; but if this be admitted in the one
 case, it is clearly possible in the other; and fundamental differences
 of structure in the visual organs of two groups might have been
 anticipated, in accordance with this view of their manner of
 formation. As two men have sometimes independently hit on the same
 invention, so in the several foregoing cases it appears that natural
 selection, working for the good of each being, and taking advantage of
 all favourable variations, has produced similar organs, as far as
 function is concerned, in distinct organic beings, which owe none of
 their structure in common to inheritance from a common progenitor.
   </p><p>Fritz Muller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in this
 volume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line of
 argument. Several families of crustaceans include a few species,
 possessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the
 water. In two of these families, which were more especially examined
 by Muller and which are nearly related to each other, the species
 agree most closely in all important characters; namely, in their sense
 organs, circulating system, in the position of the tufts of hair
 within their complex stomachs, and lastly in the whole structure of
 the water-breathing branchiae, even to the microscopical hooks by
 which they are cleansed. Hence it might have been expected that in the
 few species belonging to both families which live on the land, the
 equally important air-breathing apparatus would have been the same;
 for why should this one apparatus, given for the same purpose, have
 been made to differ, whilst all the other important organs were
 closely similar or rather identical?
   </p><p>Fritz Muller argues that this close similarity in so many points
 of structure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be
 accounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor. But as the vast
 majority of the species in the above two families, as well as most
 other crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in
 the highest degree, that their common progenitor should have been
 adapted for breathing air was thus led carefully to examine the
 apparatus in the air-breathing species; and he found it to differ in
 each in several important points, as in the position of the
 orifices, in the manner in which they are opened and closed, and in
 some accessory details. Now such differences are intelligible, and
 might even have been expected, on the supposition that species
 belonging to distinct families had slowly become adapted to live
 more and more out of water, and to breathe the air. For these species,
 from belonging to distinct families, would have differed to a
 certain extent, and in accordance with the principle that the nature
 of each variation depends on two factors, viz., the nature of the
 organism and that of the surrounding conditions, their variability
 assuredly would not have been exactly the same. Consequently natural
 selection would have had different materials or variations to work on,
 in order to arrive at the same functional result; and the structures
 thus acquired would almost necessarily have differed. On the
 hypothesis of separate acts of creation the whole case remains
 unintelligible. This line of argument seems to have had great weight
 in leading Fritz Muller to accept the views maintained by me in this
 volume.
   </p><p>Another distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparide, has
 argued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result. He
 shows that there are parasitic mites (Acaridae), belonging to distinct
 sub-families and families, which are furnished with hair-claspers.
 These organs must have been independently developed, as they could not
 have been inherited from a common progenitor; and in the several
 groups they are formed by the modification of the fore-legs,- of the
 hind-legs,- of the maxillae or lips,- and of appendages on the under
 side of the hind part of the body.
 
   </p><p>In the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same
 function performed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied, by
 organs in appearance, though not in development, closely similar. On
 the other hand, it is a common rule throughout nature that the same
 end should be gained, even sometimes in the case of closely-related
 beings, by the most diversified means. How differently constructed
 is the feathered wing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a
 bat; and still more so the four wings of a butterfly, the two wings of
 a fly, and the two wings with the elytra of a beetle. Bivalve shells
 are made to open and shut, but on what a number of patterns is the
 hinge constructed,- from the long row of neatly interlocking teeth
 in a Nucula to the simple ligament of a Mussel! Seeds are disseminated
 by their minuteness,- by their capsule being converted into a light
 balloon-like envelope,- by being embedded in pulp or flesh, formed
 of the most diverse parts, and rendered nutritious, as well as
 conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and be devoured by birds,- by
 having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and serrated arms, so as to
 adhere to the fur of quadrupeds,- and by being furnished with wings
 and plumes, as different in shape as they are elegant in structure, so
 as to be wafted by every breeze. I will give one other instance; for
 this subject of the same end being gained by the most diversified
 means well deserves attention. Some authors maintain that organic
 beings have been formed in many ways for the sake of mere variety,
 almost like toys in a shop, but such a view of nature is incredible.
 With plants having separated sexes, and with those in which, though
 hermaphrodites, the pollen does not spontaneously fall on the
 stigma, some aid is necessary for their fertilisation. With several
 kinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are light and
 incoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance on to the
 stigma; and this is the simplest plan which can well be conceived.
 An almost equally simple, though very different, plan occurs in many
 plants in which a symmetrical flower secretes a few drops of nectar,
 and is consequently visited by insects; and these carry the pollen
 from the anthers to the stigma.
   </p><p>From this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible number
 of contrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in
 essentially the same manner, but entailing changes in every part of
 the flower. The nectar may be stored in variously shaped
 receptacles, with the stamens and pistils modified in many ways,
 sometimes forming trap-like contrivances, and sometimes capable of
 neatly adapted movements through irritability or elasticity. From such
 structures we may advance till we come to such a case of extraordinary
 adaptation as that lately described by Dr. Cruger in the Coryanthes.
 This orchid has part of its labellum or lower lip hollowed out into
 a great bucket, into which drops of almost pure water continually fall
 from two secreting horns which stand above it; and when the bucket
 is half full, the water overflows by a spout on one side. The basal
 part of the labellum stands over the bucket, and is itself hollowed
 out into a sort of chamber with two lateral entrances; within this
 chamber there are curious fleshy ridges. The most ingenious man, if he
 had not witnessed what takes place, could never have imagined what
 purpose all these parts serve. But Dr. Cruger saw crowds of large
 humble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order
 to suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above
 the bucket; in doing this they frequently pushed each other into the
 bucket, and their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but
 were compelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or
 overflow. Dr. Cruger saw a "continual procession" of bees thus
 crawling out of their involuntary bath. The passage is narrow, and
 is roofed over by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out,
 first rubs its back against the viscid stigma and then against the
 viscid glands of the pollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus glued
 to the back of the be which first happens to crawl out through the
 passage of a lately expanded flower, and are thus carried away. Dr.
 Cruger sent me a flower in spirits of wine, with a bee which he had
 killed before it had quite crawled out with a pollen-mass still
 fastened to its back. When the bee, thus provided, flies to another
 flower, or to the same flower a second time, and is pushed by its
 comrades into the bucket and then crawls out by the passage, the
 pollen-mass necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid
 stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is fertilised. Now at last
 we see the full use of every part of the flower, of the
 water-secreting horns, of the bucket half full of water, which
 prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out
 through the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid
 pollen-masses and the viscid stigma.
   </p><p>The construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid,
 namely the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same
 end; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, like those of
 the Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they
 inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have
 called it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a
 sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly
 ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot
 forth, like an arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its
 viscid extremity to the back of the bee. The pollen-mass of the male
 plant (for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to
 the flower of the female plant where it is brought into contact with
 the stigma, which is viscid enough to break certain elastic threads,
 and retaining the pollen, fertilisation is effected.
   </p><p>How, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other
 instances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and the
 multifarious means for gaining the same end. The answer no doubt is,
 as already remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ
 from each other in some slight degree, the variability will not be
 of the same exact nature, and consequently the results obtained
 through natural selection for the same general purpose will not be the
 same. We should also bear in mind that every highly developed organism
 has passed through many changes; and that each modified structure
 tends to be inherited, so that each modification will not readily be
 quite lost, but may be again and again further altered. Hence the
 structure of each part of each species, for whatever purpose it may
 serve, is the sum of many inherited changes, through which the species
 has passed during its successive adaptations to changed habits and
 conditions of life.
   </p><p>Finally then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to
 conjecture by what transitions organs have arrived at their present
 state; yet, considering how small the proportion of living and known
 forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how rarely
 an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to
 lead. It certainly is true, that new organs appearing as if created
 for some special purpose, rarely or never appear in any being;- as
 indeed is shown by that old, but somewhat exaggerated, canon in
 natural history of "Natura non facit saltum." We meet with this
 admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or
 as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, Nature is prodigal in variety,
 but niggard in innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should
 there be so much variety and so little real novelty? Why should all
 the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have
 been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so commonly
 linked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature take a
 sudden leap from structure to structure? On the theory of natural
 selection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for natural
 selection acts only by taking advantage of slight successive
 variations; she can never take a great and sudden leap, but must
 advance by short and sure, though slow steps.
 
 </p><h4>Organs of little apparent Importance, as affected by Natural
 Selection</h4>
 
   <p>As natural selection acts by life and death,- by the survival of the
 fittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted
 individuals,- I have sometimes felt great difficulty in
 understanding the origin or formation of parts of little importance;
 almost as great, though of a very different kind, as in the case of
 the most perfect and complex organs.
   </p><p>In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the
 whole economy of any one organic being, to say what slight
 modifications would be of importance or not. In a former chapter I
 have given instances of very trifling characters, such as the down
 on fruit and the colour of its flesh, the colour of the skin and
 hair of quadrupeds, which, from being correlated with constitutional
 differences or from determining the attacks of insects, might
 assuredly be acted on by natural selection. The tail of the giraffe
 looks like an artificially constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at
 first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present
 purpose by successive slight modifications, each better and better
 fitted, for so trifling an object as to drive away flies; yet we
 should pause before being too positive even in this case, for we
 know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals
 in South America absolutely depend on their power of resisting the
 attacks of insects: so that individuals which could by any means
 defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range
 into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is not that
 the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare
 cases) by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their
 strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not
 so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape
 from beasts of prey.
   </p><p>Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been
 of high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been
 slowly perfected at a former period, have been transmitted to existing
 species in nearly the same state, although now of very slight use; but
 any actually injurious deviations in their structure would of course
 have been checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an
 organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general
 presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in
 their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their aquatic origin,
 may perhaps be thus accounted for. A well-developed tail having been
 formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked
 in for all sorts of purposes,- as a fly-flapper, an organ of
 prehension, or as an aid in turning, as in the case of the dog, though
 the aid in this latter respect must be slight, for the hare, with
 hardly any tail, can double still more quickly.
   </p><p>In the second place, we may easily err in attributing importance
 to characters, and in believing that they have been developed
 through natural selection. We must by no means overlook the effects of
 the definite action of changed conditions of life,- of so-called
 spontaneous variations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate
 degree on the nature of the conditions,- of the tendency to
 reversion to long-lost characters,- of the complex laws of growth,
 such as of correlation, compensation, of the pressure of one part on
 another, &amp;c.,- and finally of sexual selection, by which characters of
 use to one sex are often gained and then transmitted more or less
 perfectly to the other sex, though of no use to this sex. But
 structures thus indirectly gained, although at first of no advantage
 to a species, may subsequently have been taken advantage of by its
 modified descendants, under new conditions of life and newly
 acquired habits.
   </p><p>If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that
 there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have
 thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal
 this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that
 it was a character of importance, and had been acquired through
 natural selection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part
 due to sexual selection. A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago
 climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed
 hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance,
 no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly
 similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, and which, as
 there is reason to believe from the distribution of the
 thorn-bearing species in Africa and South America, serve as a
 defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes on the palm may
 at first have been developed for this object, and subsequently have
 been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as it underwent
 further modification and became a climber. The naked skin on the
 head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation for
 wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to
 the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious
 in drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head
 of the clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the
 skull? of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation
 for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be
 indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of
 young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg,
 we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth,
 and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher
 animals.
   </p><p>We are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation
 or individual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of
 this by reflecting on the differences between the breeds of our
 domesticated animals in different countries,- more especially in the
 less civilised countries where there has been but little methodical
 selection. Animals kept by savages in different countries often have
 to struggle for their own subsistence, and are exposed to a certain
 extent to natural selection, and individuals with slightly different
 constitutions would succeed best under different climates. With cattle
 susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as
 is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that even colour
 would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. Some
 observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of
 the hair, and that with the hair the horns are correlated. Mountain
 breeds always differ from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country
 would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and
 possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then by the law of
 homologous variation, the front limbs and the head would probably be
 affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might affect by pressure
 the shape of certain parts of the young in the womb. The laborious
 breathing necessary in high regions tends, as we have good reason to
 believe, to increase the size of the chest; and again correlation
 would come into play. The effects of lessened exercise together with
 abundant food on the whole organisation is probably still more
 important; and this, as H. von Nathusius has lately shown in his
 excellent treatise, is apparently one chief cause of the great
 modification which the breeds of swine have undergone. But we are
 far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the
 several known and unknown causes of variation; and I have made these
 remarks only to show that, if we are unable to account for the
 characteristic differences of our several domestic breeds, which
 nevertheless are generally admitted to have arisen through ordinary
 generation from one or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too
 much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight
 analogous differences between true species.
 
 </p><h4>Utilitarian Doctrine, how far true: Beauty, how acquired.</h4>
 
   <p>The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest
 lately made by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that
 every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its
 possessor. They believe that many structures have been created for the
 sake of beauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point
 is beyond the scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere
 variety, a view already discussed. Such doctrines, if true, would be
 absolutely fatal to my theory. I fully admit that many structures
 are now of no direct use to their possessors, and may never have
 been of any use to their progenitors; but this does not prove that
 they were formed solely for beauty or variety. No doubt the definite
 action of changed conditions, and the various causes of modifications,
 lately specified, have all produced an effect, probably a great
 effect, independently of any advantage thus gained. But a still more
 important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation
 of every living creature is due to inheritance; and consequently,
 though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature,
 many structures have now no very close and direct relation to
 present habits of life. Thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed
 feet of the upland goose or of the frigate-bird are of special use
 to these birds; we cannot believe that the similar bones in the arm of
 the monkey, in the fore-leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat,
 and in the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals.
 We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But webbed
 feet no doubt were as useful to the progenitor of the upland goose and
 of the frigate-bird, as they now are to the most aquatic of living
 birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal did not
 possess a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or
 grasping; but we may further venture to believe that the several bones
 in the limbs of the monkey, horse, and bat, were originally developed,
 on the principle of utility, probably through the reduction of more
 numerous bones in the fin of some ancient fish-like progenitor of
 the whole class. It is scarcely possible to decide how much
 allowance ought to be made for such causes of change, as the
 definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous
 variations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important
 exceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living
 creature either now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect
 use to its possessor.
   </p><p>With respect to the belief that organic beings have been created
 beautiful for the delight of man,- a belief which it has been
 pronounced is subversive of my whole theory,- I may first remark
 that the sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the
 mind, irrespective of any real quality in the admired object; and that
 the idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see
 this, for instance, in the men of different races admiring an entirely
 different standard of beauty in their women. If beautiful objects
 had been created solely for man's gratification, it ought to be
 shown that before man appeared, there was less beauty on the face of
 the earth than since he came on the stage. Were the beautiful volute
 and cone shells of the Eocene epoch, and the gracefully sculptured
 ammonites of the Secondary period, created that man might ages
 afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few objects are more
 beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceae: were
 these created that they might be examined and admired under the higher
 powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter case, and in
 many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of growth. Flowers
 rank amongst the most beautiful productions of nature; but they have
 been rendered conspicuous in contrast with the green leaves, and in
 consequence at the same time beautiful, so that they may be easily
 observed by insects. I have come to this conclusion from finding it an
 invariable rule that when a flower is fertilised by the wind it
 never has a gaily-coloured corolla. Several plants habitually
 produce two kinds of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to
 attract insects; the other closed, not coloured, destitute of
 nectar, and never visited by insects. Hence we may conclude that, if
 insects had not been developed on the face of the earth, our plants
 would not have been decked with beautiful flowers, but would have
 produced only such poor flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash
 trees, on grasses, spinach, docks, and nettles, which are all
 fertilised through the agency of the wind. A similar line of
 argument holds good with fruits; that a ripe strawberry or cherry is
 as pleasing to the eye as to the palate,- that the gaily-coloured
 fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the scarlet berries of the holly
 are beautiful objects,- will be admitted by every one. But this beauty
 serves merely as a guide to birds and beasts, in order that the
 fruit may be devoured and the matured seeds disseminated: I infer that
 this is the case from having as yet found no exception to the rule
 that seeds are always thus disseminated when embedded within a fruit
 of any kind (that is within a fleshy or pulpy envelope), if it be
 coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered conspicuous by being white
 or black.
   </p><p>On the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male
 animals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and
 mammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have been
 rendered beautiful for beauty's sake; but this has been effected
 through sexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful males
 having been continually preferred by the females, and not for the
 delight of man. So it is with the music of birds. We may infer from
 all this that a nearly similar taste for beautiful colours and for
 musical sounds runs through a large part of the animal kingdom. When
 the female is as beautifully coloured as the male, which is not rarely
 the case with birds and butterflies, the cause apparently lies in
 the colours acquired through sexual selection having been
 transmitted to both sexes, instead of to the males alone. How the
 sense of beauty in its simplest form- that is, the reception of a
 peculiar kind of pleasure from certain colours, forms, and sounds- was
 first developed in the mind of man and of the lower animals, is a very
 obscure subject. The same sort of difficulty is presented, if we
 enquire how it is that certain flavours and odours give pleasure,
 and others displeasure. Habit in all these cases appears to have
 come to a certain extent into play; but there must be some fundamental
 cause in the constitution of the nervous system in each species.
 
   </p><p>Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a
 species exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout
 nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the
 structures of others. But natural selection can and does often produce
 structures for the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the
 fang of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which
 its eggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it
 could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species
 had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would
 annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through
 natural selection. Although many statements may be found in works on
 natural history to this effect, I cannot find even one which seems
 to me of any weight. It is admitted that the rattlesnake has a
 poison-fang for its own defence, and for the destruction of its
 prey; but some authors suppose that at the same time it is furnished
 with a rattle for its own injury, namely, to warn its prey. I would
 almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when
 preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed mouse. It is a much
 more probable view that the rattlesnake uses its rattle, the cobra
 expands its frill, and the puff-adder swells whilst hissing so
 loudly and harshly, in order to alarm the many birds and beasts
 which are known to attack even the most venomous species. Snakes act
 on the same principle which makes the hen ruffle her feathers and
 expand her wings when a dog approaches her chickens; but I have not
 space here to enlarge on the many ways by which animals endeavour to
 frighten away their enemies.
   </p><p>Natural selection will never produce in a being any structure more
 injurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts
 solely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed, as
 Paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an
 injury to its possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the
 good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the whole
 advantageous. After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of
 life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it
 be not so, the being Will become extinct as myriads have become
 extinct.
   </p><p>Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect
 as, or slightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same
 country with which it comes into competition. And we see that this
 is the standard of perfection attained under nature. The endemic
 productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared
 with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing
 legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe. Natural
 selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet,
 as far as we can judge, with this high standard under nature. The
 correction for the aberration of light is said by Muller not to be
 perfect even in that most perfect organ, the human eye. Helmholtz,
 whose judgment no one will dispute, after describing in the
 strongest terms the wonderful powers of the human eye, adds these
 remarkable words: "That which we have discovered in the way of
 inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and in the image
 on the retina, is as nothing in comparison with the incongruities
 which we have just come across in the domain of the sensations. One
 might say that nature has taken delight in accumulating contradictions
 in order to remove all foundation from the theory of a pre-existing
 harmony between the external and internal worlds." If our reason leads
 us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in
 nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily err on both
 sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. Can we
 consider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, when used against
 many kinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward
 serratures, and thus inevitably causes the death of the insect by
 tearing out its viscera?
   </p><p>If we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remote
 progenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so
 many members of the same great order, and which has since been
 modified but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison
 originally adapted for some other object, such as to produce galls,
 since intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of
 the sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on
 the whole the power of stinging be useful to the social community,
 it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it
 may cause the death of some few members. If we admire the truly
 wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their
 females, can we admire the production for this single purpose of
 thousands of drones, which are utterly useless to the community for
 any other purpose, and which are ultimately slaughtered by their
 industrious and sterile sisters? It may be difficult, but we ought
 to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which
 urges her to destroy the young queens, her daughters, as soon as
 they are born, or to perish herself in the combat; for undoubtedly
 this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or maternal
 hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to
 the inexorable principle of natural selection. If we admire the
 several ingenious contrivances, by which orchids and many other plants
 are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally
 perfect the elaboration of dense clouds of pollen by our fir trees, so
 that a few granules may be wafted by chance on to the ovules?
 
 </p><h4>Summary: the Law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence
 embraced by the Theory of Natural Selection</h4>
 
   <p>We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and
 objections which may be urged against the theory. Many of them are
 serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on
 several facts, which on the belief of independent acts of creation are
 utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not
 indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of
 intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural
 selection is always very slow, and at any one time acts only on a
 few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection
 implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and
 intermediate gradations. Closely allied species, now living on a
 continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not
 continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly
 graduate away from one part to another. When two varieties are
 formed in two districts of a continuous area, an intermediate
 variety will often be formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but
 from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will usually exist
 in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects; consequently
 the two latter, during the course of further modification, from
 existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less
 numerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in
 supplanting and exterminating it.
   </p><p>We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding
 that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each
 other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural
 selection from an animal which at first only glided through the air.
   </p><p>We have seen that a species under new conditions of life may
 change its habits; or it may have diversified habits, with some very
 unlike those of its nearest congeners. Hence we can understand,
 bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever
 it can live, how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed
 feet, ground woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits
 of auks.
   </p><p>Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have
 been formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in
 the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in
 complexity, each good for its possessor, then, under changing
 conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in the
 acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural
 selection. In the cases in which we know of no intermediate or
 transitional states, we should be extremely cautious in concluding
 that none can have existed, for the metamorphoses of many organs
 show what wonderful changes in function are at least possible. For
 instance, a swimbladder has apparently been converted into an
 air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed simultaneously
 very different functions, and then having been in part or in whole
 specialised for one function; and two distinct organs having performed
 at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected
 whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated
 transitions.
   </p><p>We have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in the
 natural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in external
 appearance closely similar may have been separately and
 independently formed; but when such organs are closely examined,
 essential differences in their structure can almost always be
 detected; and this naturally follows from the principle of natural
 selection. On the other hand, the common rule throughout nature is
 infinite diversity of structure for gaining the same end; and this
 again naturally follows from the same great principle.
   </p><p>In many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert that a
 part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that
 modifications in its structure could not have been slowly
 accumulated by means of natural selection. In many other cases,
 modifications are probably the direct result of the laws of
 variation or of growth, independently of any good having been thus
 gained. But even such structures have often, as we may feel assured,
 been subsequently taken advantage of, and still further modified,
 for the good of species under new conditions of life. We may, also,
 believe that a part formerly of high importance has frequently been
 retained (as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial
 descendants), though it has become of such small importance that it
 could not, in its present state, have been acquired by means of
 natural selection.
   </p><p>Natural selection can produce nothing in one species for the
 exclusive good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts,
 organs, and excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or again
 highly injurious to another species, but in all cases at the same time
 useful to the possessor. In each well-stocked country natural
 selection acts through the competition of the inhabitants, and
 consequently leads to success in the battle for life, only in
 accordance with the standard of that particular country. Hence the
 inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, often yield
 to the inhabitants of another and generally the larger country. For in
 the larger country there will have existed more individuals and more
 diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and
 thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher.
 Natural selection will not necessarily lead to absolute perfection;
 nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can absolute
 perfection be everywhere predicated.
   </p><p>On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the
 full meaning of that old canon in natural history, "Natura non facit
 saltum." This canon, if we look to the present inhabitants alone of
 the world, is not strictly correct; but if we include all those of
 past times, whether known or unknown, it must on this theory be
 strictly true.
   </p><p>It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been
 formed on two great laws: Unity of Type, and the Conditions of
 Existence. By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in
 structure which we see in organic beings of the same class, and
 which is quite independent of their habits of life. On my theory,
 unity of type is explained by unity of descent. The expression of
 conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious
 Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection. For
 natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of
 each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by
 having adapted them during past periods of time: the adaptations being
 aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse of parts, being
 affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life,
 and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and
 variation. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is
 the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former
 variations and adaptations, that of Unity of Type.
