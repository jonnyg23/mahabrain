 <h3>Chapter V: Laws of Variation</h3>
 
  <p>I HAVE hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations- so common and
 multiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser
 degree with those under nature- were due to chance. This, of course,
 is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly
 our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some
 authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive
 system to produce individual differences, or slight deviations of
 structure, as to make the child like its parents. But the fact of
 variations and monstrosities occurring much more frequently under
 domestication than under nature, and the greater variability of
 species having wider ranges than of those with restricted ranges, lead
 to the conclusion that variability is generally related to the
 conditions of life to which each species has been exposed during
 several successive generations. In the first chapter I attempted to
 show that changed conditions act in two ways, directly on the whole
 organisation or on certain parts alone, and indirectly through the
 reproductive system. In all cases there are two factors, the nature of
 the organism, which is much the most important of the two, and the
 nature of the conditions. The direct action of changed conditions
 leads to definite or indefinite results. In the latter case the
 organisation seems to become plastic, and we have much fluctuating
 variability. In the former case the nature of the organism is such
 that it yields readily, when subjected to certain conditions, and all,
 or nearly all the individuals become modified in the same way.
   </p><p>It is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such as
 of climate, food, &amp;c., have acted in a definite manner. There is
 reason to believe that in the course of time the effects have been
 greater than can be proved by clear evidence. But we may safely
 conclude that the innumerable complex co-adaptations of structure,
 which we see throughout nature between various organic beings,
 cannot be attributed simply to such action. In the following cases the
 conditions seem to have produced some slight definite effect: E.
 Forbes asserts that shells at their southern limit, and when living in
 shallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same
 species from further north or from a greater depth; but this certainly
 does not always hold good. Mr. Gould believes that birds of the same
 species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when
 living near the coast or on islands, and Wollaston is convinced that
 residence near the sea affects the colours of insects. Moquin-Tandon
 gives a list of plants which, when growing near the sea-shore, have
 their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. These
 slightly varying organisms are interesting in as far as they present
 characters analogous to those possessed by the species which are
 confined to similar conditions.
   </p><p>When a variation is of the slightest use to any being, we cannot
 tell how much to attribute to the accumulative action of natural
 selection, and how much to the definite action of the conditions of
 life. Thus, it is well known to furriers that animals of the same
 species have thicker and better fur the further north they live; but
 who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the
 warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during
 many generations, and how much to the action of the severe climate?
 for it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of
 our domestic quadrupeds.
   </p><p>Instances could be given of similar varieties being produced from
 the same species under external conditions of life as different as can
 well be conceived; and, on the other hand, of dissimilar varieties
 being produced under apparently the same external conditions. Again,
 innumerable instances are known to every naturalist, of species
 keeping true, or not varying at all, although living under the most
 opposite climates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay less
 weight on the direct action of the surrounding conditions, than on a
 tendency to vary, due to causes of which we are quite ignorant.
   </p><p>In one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to cause
 variability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to include
 natural selection, for the conditions determine whether this or that
 variety shall survive. But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly
 see that the two elements of change are distinct; variability is in
 some manner excited, but it is the will of man which accumulates the
 variations in certain directions; and it is this latter agency which
 answers to the survival of the fittest under nature.
 
 </p><h4>Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by
 Natural Selection</h4>
 
   <p>From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be
 no doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and
 enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such
 modifications are inherited. Under free nature, we have no standard of
 comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use
 or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals
 possess structures which can be best explained by the effects of
 disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in
 nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this
 state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along the
 surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition
 as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it is a remarkable fact that the young
 birds, according to Mr. Cunningham, can fly, while the adults have
 lost this power. As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight
 except to escape danger, it is probable that the nearly wingless
 condition of several birds, now inhabiting or which lately inhabited
 several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused
 by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents, and is exposed to
 danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but it can defend itself
 by kicking its enemies, as efficiently as many quadrupeds. We may
 believe that the progenitor of the ostrich genus had habits like those
 of the bustard, and that, as the size and weight of its body were
 increased during successive generations, its legs were used more,
 and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.
   </p><p>Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the
 anterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are often
 broken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and
 not one had even a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are
 so habitually lost, that the insect has been described as not having
 them. In some other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary
 condition. In the Ateuchus, or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they
 are totally deficient. The evidence that accidental mutilations can be
 inherited is at present not decisive; but the remarkable cases
 observed by Brown-Sequard in guinea-pigs, of the inherited effects
 of operations, should make us cautious in denying this tendency. Hence
 it will perhaps be safest to look at the entire absence of the
 anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some
 other genera, not as cases of inherited mutilations, but as due to the
 effects of long-continued disuse; for as many dung-feeding beetles are
 generally found with their tarsi lost, this must happen early in life;
 therefore the tarsi cannot be of much importance or be much used by
 these insects.
   </p><p>In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of
 structure which are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. Mr.
 Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out
 of the 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so
 far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of the
 twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all their
 species in this condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many
 parts of the world are frequently blown to sea and perish; that the
 beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much
 concealed, until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the
 proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Desertas
 than in Madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so
 strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that certain large groups of
 beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which absolutely require
 the use of their wings, are here almost entirely absent;- these
 several considerations make me believe that the wingless condition
 of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural
 selection, combined probably with disuse. For during many successive
 generations each individual beetle which flew least, either from its
 wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from
 indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not
 being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which
 most readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea, and
 thus destroyed.
   </p><p>The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as
 certain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use
 their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston
 suspects, their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is
 quite compatible with the action of natural selection. For when a
 new insect first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural
 selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a
 greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with
 the winds, or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying.
 As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better
 for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further,
 whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not
 been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.
   </p><p>The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in
 size, and in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur. This
 state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse,
 but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a
 burrowing rodent, the tucotuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean
 in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who
 had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I
 kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared
 on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane.
 As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any
 animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having
 subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of
 the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an
 advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of
 disuse.
   </p><p>It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most
 different classes, which inhabit the caves of Carniola and of
 Kentucky, are blind. in some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye
 remains, though the eye is gone;- the stand for the telescope is
 there, though the telescope with its glasses has been lost. As it is
 difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any way
 injurious to animals living in darkness, their loss may be
 attributed to disuse. In one of the blind animals, namely, the
 cave-rat (Noetoma), two of which were captured by Professor Silliman
 at above half a mile distance from the mouth of the cave, and
 therefore not in the profoundest depths, the eyes were lustrous and of
 large size; and these animals, as I am informed by Professor Silliman,
 after having been exposed for about a month to a graduated light,
 acquired a dim perception of objects.
   </p><p>It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep
 limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in
 accordance with the old view of the blind animals having been
 separately created for the American and European caverns, very close
 similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been
 expected. This is certainly not the case if we look at the two whole
 faunas; and with respect to the insects alone, Schiodte has
 remarked, "We are accordingly prevented from considering the entire
 phenomenon in any other light than something purely local, and the
 similarity which is exhibited in a few forms between the Mammoth
 cave (in Kentucky) and the caves in Carniola, otherwise than as a very
 plain expression of that analogy which subsists generally between
 the fauna of Europe and of North America." On my view we must
 suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary powers of
 vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world
 into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did
 European animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence of
 this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks, "We accordingly
 look upon the subterranean faunas as small ramifications which have
 penetrated into the earth from the geographically limited faunas of
 the adjacent tracts, and which, as they extended themselves into
 darkness, have been accommodated to surrounding circumstances. Animals
 not far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from
 light to darkness. Next follow those that are constructed for
 twilight; and, last of all, those destined for total darkness, and
 whose formation is quite peculiar." These remarks of Schiodte's it
 should be understood, apply not to the same, but to distinct
 species. By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless
 generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have
 more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection
 will often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the
 length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for blindness.
 Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to see in
 the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants of
 that continent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the
 European continent. And this is the case with some of the American
 cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some, of the European
 cave insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding
 country. It would be difficult to give any rational explanation of the
 affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the
 two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation.
 That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds
 should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known
 relationship of most of their other productions. As a blind species of
 Bathyscia is found in abundance on shady rocks far from caves, the
 loss of vision in the cave-species of this one genus has probably
 had no relation to its dark habitation; for it is natural that an
 insect already deprived of vision should readily become adapted to
 dark caverns. Another blind genus (Anophthaimus) offers this
 remarkable peculiarity, that the species, as Mr. Murray observes, have
 not as yet been found anywhere except in caves; yet those which
 inhabit the several eaves of Europe and America are distinct; but it
 is possible that the progenitors of these several species, whilst they
 were furnished with eyes, may formerly have ranged over both
 continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in their present
 secluded abodes. Far from feeling surprise that some of the
 cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in
 regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with
 blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only
 surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,
 owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants
 of these dark abodes will have been exposed.
 
 </p><h4>Acclimatisation</h4>
 
   <p>Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in
 the time of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to
 germinate, &amp;c., and this leads me to say a few words on
 acclimatisation. As it is extremely common for distinct species
 belonging to the same genus to inhabit hot and cold countries, if it
 be true that all the species of the same genus are descended from a
 single parent-form, acclimatisation must be readily effected during
 a long course of descent. It is notorious that each species is adapted
 to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic or even from
 a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate, or conversely. So
 again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. But the
 degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they
 live is often overrated. We may infer this from our frequent inability
 to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate,
 and from the number of plants and animals brought from different
 countries which are here perfectly healthy. We have reason to
 believe that species in a state of nature are closely limited in their
 ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or
 more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But whether or not
 this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have evidence with
 some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent, naturally
 habituated to different temperatures; that is, they become
 acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed
 collected by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different
 heights on the Himalaya, were found to possess in this country
 different constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites
 informs me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon; analogous
 observations have been made by Mr. H. C. Watson on European species of
 plants brought from the Azores to England; and I could give other
 cases. In regard to animals, several authentic instances could be
 adduced of species having largely extended, within historical times,
 their range from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do
 not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to
 their native climate, though in all ordinary cases we assume such to
 be the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become
 specially acclimatised to their new homes, so as to be better fitted
 for them than they were at first.
   </p><p>As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen
 by uncivilised man because they were useful and because they bred
 readily under confinement, and not because they were subsequently
 found capable of far-extended transportation, the common and
 extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only
 withstanding the most different climates, but of being perfectly
 fertile (a far severer test) under them, may be used as an argument
 that a large proportion of other animals now in a state of nature
 could easily be brought to bear widely different climates. We must
 not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on account of the
 probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild
 stocks; the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf may
 perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat and mouse cannot be
 considered as domestic animals, but they have been transported by
 man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider range than
 any other rodent; for they live under the cold climate of Faroe in the
 north and of the Falklands in the south, and on many an island in
 the torrid zones. Hence adaptation to any special climate may be
 looked at as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility
 of constitution, common to most animals. On this view, the capacity of
 enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his
 domestic animals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and
 rhinoceros having formerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the
 living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits,
 ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but as examples of a very
 common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar
 circumstances, into action.
   </p><p>How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate
 is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of
 varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to
 both means combined, is an obscure question. That habit or custom
 has some influence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the
 incessant advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient
 encyclopaedias of China, to be very cautious in transporting animals
 from one district to another. And as it is not likely that man
 should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds
 with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts, the
 result must, I think, be due to habit. On the other hand, natural
 selection would inevitably tend to preserve those individuals which
 were born with constitutions best adapted to any country which they
 inhabited. In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain
 varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others;
 this is strikingly shown in works on fruit-trees published in the
 United States, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended
 for the northern and others for the southern States; and as most of
 these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their
 constitutional differences to habit. The case of the Jerusalem
 artichoke, which is never propagated in England by seed, and of
 which consequently new varieties have not been produced, has even been
 advanced, as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for it
 is now as tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean
 has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater
 weight; but until someone will sow, during a score of generations, his
 kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by
 frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to
 prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these
 seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to
 have been tried. Nor let it be supposed that differences in the
 constitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an account has
 been published how much more hardy some seedlings are than others; and
 of this fact I have myself observed striking instances.
   </p><p>On the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have,
 in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the
 constitution and structure; but that the effects have often been
 largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural
 selection of innate variations.
 
 </p><h4>Correlated Variation</h4>
 
   <p>I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied
 together during its growth and development, that when slight
 variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through
 natural selection, other parts become modified. This is a very
 important subject, most imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly
 different classes of facts may be here easily confounded together.
 We shall presently see that simple inheritance often gives the false
 appearance of correlation. One of the most obvious real cases is, that
 variations of structure arising in the young or larvae naturally
 tend to affect the structure of the mature animal. The several parts
 of the body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic
 period, are identical in structure, and which are necessarily
 exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary in a like
 manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in
 the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws
 and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some
 anatomists to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not
 doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection;
 thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side;
 and if this had been of any great use to the breed, it might
 probably have been rendered permanent by selection.
   </p><p>Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to
 cohere; this is often seen in monstrous plants: and nothing is more
 common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as
 in the union of the petals into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect
 the form of adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors
 that with birds the diversity in the shape of the pelvis causes the
 remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys. Others believe
 that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by
 pressure the shape of the head of the child. In snakes, according to
 Schlegel, the form of the body and the manner of swallowing
 determine the position and form of several of the most important
 viscera.
   </p><p>The nature of the bond is frequently quite obscure. Isidore Geoffroy
 St-Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations
 frequently, and that others rarely, co-exist, without our being able
 assign any reason. What can be more singular than the relation in cats
 between complete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the
 tortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons between
 their feathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the
 presence of more or less down on the young pigeon when first
 hatched, with the future colour of its plumage; or, again, the
 relation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though
 here no doubt homology comes into play? With respect to this latter
 case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental, that the two
 orders of mammals which are most abnormal in their dermal covering,
 viz., Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters,
 &amp;c.,) are likewise on the whole the most abnormal in their teeth;
 but there are so many exceptions to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has
 remarked, that it has little value.
   </p><p>I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the
 laws of correlation and variation, independently of utility and
 therefore of natural selection, than that of the difference between
 the outer and inner flowers in some compositous and timbelliferous
 plants. Every one is familiar with the difference between the ray
 and central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference
 is often accompanied with the partial or complete abortion of the
 reproductive organs. But in some of these plants, the seeds also
 differ in shape and sculpture. These differences have sometimes been
 attributed to the pressure of the involuera on the florets, or to
 their mutual pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets
 of some Compositae countenances this idea; but with the
 Umbelliferae, it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me, the species
 with the densest heads which most frequently differ in their inner and
 outer flowers. It might have been thought that the development of
 the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from the reproductive organs
 causes their abortion; but this can hardly be the sole cause, for in
 some Compositae the seeds of the outer and inner florets differ,
 without any difference in the corolla. Possibly these several
 differences may be connected with the different flow of nutriment
 towards the central and external flowers: we know, at least, that with
 irregular flowers, those nearest to the axis are most subject to
 peloria, that is to become abnormally symmetrical. I may add, as an
 instance of this fact, and as a striking case of correlation, that
 in many pelargoniums, the two upper petals in the central flower of
 the truss often lose their patches of darker colour; and when this
 occurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted; the central flower thus
 becoming peloric or regular. When the colour is absent from only one
 of the two upper petals, the nectary is not quite aborted but is
 much shortened.
   </p><p>With respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel's idea that
 the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly
 advantageous or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is
 highly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into play.
 But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their
 differences in shape, which are not always correlated with any
 difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial: yet in the
 Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance- the
 seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and
 coelospermous in the central flowers,- that the elder De Candolle
 founded his main divisions in the order on such characters. Hence
 modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value,
 may be wholly due to the laws of variation and correlation, without
 being, as far as we can judge, of the slightest service to the
 species.
   </p><p>We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures
 which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are
 simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired
 through natural selection some one modification in structure, and,
 after thousands of generations, some other and independent
 modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted
 to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally
 be thought to be in some necessary manner correlated. Some other
 correlations are apparently due to the manner in which natural
 selection can alone act. For instance, Alph. de Candolle has
 remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not
 open; I should explain this rule by the impossibility of seeds
 gradually becoming winged through natural selection, unless the
 capsules were open; for in this case alone could the seeds, which were
 a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind, gain an advantage
 over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.
 
 </p><h4>Compensation and Economy of Growth</h4>
 
   <p>The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time,
 their law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe
 expressed it, "In order to spend on one side, nature is forced to
 economise on the other side." I think this holds true to a certain
 extent with our domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part
 or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another
 part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to
 fatten readily. The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield
 abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing
 seeds. When the seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself
 gains largely in size and quality. In our poultry, a large tuft of
 feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb,
 and a large beard by diminished wattles. With species in a state of
 nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal
 application; but many good observers, more especially botanists,
 believe in its truth. I will not, however, here give any instances,
 for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects, on the
 one hand, of a part being largely developed through natural
 selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same
 process or by disuse, and, on the other hand the actual withdrawal
 of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another
 and adjoining part.
   </p><p>I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have
 been advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a
 more general principle, namely, that natural selection is
 continually trying to economise every part of the organization. If
 under changed conditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes
 less useful, its diminution will be favoured, for it will profit the
 individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up an
 useless structure. I can only thus understand a fact with which I
 was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which many analogous
 instances could be given: namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic
 within another cirripede and is thus protected, it loses more or
 less completely its own shell or carapace. This is the case with the
 male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas:
 for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three
 highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously developed,
 and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the parasitic
 and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the head is
 reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile
 antennae. Now the saving of a large and complex structure, when
 rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each
 successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life
 to which every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of
 supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted.
   </p><p>Thus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run to
 reduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes, through
 changed habits, superfluous, without by any means causing some other
 part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And,
 conversely, that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in
 largely developing an organ without requiring as a necessary
 compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.
 
 </p><h4>Multiple, Rudimentary, and Lowly-organised Structures are Variable</h4>
 
   <p>It seems to be a rule, as remarked by the younger Geoffroy, both
 with varieties and species, that when any part or organ is repeated
 many times in the same individual (as the vertebrae in snakes, and the
 stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the
 same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is constant. The
 same author as well as some botanists have further remarked that
 multiple parts are extremely liable to vary in structure. As
 "vegetable repetition," to use Prof. Owen's expression, is a sign of
 low organisation, the foregoing statements accord with the common
 opinion of naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale of
 nature are more variable than those which are higher. I presume that
 lowness here means that the several parts of the organisation have
 been but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as
 the same part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see
 why it should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should
 not have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form as
 carefully as when the part has to serve for some one special
 purpose. In the same way, a knife which has to cut all sorts of things
 may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for some
 particular-purpose must be of some particular shape. Natural
 selection, it should never be forgotten, can act solely through and
 for the advantage of each being.
   </p><p>Rudimentary parts, as it is generally admitted, are apt to be highly
 variable. We shall have to recur to this subject; and I will here only
 add that their variability seems to result from their uselessness, and
 consequently from natural selection having had no power to check
 deviations in their structure.
 
 </p><h4>A Part developed in any Species in an extraordinary degree or
 manner, in comparison with the same Part in allied Species, tends to
 be highly variable</h4>
 
   <p>Several years ago I was much struck by a remark, to the above
 effect, made by Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to have
 come to a nearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to
 convince any one of the truth of the above proposition without
 giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which
 cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction
 that it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes
 of error, but I hope that I have made due allowance for them. It
 should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part,
 however unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in one
 species or in a few species in comparison with the same part in many
 closely allied species. Thus, the wing of a bat is a most abnormal
 structure in the class of mammals, but the rule would not apply
 here, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it would
 apply only if some one species had wings developed in a remarkable
 manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus. The
 rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters,
 when displayed in any unusual manner. The term, secondary sexual
 characters, used by Hunter, relates to characters which are attached
 to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of
 reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but more rarely
 to the females, as they seldom offer remarkable secondary sexual
 characters. The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of
 secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of
 these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner- of
 which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule is not
 confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case
 of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended to Mr.
 Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this Order, and I am fully
 convinced that the rule almost always holds good. I shall, in a future
 work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases; I will here give
 only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application. The
 opereular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in
 every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ
 extremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species
 of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvelous amount of
 diversification; the homologous valves in the different species
 being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in
 the individuals of the same species is so great, that it is no
 exaggeration to state that the varieties of the same species differ
 more from each other in the characters derived from these important
 organs, than do the species belonging to other distinct genera.
   </p><p>As with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting the
 same country, vary extremely little, I have particularly attended to
 them; and the rule certainly seems to hold good in this class. I
 cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this would have
 seriously shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great variability
 in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative
 degrees of variability.
   </p><p>When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or
 manner in a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high
 importance to that species: nevertheless it is in this case
 eminently liable to variation. Why should this be so? On the view that
 each species has been independently created, with all its parts as
 we now see them, I can see no explanation. But on the view that groups
 of species are descended from some other species, and have been
 modified through natural selection, I think we can obtain some
 light. First let me make some preliminary remarks. If, in our domestic
 animals, any part or the whole animal be neglected, and no selection
 be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl)
 or the whole breed will cease to have a uniform character: and the
 breed may be said to be degenerating. In rudimentary organs, and in
 those which have been but little specialised for any particular
 purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel
 case; for in such cases natural selection either has not or cannot
 have come into full play, and thus the organisation is left in a
 fluctuating condition. But what here more particularly concerns us is,
 that those points in our domestic animals, which at the present time
 are undergoing rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently
 liable to variation. Look at the individuals of the same breed of
 the pigeon, and see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in
 the beaks of tumblers, in the beaks and wattle of carriers, in the
 carriage and tail of fantails, &amp;c., these being the points now
 mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even in the same sub-breed, as
 in that of the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously difficult to
 breed nearly perfect birds, many departing widely from the standard.
 There may truly be said to be a constant struggle going on between, on
 the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less perfect state, as
 well as an innate tendency to new variations, and, on the other
 hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the
 long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so
 completely as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler pigeon
 from a good short-faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly
 going on, much variability in the parts undergoing modification may
 always be expected.
   </p><p>Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an
 extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other
 species of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has
 undergone an extraordinary amount of modification since the period
 when the several species branched off from the common progenitor of
 the genus. This period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as
 species rarely endure for more than one geological period. An
 extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and
 long-continued amount of variability, which has continually been
 accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. But
 as the variability of the extraordinarily developed part or organ
 has been so great and long-continued within a period not excessively
 remote, we might, as a general rule, still expect to find more
 variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation
 which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant. And
 this, I am convinced, is the case. That the struggle between natural
 selection on the one hand, and the tendency to reversion and
 variability on the other hand, will in the course of time cease; and
 that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant, I
 see no reason to doubt. Hence, when an organ, however abnormal it
 may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to
 many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of the bat, it
 must have existed, according to our theory, for an immense period in
 nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be more variable
 than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which the
 modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great
 that we ought to find the generative variability, as it may be called,
 still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability
 will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the
 individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the
 continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less
 modified condition.
 
 </p><h4>Specific Characters more Variable than Generic Characters</h4>
 
   <p>The principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to our
 present subject. It is notorious that specific characters are more
 variable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant:
 if in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some
 had red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one
 would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or
 conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour
 would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more
 unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because the
 explanation which most naturalists would advance is not here
 applicable, namely, that specific characters are more variable than
 generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological
 importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe
 this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall,
 however, have to return to this point in the chapter on
 Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in
 support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters are more
 variable than generic; but with respect to important characters I have
 repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author
 remarks with surprise that some important organ or part, which is
 generally very constant throughout a large group of species, differs
 considerably in closely-allied species, it is often variable in the
 individuals of the same species. And this fact shows that a character,
 which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and
 becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its
 physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same
 kind applies to monstrosities: at least Isidore Geoffroy St-Hilaire
 apparently entertains no doubt that the more an organ normally differs
 in the different species of the same group, the more subject it is
 to anomalies in the individuals.
   </p><p>On the ordinary view of each species having been independently
 created, why should that part of the structure, which differs from the
 same part in other independently-created species of the same genus, be
 more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the
 several species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But
 on the view that species are only strongly marked and fixed varieties,
 we might expect often to find them still continuing to vary in those
 parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately
 recent period, and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the
 case in another manner:- the points in which all the species of a
 genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from allied
 genera, are called generic characters; and these characters may be
 attributed to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can
 rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several
 distinct species, fitted to more or less widely-different habits, in
 exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic characters
 have been inherited from before the period when the several species
 first branched off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have
 not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight
 degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day.
 On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other
 species of the same genus are called specific characters; and as these
 specific characters have varied and come to differ since the period
 when the species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable
 that they should still often be in some degree variable,- at least
 more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a
 very long period remained constant.
   </p><p>Secondary Sexual Characters Variable.- I think it will be admitted
 by naturalists, without my entering on details, that secondary
 sexual characters are highly variable. It will also be admitted that
 species of the same group differ from each other more widely in
 their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their
 organisation: compare, for instance, the amount of difference
 between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual
 characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference
 between the females. The cause of the original variability of these
 characters is not manifest; but we can see why they should not have
 been rendered as constant and uniform as others, for they are
 accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action
 than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives
 fewer off-spring to the less favoured males. Whatever the cause may be
 of the variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are
 highly variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for
 action, and may thus have succeeded in giving to the species of the
 same group a greater amount of difference in these than in other
 respects.
   </p><p>It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between
 the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the
 very same parts of the organisation in which the species of the same
 genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in illustration
 the two first instances which happen to stand on my list; and as the
 differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature, the
 relation can hardly be accidental. The same number of joints in the
 tarsi is a character common to very large groups of beetles, but in
 the Engidoe, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly;
 and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same
 species. Again in the fossorial hymenoptera, the neuration of the
 wings is a character of the highest importance, because common to
 large groups; but in certain genera the neuration differs in the
 different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the same
 species. Sir J. Lubbock has recently remarked, that several minute
 crustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law. "In Pontella,
 for instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly by the
 anterior antennae and by the fifth pair of legs: the specific
 differences also are principally given by these organs." This relation
 has a clear meaning on my view: I look at all the species of the
 same genus as having as certainly descended from a common
 progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one species. Consequently,
 whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor, or of its
 early descendants, became variable, variations of this part would,
 it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural and sexual
 selection, in order to fit the several species to their several places
 in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the
 same species to each other, or to fit the males to struggle with other
 males for the possession of the females.
   </p><p>Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific
 characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of
 generic characters, or those which are possessed by all the
 species;- that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is
 developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with
 the same part in its congeners; and the slight degree of variability
 in a part, however extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be
 common to a whole group of species;- that the great variability of
 secondary sexual characters, and their great difference in closely
 allied species;- that secondary sexual and ordinary specific
 differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the
 organisation,- are all principles closely connected together. All
 being mainly due to the species of the same group being the
 descendants of common progenitor, from whom they have inherited much
 in common,- to parts which have recently and largely varied being more
 likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been
 inherited and have not varied,- to natural selection having more or
 less completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the
 tendency to reversion and to further variability,- to sexual selection
 being less rigid than ordinary selection,- and to variations in the
 same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection,
 and having been thus adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary
 purposes.
   </p><p>Distinct Species present analagous Variations, so that a Variety
 of one Species often assumes a Character proper to an Allied
 Species, or reverts to some of the Characters of an early
 Progenitor.- These propositions will be most readily understood by
 looking to our domestic races. The most distinct breeds of the pigeon,
 in countries widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed
 feathers on the head, and with feathers on the feet,- characters not
 possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous
 variations in two or more distinct races. The frequent presence of
 fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter may be considered
 as a variation representing the normal structure of another race,
 the fan-tail. I presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous
 variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited
 from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to
 variation, when acted on by similar unknown influences. In the
 vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation, in the
 enlarged stems, or as commonly called roots, of the Swedish turnip and
 Rutabaga, plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by
 cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so, the case will
 then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct
 species; and to these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip.
 According to the ordinary view of each species having been
 independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity
 in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa
 of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like
 manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation.
 Many similar cases of analogous variation have been observed by Naudin
 in the great gourd-family, and by various authors in our cereals.
 Similar cases occurring with insects under natural conditions have
 lately been discussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has
 grouped them under his law of Equable Variability.
   </p><p>With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the
 occasional appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with
 two black bars on the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the
 tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their basis with
 white. As all these marks are characteristic of the parent
 rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of
 reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the
 several breeds. We may, I think, confidently come to this
 conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are
 eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct
 and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing
 in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the
 slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere
 act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.
   </p><p>No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should
 reappear after having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of
 generations. But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other
 breed, the offspring occasionally show for many generations a tendency
 to revert in character to the foreign breed- some say, for a dozen
 or even a score of generations. After twelve generations, the
 proportion of blood, to use a common expression, from one ancestor, is
 only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally believed that a
 tendency to reversion is retained by this remnant of foreign blood. In
 a breed which has not been crossed, but in which both parents have
 lost some character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency,
 whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost character might, as
 was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, be
 transmitted for almost any number of generations. When a character
 which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of
 generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that one
 individual suddenly takes after an ancestor removed by some hundred
 generations, but that in each successive generation the character in
 question has been lying latent, and at last, under unknown
 favourable conditions, is developed. With the barb-pigeon, for
 instance, which very rarely produces a blue bird, it is probable
 that there is a latent tendency in each generation to produce blue
 plumage. The abstract improbability of such a tendency being
 transmitted through a vast number of generations, is not greater
 than that of quite useless or rudimentary organs being similarly
 transmitted. A mere tendency to produce a rudiment is indeed sometimes
 thus inherited.
   </p><p>As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended
 from a common progenitor, it might be expected that they would
 occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two
 or more species would resemble each other, or that a variety of one
 species would resemble in certain characters another and distinct
 species,- this other species being, according to our view, only a well
 marked and permanent variety. But characters exclusively due to
 analogous variation would probably be of an unimportant nature, for
 the preservation of all functionally important characters will have
 been determined through natural selection, in accordance with the
 different habits of the species. It might further be expected that the
 species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to
 long lost characters. As, however, we do not know the common ancestors
 of any natural group, we cannot distinguish between reversionary and
 analogous characters. If, for instance, we did not know that the
 parent rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could
 not have told, whether such characters in our domestic breeds were
 reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred
 that the blue colour was a case of reversion from the number of the
 markings, which are correlated with this tint, and which would not
 probably have all appeared together from simple variation. More
 especially we might have inferred this, from the blue colour and the
 several marks so often appearing when differently coloured breeds
 are crossed. Hence, although under nature it must generally be left
 doubtful, what cases are reversions to formerly existing characters,
 and what are new but analogous variations, yet we ought, on our
 theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species
 assuming characters which are already present in other members of
 the same group. And this undoubtedly is the case.
   </p><p>The difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due
 to the varieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same genus.
 A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate
 between two other forms, which themselves can only doubtfully be
 ranked as species; and this shows, unless all these closely allied
 forms be considered as independently created species, that they have
 in varying assumed some of the characters of the others. But the
 best evidence of analogous variations is afforded by parts or organs
 which are generally constant in character, but which occasionally vary
 so as to resemble, in some degree, the same part or organ in an allied
 species. I have collected a long list of such cases; but here, as
 before, I lie under the great disadvantage of not being able to give
 them. I can only repeat that such cases certainly occur, and seem to
 me very remarkable.
   </p><p>I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as
 affecting any important character, but from occurring in several
 species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under
 nature. It is a case almost certainly of reversion. The ass
 sometimes has very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on
 the legs of the zebra: it has been asserted that these are plainest in
 the foal, and, from inquiries which I have made, I believe this to
 be true. The stripe on the shoulder is sometimes double, and is very
 variable in length and outline. A white ass, but not an albino, has
 been described without either spinal or shoulder stripe: and these
 stripes are sometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in
 dark-coloured asses. The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen
 with a double shoulder-stripe. Mr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the
 hemionus with a distinct shoulder-stripe, though it properly has none;
 and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that the foals of this
 species are generally striped on the legs, and faintly on the
 shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra over the
 body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one
 specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.
   </p><p>With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of
 the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of all
 colours: transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns,
 and in one instance in a chestnut a faint shoulder-stripe may
 sometimes be seen in duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse.
 My son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian
 cart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes;
 I have myself seen a dun Devonshire pony, and a small dun Welsh pony
 has been carefully described to me, both with three parallel stripes
 on each shoulder.
   </p><p>In the north-west part of India the kattywar breed of horses is so
 generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined
 this breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not
 considered as purely-bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are
 generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double
 and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is
 sometimes striped. The stripes are often plainest in the foal; and
 sometimes quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both
 gray and bay kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have also
 reason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W. W. Edwards,
 that with the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in
 the foal than in the fullgrown animal. I have myself recently bred a
 foal from a bay mare (offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish
 mare) by a bay English race-horse; this foal when a week old was
 marked on its hinder quarters and on its forehead with numerous,
 very narrow, dark, zebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly
 striped: all the stripes soon disappeared completely. Without here
 entering on further details, I may state that I have collected cases
 of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in
 various countries from Britain to eastern China; and from Norway in
 the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south. In all parts of the
 world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by
 the term dun a large range of colour is included, from one between
 brown and black to a close approach to cream-colour.
   </p><p>I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this
 subject, believes that the several breeds of the horse are descended
 from several aboriginal species- one of which, the dun, was striped;
 and that the above described appearances are an due to ancient crosses
 with the dun stock. But this view may be safely rejected; for it is
 highly improbable that the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies,
 Norwegian cobs, the lanky kattywar race, &amp;c., inhabiting the most
 distant parts of the world, should all have been crossed with one
 supposed aboriginal stock.
   </p><p>Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of
 the horse-genus. Rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and
 horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs; according to Mr.
 Gosse, in certain parts of the United States about nine out of ten
 mules have striped legs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much
 striped that any one might have thought that it was a hybrid-zebra;
 and Mr. W. C. Martin, in his excellent treatise on the horse, has
 given a figure of a similar mule. In four coloured drawings, which I
 have seen, of hybrids between the ass and zebra, the legs were much
 more plainly barred than the rest of the body; and in one of them
 there was a double shoulder-stripe. In Lord Morton's famous hybrid,
 from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure
 offspring subsequently produced from the same mare by a black
 Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is
 even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most remarkable
 case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs me that he
 knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this
 hybrid, though the ass only occasionally has stripes on its legs and
 the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless
 had all four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like
 those on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and even had some
 zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With respect to this last
 fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from
 what is commonly called chance, that I was led solely from the
 occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and
 hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever
 occurred in the eminently striped kattywar breed of horses, and was,
 as we have seen, answered in the affirmative.
   </p><p>What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several
 distinct species of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation,
 striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like
 an ass. In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint
 appears- a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of
 the other species of the genus. The appearance of the stripes is not
 accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character. We
 see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids
 from between several of the most distinct species. Now observe the
 case of the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a
 pigeon (including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of
 bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed
 assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other
 marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form or
 character. When the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are
 crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks
 to reappear in the mongrels. I have stated that the most probable
 hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters,
 is- that there is a tendency in the young of each successive
 generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency,
 from unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in
 several species of the horse-genus the stripes are either plainer or
 appear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the breeds
 of pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and
 how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the
 horse-genus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back
 thousands on thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped
 like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed,
 the common parent of our domestic horse (whether or not it be
 descended from one or more wild stocks), of the ass, the hemionus,
 quagga, and zebra.
   </p><p>He who believes that each equine species was independently
 created, will, I presume, assert that each species has been created
 with a tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in
 this particular manner, so as often to become striped like the other
 species of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong
 tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the
 world, to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own
 parents, but other species of the genus. To admit this view is, as
 it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an
 unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and
 deception; I would almost as soon believe, with the old and ignorant
 cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created
 in stone so as to mock the shells living on the seashore.
   </p><p>Summary.- Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in
 one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this
 or that part has varied. But whenever we have the means of instituting
 a comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in producing the
 lesser differences between varieties of the same species, and the
 greater differences between species of the same genus. Changed
 conditions generally induce mere fluctuating variability, but
 sometimes they cause direct and definite effects; and these may become
 strongly marked in the course of time, though we have not sufficient
 evidence on this head. Habit in producing constitutional peculiarities
 and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing
 organs, appear in many cases to have been potent in their effects.
 Homologous parts tend to vary in the same manner, and homologous parts
 tend to cohere. Modifications in hard parts and in external parts
 sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When one part is largely
 developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining
 parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved without
 detriment will be saved. Changes of structure at an early age may
 affect parts subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated
 variation, the nature of which we are unable to understand,
 undoubtedly occur. Multiple parts are variable in number and in
 structure, perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely
 specialised for any particular function, so that their modifications
 have not been closely cheeked by natural selection. It follows
 probably from this same cause, that organic beings low in the scale
 are more variable than those standing higher in the scale, and which
 have their whole organisation more specialised. Rudimentary organs,
 from being useless, are not regulated by natural selection, and
 hence are variable. Specific characters- that is, the characters which
 have, come to differ since the several species of the same genus
 branched off from a common parent- are more variable than generic
 characters, or those which have long been inherited, and have not
 differed from this same period. In these remarks we have referred to
 special parts or organs being still variable, because they have
 recently varied and thus come to differ; but we have also seen in
 the second chapter that the same principle applies to the whole
 individual; for in a district where many species of a genus are found-
 that is, where there has been much former variation and
 differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has
 been actively at work- in that district and amongst these species,
 we now find, on an average, most varieties. Secondary sexual
 characters are highly variable, and such characters differ much in the
 species of the same group. Variability in the same parts of the
 organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary
 sexual differences to the two sexes of the same species, and
 specific differences to the several species of the same genus. Any
 part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an
 extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the
 allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of
 modification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why
 it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other
 parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural
 selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome
 the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less
 modified state. But when a species with any
 extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of many modified
 descendants- which on our view must be a very slow process,
 requiring long lapse of time- in this case, natural selection has
 succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however
 extraordinary a manner it may have been developed. Species
 inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent, and
 exposed to similar influences, naturally tend to present analogous
 variations, or these same species may occasionally revert to some of
 the characters of their ancient progenitors. Although new and
 important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous
 variation, such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious
 diversity of nature.
   </p><p>Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the
 offspring and their parents- and a cause for each must exist- we
 have reason to believe that it is the steady accumulation of
 beneficial differences which has given rise to all the more
 important modifications of structure in relation to the habits of each
 species.
