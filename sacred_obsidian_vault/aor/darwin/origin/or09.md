 <p></p><h3>Chapter IX: Hybridism</h3>
 <p>THE view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when
 intercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order
 to prevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at first
 highly probable, for species living together could hardly have been
 kept distinct had they been capable of freely crossing. The subject is
 in many ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of
 species when first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot
 have been acquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive
 profitable degrees of sterility. It is an incidental result of
 differences in the reproductive systems of the parent-species.
   </p><p>In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent
 fundamentally different, have generally been confounded; namely, the
 sterility of species when first crossed, and the sterility of the
 hybrids produced from them.
   </p><p>Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a
 perfect condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no
 offspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive
 organs functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of
 the male element in both plants and animals; though the formative
 organs themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope
 reveals. In the first case the two sexual elements which go to form
 the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either not at
 all developed, or are imperfectly developed. This distinction is
 important, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two
 cases, has to be considered. The distinction probably has been slurred
 over, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a
 special endowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers.
   </p><p>The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed
 to be descended from common parents, when crossed, and likewise the
 fertility of their mongrel offspring, is, with reference to my theory,
 of equal importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to
 make a broad and clear distinction between varieties and species.
   </p><p>Degrees of Sterility.- First, for the sterility of species when
 crossed and of their hybrid offspring. It is impossible to study the
 several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable
 observers, Kolreuter and Gartner, who almost devoted their lives to
 this subject, without being deeply impressed with the high
 generality of some degree of sterility. Kolreuter makes the rule
 universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he
 found two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite
 fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties.
 Gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the
 entire fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases. But in these and in many
 other cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order
 to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares
 the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first
 crossed, and the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with
 the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state
 of nature. But causes of serious error here intervene: a plant, to
 be hybridised, must be castrated, and, what is often more important,
 must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by
 insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants experimented on by
 Gartner were potted, and were kept in a chamber in his house. That
 these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot
 be doubted; for Gartner gives in his table about a score of cases of
 plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their
 own pollen, and (excluding all cases such as the Leguminosae, in which
 there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of these
 twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired. Moreover,
 as Gartner repeatedly crossed some forms, such as the common red and
 blue pimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and caerulea), which the best
 botanists rank as varieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we may
 doubt whether many species are really so sterile, when intercrossed,
 as he believed.
   </p><p>It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various
 species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so
 insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species
 is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical
 purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends
 and sterility begins. I think no better evidence of this can be
 required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever
 lived, namely Kolreuter and Gartner, arrived at diametrically opposite
 conclusions in regard to some of the very same forms. It is also
 most instructive to compare- but I have not space here to enter on
 details- the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question
 whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or
 varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different
 hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made during
 different years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor
 fertility affords any certain distinction between species and
 varieties. The evidence from this source graduates away, and is
 doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other
 constitutional and structural differences.
   </p><p>In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations:
 though Gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding
 them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in
 one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their
 fertility never increases, but generally decreases greatly and
 suddenly. With respect to this decrease, it may first be noticed
 that when any deviation in structure or constitution is common to both
 parents, this is often transmitted in an augmented degree to the
 offspring; and both sexual elements in hybrid plants are already
 affected in some degree. But I believe that their fertility has been
 diminished in nearly all these cases by an independent cause,
 namely, by too close interbreeding. I have made so many experiments
 and collected so many facts, showing on the one hand that an
 occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases the
 vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on the other hand that very
 close interbreeding lessens their vigour and fertility, that I
 cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion. Hybrids are seldom
 raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the
 parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same
 garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the
 flowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally
 be fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower;
 and this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already
 lessened by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this
 conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner,
 namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially
 fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility,
 notwithstanding the frequent ill effects from manipulation,
 sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now, in the
 process of artificial fertilisation, pollen is as often taken by
 chance (as I know from my own experience) from the anthers of
 another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to
 be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though probably
 often on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover, whenever
 complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer as
 Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have
 ensured in each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct flower,
 either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid
 nature. And thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility in
 the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids, in
 contrast with those spontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I
 believe, be accounted for by too close interbreeding having been
 avoided.
   </p><p>Now let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most
 experienced hybridiser, namely, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. He is as
 emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile- as
 fertile as the pure parent-species- as are Kolreuter and Gartner
 that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a
 universal law of nature. He experimented on some of the very same
 species as did Gartner. The difference in their results may, I
 think, be in part accounted for by Herbert's great horticultural
 skill, and by his having hot-houses at his command. Of his many
 important statements I will here give only a single one as an example,
 namely, that "every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense fertilised by
 C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to occur in a case of
 its natural fecundation." So that here we have perfect or even more
 than commonly perfect fertility, in a first cross between two distinct
 species.
   </p><p>This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact,
 namely, that individual plants of certain species of Lobelia,
 Verbascum and Passiflora, can easily be fertilised by pollen from a
 distinct species, but not by pollen from the same plant, though this
 pollen can be proved to be perfectly sound by fertilising other plants
 or species. In the genus Hippeastrum, in Corydalis as shown by
 Professor Hildebrand, in various orchids as shown by Mr. Scott and
 Fritz Muller, all the individuals are in this peculiar condition. So
 that with some species, certain abnormal individuals, and in other
 species all the individuals, can actually be hybridised much more
 readily than they can be fertilised by pollen from the same individual
 plant! To give one instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced
 four flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert with their own
 pollen, and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of
 a compound hybrid descended from three distinct species: the result
 was that "the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to
 grow, and after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod
 impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid
 progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely." Mr.
 Herbert tried similar experiments during many years, and always with
 the same result. These cases serve to show on what slight and
 mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of a species
 sometimes depends.
   </p><p>The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with
 scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how
 complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,
 Petunia, Rhododendron, &amp;c., have been crossed, yet many of these
 hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid
 from Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely
 dissimilar in general habit, "reproduces itself as perfectly as if
 it had been a natural species from the mountains of Chili." I have
 taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the
 complex crosses of rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them
 are perfectly fertile. Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that
 he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between Rhod. ponticum and
 catawbiense, and that this hybrid "seeds as freely as it is possible
 to imagine." Had hybrids when fairly treated, always gone on
 decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as Gartner
 believed to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to
 nurserymen. Horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrid, and
 such alone are fairly treated, for by insect agency the several
 individuals are allowed to cross freely with each other, and the
 injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. Any
 one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insect-agency by
 examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid
 rhododendrons, which produce no pollen for he will find on their
 stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.
   </p><p>In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully
 tried than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted,
 that is, if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as
 are the genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely
 distinct in the scale of nature can be crossed more easily than in the
 case of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile.
 It should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals
 breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly
 tried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine
 distinct species of finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in
 confinement, we have no right to expect that the first crosses between
 them and the canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly
 fertile. Again, with respect to the fertility in successive
 generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know of an
 instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised
 at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill
 effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary, brothers and
 sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in
 opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. And
 in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent
 sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing.
   </p><p>Although I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of
 perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe that the
 hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and reevesii, and from Phasianus
 colchicus with P. torquatus, are perfectly fertile. M. Quatrefages
 states that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia and arrindia)
 were proved in Paris to be fertile inter se for eight generations.
 It has lately been asserted that two such distinct species as the hare
 and rabbit, when they can be got to breed together, produce
 offspring which are highly fertile when crossed with one of the
 parent-species. The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A.
 cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally
 ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either
 pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se.
 This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same
 parents, but from different hatches; and from these two birds he
 raised no less than eight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese)
 from one nest. In India, however, these cross-bred geese must be far
 more fertile; for I am assured by two eminently capable judges, namely
 Mr. Blyth and Capt. Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese
 are kept in various parts of the country; and as they are kept for
 profit, where neither pure parent-species exists, they must
 certainly be highly or perfectly fertile.
 
   </p><p>With our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed
 together are quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended
 from two or more wild species. From this fact we must conclude
 either that the aboriginal parent-species at first produced
 perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the hybrids subsequently reared
 under domestication became quite fertile. This latter alternative,
 which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by far the most
 probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted. It is, for instance,
 almost certain that our dogs are descended from several wild stocks;
 yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of
 South America, all are quite fertile together; but analogy makes me
 greatly doubt whether the several aboriginal species would at first
 have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids.
 So again I have lately acquired decisive evidence that the crossed
 offspring from the Indian humped and common cattle are inter se
 perfectly fertile; and from the observations by Rutimeyer on their
 important osteological differences, as well as from those by Mr. Blyth
 on their differences in habits, voice, constitution, &amp;c., these two
 forms must be regarded as good and distinct species. The same
 remarks may be extended to the two chief races of the pig. We must,
 therefore, either give up the belief of the universal sterility of
 species when crossed; or we must look at this sterility in animals,
 not as an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being
 removed by domestication.
   </p><p>Finally, considering all the ascertained facts on the
 intercrossing of plants and animals, it may be concluded that some
 degree of sterility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an
 extremely general result; but that it cannot, under our present
 state of knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal.
 
 </p><h4>Laws governing the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids</h4>
 
   <p>We will now consider a little more in detail the laws governing
 the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will
 be to see whether or not these laws indicate that species have been
 specially endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their
 crossing and blending together in utter confusion. The following
 conclusions are drawn up chiefly from Gartner's admirable work on
 the hybridisation of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain
 how far they apply to animals, and, considering how scanty our
 knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to
 find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.
   </p><p>It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both
 of first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect
 fertility. It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation
 can be shown; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be
 given. When pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the
 stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts no more influence
 than so much inorganic dust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the
 pollen of different species applied to the stigma of some one
 species of the same genus, yields a perfect gradation in the number of
 seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete
 fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to an
 excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant's own pollen
 produces. So in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have
 produced, and probably never would produce, even with the pollen of
 the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases
 a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of
 the pure parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither
 earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the early withering
 of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation.
 From this extreme degree of sterility we have self-sterilised
 hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to
 perfect fertility.
   </p><p>The hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to
 cross, and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very
 sterile; but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a
 first cross, and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced- two
 classes of facts which are generally confounded together- is by no
 means strict. There are many cases, in which two pure species, as in
 the genus Verbascum, can be united with unusual facility, and
 produce numerous hybrid offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably
 sterile. On the other hand, there are species which can be crossed
 very rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last
 produced, are very fertile. Even within the limits of the same
 genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur.
   </p><p>The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more
 easily affected by unfavourable conditions, than is that of pure
 species. But the fertility of first crosses is likewise innately
 variable; for it is not always the same in degree when the same two
 species are crossed under the same circumstances; it depends in part
 upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been
 chosen for the experiment. So it is with hybrids, for their degree
 of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several
 individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to
 the same conditions.
   </p><p>By the term systematic affinity is meant, the general resemblance
 between species in structure and constitution. Now the fertility of
 first crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely
 governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by
 hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by
 systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand, by very
 closely allied species generally uniting with facility. But the
 correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of
 crossing is by no means strict. A multitude of cases could be given of
 very closely allied species which will not unite, or only with extreme
 difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite
 with the utmost facility. In the same family there may be a genus,
 as Dianthus, in which very many species can most readily be crossed;
 and another genus, as Silene, in which the most persevering efforts
 have failed to produce between extremely close species a single
 hybrid. Even within the limits of the same genus, we meet with this
 same difference; for instance, the many species of Nicotiana have been
 more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus; but
 Gartner found that N. acuminata, which is not a particularly
 distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to be fertilised
 by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Many analogous facts
 could be given.
   </p><p>No one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of
 difference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent
 two species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely
 different in habit and general appearance, and having strongly
 marked differences in every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in
 the fruit, and in the cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial
 plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different
 stations and fitted for extremely different climates, can often be
 crossed with ease.
   </p><p>By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for
 instance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and
 then a mare by a male-ass; these two species may then be said to
 have been reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible
 difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases
 are highly important, for they prove that the capacity in any two
 species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic
 affinity, that is of any difference in their structure or
 constitution, excepting in their reproductive systems. The diversity
 of the result in reciprocal crosses between the same two species was
 long ago observed by Kolreuter. To give an instance: Mirabilis
 jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M. longiflora, and
 the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but Kolreuter
 tried more than two hundred times, during eight following years, to
 fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M. jalapa, and
 utterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could be given.
 Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds or Fuci.
 Gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in making
 reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has
 observed it even between closely related forms (as Matthiola annua and
 gilabra) which many botanists rank only as varieties. It is also a
 remarkable fact, that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though
 of course compounded of the very same two species, the one species
 having first been used as the father and then as the mother, though
 they rarely differ in external characters, yet generally differ in
 fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree.
   </p><p>Several other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for
 instance, some species have a remarkable power of crossing with
 other species; other species of the same genus have a remarkable power
 of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these
 two powers do not at all necessarily go together. There are certain
 hybrids which, instead of having, as is usual, an intermediate
 character between their two parents, always closely resemble one of
 them; and such hybrids, though externally so like one of their pure
 parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely sterile. So again
 amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between
 their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are
 born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and these
 hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other hybrids
 raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of
 fertility. These facts show how completely the fertility of a hybrid
 may be independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent.
   </p><p>Considering the several rules now given, which govern the
 fertility of first causes and of hybrids, we see that when forms,
 which must be considered as good and distinct species, are united,
 their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to
 fertility under certain conditions in excess; that their fertility,
 besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable
 conditions, is innately variable; that it is by no means always the
 same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced from
 this cross; that the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree
 in which they resemble in external appearance either parent; and
 lastly, that the facility of making a first cross between any two
 species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or
 degree of resemblance to each other. This latter statement is
 clearly proved by the difference in the result of reciprocal crosses
 between the same two species, for, according as the one species or the
 other is used as the father or the mother, there is generally some
 difference, and occasionally the widest possible difference, in the
 facility of effecting an union. The hybrids, moreover, produced from
 reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.
   </p><p>Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have
 been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming
 confounded in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be
 so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed,
 all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep
 from blending together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately
 variable in the individuals of the same species? Why should some
 species cross with facility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and
 other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly
 fertile hybrids? Why should there often be so great a difference in
 the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it
 may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? To
 grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and then to
 stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility,
 not strictly related to the facility of the first union between
 their parents, seems a strange arrangement.
   </p><p>The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me
 clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of
 hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in
 their reproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and
 limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two
 species, the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on
 the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed
 direction. It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an
 example what I mean by sterility being incidental on other
 differences, and not a specially endowed quality. As the capacity of
 one plant to be grafted or budded on another is unimportant for
 their welfare in a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose
 that this capacity is a specially endowed quality, but will admit that
 it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two
 plants. We can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take
 on another, from differences in their rate of growth, in the
 hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of their
 sap, &amp;c.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason
 whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody
 and the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous,
 and adaptation to widely different climates, do not always prevent the
 two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the
 capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able
 to graft together trees belonging to quite distinct families; and,
 on the other hand, closely allied species, and varieties of the same
 species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. But
 this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed
 by systematic affinity. Although many distinct genera within the
 same family have been grafted together, in other cases species of
 the same genus will not take on each other. The pear can be grafted
 far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus,
 than on the apple, which is a member of the same genus. Even different
 varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the
 quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on
 certain varieties of the plum.
   </p><p>As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in
 different individuals of the same two species in crossing; so
 Sageret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the
 same two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal
 crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from
 equal, so it sometimes is in grafting; the common gooseberry, for
 instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the current will
 take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.
   </p><p>We have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their
 reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a different case
 from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their
 reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct classes of cases
 run to a large extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in
 grafting; for Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded
 freely on their own roots, and which could be grafted with no great
 difficulty on a fourth species, when thus grafted were rendered
 barren. On the other hand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted
 on other species yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own
 roots. We are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary
 cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, &amp;c., which seed much more freely
 when fertilised with the pollen of a distinct species, than when
 fertilised with pollen from the same plant.
   </p><p>We thus see, that, although there is a clear and great difference
 between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male
 and female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a
 rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of
 crossing distinct species. And as we must look at the curious and
 complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted
 on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative
 systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws governing the
 facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown differences in
 their reproductive systems. These differences in both cases, follow to
 a certain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by
 which term every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic
 beings is attempted to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to
 indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or
 crossing various species has been a special endowment; although in the
 case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and
 stability of specific forms, as in the case of grafting it is
 unimportant for their welfare.
 
 </p><h4>Origin and Causes of the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids</h4>
 
   <p>At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that
 the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly
 acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of
 fertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared
 in certain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of
 another variety. For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties
 or incipient species, if they could be kept from blending, on the same
 principle that, when man is selecting at the same time two
 varieties, it is necessary that he should keep them separate. In the
 first place, it may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct
 regions are often sterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been
 of no advantage to such separated species to have been rendered
 mutually sterile, and consequently this could not have been effected
 through natural selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a
 species was rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility
 with other species would follow as a necessary contingency. In the
 second place, it is almost as much opposed to the theory of natural
 selection as to that of special creation, that in reciprocal crosses
 the male element of one form should have been rendered utterly
 impotent on a second form, whilst at the same time the male element of
 this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the first form; for
 this peculiar state of the reproductive system could hardly have
 been advantageous to either species.
   </p><p>In considering the probability of natural selection having come into
 action, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty
 will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps from
 slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be
 admitted that it would profit an incipient species, if it were
 rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent
 form or with some other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and
 deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with
 the new species in process of formation. But he who will take the
 trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of
 sterility could be increased through natural selection to that high
 degree which is common with so many species, and which is universal
 with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family
 rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex. After mature
 reflection it seems to me that this could not have been effected
 through natural selection. Take the case of any two species which,
 when crossed, produced few and sterile offspring; now, what is there
 which could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to
 be endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility, and
 which thus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility?
 Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory of natural selection be
 brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred with many species, for
 a multitude are mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects
 we have reason to believe that modifications in their structure and
 fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an
 advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to
 which they belonged over other communities of the same species; but an
 individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered
 slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not
 thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the
 other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their
 preservation.
   </p><p>But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail;
 for with plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of
 crossed species must be due to some principle, quite independent of
 natural selection. Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in
 genera including numerous species, a series can be formed from species
 which when crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never
 produce a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of certain
 other species, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly impossible
 to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to
 yield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone
 is affected, cannot have been gained through selection; and from the
 laws governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform
 throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the
 cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in an cases.
 
   </p><p>We will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the
 differences between species which induce sterility in first crosses
 and in hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the greater or less
 difficulty in effecting an union and in obtaining offspring apparently
 depends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical
 impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be
 the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to
 reach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when the pollen of
 one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species,
 though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the
 stigmatic surface. Again, the male element may reach the female
 element but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as
 seems to have been the case with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci.
 No explanation can be given of these facts, any more than why
 certain trees cannot be grafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may be
 developed, and then perish at an early period. This latter alternative
 has not been sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from
 observations communicated to me by Mr. Rewitt, who has had great
 experience in hybridising pheasants and fowls, that the early death of
 the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. Mr.
 Salter has recently given the results of an examination of about 500
 eggs produced from various crosses between three species of Gallus and
 their hybrids; the majority of these eggs had been fertilised; and
 in the majority of the fertilised eggs, the embryos had either been
 partially developed and had then perished, or had become nearly
 mature, but the young chickens had been unable to break through the
 shell. Of the chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died
 within the first few days, or at latest weeks, "without any obvious
 cause, apparently from mere inability to live"; so that from the 500
 eggs only twelve chickens were reared. With plants, hybridised embryos
 probably often perish in a like manner; at least it is known that
 hybrids raised from very distinct species are sometimes weak and
 dwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact Max Wichura has
 recently given some striking cases with hybrid willows. It may be here
 worth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos
 within the eggs of silk moths which had not been fertilised, pass
 through their early stages of development and then perish like the
 embryos produced by a cross between distinct species. Until becoming
 acquainted with these facts, I was unwilling to believe in the
 frequent early death of hybrid embryos; for hybrids, when once born,
 are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the
 common mule. Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before
 and after birth: when born and living in a country where their two
 parents live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of
 life. But a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and
 constitution of its mother; it may therefore before birth, as long
 as it is nourished within its mother's womb, or within the egg or seed
 produced by the mother, be exposed to conditions in some degree
 unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an early period;
 more especially as all very young beings are eminently sensitive to
 injurious or unnatural conditions of life. But after all, the cause
 more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act of
 impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather
 than in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.
   </p><p>In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual
 elements are imperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different.
 I have more than once alluded to a large body of facts showing that,
 when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions,
 they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously
 affected. This, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of
 animals. Between the sterility thus super-induced and that of hybrids,
 there are many points of similarity. In both cases the sterility is
 independent of general health, and is often accompanied by excess of
 size or great luxuriance. In both cases the sterility occurs in
 various degrees; in both, the male element is the most liable to be
 affected; but sometimes the female more than the male. In both, the
 tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity, for
 whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same
 unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species tend to produce
 sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one species in a group will
 sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired
 fertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually
 fertile hybrids. No one can tell, till he tries, whether any
 particular animal will breed under confinement, or any exotic plant
 seed freely under culture; nor can he tell till he tries, whether
 any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile
 hybrids. Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several
 generations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely
 liable to vary, which seems to be partly due to their reproductive
 systems having been specially affected, though in a lesser degree than
 when sterility ensues. So it is with hybrids, for their offspring in
 successive generations are eminently liable to vary, as every
 experimentalist has observed.
   </p><p>Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and
 unnatural conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural
 crossing of two species, the reproductive system, independently of the
 general state of health, is affected in a very similar manner. In
 the one case, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often
 in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case,
 or that of hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same,
 but the organisation has been disturbed by two distinct structures and
 constitutions, including of course the reproductive systems, having
 been blended into one. For it is scarcely possible that two
 organisations should be compounded into one, without some
 disturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or
 mutual relations of the different parts and organs one to another or
 to the conditions of life. When hybrids are able to breed inter se,
 they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the
 same compounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised
 that their sterility, though in some degree variable, does not
 diminish; it is even apt to increase, this being generally the result,
 as before explained, of too close interbreeding. The above view of the
 sterility of hybrids being caused by two constitutions being
 compounded into one has been strongly maintained by Max Wichura.
   </p><p>It must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the above
 or any other view, several facts with respect to the sterility of
 hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced
 from reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids
 which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure
 parent. Nor do I pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root
 of the matter; no explanation is offered why an organism, when
 placed under unnatural conditions, is rendered sterile. All that I
 have attempted to show is, that in two cases, in some respects allied,
 sterility is the common result,- in the one case from the conditions
 of life having been disturbed, in the other case from the organisation
 having been disturbed by two organisations being compounded into one.
   </p><p>A similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very different
 class of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief founded on
 a considerable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere given, that
 slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all
 living things. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in
 their frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, &amp;c., from one soil or
 climate to another, and back again. During the convalescence of
 animals, great benefit is derived from almost any change in their
 habits of life. Again, both with plants and animals, there is the
 clearest evidence that a cross between individuals of the same
 species, which differ to a certain extent, gives vigour and
 fertility to the offspring; and that close interbreeding continued
 during several generations between the nearest relations, if these
 be kept under the same conditions of life, almost always leads to
 decreased size, weakness, or sterility.
   </p><p>Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the
 conditions of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other
 hand, that slight crosses, that is crosses between the males and
 females of the same species, which have been subjected to slightly
 different conditions, or which have slightly varied, give vigour and
 fertility to the offspring. But, as we have seen, organic beings
 long habituated to certain uniform conditions under a state of nature,
 when subjected, as under confinement, to a considerable change in
 their conditions, very frequently are rendered more or less sterile;
 and we know that a cross between two forms, that have become widely or
 specifically different, produce hybrids which are almost always in
 some degree sterile. I am fully persuaded that this double parallelism
 is by no means an accident or an illusion. He who is able to explain
 why the elephant and a multitude of other animals are incapable of
 breeding when kept under only partial confinement in their native
 country, will be able to explain the primary cause of hybrids being so
 generally sterile. He will at the same time be able to explain how
 it is that the races of some of our domesticated animals, which have
 often been subjected to new and not uniform conditions, are quite
 fertile together, although they are descended from distinct species,
 which would probably have been sterile if aboriginally crossed. The
 above two parallel series of facts seem to be connected together by
 some common but unknown bond, which is essentially related to the
 principle of life; this principle, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer,
 being that life depends on, or consists in, the incessant action and
 reaction of various forces, which, as throughout nature, are always
 tending towards an equilibrium; and when this tendency is slightly
 disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in power.
 
 </p><h4>Reciprocal Dimorphism and Trimorphism</h4>
 
   <p>This subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to
 throw some light on hybridism. Several plants belonging to distinct
 orders present two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which
 differ in no respect except in their reproductive organs; one form
 having a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with
 long stamens; the two having differently sized pollen-grains. With
 trimorphic plants there are three forms likewise differing in the
 lengths of the pistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the
 pollen grains, and in some other respects; and as in each of the three
 forms there are two sets of stamens, the three forms possess
 altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils. These
 organs are so proportioned in length to each other, that half the
 stamens in two of the forms stand on a level with the stigma of the
 third form. Now I have shown, and the result has been confirmed by
 other observers, that, in order to obtain full fertility with these
 plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the one form should be
 fertilised by pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in
 another form. So that with dimorphic species two unions, which may
 be called legitimate, are fully fertile; and two, which may be
 called illegitimate, are more or less infertile. With trimorphic
 species six unions are legitimate, or fully fertile,- and twelve are
 illegitimate, or more or less infertile.
   </p><p>The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and
 trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by
 pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil,
 differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in
 the same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the
 degree of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on
 the conditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have
 found it with illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen
 of a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own
 pollen be afterwards, even after a considerable interval of time,
 placed on the same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it
 generally annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is
 with the pollen of the several forms of the same species, for
 legitimate pollen is strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when
 both are placed on the same stigma. I ascertained this by
 fertilising several flowers, first illegitimately, and twenty-four
 hours afterwards legitimately with the pollen taken from a
 peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings were similarly
 coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen, though applied
 twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed or prevented
 the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen. Again, as in
 making reciprocal crosses between the same two species, there is
 occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same thing
 occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form of
 Lythrum galicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease
 by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and
 yielded many seeds; but the latter form did not yield a single seed
 when fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.
   </p><p>In all these respects, and in others which might be added, the forms
 of the same undoubted species when illegitimately united behave in
 exactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed.
 This led me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings,
 raised from several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that
 these illegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully
 fertile. It is possible to raise from dimorphic species, both
 long-styled and short-styled illegitimate plants, and from
 trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms. These can then be
 properly united in a legitimate manner. When this is done, there is no
 apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their
 parents when legitimately fertilised. But such is not the case. They
 are all infertile, in various degrees; some being so utterly and
 incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single
 seed or even seed-capsule. The sterility of these illegitimate plants,
 when united with each other in a legitimate manner, may be strictly
 compared with that of hybrids when crossed inter se. If, on the
 other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent-species, the
 sterility is usually much lessened: and so it is when an
 illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant. In the same
 manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run parallel with
 the difficulty of making the first cross between the two
 parent-species, so the sterility of certain illegitimate plants was
 unusually great, whilst the sterility of the union from which they
 were derived was by no means great. With hybrids raised from the
 same seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable, so
 it is in a marked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly, many
 hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers, whilst other and more
 sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs;
 exactly similar cases occur with the illegitimate offspring of various
 dimorphic and trimorphic plants.
   </p><p>Altogether there is the closest identity in character and
 behaviour between illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an
 exaggeration to maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids,
 produced within the limits of the same species by the improper union
 of certain forms, whilst ordinary hybrids are produced from an
 improper union between so-called distinct species. We have also
 already seen that there is the closest similarity in all respects
 between first illegitimate unions and first crosses between distinct
 species. This will perhaps be made more fully apparent by an
 illustration; we may suppose that a botanist found two well-marked
 varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the trimorphic
 Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by crossing whether
 they were specifically distinct. He would find that they yielded
 only about one-fifth of the proper number of seeds, and that they
 behaved in all the other above-specified respects as if they had
 been two distinct species. But to make the case sure, he would raise
 plants from his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that the
 seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they
 behaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids. He might then
 maintain that he had actually proved, in accordance with the common
 view, that his two varieties were as good and as distinct species as
 any in the world; but he would be completely mistaken.
   </p><p>The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are
 important, because they show us, first, that the physiological test of
 lessened fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe
 criterion of specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude
 that there is some unknown bond which connects the infertility of
 illegitimate unions with that of their illegitimate offspring, and
 we are led to extend the same view to first crosses and hybrids;
 thirdly, because we find, and this seems to me of especial importance,
 that two or three forms of the same species may exist and may differ
 in no respect whatever, either in structure or in constitution,
 relatively to external conditions, and yet be sterile when united in
 certain ways. For we must remember that it is the union of the
 sexual elements of individuals of the same form, for instance, of
 two long-styled forms, which results in sterility; whilst it is the
 union of the sexual elements proper to two distinct forms which is
 fertile. Hence the case appears at first sight exactly the reverse
 of what occurs, in the ordinary unions of the individuals of the
 same species and with crosses between distinct species. It is,
 however, doubtful whether this is really so; but I will not enlarge on
 this obscure subject.
   </p><p>We may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of
 dimorphic and trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct
 species when crossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends
 exclusively on the nature of their sexual elements, and not on any
 difference in their structure or general constitution. We are also led
 to this same conclusion by considering reciprocal crosses, in which
 the male of one species cannot be united, or can be united with
 great difficulty, with the female of a second species, whilst the
 converse cross can be effected with perfect facility. That excellent
 observer, Gartner, likewise concluded that species when crossed are
 sterile owing to differences confined to their reproductive systems.
 
 </p><h4>Fertility of Varieties when Crossed, and of their Mongrel Offspring,
 not universal</h4>
 
   <p>It may be urged, as an overwhelming argument, that there must be
 some essential distinction between species and varieties, inasmuch
 as the latter, however much they may differ from each other in
 external appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield
 perfectly fertile offspring. With some exceptions, presently to be
 given, I fully admit that this is the rule. But the subject is
 surrounded by difficulties, for, looking to varieties produced under
 nature, if two forms hitherto reputed to be varieties be found in
 any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by most
 naturalists as species. For instance, the blue and red pimpernel,
 which are considered by most botanists as varieties, are said by
 Gartner to be quite sterile when crossed, and he subsequently ranks
 them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in a circle, the fertility
 of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be
 granted.
   </p><p>If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been
 produced, under domestication, we are still involved in some doubt.
 For when it is stated, for instance, that certain South American
 indigenous domestic dogs do not readily unite with European dogs,
 the explanation which will occur to every one, and probably the true
 one, is that they are descended from aboriginally distinct species.
 Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic races,
 differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance those
 of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more
 especially when we reflect how many species there are, which, though
 resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when
 intercrossed. Several considerations however, render the fertility
 of domestic varieties less remarkable. In the first place, it may be
 observed that the amount of external difference between two species is
 no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so that similar
 differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide. It is
 certain that with species the cause lies exclusively in differences in
 their sexual constitution. Now the varying conditions to which
 domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected, have
 had so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in
 a manner leading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds for
 admitting the directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that
 such conditions generally eliminate this tendency; so that the
 domesticated descendants of species, which in their natural state
 probably would have been in some degree sterile when crossed, become
 perfectly fertile together. With plants, so far is cultivation from
 giving a tendency towards sterility between distinct species, that
 in several well-authenticated cases already alluded to, certain plants
 have been affected in an opposite manner, for they have become
 self-impotent whilst still retaining the capacity of fertilising,
 and being fertilised by, other species. If the Pallasian doctrine of
 the elimination of sterility through long-continued domestication be
 admitted, and it can hardly be rejected, it becomes in the highest
 degree improbable that similar conditions long-continued should
 likewise induce this tendency; though in certain cases, with species
 having a peculiar constitution, sterility might occasionally be thus
 caused. Thus, as I believe, we can understand why with domesticated
 animals varieties have not been produced which are mutually sterile;
 and why with plants only a few such cases, immediately to be given,
 have been observed.
   </p><p>The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears
 to me, why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile
 when crossed, but why this has so generally occurred with natural
 varieties, as soon as they have been permanently modified in a
 sufficient degree to take rank as species. We are far from precisely
 knowing the cause; nor is this surprising, seeing how profoundly
 ignorant we are in regard to the normal and abnormal action of the
 reproductive system. But we can see that species, owing to their
 struggle for existence with numerous competitors, will have been
 exposed during long periods of time to more uniform conditions, than
 have domestic varieties; and this may well make a wide difference in
 the result. For we know how commonly wild animals and plants, when
 taken from their natural conditions and subjected to captivity, are
 rendered sterile; and the reproductive functions of organic beings
 which have always lived under natural conditions would probably in
 like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural
 cross. Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which, as shown by
 the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally highly
 sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can now
 generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of
 conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be
 little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected
 by the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in
 a like manner.
   </p><p>I have not as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species
 were invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to
 resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of
 sterility in the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract.
 The evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in
 the sterility of a multitude of species. The evidence is, also,
 derived from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider
 fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction.
 Gartner kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow
 seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing near each other in
 his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes, they never
 naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one kind
 with pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed,
 and this one head produced only five grains. Manipulation in this case
 could not have been injurious, as the plants have separated sexes.
 No one, I believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are
 distinct species; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants
 thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile; so that even Gartner
 did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically
 distinct.
   </p><p>Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like
 the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual
 fertilization is by so much the less easy as their differences are
 greater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but the
 forms experimented on are ranked by Sageret, who mainly founds his
 classification by the test of infertility, as varieties, and Naudin
 has come to the same conclusion.
   </p><p>The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first
 incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of
 experiments made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so
 good an observer and so hostile a witness as Gartner: namely, that the
 yellow and white varieties when crossed produce less seed than the
 similarly coloured varieties of the same species. Moreover, he asserts
 that, when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed
 with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species, more seed is
 produced by the crosses between the similarly coloured flowers, than
 between those which are differently coloured. Mr. Scott also has
 experimented on the species and varieties of Verbascum; and although
 unable to confirm Gartner's results on the crossing of the distinct
 species, he finds that the dissimilarly coloured varieties of the same
 species yield fewer seeds in the proportion of 86 to 100, than the
 similarly coloured varieties. Yet these varieties differ in no respect
 except in the colour of their flowers; and one variety can sometimes
 be raised from the seed of another.
   </p><p>Kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent
 observer, has proved the remarkable fact, that one particular
 variety of the common tobacco was more fertile than the other
 varieties, when crossed with a widely distinct species. He
 experimented on five forms which are commonly reputed to be varieties,
 and which he tested by the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal
 crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile. But
 one of these five varieties, when used either as the father or mother,
 and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not
 so sterile as those which were produced from the four other
 varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the reproductive
 system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some
 degree modified.
   </p><p>From these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties
 when crossed are invariably quite fertile. From the great difficulty
 of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for
 a supposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would
 almost universally be ranked as a species;- from man attending only to
 external characters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties
 not having been exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of
 life;- from these several considerations we may conclude that
 fertility does not constitute a fundamental distinction between
 varieties and species when crossed. The general sterility of crossed
 species may safely be looked at, not as a special acquirement or
 endowment, but as incidental on changes of an unknown nature in
 their sexual elements.
 
 </p><h4>Hybrids and Mongrels compared, independently of their fertility</h4>
 
   <p>Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species
 and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other
 respects. Gartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a distinct line
 between species and varieties, could find very few, and, as it seems
 to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid
 offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of
 varieties. And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in many
 important respects.
   </p><p>I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most
 important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are
 more variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from
 species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the
 first generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this
 fact. Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely
 allied species are more variable than those from very distinct
 species; and this shows that the difference in the degree of
 variability graduates away. When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids
 are propagated for several generations, an extreme amount of
 variability in the offspring in both cases is notorious; but some
 few instances of both hybrids and mongrels long retaining a uniform
 character could be given. The variability, however, in the
 successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in
 hybrids.
   </p><p>This greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not seem
 at all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and
 mostly domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on
 natural varieties), and this implies that there has been recent
 variability, which would often continue and would augment that arising
 from the act of crossing. The slight variability of hybrids in the
 first generation, in contrast with that in the succeeding generations,
 is a curious fact and deserves attention. For it bears on the view
 which I have taken of one of the causes of ordinary variability;
 namely, that the reproductive system from being eminently sensitive to
 changed conditions of life, fails under these circumstances to perform
 its proper function of producing offspring closely similar in all
 respects to the parent-form. Now hybrids in the first generation are
 descended from species (excluding those long-cultivated) which have
 not had their reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are
 not variable; but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems
 seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable.
   </p><p>But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner
 states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to
 either parent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a
 difference in degree. Moreover, Gartner expressly states that
 hybrids from long cultivated plants are more subject to reversion than
 hybrids from species in their natural state; and this probably
 explains the singular difference in the results arrived at by
 different observers: thus Max Wichura doubts whether hybrids ever
 revert to their parent-forms, and he experimented on uncultivated
 species of willows; whilst Naudin, on the other hand, insists in the
 strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to reversion in
 hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants. Gartner
 further states that when any two species, although most closely allied
 to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are
 widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct
 varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids
 do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make out,
 is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the
 results of several experiments made by Kolreuter.
   </p><p>Such alone are the unimportant differences which Gartner is able
 to point out between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the
 degrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their
 respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly
 related species, follow according to Gartner the same laws. When two
 species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing
 its likeness on the hybrid. So I believe it to be with varieties of
 plants; and with animals one variety certainly often has this
 prepotent power over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a
 reciprocal cross, generally resemble each other closely; and so it
 is with mongrel plants from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and
 mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent-form, by repeated
 crosses in successive generations with either parent.
   </p><p>These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but
 the subject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of
 secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency
 in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in
 the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one
 variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those
 authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over
 the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely
 the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly
 in the male than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is the
 offspring of the male ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the
 hinny, which is the offspring of the female ass and stallion.
   </p><p>Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that
 it is only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in
 character, but closely resemble one of their parents; but this does
 sometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than
 with mongrels. Looking to the cases which I have collected of
 cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances
 seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their
 nature, and which have suddenly appeared- such as albinism,
 melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes;
 and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired
 through selection. A tendency to sudden reversions to the perfect
 character of either parent would, also, be much more likely to occur
 with mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly
 produced and semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are
 descended from species slowly and naturally produced On the whole, I
 entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an
 enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the
 conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents
 are the same, whether the two parents differ little or much from
 each other, namely, in the union of individuals of the same variety,
 or of different varieties, or of distinct species.
   </p><p>Independently of the question of fertility and sterility, in all
 other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the
 offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look
 at species as having been specially created, and at varieties as
 having been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an
 astonishing fact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there
 is no essential distinction between species and varieties.
 
 </p><h4>Summary of Chapter</h4>
 
   <p>First crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked as
 species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,
 sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight
 that the most careful experimentalists have arrived at diametrically
 opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The sterility is
 innately variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently
 susceptible to the action of favourable and unfavourable conditions.
 The degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic
 affinity, but is governed by several curious and complex laws. It is
 generally different, and sometimes widely different in reciprocal
 crosses between the same two species. It is not always equal in degree
 in a first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross.
   </p><p>In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one species
 or variety to take on another, is incidental on differences, generally
 of an unknown nature, in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the
 greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is
 incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There
 is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed
 with various degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and
 blending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially
 endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in
 being grafted together in order to prevent their inarching in our
 forests.
   </p><p>The sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not
 been acquired through natural selection. In the case of first
 crosses it seems to depend on several circumstances; in some instances
 in chief part on the early death of the embryo. In the case of
 hybrids, it apparently depends on their whole organisation having been
 disturbed by being compounded from two distinct forms; the sterility
 being closely allied to that which so frequently affects pure species,
 when exposed to new and unnatural conditions of life. He who will
 explain these latter cases will be able to explain the sterility of
 hybrids. This view is strongly supported by a parallelism of another
 kind: namely, that, firstly, slight changes in the conditions of
 life add to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings; and
 secondly, that the crossing of forms, which have been exposed to
 slightly different conditions of life or which have varied, favours
 the size, vigour, and fertility of their offspring. The facts given on
 the sterility of the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic
 plants and of their illegitimate progeny, perhaps render it probable
 that some unknown bond in all cases connects the degree of fertility
 of first unions with that of their offspring. The consideration of
 these facts on dimorphism, as well as of the results of reciprocal
 crosses, clearly leads to the conclusion that the primary cause of the
 sterility of crossed species is confined to differences in their
 sexual elements. But why, in the case of distinct species, the
 sexual elements should so generally have become more or less modified,
 leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; but it seems to
 stand in some close relation to species having been exposed for long
 periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of life.
   </p><p>It is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two
 species, and the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most
 cases correspond, even if due to distinct causes: for both depend on
 the amount of difference between the species which are crossed. Nor is
 it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the
 fertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being
 grafted together- though this latter capacity evidently depends on
 widely different circumstances- should all run, to a certain extent,
 parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to
 experiment; for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all
 kinds.
   </p><p>First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently
 alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring,
 are very generally, but not, as is so often stated, invariably
 fertile. Nor is this almost universal and perfect fertility
 surprising, when it is remembered how liable we are to argue in a
 circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature; and when we
 remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under
 domestication by the selection of mere external differences, and
 that they have not been long exposed to uniform conditions of life. It
 should also be especially kept in mind, that long-continued
 domestication tends to eliminate sterility, and is therefore little
 likely to induce this same quality. Independently of the question of
 fertility, in all other respects there is the closest general
 resemblance between hybrids and mongrels,- in their variability, in
 their power of absorbing each other by repeated crosses, and in
 their inheritance of characters from both parent-forms. Finally, then,
 although we are as ignorant of the precise cause of the sterility of
 first crosses and of hybrids as we are why animals and plants
 removed from their natural conditions become sterile, yet the facts
 given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to the belief that
 species aboriginally existed as varieties.
