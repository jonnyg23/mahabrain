 <h1>Why I Am An Agnostic</h1>
 <h2>Clarence Darrow</h2>
 </center>
 
 An agnostic is a doubter. The word is generally applied to
 those who doubt the verity of accepted religious creeds of
 faiths. Everyone is an agnostic as to the beliefs or creeds
 they do not accept. Catholics are agnostic to the
 Protestant creeds, and the Protestants are agnostic to
 the
 Catholic creed. Any one who thinks is an agnostic about
 something, otherwise he must believe that he is possessed
 of all knowledge. And the proper place for such a person is
 in the madhouse or the home for the feeble-minded. In a
 popular way, in the western world, an agnostic is one who
 doubts or disbelieves the main tenets of the
 Christian
 faith.
 
 <p>
 
 
 I would say that belief in at least three tenets is necessary
 to the faith of a Christian: a belief in God, a belief
 in
 immortality, and a belief in a supernatural book.
 Various
 Christian sects require much more, but it is difficult to
 imagine that one could be a Christian, under any
 intelligent
 meaning of the word, with less. Yet there are some people who
 
 claim to be Christians who do not accept the literal
 interpretation 
 of all the Bible, and who give more credence to some portions
 of the book than to others.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 I am an agnostic as to the question of God. I think that it
 is
 impossible for the human mind to believe in an object or
 thing unless it can form a mental picture of such object or
 thing. Since man ceased to worship openly an
 anthropomorphic God and talked vaguely and not
 intelligently about some force in the universe, higher than
 man, that is responsible for the existence of man and
 the
 universe, he cannot be said to believe in God. One cannot
 believe in a force excepting as a force that pervades
 matter and is not an individual entity. To believe in a thing,
 an image of the thing must be stamped on the mind. If one
 is asked if he believes in such an animal as a camel,
 there
 immediately arises in his mind an image of the camel. This
 image has come from experience or knowledge of the
 animal gathered in some way or other. No such image
 comes, or can come, with the idea of a God who is described
 as a force.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Man has always speculated upon the origin of the
 universe,
 including himself. I feel, with Herbert Spencer, that whether
 the universe had an origin-- and if it had-- what the origin
 is
 will never be known by man. The Christian says that the
 universe could not make itself; that there must have been
 some higher power to call it into being. Christians have
 been obsessed for many years by Paley's argument that if a
 person passing through a desert should find a watch and
 examine its spring, its hands, its case and its crystal, he
 would at once be satisfied that some intelligent being
 capable of design had made the watch. No doubt this is true.
 No civilized man would question that someone made the
 watch. The reason he would not doubt it is because he is
 familiar with watches and other appliances made by man.
 The savage was once unfamiliar with a watch and would have
 had no idea upon the subject. There are plenty of crystals
 and rocks of natural formation that are as intricate as a
 watch, but even to intelligent man they carry no
 implication that some intelligent power must have made
 them. They carry no such implication because no one has
 any knowledge or experience of someone having made
 these natural objects which everywhere abound.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 To say that God made the universe gives us no explanation
 of the beginnings of things. If we are told that God made
 the universe, the question immediately arises: Who made
 God? Did he always exist, or was there some power back of
 that? Did he create matter out of nothing, or is his
 existence coextensive with matter? The problem is still
 there. What is the origin of it all? If, on the other hand,
 one
 says that the universe was not made by God, that it
 always
 existed, he has the same difficulty to confront. To say that
 the universe was here last year, or millions of years ago,
 does not explain its origin. This is still a mystery. As to
 the
 question of the origin of things, man can only wonder and
 doubt and guess.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 As to the existence of the soul, all people may either
 believe or disbelieve. Everyone knows the origin of the
 human being. They know that it came from a single cell in
 the body of the mother, and that the cell was one out of
 ten
 thousand in the mother's body. Before gestation the cell
 must have been fertilized by a spermatozoon from the body 
 of the father. This was one out of perhaps a billion spermatozoa
 
 that was the capacity of the father. When the cell is fertilized
 
 a chemical process begins. The cell divides and multiplies
 and
 increases into millions of cells, and finally a child is
 born.
 Cells die and are born during the life of the individual
 until
 they finally drop apart, and this is death.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 If there is a soul, what is it, and where did it come from,
 and
 where does it go? Can anyone who is guided by his reason
 possibly imagine a soul independent of a body, or the place
 of its residence, or the character of it, or anything
 concerning it? If man is justified in any belief or disbelief
 on any subject, he is warranted in the disbelief in a soul.
 Not one scrap of evidence exists to prove any such
 impossible thing.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Many Christians base the belief of a soul and God upon the
 Bible. Strictly speaking, there is no such book. To make
 the
 Bible, sixty-six books are bound into one volume. These
 books are written by many people at different times, and
 no one knows the time or the identity of any author. Some
 of the books were written by several authors at various
 times. These books contain all sorts of contradictory
 concepts of life and morals and the origin of things.
 Between the first and the last nearly a thousand years
 intervened, a longer time than has passed since the
 discovery of America by Columbus.

 When I was a boy the theologians used to assert that the
 proof of the divine inspiration of the Bible rested on
 miracles and prophecies. But a miracle means a violation of
 a natural law, and there can be no proof imagined that could
 be sufficient to show the violation of a natural law; even
 though proof seemed to show violation, it would only show
 that we were not acquainted with all natural laws. One
 believes in the truthfulness of a man because of his
 long
 experience with the man, and because the man has always
 told a consistent story. But no man has told so consistent a
 story as nature.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 If one should say that the sun did not rise, to use the
 ordinary expression, on the day before, his hearer would
 not believe it, even though he had slept all day and knew
 that his informant was a man of the strictest veracity. He
 would not believe it because the story is inconsistent with
 the conduct of the sun in all the ages past.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Primitive and even civilized people have grown so
 accustomed to believing in miracles that they often
 attribute the simplest manifestations of nature to
 agencies of which they know nothing. They do this when the
 belief is utterly inconsistent with knowledge and logic.
 They believe in old miracles and new ones. Preachers pray
 for rain, knowing full well that no such prayer was ever
 answered. When a politician is sick, they pray for God to
 cure him, and the politician almost invariably dies. The
 modern clergyman who prays for rain and for the health of
 the politician is no more intelligent in this matter than
 the
 primitive man who saw a separate miracle in the rising and
 setting of the sun, in the birth of an individual, in the
 growth of a plant, in the stroke of lighting, in the flood,
 in
 every manifestation of nature and life.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 As to prophecies, intelligent writers gave them up long
 ago. In all prophecies facts are made to suit the prophecy,
 or the prophecy was made after the facts, or the events have 
 no relation to the prophecy.  Weird and strange and unreasonable
 
 interpretations are used to explain simple statements, that a
 
 prophecy may be claimed.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Can any rational person believe that the Bible is anything
 but a human document? We now know pretty well where the
 various books came from, and about when they were
 written. We know that they were written by human beings
 who had no knowledge of science, little knowledge of life,
 and were influenced by the barbarous morality of primitive
 times, and were grossly ignorant of most things that men
 know today. For instance, Genesis says that God made the
 earth, and he made the sun to light the day and the moon to
 light the night, and in one clause disposes of the stars by
 saying that "he made the stars also." This was plainly
 written by someone who had no conception of the stars.
 Man, by the aid of his telescope, has looked out into the
 heavens and found stars whose diameter is as great as the
 distance between the earth and the sun. We know that the
 universe is filled with stars and suns and planets and
 systems. Every new telescope looking further into the
 heavens only discovers more and more worlds and suns and
 systems in the endless reaches of space. The men who
 wrote Genesis believed, of course, that this tiny speck of
 mud that we call the earth was the center of the universe,
 the only world in space, and made for man, who was the only
 being worth considering. These men believed that the stars
 were only a little way above the earth, and were set in
 the
 firmament for man to look at, and for nothing else.
 Everyone today knows that this conception is not true.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 The origin of the human race is not as blind a subject as it
 once was. Let alone God creating Adam out of hand, from
 the dust of the earth, does anyone believe that Eve was
 made from Adam's rib--that the snake walked and spoke in
 the Garden of Eden--that he tempted Eve to persuade
 Adam to eat an apple, and that it is on that account that
 the
 whole human race was doomed to hell--that for four
 thousand years there was no chance for any human to be
 saved, though none of them had anything whatever to do
 with the temptation; and that finally men were saved only
 through God's son dying for them, and that unless human
 beings believed this silly, impossible and wicked story
 they were doomed to hell? Can anyone with intelligence
 really believe that a child born today should be doomed
 because the snake tempted Eve and Eve tempted Adam? To
 believe that is not God-worship; it is devil-worship.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Can anyone call this scheme of creation and damnation
 moral? It defies every principle of morality, as man
 conceives morality. Can anyone believe today that the
 whole world was destroyed by flood, save only Noah and his
 family and a male and female of each species of animal
 that
 entered the Ark? There are almost a million species of
 insects alone. How did Noah match these up and make sure
 of getting male and female to reproduce life in the world
 after the flood had spent its force? And why should all the
 lower animals have been destroyed? Were they included in
 the sinning of man? This is a story which could not beguile
 a
 fairly bright child of five years of age today.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Do intelligent people believe that the various languages
 spoken by man on earth came from the confusion of tongues at 
 the Tower of Babel, some four thousand years ago? Human languages
 
 were dispersed all over the face of the earth long before that
 
 time. Evidences of civilizations are in existence now that were
 
 old long before the date that romancers fix for the building of
 
 the Tower, and even before the date claimed for the flood.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Do Christians believe that Joshua made the sun stand still,
 so that the day could be lengthened, that a battle might
 be
 finished? What kind of person wrote that story, and what
 did he know about astronomy? It is perfectly plain that the
 author thought that the earth was the center of the
 universe and stood still in the heavens, and that the sun
 either went around it or was pulled across its path each
 day, and that the stopping of the sun would lengthen the
 day. We know now that had the sun stopped when Joshua
 commanded it, and had it stood still until now, it would not
 have lengthened the day. We know that the day is
 determined by the rotation of the earth upon its axis, and
 not by the movement of the sun. Everyone knows that this
 story simply is not true, and not many even pretend to
 believe the childish fable.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 What of the tale of Balaam's ass speaking to him, probably
 in Hebrew? Is it true, or is it a fable? Many asses have
 spoken, and doubtless some in Hebrew, but they have not
 been that breed of asses. Is salvation to depend on a belief
 in a monstrosity like this?
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 Above all the rest, would any human being today believe
 that a child was born without a father? Yet this story was
 not at all unreasonable in the ancient world; at least three
 or four miraculous births are recorded in the Bible,
 including John the Baptist and Samson. Immaculate
 conceptions were common in the Roman world at the time
 and at the place where Christianity really had its nativity.
 Women were taken to the temples to be inoculated of God
 so that their sons might be heroes, which meant,
 generally,
 wholesale butchers. Julius Caesar was a
 miraculous
 conception--indeed, they were common all over the world.
 How many miraculous-birth stories is a Christian now
 expected to believe?
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 In the days of the formation of the Christian religion,
 disease meant the possession of human beings by devils.
 Christ cured a sick man by casting out the devils, who ran
 into the swine, and the swine ran into the sea. Is there
 any
 question but what that was simply the attitude and belief
 of a primitive people? Does anyone believe that sickness
 means the possession of the body by devils, and that the
 devils must be cast out of the human being that he may be
 cured? Does anyone believe that a dead person can come to
 life? The miracles recorded in the Bible are not the
 only
 instances of dead men coming to life. All over the world
 one finds testimony of such miracles: miracles which no
 person is expected to believe, unless it is his kind of a
 miracle. Still at Lourdes today, and all over the present
 world, from New York to Los Angeles and up and down the
 lands, people believe in miraculous occurrences, and even
 in the return of the dead. Superstition is everywhere
 prevalent in the world. It has been so from the beginning,
 and most likely will be so unto the end.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 The reasons for agnosticism are abundant and compelling.
 Fantastic and foolish and impossible consequences are
 freely claimed for the belief in religion. All the civilization
 of any period is put down as a result of religion. All the
 cruelty and error and ignorance of the period has no
 relation to religion.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 The truth is that the origin of what we call civilization is
 not due to religion but to skepticism. So long as men
 accepted miracles without question, so long as they
 believed in original sin and the road to salvation, so long
 as
 they believed in a hell where man would be kept for
 eternity on account of Eve, there was no reason whatever
 for civilization: life was short, and eternity was long, and
 the business of life was preparation for eternity.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 When every event was a miracle, when there was no order
 or system or law, there was no occasion for studying any
 subject, or being interested in anything excepting a
 religion which took care of the soul. As man doubted the
 primitive conceptions about religion, and no longer
 accepted the literal, miraculous teachings of ancient
 books, he set himself to understand nature. We no longer
 cure disease by casting out devils. Since that time, men
 have studied the human body, have built hospitals and
 treated illness in a scientific way. Science is responsible
 for the building of railroads and bridges, of steamships,
 of
 telegraph lines, of cities, towns, large buildings and
 small,
 plumbing and sanitation, of the food supply, and the
 countless thousands of useful things that we now deem
 necessary to life. Without skepticism and doubt, none of
 these things could have been given to the world.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 The fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. The fear of
 God is the death of wisdom. Skepticism and doubt lead to
 study and investigation, and investigation is the beginning
 of wisdom.
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 The modern world is the child of doubt and inquiry, as the
 ancient world was the child of fear and faith.
