 <center><h1>Examination Of The Prophecies, by Thomas Paine</h1></center>
 
 <p>     [NOTE: An early American Editor, Col. Fellows, Paine's
      personal friend, adds after the title of this "Examination"
      the following interesting Note: "This work was first published
      by Mr. Paine, at New-York, in 1807, and was the last of his
      writings edited by himself. It is evidently extracted from his
      answer to the bishop of Llandaff, or from his third part of
      the Age of Reason, both of which, it appears by his will, he
      left in manuscript. The term, 'The Bishop,' occurs in this
      examination six times without designating what bishop is
      meant. Of all the replies to his second part of the Age of
      Reason, that of bishop Watson was the only one to which he
      paid particular attention; and he is, no doubt, the person
      here alluded to. Bishop Watson's Apology for the Bible had
      been published some years before Mr. P. left France, and the
      latter composed his answer to it, and also his third part of
      the Age of Reason, while in that country.</p>
 
 <p>     "When Mr. Paine arrived in America, and found that liberal
      opinions on religion were in disrepute, through the influence
      of hypocrisy and superstition, he declined publishing the
      entire of the works which he had prepared; observing that 'An
      author might lose the credit he had acquired by writing too
      much.' He however gave to the public the Examination before
      us, in a pamphlet form. But the apathy which appeared to
      prevail at that time in regard to religious inquiry, fully
      determined him to discontinue the publication of his
      theological writings. In this case, taking only a portion of
      one of the works before mentioned, he chose a title adapted to
      the particular part selected." -- Editor.]</p><p>

      THE passages called Prophecies of, or concerning, Jesus
 Christ, in the Old Testament may be classed under the two following
 heads.
 
 <p>     First, those referred to in the four books of the New
 Testament, called the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
 John.</p>
 
 <p>     Secondly, those which translators and commentators have, of
 their own imagination, erected into prophecies, and dubbed with
 that title at the head of the several chapters of the Old
 Testament. Of these it is scarcely worth while to waste time, ink,
 and paper upon; I shall, therefore, confine myself chiefly to those
 referred to in the aforesaid four books of the New Testament. If I
 show that these are not prophecies of the person called Jesus
 Christ, nor have reference to any such person, it will be perfectly
 needless to combat those which translators or the church have
 invented, and for which they had no other authority than their own
 imagination.</p>
 
 <p>     I begin with the book called the Gospel according to St.
 Matthew.</p>
 
 <p></p><hr>
 
 <h2>THE BOOK OF MATTHEW</h2>
 
      In i. 18, it is said, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
 this wise: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they
 came together, SHE WAS FOUND WITH CHILD OF THE HOLY GHOST." -- This
 is going a little too fast; because to make this verse agree with
 the next it should have said no more than that she was found with
 child; for the next verse says, "Then Joseph her husband, being a
 just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded
 to put her away privately." Consequently Joseph had found out no
 more than that she was with child, and he knew it was not by
 himself.
 
 <p>     Ver. 20, 21. "And while he thought of these things, [that is
 whether he should put her away privately, or make a public example
 of her,] behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to him IN A DREAM
 [that is, Joseph dreamed that an angel appeared unto him] saying,
 Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
 wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And
 she shall bring forth a son, and call his name Jesus; for he shall
 save his people from their sins."</p>
 
 <p>     Now, without entering into any discussion upon the merits or
 demerits of the account here given, it is proper to observe, that
 it has no higher authority than that of a dream; for it is
 impossible to a man to behold any thing in a dream but that which
 he dreams of. I ask not, therefore, whether Joseph if there was
 such a man had such a dream or not, because admitting he had, it
 proves nothing. So wonderful and irrational is the faculty of the
 mind in dream, that it acts the part of all the characters its
 imagination creates, and what it thinks it hears from any of them
 is no other than what the roving rapidity of its own imagination
 invents. It is therefore nothing to me what Joseph dreamed of;
 whether of the fidelity or infidelity of his wife. I pay no regard
 to my own dreams, and I should be weak indeed to put faith in the
 dreams of another.</p>
 
 <p>     The verses that follow those I have quoted, are the words of
 the writer of the book of Matthew. "Now, [says he,] all this [that
 is, all this dreaming and this pregnancy] was done that it might be
 fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying,
 Behold a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
 and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted, is,
 God with us.</p>
 
 <p>     This passage is in Isaiah vii. 14, and the writer of the book
 of Matthew endeavors to make his readers believe that this passage
 is a prophecy of the person called Jesus Christ. It is no such
 thing, and I go to show it is not. But it is first necessary that
 I explain the occasion of these words being spoken by Isaiah. The
 reader will then easily perceive that so far from their being a
 prophecy of Jesus Christ, they have not the least reference to such
 a person, nor to any thing that could happen in the time that
 Christ is said to have lived, which was about seven hundred years
 after the time of Isaiah. The case is this;</p>
 
 <p>     On the death of Solomon the Jewish nation split into two
 monarchies: one called the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which
 was Jerusalem: the other the kingdom of Israel, the capital of 
 which was Samaria. The kingdom of Judah followed the line of David,
 and the kingdom of Israel that of Saul; and these two rival
 monarchies frequently carried on fierce wars against each other.</p>
 
 <p>     At the time Ahaz was king of Judah, which was in the time of
 Isaiah, Pekah was king of Israel; and Pekah joined himself to
 Rezin, king of Syria, to make war against Ahaz, king of Judah; and
 these two kings marched a confederated and powerful army against
 Jerusalem. Ahaz and his people became alarmed at their danger, and
 "their hearts were moved as the trees of the wood are moved with
 the wind." Isaiah vii. 3.</p>
 
 <p>     In this perilous situation of things, Isaiah addresses himself
 to Ahaz, and assures him in the name of the Lord, (the cant phrase
 of all the prophets,) that these two kings should not succeed
 against him; and to assure him that this should be the case, (the
 case was however directly contrary, [NOTE: II. Chron. xxviii. I.
 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign. and he reigned
 sixteen years in Jerusalem, but he did not that which was right in
 the sight of the Lord. -- ver. 5. Wherefore the Lord his God
 delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, and they smate
 him, and carried away a great multitude of them captive and brought
 them to Damascus; and he was also delivered into the hand of the
 king, of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. Ver. 6. And
 Pekah (king of Israel) slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand
 in one day. -- ver. 8. And the children of Israel carried away
 captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and
 daughters.]) tells Ahaz to ask a sign of the Lord. This Ahaz
 declined doing, giving as a reason, that he would not tempt the
 Lord; upon which Isaiah, who pretends to be sent from God, says,
 ver. 14, "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign, behold
 a virgin shall conceive and bear a son -- Butter and honey shall he
 eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and chose the good -- For
 before the child shall know to refuse the evil and chose the good,
 the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings"
 -- meaning the king of Israel and the king of Syria who were
 marching against him.</p>
 
 <p>     Here then is the sign, which was to be the birth of a child,
 and that child a son; and here also is the time limited for the
 accomplishment of the sign, namely, before the child should know to
 refuse the evil and chose the good.</p>
 
 <p>     The thing, therefore, to be a sign of success to Ahaz, must be
 something that would take place before the event of the battle then
 pending between him and the two kings could be known. A thing to be
 a sign must precede the thing signified. The sign of rain must be
 before the rain.</p>
 
 <p>     It would have been mockery and insulting nonsense for Isaiah
 to have assured Ahaz as a sign that these two kings should not
 prevail against him, that a child should be born seven hundred
 years after he was dead, and that before the child so born should
 know to refuse the evil and choose the good, he, Ahaz, should be
 delivered from the danger he was then immediately threatened with.</p>
 
 <p>     But the case is, that the child of which Isaiah speaks was his
 own child, with which his wife or his mistress was then pregnant;
 for he says in the next chapter, (Is. viii. 2), "And I took unto me
 faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the Priest, and Zechariah the
 son of Jeberechiah; and I went unto the Prophetess, and she
 conceived and bear a son and he says, at ver. 18 of the same
 chapter, "Behold I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are
 for signs and for wonders in Israel."</p>
 
 <p>     It may not be improper here to observe, that the word
 translated a virgin in Isaiah, does not signify a virgin in Hebrew,
 but merely a 'young woman.' The tense is also falsified in the
 translation. Levi gives the Hebrew text of Isaiah vii. 14, and the
 translation in English with it -- "Behold a young woman is with
 child and beareth a son;" [NOTE: A Defence of the Old Testament."
 By David Levi. London, 1797. -- Editor.] The expression, says he,
 is in the present tense. This translation agrees with the other
 circumstances related of the birth of this child which was to be a
 sign to Ahaz. But as the true translation could not have been
 imposed upon the world as a prophecy of a child to be born seven
 hundred years afterwards, the christian translators have falsified
 the original: and instead of making Isaiah to say, behold a young
 woman is with child and beareth a son, they have made him to say,
 "Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. It is, however,
 only necessary for a person to read Isaiah vii. and viii., and he
 will be convinced that the passage in question is no prophecy of
 the person called Jesus Christ. I pass on to the second passage
 quoted from the Old Testament by the New, as a prophecy of Jesus
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew ii. 1-6. "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
 Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold there came wise men
 from the East to Jerusalem, saying, where is he that is born king
 of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the East, and are come to
 worship Him. When Herod the king heard these things he was
 troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and when he had gathered all
 the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded
 of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In
 Bethlehem, in the land of Judea: for thus it is written by the
 prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, ant not the
 least among the Princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a
 Governor that shall rule my people Israel." This passage is in
 Micah v. 2.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass over the absurdity of seeing and following a star in
 the day time, as a man would a 'Will with the whip,' or a candle
 and lantern at night; and also that of seeing it in the east, when
 themselves came from the east; for could such a thing be seen at
 all to serve them for a guide, it must be in the west to them. I
 confine myself solely to the passage called a prophecy of Jesus
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     The book of Micah, in the passage above quoted, v. 2, is
 speaking of some person, without mentioning his name, from whom
 some great achievements were expected; but the description he gives
 of this person, ver. 5, 6, proves evidently that it is not Jesus
 Christ, for he says, "and this man shall be the peace, when the 
 Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our
 palaces, then shall we raise up against him [that is, against the
 Assyrian] seven shepherds and eight principal men. And they shall
 waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod on
 the entrance thereof; thus shall He [the person spoken of at the
 head of the second verse] deliver us from the Assyrian, when he
 cometh into our land, and when be treadeth within our borders."</p>
 
 <p>     This is so evidently descriptive of a military chief, that it
 cannot be applied to Christ without outraging the character they
 pretend to give us of him. Besides which, the circumstances of the
 times here spoken of, and those of the times in which Christ is
 said to have lived, are in contradiction to each other. It was the
 Romans, and not the Assyrians that had conquered and were in the
 land of Judea, and trod in their palaces when Christ was born, and
 when he died, and so far from his driving them out, it was they who
 signed the warrant for his execution, and he suffered under it.</p>
 
 <p>     Having thus shown that this is no prophecy of Jesus Christ, I
 pass on to the third passage quoted from the Old Testament by the
 New, as a prophecy of him. This, like the first I have spoken of,
 is introduced by a dream. Joseph dreameth another dream, and
 dreameth that he seeth another angel. The account begins at Matthew
 ii. 13. "The angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
 saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into
 Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: For Herod will
 seek the life of the young child to destroy him. When he arose he
 took the young child and his mother by night and departed into
 Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be
 fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out
 of Egypt have I called my son."</p>
 
 <p>     This passage is in the book of Hosea, xi. I. The words are,
 "When Israel was a child then I loved him and called my son out of
 Egypt. As they called them so they went from them, they sacrificed
 unto Baalim and burnt incense to graven images."</p>
 
 <p>     This passage, falsely called a prophecy of Christ, refers to
 the children of Israel coming out of Egypt in the time of Pharaoh,
 and to the idolatry they committed afterwards. To make it apply to
 Jesus Christ, he then must be the person who sacrificed unto Baalim
 and burnt incense to graven images; for the person called out of
 Egypt by the collective name, Israel, and the persons committing
 this idolatry, are the same persons, or the descendants of them.
 This then can be no prophecy of Jesus Christ, unless they are
 willing to make an idolator of him. I pass on to the fourth passage
 called a prophecy by the writer of the book of Matthew.</p>
 
 <p>     This is introduced by a story told by nobody but himself, and
 scarcely believed by any body, of the slaughter of all the children
 under two years old, by the command of Herod. A thing which it is
 not probable should be done by Herod, as he only held an office
 under the Roman government, to which appeals could always be had,
 as we see in the case of Paul. Matthew, however, having made or
 told his story, says, ii. 17, 18, "Then was fulfilled that which
 was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, -- 'In Ramah was there a
 voice heard, lamentation, and weeping and great mourning, Rachel 
 weeping for her children, and would not be comforted because they
 were not."</p>
 
 <p>     This passage is in Jeremiah xxxi. 15; and this verse, when
 separated from the verses before and after it, and which explain
 its application, might with equal propriety be applied to every
 case of wars, sieges, and other violence, such as the Christians
 themselves have often done to the Jews, where mothers have lamented
 the loss of their children. There is nothing in the verse, taken
 singly, that designates or points out any particular application of
 it, otherwise than it points to some circumstances which, at the
 time of writing it, had already happened, and not to a thing yet to
 happen, for the verse is in the pretar or past tense. I go to
 explain the case and show the application of the verse.</p>
 
 <p>     Jeremiah lived in the time that Nebuchadnezar besieged, took,
 plundered, and destroyed Jerusalem, and led the Jews captive to
 Babylon. He carried his violence against the Jews to every extreme.
 He slew the sons of king Zedekiah before his face, he then put out
 the eyes of Zedekiah, and kept him in prison till the day of his
 death.</p>
 
 <p>     It is of this time of sorrow and suffering to the Jews that
 Jeremiah is speaking. Their Temple was destroyed, their land
 desolated, their nation and government entirely broken up, and
 themselves, men, women and children, carried into captivity. They
 had too many sorrows of their own, immediately before their eyes,
 to permit them, or any of their chiefs, to be employing themselves
 on things that might, or might not, happen in the World seven
 hundred years afterwards.</p>
 
 <p>     It is, as already observed, of this time of sorrow and
 suffering to the Jews that Jeremiah is speaking in the verse in
 question. In the next two verses (16, 17), he endeavors to console
 the sufferers by giving them hopes, and, according to the fashion
 of speaking in those days, assurances from the Lord, that their
 sufferings should have an end, and that their children should
 return again to their own children. But I leave the verses to speak
 for themselves, and the Old Testament to testify against the New.</p>
 
 <p>     Jeremiah xxxi. 15. -- "Thus saith the Lord, a voice was heard
 in Ramah [it is in the preter tense], lamentation and bitter
 weeping: Rachel, weeping for her children, refused to be comforted
 for her children because they were not." Ver. 16, "Thus saith the
 Lord: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears;
 for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and THEY shall come
 again from the land of the enemy." Ver. 17. -- "And there is hope
 in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to
 their own border."</p>
 
 <p>     By what strange ignorance or imposition is it, that the
 children of which Jeremiah speaks, (meaning the people of the
 Jewish nation, scripturally called children of Israel, and not mere
 infants under two years old,) and who were to return again from the
 land of the enemy, and come again into their own borders, can mean
 the children that Matthew makes Herod to slaughter? Could those
 return again from the land of the enemy, or how can the land of the
 enemy be applied to them? Could they come again to their own
 Borders? Good heavens! How has the world been imposed upon by
 testament-makers, priestcraft, and pretended prophecies. I pass on 
 to the fifth passage called a prophecy of Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     This, like two of the former, is introduced by dream. Joseph
 dreamed another dream, and dreameth of another Angel. And Matthew
 is again the historian of the dream and the dreamer. If it were
 asked how Matthew could know what Joseph dreamed, neither the
 Bishop nor all the Church could answer the question. Perhaps it was
 Matthew that dreamed, and not Joseph; that is, Joseph dreamed by
 proxy, in Matthew's brain, as they tell us Daniel dreamed for
 Nebuchadnezar. -- But be this as it may, I go on with my subject.</p>
 
 <p>     The account of this dream is in Matthew, ii. 19-23. "But when
 Herod was dead, behold an Angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to
 Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his
 mother and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead which
 sought the young child's life. And he arose and took the young
 child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he
 heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea in the room of his father
 Herod, he was afraid to go thither. Notwithstanding being warned of
 God in a dream [here is another dream] he turned aside into the
 parts of Galilee; and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth,
 that it might be fulfilled which was spoke by the prophets, He
 shall be called a Nazarene."</p>
 
 <p>     Here is good circumstantial evidence that Matthew dreamed, for
 there is no such passage in all the Old Testament; and I invite the
 bishop, [NOTE: Dr. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, who had replied to
 "The Age of Reason." -- Editor.] and all the priests in
 Christendom, including those of America, to produce it. I pass on
 to the sixth passage, called a prophecy of Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     This, as Swift says on another occasion, is lugged in head and
 shoulders; it need only to be seen in order to be hooted a forced
 and far-fetched piece of imposition.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew iv. 12-16, "Now when Jesus heard that John was cast
 into prison, he departed into Galilee: and leaving Nazareth, he
 came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the
 borders of Zebulon and Nephthalim: That it might be fulfilled which
 was spoken by Esaias [Isaiah] the prophet, saying, 'The land of
 Zebulon and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond
 Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which sat in the region
 and shadow of death, light is springing upon them.'</p>
 
 <p>     I wonder Matthew has not made the cris-cross-row, or the
 christ-cross-row (I know not how the priests spell it) into a
 prophecy. He might as well have done this as cut out these
 unconnected and undescriptive sentences from the place they stand
 in and dubbed them with that title. The words however, are in
 Isaiah, ix. 1, 2, as follows: "Nevertheless the dimness shall not
 be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly
 afflicted the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali, and
 afterwards did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea
 beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations."</p>
 
 <p>     All this relates to two circumstances that had already
 happened at the time these words in Isaiah were written. The one,
 where the land of Zebulon and Naphtali had been lightly afflicted,
 and afterwards more grievously by the way of the sea.</p>
 
 <p>     But observe, reader, how Matthew has falsified the text. He
 begins his quotation at a part of the verse where there is not so
 much as a comma, and thereby cuts off everything that relates to
 the first affliction. He then leaves out all that relates to the
 second affliction, and by this means leaves out every thing that
 makes the verse intelligible, and reduces it to a senseless
 skeleton of names of towns.</p>
 
 <p>     To bring this imposition of Matthew clearly and immediately
 before the eye of the reader, I will repeat the verse, and put
 between crotchets [ ] the words he has left out, and put in Italics
 those he has preserved.</p>
 
 <p>     "[Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her
 vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted] the land of
 Zebulon and the land of Naphtali, [and did afterwards more
 grievously afflict her] by the way of the sea beyond Jordan in
 Galilee of the nations."</p>
 
 <p>     What gross imposition is it to gut, as the phrase is, a verse
 in this manner, render it perfectly senseless, and then puff it off
 on a credulous world as a prophecy. I proceed to the next verse.</p>
 
 <p>     Ver. 2. "The people that walked in darkness have seen a great
 light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon
 them hath the light shined." All this is historical, and not in the
 least prophetical. The whole is in the preter tense: it speaks of
 things that had been accomplished at the time the words were
 written, and not of things to be accomplished afterwards.</p>
 
 <p>     As then the passage is in no possible sense prophetical, nor
 intended to be so, and that to attempt to make it so is not only to
 falsify the original but to commit a criminal imposition, it is
 matter of no concern to us, otherwise than as curiosity, to know
 who the people were of which the passage speaks that sat in
 darkness, and what the light was that had shined in upon them.</p>
 
 <p>     If we look into the preceding chapter, Is. viii., of which ix.
 is only a continuation, we shall find the writer speaking, at verse
 19 of "witches and wizards who peep about and mutter," and of
 people who made application to them; and he preaches and exhorts
 them against this darksome practice. It is of this people, and of
 this darksome practice, of walking in darkness, that he is speaking
 at ix. 2; and with respect to the light that had shined in upon
 them, it refers entirely to his own ministry, and to the boldness
 of it, which opposed itself to that of the witches and wizards who
 peeped about a and muttered.</p>
 
 <p>     Isaiah is, upon the whole, a wild disorderly writer,
 preserving in general no clear chain of perception in the
 arrangement of his ideas, and consequently producing no defined
 conclusions from them. It is the wildness of his stile, the
 confusion of his ideas, and the ranting metaphors he employs, that
 have afforded so many opportunities to priestcraft in some cases,
 and to superstition in others, to impose those defects upon the
 world as prophecies of Jesus Christ. Finding no direct meaning in 
 them, and not knowing what to make of them, and supposing at the
 same time they were intended to have a meaning, they supplied the
 defect by inventing a meaning of their own, and called it 'his.' I
 have however in this place done Isaiah the justice to rescue him
 from the claws of Matthew, who has torn him unmercifully to pieces,
 and from the imposition or ignorance of priests and commentators,
 by letting Isaiah speak for himself.</p>
 
 <p>     If the words walking in darkness, and light breaking in, could
 in any case be applied prophetically, which they cannot be, they
 would better apply to the times we now live in than to any other.
 The world has "walked in darkness" for eighteen hundred years, both
 as to religion and government, and it is only since the American
 Revolution began that light has broken in. The belief of one God,
 whose attributes are revealed to us in the book or scripture of the
 creation, which no human hand can counterfeit or falsify, and not
 in the written or printed book which, as Matthew has shown, can be
 altered or falsified by ignorance or design, is now making its way
 among us: and as to government, 'the light is already gone forth,'
 and whilst men ought to be careful not to be blinded by the excess
 of it, as at a certain time in France when everything was
 Robespierrean violence, they ought to reverence, and even to adore
 it, with all the perseverance that true wisdom can inspire.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the seventh passage, called a prophecy of Jesus
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew viii. 16, 17/ "When the evening was come, they brought
 unto him [Jesus] many that were possessed with devils, and he cast
 out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: That
 it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias (Isaiah) the
 prophet, saying, himself took our infirmities, and bare our
 sickness."</p>
 
 <p>     This affair of people being possessed by devils, and of
 casting them out, was the fable of the day when the books of the
 New Testament were written. It had not existence at any other time.
 The books of the Old Testament mention no such thing; the people of
 the present day know of no such thing; nor does the history of any
 people or country speak of such a thing. It starts upon us all at
 once in the book of Matthew, and is altogether an invention of the
 New Testament-makers and the Christian church. The book of Matthew
 is the first book where the word Devil is mentioned. [NOTE by
 PAINE: The word devil is a personification of the word evil. --
 Author.] We read in some of the books of the Old Testament of
 things called familiar spirits, the supposed companions of people
 called witches and wizards. It was no other than the trick of
 pretended conjurers to obtain money from credulous and ignorant
 people, or the fabricated charge of superstitious malignancy
 against unfortunate and decrepid old age. But the idea of a
 familiar spirit, if we can affix any idea to the term, is
 exceedingly different to that of being possessed by a devil. In the
 one case, the supposed familiar spirit is a dexterous agent, that
 comes and goes and does as he is bidden; in the other, he is a
 turbulent roaring monster, that tears and tortures the body into
 convulsions. Reader, whoever thou art, put thy trust in thy
 creator, make use of the reason he endowed thee with, and cast from
 thee all such fables.</p>
 
 <p>     The passage alluded to by Matthew, for as a quotation it is
 false, is in Isaiah, Iiii. 4, which is as follows: "Surely he [the
 person of whom Isaiah is speaking] hath borne our griefs and
 carried our sorrows." It is in the preter tense.</p>
 
 <p>     Here is nothing about casting out devils, nor curing of
 sicknesses. The passage, therefore, so far from being a prophecy of
 Christ, is not even applicable as a circumstance.</p>
 
 <p>     Isaiah, or at least the writer of the book that bears his
 name, employs the whole of this chapter, Iiii., in lamenting the
 sufferings of some deceased persons, of whom he speaks very
 pathetically. It is a monody on the death of a friend; but he
 mentions not the name of the person, nor gives any circumstance of
 him by which he can be personally known; and it is this silence,
 which is evidence of nothing, that Matthew has laid hold of, to put
 the name of Christ to it; as if the chiefs of the Jews, whose
 sorrows were then great, and the times they lived in big with
 danger, were never thinking about their own affairs, nor the fate
 of their own friends, but were continually running a Wild-Goose
 chase into futurity.</p>
 
 <p>     To make a monody into a prophecy is an absurdity. The
 characters and circumstances of men, even in the different ages of
 the world, are so much alike, that what is said of one may with
 propriety be said of many; but this fitness does not make the
 passage into a prophecy; and none but an impostor, or a bigot,
 would call it so.</p>
 
 <p>     Isaiah, in deploring the hard fate and loss of his friend,
 mentions nothing of him but what the human lot of man is subject
 to. All the cases he states of him, his persecutions, his
 imprisonment, his patience in suffering, and his perseverance in
 principle, are all within the line of nature; they belong
 exclusively to none, and may with justness be said of many. But if
 Jesus Christ was the person the church represents him to be, that
 which would exclusively apply to him must be something that could
 not apply to any other person; something beyond the line of nature,
 something beyond the lot of mortal man; and there are no such
 expressions in this chapter, nor any other chapter in the Old
 Testament.</p>
 
 <p>     It is no exclusive description to say of a person, as is said
 of the person Isaiah is lamenting in this chapter, He was oppressed
 and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as
 a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers is
 dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. This may be said of thousands of
 persons, who have suffered oppressions and unjust death with
 patience, silence, and perfect resignation.</p>
 
 <p>     Grotius, whom the Bishop [of Llandaff] esteems a most learned
 man, and who certainly was so, supposes that the person of whom
 Isaiah is speaking, is Jeremiah. Grotius is led into this opinion
 from the agreement there is between the description given by Isaiah
 and the case of Jeremiah, as stated in the book that bears his
 name. If Jeremiah was an innocent man, and not a traitor in the
 interest of Nebuchadnezar when Jerusalem was besieged, his case was
 hard; he was accused by his countrymen, was persecuted, oppressed, 
 and imprisoned, and he says of himself, (see Jer. xi. 19,) "But as
 for me, I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the
 slaughter."</p>
 
 <p>     I should be inclined to the same opinion with Grotius, had
 Isaiah lived at the time when Jeremiah underwent the cruelties of
 which he speaks; but Isaiah died about fifty years before; and it
 is of a person of his own time whose case Isaiah is lamenting in
 the chapter in question, and which imposition and bigotry, more
 than seven hundred years afterwards, perverted into a prophecy of
 a person they call Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the eighth passage called a prophecy of Jesus
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew xii. 14-21: "Then the Pharisees went out and held a
 council against him, how they might destroy him. But when Jesus
 knew it he withdrew himself; and great numbers followed him and he
 healed them all; and he charged them they should not make him
 known: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias
 (Isaiah) the prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have
 chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my
 spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. He
 shall not strive nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in
 the streets. A bruised reed shall he not break, and smocking flax
 shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. And
 in his name shall the Gentiles trust."</p>
 
 <p>     In the first place, this passage hath not the least relation
 to the purpose for which it is quoted.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew says, that the Pharisees held a council against Jesus
 to destroy him -- that Jesus withdrew himself -- that great numbers
 followed him -- that he healed them -- and that he charged them
 they should not make him known. But the passage Matthew has quoted
 as being fulfilled by these circumstances does not so much as apply
 to any one of them. It has nothing to do with the Pharisees holding
 a council to destroy Jesus -- with his withdrawing himself -- with
 great numbers following him -- with his healing them -- nor with
 his charging them not to make him known.</p>
 
 <p>     The purpose for which the passage is quoted, and the passage
 itself, are as remote from each other, as nothing from something.
 But the case is, that people have been so long in the habit of
 reading the books called the Bible and Testament with their eyes
 shut, and their senses locked up, that the most stupid
 inconsistencies have passed on them for truth, and imposition for
 prophecy. The all-wise creator hath been dishonored by being made
 the author of Fable, and the human mind degraded by believing it.</p>
 
 <p>     In this passage, as in that last mentioned, the name of the
 person of whom the passage speaks is not given, and we are left in
 the dark respecting him. It is this defect in the history that
 bigotry and imposition have laid hold of, to call It prophecy.</p>
 
 <p>     Had Isaiah lived in the time of Cyrus, the passage would
 descriptively apply to him. As king of Persia, his authority was 
 great among the Gentiles, and it is of such a character the passage
 speaks; and his friendship for the Jews, whom he liberated from
 captivity, and who might then be compared to a bruised reed, was
 extensive. But this description does not apply to Jesus Christ, who
 had no authority among the Gentiles; and as to his own countrymen,
 figuratively described by the bruised reed, it was they who
 crucified him. Neither can it be said of him that he did not cry,
 and that his voice was not heard in the street. As a preacher it
 was his business to be heard, and we are told that he travelled
 about the country for that purpose. Matthew has given a long
 sermon, which (if his authority is good, but which is much to be
 doubted since he imposes so much,) Jesus preached to a multitude
 upon a mountain, and it would be a quibble to say that a mountain
 is not a street, since it is a place equally as public.</p>
 
 <p>     The last verse in the passage (the 4th) as it stands in
 Isaiah, and which Matthew has not quoted, says, "He shall not fail
 nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the Earth and the
 Isles shall wait for his law." This also applies to Cyrus. He was
 not discouraged, he did not fail, he conquered all Babylon,
 liberated the Jews, and established laws. But this cannot be said
 of Jesus Christ, who in the passage before us, according to
 Matthew, [xii. 15], withdrew himself for fear of the Pharisees, and
 charged the people that followed him not to make it known where he
 was; and who, according to other parts of the Testament, was
 continually moving from place to place to avoid being apprehended.
 [NOTE by PAINE: In the second part of the 'Age of Reason,' I have
 shown that the book ascribed to Isaiah is not only miscellaneous as
 to matter, but as to authorship; that there are parts in it which
 could not be written by Isaiah, because they speak of things one
 hundred and fifty years after he was dead. The instance I have
 given of this, in that work, corresponds with the subject I am
 upon, at least a little better than Matthew's introduction and his
 question.</p>
 
 <p>     Isaiah lived, the latter part of his life, in the time of
 Hezekiah, and it was about one hundred and fifty years from the
 death of Hezekiah to the first year of the reign of Cyrus, when
 Cyrus published a proclamation, which is given in Ezra i., for the
 return of the Jews to Jerusalem. It cannot be doubted, at least it
 ought not to be doubted, that the Jews would feel an affectionate
 gratitude for this act of benevolent justice, and it is natural
 they would express that gratitude in the customary stile,
 bombastical and hyperbolical as it was, which they used on
 extraordinary occasions, and which was and still is in practice
 with all the eastern nations.</p>
 
 <p>     The instance to which I refer, and which is given in the
 second part of the Age of Reason, Is. xliv. 28 and xlv. 1, in these
 words: "That saith of Cyrus, he is my shepherd and shall perform
 all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusaalm, Thou shalt be built, and
 to the Temple, Thy foundation shall be laid. Thus saith the Lard to
 his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden to subdue
 nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open
 before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut."</p>
 
 <p>     This complimentary address is in the present tense, which
 shows that the things of which it speaks were in existence at the
 time of writing it; and consequently that the author must have been
 at least one hundred and fifty years later than Isaiah, and that
 the book which bears his name is a compilation. The Proverbs called
 Solomon's, and the Psalms called David's, are of the same kind. The
 last two verses of the second book of Chronicles, and the first
 three verses of Ezra i. are word for word the same; which show that
 the compilers of the Bible mixed the writings of different authors
 together, and put them under some common head.</p>
 
 <p>     As we have here an instance in Isaiah xliv. and xlv. of the
 introduction of the name of Cyrus into a book to which it cannot
 belong, it affords good ground to conclude, that the passage in
 chapter xlii., in which the character of Cyrus is given without his
 name, has been introduced in like manner, and that the person there
 spoken of is Cyrus. -- Author.]</p>
 
 <p>     But it is immaterial to us, at this distance of time, to know
 who the person was: it is sufficient to the purpose I am upon, that
 of detecting fraud and falsehood, to know who it was not, and to
 show it was not the person called Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the ninth passage called a prophecy of Jesus
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew xxi. 1-5. "And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and
 were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent
 two of his disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over
 against you, and straightway ye shall find an Ass tied, and a colt
 with her; loose them and bring them unto me. And if any man say
 ought to you, ye shall say, the Lord hath need of them, and
 straightway he will send them. All this was done that it might be
 fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the
 daughter of Sion, Behold thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and
 sitting upon an Ass, and a colt the foal of an Ass."</p>
 
 <p>     Poor ass! let it be some consolation amidst all thy
 sufferings, that if the heathen world erected a Bear into a
 constellation, the christian world has elevated thee into a
 prophecy.</p>
 
 <p>     This passage is in Zechariah ix. 9, and is one of the whims of
 friend Zechariah to congratulate his countrymen, who were then
 returning from captivity in Babylon, and himself with them, to
 Jerusalem. It has no concern with any other subject. It is strange
 that apostles, priests, and commentators, never permit, or never
 suppose, the Jews to be speaking of their own affairs. Every thing
 in the Jewish books is perverted and distorted into meanings never
 intended by the writers. Even the poor ass must not be a Jew-ass
 but a Christian-ass. I wonder they did not make an apostle of him,
 or a bishop, or at least make him speak and prophesy. He could have
 lifted up his voice as loud as any of them.</p>
 
 <p>     Zechariah, in the first chapter of his book, indulges himself
 in several whims on the joy of getting back to Jerusalem. He says
 at the 8th verse, "I saw by night [Zechariah was a sharp-sighted 
 seer] and behold a man setting on a red horse, [yes reader, a red
 horse,] and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the
 bottom, and behind him were red horses, speckled and white." He
 says nothing about green horses, nor blue horses, perhaps because
 it is difficult to distinguish green from blue by night, but a
 christian can have no doubt they were there, because "faith is the
 evidence of things not seen."</p>
 
 <p>     Zechariah then introduces an angel among his horses, but he
 does not tell us what color the angel was of, whether black or
 white, nor whether he came to buy horses, or only to look at them
 as curiosities, for certainly they were of that kind. Be this
 however as it may, he enters into conversation with this angel on
 the joyful affair of getting back to Jerusalem, and he saith at the
 16th verse, "Therefore, thus saith the Lord, I AM RETURNED to
 Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it saith the
 Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem."
 An expression signifying the rebuilding the city.</p>
 
 <p>     All this, whimsical and imaginary as it is, sufficiently
 proves that it was the entry of the Jews into Jerusalem from
 captivity, and not the entry of Jesus Christ seven hundred years
 afterwards, that is the subject upon which Zechariah is always
 speaking.</p>
 
 <p>     As to the expression of riding upon an ass, which commentators
 represent as a sign of humility in Jesus Christ, the case is, he
 never was so well mounted before. The asses of those countries are
 large and well proportioned, and were anciently the chief of riding
 animals. Their beasts of burden, and which served also for the
 conveyance of the poor, were camels and dromedaries. We read in
 Judges X. 4, that Jair [one of the judges of Israel] "had thirty
 sons that rode on thirty ass-colts, and they had thirty cities."
 But commentators distort every thing.</p>
 
 <p>     There is besides very reasonable grounds to conclude that this
 story of Jesus riding publicly into Jerusalem, accompanied, as it
 is said at verses 8 and 9, by a great multitude, shouting and
 rejoicing and spreading their garments by the way, is a story
 altogether destitute of truth.</p>
 
 <p>     In the last passage called a prophecy that I examined, Jesus
 is represented as withdrawing, that is, running away, and
 concealing himself for fear of being apprehended, and charging the
 people that were with him not to make him known. No new
 circumstance had arisen in the interim to change his condition for
 the better; yet here he is represented as making his public entry
 into the same city from which he had fled for safety. The two cases
 contradict each other so much, that if both are not false, one of
 them at least can scarcely be true. For my own part, I do not
 believe there is one word of historical truth in the whole book. I
 look upon it at best to be a romance: the principal personage of
 which is an imaginary or allegorical character founded upon some
 tale, and in which the moral is in many parts good, and the
 narrative part very badly and blunderingly written.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the tenth passage called a prophecy of Jesus 
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew xxvi. 51-56: "And behold one of them which was with
 Jesus [meaning Peter] stretched out his hand, and drew his sword,
 and struck a servant of the high priest, and smote off his ear.
 Then said Jesus unto him, put up again thy sword into its place:
 for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
 presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then
 shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be? In that
 same hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against
 a thief, with swords and with staves for to take me? I sat daily
 with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. But all
 this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be
 fulfilled."</p>
 
 <p>     This loose and general manner of speaking, admits neither of
 detection nor of proof. Here is no quotation given, nor the name of
 any bible author mentioned, to which reference can be had.</p>
 
 <p>     There are, however, some high improbabilities against the
 truth of the account.</p>
 
 <p>     First -- It is not probable that the Jews, who were then a
 conquered people, and under subjection to the Romans, should be
 permitted to wear swords.</p>
 
 <p>     Secondly -- If Peter had attacked the servant of the high
 priest and cut off his ear, he would have been immediately taken up
 by the guard that took up his master and sent to prison with him.</p>
 
 <p>     Thirdly -- What sort of disciples and preaching apostles must
 those of Christ have been that wore swords?</p>
 
 <p>     Fourthly -- This scene is represented to have taken place the
 same evening of what is called the Lord's supper, which makes,
 according to the ceremony of it, the inconsistency of wearing
 swords the greater.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the eleventh passage called a prophecy of Jesus
 Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew xxvii. 3-10: "Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when
 he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again
 the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
 saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.
 And they said, What is that to us, see thou to that. And he cast
 down the thirty pieces of silver, and departed, and went and hanged
 himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, it
 is not lawful to put them in the treasury, because it is the price
 of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
 field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field is called the
 field of blood unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was
 spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty
 pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of
 the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the potter's
 field, as the Lord appointed me."</p>
 
 <p>     This is a most barefaced piece of imposition. The passage in
 Jeremiah which speaks of the purchase of a field, has no more to do
 with the case to which Matthew applies it, than it has to do with
 the purchase of lands in America. I will recite the whole passage:</p>
 
 <p><cite>
      Jeremiah xxxii. 6-15: "And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord
 came unto me, saying, Behold Hanameel, the son of Shallum thine
 uncle, shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in
 Anathoth, for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. So
 Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison,
 according to the word of the Lord, and said unto me, Buy my field
 I pray thee that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of
 Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption
 is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew this was the word of the
 Lord. And I bought the field of Hanameel mine uncle's son, that was
 in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of
 silver. And I subscribed the evidence and sealed it, and took
 witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances. So I took the
 evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to
 the law and custom, and that which was open; and I gave the
 evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of
 Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the
 presence of the witnesses that subscribed [the book of the
 purchase,] before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
 And I charged Baruch before them, saying, Thus saith the Lord of
 hosts, the God of Israel: Take these evidences, this evidence of
 the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is
 open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue
 many days. For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
 Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this
 land."<p>
 </p></cite>
 
      I forbear making any remark on this abominable imposition of
 Matthew. The thing glaringly speaks for itself. It is priests and
 commentators that I rather ought to censure, for having preached
 falsehood so long, and kept people in darkness with respect to
 those impositions. I am not contending with these men upon points
 of doctrine, for I know that sophistry has always a city of refuge.
 I am speaking of facts; for wherever the thing called a fact is a
 falsehood, the faith founded upon it is delusion, and the doctrine
 raised upon it not true. Ah, reader, put thy trust in thy creator,
 and thou wilt be safe; but if thou trustest to the book called the
 scriptures thou trustest to the rotten staff of fable and
 falsehood. But I return to my subject.</p>
 
 <p>     There is among the whims and reveries of Zechariah, mention
 made of thirty pieces of silver given to a Potter. They can hardly
 have been so stupid as to mistake a potter for a field: and if they
 had, the passage in Zechariah has no more to do with Jesus, Judas,
 and the field to bury strangers in, than that already quoted. I
 will recite the passage.</p>
 
 <p>     Zechariah xi. 7-14: "And I will feed the flock of slaughter,
 even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the
 one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the
 flock. Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul
 loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me. Then said I, I will 
 not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be
 cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the
 flesh of another. -- And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it
 asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all
 the people. And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the
 flock who waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. And
 I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price, and if not,
 forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And
 the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter; a goodly price that
 I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver,
 and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord. Then I cut
 asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the
 brotherhood between Judah and Israel." [NOTE by PAINE: Whiston, in
 his Essay on the Old Testament, says, that the passage of Zechariah
 of which I have spoken, was, in the copies of the Bible of the
 first century, in the book of Jeremiah, from whence, says he, it
 was taken and inserted without coherence in that of Zechariah.
 Well, let it be so, it does not make the case a whit the better for
 the New Testament; but it makes the case a great deal the worse for
 the Old. Because it shows, as I have mentioned respecting some
 passages in a book ascribed to Isaiah, that the works of different
 authors have been so mixed and confounded together, they cannot now
 be discriminated, except where they are historical, chronological,
 or biographical, as in the interpolation in Isaiah. It is the name
 of Cyrus, inserted where it could not be inserted, as he was not in
 existence till one hundred and fifty years after the time of
 Isaiah, that detects the interpolation and the blunder with it.</p>
 
 <p>     Whiston was a man of great literary learning, and what is of
 much higher degree, of deep scientific learning. He was one of the
 best and most celebrated mathematicians of his time, for which he
 was made professor of mathematics of the University of Cambridge.
 He wrote so much in defence of the Old Testament, and of what he
 calls prophecies of Jesus Christ, that at last he began to suspect
 the truth of the Scriptures, and wrote against them; for it is only
 those who examine them, that see the imposition. Those who believe
 them most, are those who know least about them.</p>
 
 <p>     Whiston, after writing so much in defence of the Scriptures,
 was at last prosecuted for writing against them. It was this that
 gave occasion to Swift, in his ludicrous epigram on Ditton and
 Whiston, each of which set up to find out the longitude, to call
 the one good master Ditton and the other wicked Will Whiston. But
 as Swift was a great associate with the Freethinkers of those days,
 such as Bolingbroke, Pope, and others, who did not believe the book
 called the scriptures, there is no certainty whether he wittily
 called him wicked for defending the scriptures, or for writing
 against them. The known character of Swift decides for the former.
 -- Author.]</p>
 
 <p>     There is no making either head or tail of this incoherent
 gibberish. His two staves, one called Beauty and the other Bands,
 is so much like a fairy tale, that I doubt if it had any other
 origin. There is, however, no part that has the least relation to
 the case stated in Matthew; on the contrary, it is the reverse of
 it. Here the thirty Pieces of silver, whatever it was for, is
 called a goodly price, it was as much as the thing was worth, and 
 according to the language of the day, was approved of by the Lord,
 and the money given to the potter in the house of the Lord. In the
 case of Jesus and Judas, as stated in Matthew, the thirty pieces of
 silver were the price of blood; the transaction was condemned by
 the Lord, and the money when refunded was refused admittance into
 the Treasury. Every thing in the two cases is the reverse of each
 other.</p>
 
 <p>     Besides this, a very different and direct contrary account to
 that of Matthew, is given of the affair of Judas, in the book
 called the Acts of the Apostles; according to that book the case
 is, that so far from Judas repenting and returning the money, and
 the high priest buying a field with it to bury strangers in, Judas
 kept the money and bought a field with it for himself; and instead
 of hanging himself as Matthew says, that he fell headlong and burst
 asunder. Some commentators endeavor to get over one part of the
 contradiction by ridiculously supposing that Judas hanged himself
 first and the rope broke.</p>
 
 <p>     Acts i. 16-18: "Men and brethren, this scripture must needs
 have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David
 spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took
 Jesus, [David says not a word about Judas,] for he [Judas] was
 numbered among us and obtained part of our ministry. Now this man
 purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling
 headlong, he burst asunder in the midst and his bowels gushed out."</p>
 
 <p>     Is it not a species of blasphemy to call the New Testament
 revealed religion, when we see in it such contradictions and
 absurdities? I pass on to the twelfth passage called a prophecy of
 Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew xxvii. 35. "And they crucified him, and parted his
 garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
 by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my
 vesture did they cast lots." This expression is in Psalm xxii. 18.
 The writer of that Psalm (who-ever he was, for the Psalms are a
 collection and not the work of one man) is speaking of himself and
 his own case, and not that of another. He begins this Psalm with
 the words which the New Testament writers ascribed to Jesus Christ:
 "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me" -- words which might be
 uttered by a complaining man without any great impropriety, but
 very improperly from the mouth of a reputed God.</p>
 
 <p>     The picture which the writer draws of his own situation, in
 this Psalm, is gloomy enough. He is not prophesying, but
 complaining of his own hard case. He represents himself as
 surrounded by enemies and beset by persecutions of every kind; and
 by way of showing the inveteracy of his persecutors he says, "They
 parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture." The
 expression is in the present tense; and is the same as to say, they
 pursue me even to the clothes upon my back, and dispute how they
 shall divide them. Besides, the word vesture does not always mean
 clothing of any kind, but property, or rather the admitting a man
 to, or investing him with property; and as it is used in this Psalm
 distinct from the word garment, it appears to be used in this  
 sense. But Jesus had no property; for they make him say of himself,
 "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the
 Son of Man hath not where to lay his head."</p>
 
 <p>     But be this as it may, if we permit ourselves to suppose the
 Almighty would condescend to tell, by what is called the spirit of
 prophecy, what could come to pass in some future age of the world,
 it is an injury to our own faculties, and to our ideas of his
 greatness, to imagine that it would be about an old coat, or an old
 pair of breeches, or about any thing which the common accidents of
 life, or the quarrels which attend it, exhibit every day.</p>
 
 <p>     That which is in the power of man to do, or in his will not to
 do, is not a subject for prophecy, even if there were such a thing,
 because it cannot carry with it any evidence of divine power, or
 divine interposition. The ways of God are not the ways of men. That
 which an almighty power performs, or wills, is not within the
 circle of human power to do, or to control. But any executioner and
 his assistants might quarrel about dividing the garments of a
 sufferer, or divide them without quarrelling, and by that means
 fulfil the thing called a prophecy, or set it aside.</p>
 
 <p>     In the passages before examined, I have exposed the falsehood
 of them. In this I exhibit its degrading meanness, as an insult to
 the creator and an injury to human. reason.</p>
 
 <p>     Here end the passages called prophecies by Matthew.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew concludes his book by saying, that when Christ expired
 on the cross, the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the bodies of
 many of the saints arose; and Mark says, there was darkness over
 the land from the sixth hour until the ninth. They produce no
 prophecy for this; but had these things been facts, they would have
 been a proper subject for prophecy, because none but an almighty
 power could have inspired a fore-knowledge of them, and afterwards
 fulfilled them. Since then there is no such prophecy, but a
 pretended prophecy of an old coat, the proper deduction is, there
 were no such things, and that the book of Matthew was fable and
 falsehood.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the book called the Gospel according to St.
 Mark.</p>
 
 <p></p><hr>
 
 <h2>THE BOOK OF MARK</h2>
 
      There are but few passages in Mark called prophecies; and but
 few in Luke and John. Such as there are I shall examine, and also
 such other passages as interfere with those cited by Matthew.
 
 <p>     Mark begins his book by a passage which he puts in the shape
 of a prophecy. Mark i. 1,2. "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
 Christ, the Son of God; As it is written in the prophets, Behold I
 send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way
 before thee." (Malachi iii. 1.) The passage in the original is in
 the first person. Mark makes this passage to be a prophecy of John
 the Baptist, said by the Church to be a forerunner of Jesus Christ.
 But if we attend to the verses that follow this expression, as it 
 stands in Malachi, and to the first and fifth verses of the next
 chapter, we shall see that this application of it is erroneous and
 false.</p>
 
 <p>     Malachi having said, at the first verse, "Behold I will send
 my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me," says, at the
 second verse, "But who may abide the day of his coming? And who
 shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and
 like fuller's soap." This description can have no reference to the
 birth of Jesus Christ, and consequently none to John the Baptist.
 It is a scene of fear and terror that is here described, and the
 birth of Christ is always spoken of as a time of joy and glad
 tidings.</p>
 
 <p>     Malachi, continuing to speak on the same subject, explains in
 the next chapter what the scene is of which he speaks in the verses
 above quoted, and whom the person is whom he calls the messenger.</p>
 
 <p>     "Behold," says he, (iv. 1,) "the day cometh that shall burn
 like an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly,
 shall be stubble; and the day cometh that shall burn them up, saith
 the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
 branch." Verse 5. "Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before
 the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord."</p>
 
 <p>     By what right, or by what imposition or ignorance Mark has
 made Elijah into John the Baptist, and Malachi's description of the
 day of judgment into the birth day of Christ, I leave to the Bishop
 [of Llandaff] to settle.</p>
 
 <p>     Mark, (i. 2,3), confounds two passages together, taken from
 different books of the Old Testament. The second verse, "Behold I
 send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way
 before thee," is taken, as I have said before, from Malachi. The
 third verse, which says, "The voice of one crying in the
 wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths
 straight," is not in Malachi, but in Isaiah, xl. 3, Whiston says
 that both these verses were originally in Isaiah. If so, it is
 another instance of the disordered state of the Bible, and
 corroborates what I have said with respect to the name and
 description of Cyrus being in the book of Isaiah, to which it
 cannot chronologically belong.</p>
 
 <p>     The words in Isaiah, -- "The voice of him that cryeth in the
 wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his Paths
 straight," -- are in the present tense, and consequently not
 predictive. It is one of those rhetorical figures which the Old
 Testament authors frequently used. That it is merely rhetorical and
 metaphorical, may be seen at the 6th verse: "And the voice said,
 cry; and he said what shall I cry? All flesh is grass." This is
 evidently nothing but a figure; for flesh is not grass otherwise
 than as a figure or metaphor, where one thing is put for another.
 Besides which, the whole passage is too general and too declamatory
 to be applied exclusively to any particular person or purpose.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass onto the eleventh chapter.</p>
 
 <p>     In this chapter, Mark speaks of Christ riding into Jerusalem
 upon a colt, but he does not make it the accomplishment of a
 prophecy, as Matthew has done, for he says nothing about a
 prophecy. Instead of which he goes on the other tack, and in order
 to add new honors to the ass, he makes it to be a miracle; for he
 says, ver. 2, it was a colt "whereon never man sat;" signifying
 thereby, that as the ass had not been broken, he consequently was
 inspired into good manners, for we do not hear that he kicked Jesus
 Christ off. There is not a word about his kicking in all the four
 Evangelists.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on from these feats of horsemanship performed upon a
 jack-ass, to the 15th chapter. At the 24th verse of this chapter
 Mark speaks of parting Christ's garments and casting lots upon
 them, but he applies no prophecy to it as Matthew does. He rather
 speaks of it as a thing then in practice with executioners, as it
 is at this day.</p>
 
 <p>     At the 28th verse of the same chapter, Mark speaks of Christ
 being crucified between two thieves; that, says he, the scripture
 might be fulfilled, "which saith, and he was numbered with the
 transgressors." The same might be said of the thieves.</p>
 
 <p>     This expression is in Isaiah Iiii. 12. Grotius applies it to
 Jeremiah. But the case has happened so often in the world, where
 innocent men have been numbered with transgressors, and is still
 continually happening, that it is absurdity to call it a prophecy
 of any particular person. All those whom the church calls martyrs
 were numbered with transgressors. All the honest patriots who fell
 upon the scaffold in France, in the time of Robespierre, were
 numbered with transgressors; and if himself had not fallen, the
 same case according to a note in his own handwriting, had befallen
 me; [NOTE: See vol. iii. p. 222 of this edition of Paine's
 Writings; also Preface to Part of "The Age of Reason" -- Editor.]
 yet I suppose the Bishop [of Llandaff] will not allow that Isaiah
 was prophesying of Thomas Paine.</p>
 
 <p>     These are all the passages in Mark which have any reference to
 prophecies.</p>
 
 <p>     Mark concludes his book by making Jesus to say to his
 disciples, (xvi. 16-18), "Go ye into all the world and preach the
 Gospel to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized shall
 be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned, [fine popish
 stuff this,] and these signs shall follow them that believe: in my
 name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
 they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it
 shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they
 shall recover." [NOTE: These are among the twelve apocryphal verses
 added to Mark. -- Editor.]</p>
 
 <p>     Now, the Bishop, in order to know if he has all this saving
 and wonder-working faith, should try those things upon himself. He
 should take a good dose of arsenic, and if he please, I will send
 him a rattle-snake from America.</p>
 
 <p>     As for myself, as I believe in God and not at all in Jesus
 Christ, nor in the books called the scriptures, the experiment does
 not concern me.</p>
 
 <p>     I pass on to the book of Luke.</p>
 
 <p></p><hr>
 
 <h2>THE BOOK OF LUKE</h2>
 
      There are no passages in Luke called prophecies, excepting
 those which relate to the passages I have already examined.
 
 <p>     Luke speaks of Mary being espoused to Joseph, but he makes no
 references to the passage in Isaiah, as Matthew does. He speaks
 also of Jesus riding into Jerusalem upon a colt, but he says
 nothing about a prophecy. He speaks of John the baptist and refers
 to the passage in Isaiah of which I have already spoken.</p>
 
 <p>     At chapter xiii. 31, 32, he says, "The same day there came
 certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him [Jesus] Get thee out and
 depart hence, for Herod will kill thee. And he said unto them, Go
 ye and tell that fox, Behold I cast out devils, and I do cures to-
 day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be Perfected.</p>
 
 <p>     Matthew makes Herod to die whilst Christ was a child in Egypt,
 and makes Joseph to return with the child on the news of Herod's
 death, who had sought to kill him. Luke makes Herod to be living,
 and to seek the life of Jesus after Jesus was thirty years of age:
 for he says, (iii. 23), "And Jesus began to be about thirty years
 of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph."</p>
 
 <p>     The obscurity in which the historical part of the New
 Testament is involved, with respect to Herod, may afford to priests
 and commentators a plea, which to some may appear plausible, but to
 none satisfactory, that the Herod of which Matthew speaks, and the
 Herod of which Luke speaks, were different persons. Matthew calls
 Herod a king; and Luke (iii. 1) calls Herod Tetrarch (that is,
 Governor) of Galilee. But there could be no such person as a king
 Herod, because the Jews and their country were then under the
 dominion of the Roman Emperors who governed then by Tetrarchs, or
 Governors.</p>
 
 <p>     Luke ii. makes Jesus to be born when Cyrenius was Governor of
 Syria, to which government Judea was annexed; and according to
 this, Jesus was not born in the time of Herod. Luke says nothing
 about Herod seeking the life of Jesus when he was born; nor of his
 destroying the children under two years old; nor of Joseph fleeing
 with Jesus into Egypt; nor of his returning from thence. On the
 contrary, the book of Luke speaks as if the person it calls Christ
 had never been out of Judea, and that Herod sought his life after
 he commenced preaching, as is before stated. I have already shown
 that Luke, in the book called the Acts of the Apostles, (which
 commentators ascribe to Luke,) contradicts the account in Matthew
 with respect to Judas and the thirty pieces of silver. Matthew says
 that Judas returned the money, and that the high priests bought
 with it a field to bury strangers in; Luke says that Judas kept the
 money, and bought a field with it for himself.</p>
 
 <p>     As it is impossible the wisdom of God should err, so it is
 impossible those books should have been written by divine
 inspiration. Our belief in God and his unerring wisdom forbids us
 to believe it. As for myself, I feel religiously happy in the total
 disbelief of it.</p>
 
 <p>     There are no other passages called prophecies in Luke than
 those I have spoken of. I Pass on to the book of John.</p>
 
 <p></p><hr>
 
 <h2>THE BOOK OF JOHN</h2>
 
      John, like Mark and Luke, is not much of a prophecy-monger. He
 speaks of the ass, and the casting lots for Jesus's clothes, and
 some other trifles, of which I have already spoken.
 
 <p>     John makes Jesus to say, (v. 46), "For had ye believed Moses,
 ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me." The book of the
 Acts, in speaking of Jesus says, (iii. 22), "For Moses truly said
 unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto
 you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things
 whatsoever he shall say unto you."</p>
 
 <p>     This passage is in Deuteronomy, xviii. 15. They apply it as a
 prophecy of Jesus. What imposition! The person spoken of in
 Deuteronomy, and also in Numbers, where the same person is spoken
 of, is Joshua, the minister of Moses, and his immediate successor,
 and just such another Robespierrean character as Moses is
 represented to have been. The case, as related in those books, is
 as follows:</p>
 
 <p>     Moses was grown old and near to his end, and in order to
 prevent confusion after his death, for the Israelites had no
 settled system of government, it was thought best to nominate a
 successor to Moses whilst he was yet living. This was done, as we
 are told, in the following manner: Numbers xxvii. 12,13: "And the
 Lord said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see
 the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. And when
 thou hast seen it thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as
 Aaron thy brother is gathered." Ver. I 5-20. "And Moses spoke unto
 the Lord, saying, Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all
 flesh, set a man over the congregation, which may go out before
 them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out,
 and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the Lord be
 not as sheep that have no shepherd. And the Lord said unto Moses,
 take thee oshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and
 lay thine hand upon him; and set him before Eleazar the priest, and
 before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
 And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the
 congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient." Ver.
 22,23. "And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and he took
 Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
 congregation; and he laid hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as
 the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses."</p>
 
 <p>     I have nothing to do, in this place, with the truth, or the
 conjuration here practiced, of raising up a successor to Moses like
 unto himself. The passage sufficiently proves it is Joshua, and 
 that it is an imposition in John to make the case into a prophecy
 of Jesus. But the prophecy-mangers were so inspired with falsehood,
 that they never speak truth. [NOTE by PAINE: Newton, Bishop of
 Bristol in England, published a work in three volumes, entitled,
 "Dissertations on the Prophecies." The work is tediously written
 and tiresome to read. He strains hard to make every passage into a
 prophecy that suits his purpose. Among others, be makes this
 expression of Moses, "the Lord shall raise thee up a prophet like
 unto me," into a prophecy of Christ, who was not born, according to
 the Bible chronologies, till fifteen hundred and fifty-two years
 after the time of Moses; whereas it was an immediate successor to
 Moses, who was then near his end, that is spoken of in the passage
 above quoted. This Bishop, the better to impose this passage on the
 world as a prophecy of Christ, has entirely omitted the account in
 the book of Numbers which I have given at length, word for word,
 and which shows, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the person
 spoken of by Moses is Joshua, find no other person. Newton is but
 a superficial writer. He takes up things upon hear-say, and inserts
 them without either examination or reflection, and the more
 extraordinary and incredible they are, the better be likes them. In
 speaking of the walls of Babylon, (vol. i. p. 263,) he makes a
 quotation from a traveller of the name of Tavernaer, whom he calls,
 (by way of giving credit to what he says,) a celebrated traveller,
 that those walls were made of burnt brick, ten feet square and
 three feet thick. If Newton had only thought of calculating the
 weight of such a brick, he would have seen the impossibility of
 their being used or even made. A brick ten feet square, and three
 feet thick, contains 300 cubic feet, and allowing a cubic foot of
 brick to be only one hundred pounds, each of the Bishop's bricks
 would weigh 30,000 pounds; and it would take about thirty cart
 loads of clay (one horse carts) to make one brick. But his account
 of the stones used in the building of Solomon's temple, (vol. ii.
 p. 211,) far exceeds his bricks of ten feet square in the walls of
 Babylon; these are but brick-bats compared to them. The stones
 (says he) employed in the foundation, were in magnitude forty
 cubits, (that is above sixty feet, a cubit, says he, being somewhat
 more than one foot and a half, (a cubit is one foot nine inches,)
 and the superstructure (says this Bishop) was worthy of such
 foundations. There were some stones, says he, of the whitest marble
 forty-five cubits long, five cubits high, and six cubits broad.
 These are the dimensions this Bishop has given, which, in measure
 of twelve inches to a foot, is 78 feet 9 inches long, 10 feet 6
 inches broad, and 8 feet 3 inches thick, and contains 7,234 cubic
 feet.</p>
 
 <p>     I now go to demonstrate the imposition of this Bishop. A cubic
 foot of water weighs sixty-two pounds and a half. The specific
 gravity of marble to water is as 2 1-2 is to one. The weight,
 therefore, of a cubic foot of marble is 156 pounds, which,
 multiplied by 7,234, the number of cubic feet in one of those
 stones, makes the weight of it to be 1,128,504 pounds, which is 503
 tons. Allowing then a horse to draw about half a ton, it will
 require a thousand horses to draw one such stone on the ground; how
 then were they to be lifted into the building by human hands? The
 Bishop may talk of faith removing mountains, but all the faith of
 all the Bishops that ever lived could not remove one of those
 stones, and their bodily strength given in.</p>
 
 <p>     This Bishop also tells of great guns used by the Turks at the
 taking of Constantinople, one of which, he says, was drawn by
 seventy yoke of oxen, and by two thousand men. (Vol. iii. p. 117.)
 The weight of a cannon that carries a ball of 43 pounds, which is
 the largest cannon that are cast, weighs 8,000 pounds, about three
 tons and a half, and may be drawn by three yoke of oxen. Any body
 may now calculate what the weight of the Bishop's great gun must
 be, that required seventy yoke of oxen to draw it. This Bishop
 beats Gulliver.</p>
 
 <p>     When men give up the use of the divine gift of reason in
 writing on any subject, be it religious or any thing else, there
 are no bounds to their extravagance, no limit to their absurdities.
 The three volumes which this Bishop has written on what he calls
 the prophecies, contain above 1,200 pages, and he says in vol. iii.
 p. 117, "I have studied brevity." This is as marvelous as the
 Bishop's great gun. -- Author.]</p>
 
 <p>     I pass to the last passage, in these fables of the
 Evangelists, called a prophecy of Jesus Christ.</p>
 
 <p>     John, having spoken of Jesus expiring on the cross between two
 thieves, says, (xix. 32, 33), "Then came the soldiers and brake the
 legs of the first [meaning one of the thieves] and of the other
 which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw
 that he was dead already, they brake not his legs." Verse 36. "For
 these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A
 bone of him shall not be broken."</p>
 
 <p>     The passage here referred to is in Exodus, and has no more to
 do with Jesus than with the ass he rode upon to Jerusalem; nor yet
 so much, if a roasted jack-ass, like a roasted he-goat, might be
 eaten at a Jewish passover. It might be some consolation to an ass
 to know that though his bones might be picked, they would not be
 broken. I go to state the case.</p>
 
 <p>     The book of Exodus, in instituting the Jewish passover, in
 which they were to eat a he-lamb, or a he-goat, says, (xii. 5),
 "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye
 shall take it from the sheep or from the goats." The book, after
 stating some ceremonies to be used in killing and dressing it, (for
 it was to be roasted, not boiled,) says, (ver. 43-48), "And the
 Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the
 passover: there shall no stranger eat thereof; but every man's
 servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him,
 then shall he eat thereof, A foreigner shall not eat thereof. In
 one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of
 the flesh thereof abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break
 a bone thereof."</p>
 
 <p>     We here see that the case as it stands in Exodus is a ceremony
 and not a prophecy, and totally unconnected with Jesus's bones, or
 any part of him.</p>
 
 <p>     John, having thus filled up the measure of apostolic fable,
 concludes his book with something that beats all fable; for he says
 at the last verse, "And there are also many other things which 
 Jesus did, the which if they could be written every one, -- I
 suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that
 should be written." [NOTE: This belongs to the part of John now
 admitted to be spurious. -- Editor.]</p>
 
 <p>     This is what in vulgar life is called a thumper; that is, not
 only a lie, but a lie beyond the line of possibility; besides which
 it is an absurdity, for if they should be written in the world, the
 world would contain them. -- Here ends the examination of the
 passages called prophecies.</p>
 
 <p></p><hr>
 
      I HAVE now, reader, gone through and examined all the passages
 which the four books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, quote from
 the Old Testament and call them prophecies of Jesus Christ. When I
 first sat down to this examination, I expected to find cause for
 some censure, but little did I expect to find them so utterly
 destitute of truth, and of all pretensions to it, as I have shown
 them to be.
 
 <p>     The practice which the writers of these books employ is not
 more false than it is absurd. They state some trifling case of the
 person they call Jesus Christ, and then cut out a sentence from
 some passage of the Old Testament and call it a prophecy of that
 case. But when the words thus cut out are restored to the place
 they are taken from, and read with the words before and after them,
 they give the lie to the New Testament. A short instance or two of
 this will suffice for the whole.</p>
 
 <p>     They make Joseph to dream of an angel, who informs him that
 Herod is dead, and tells him to come with the child out of Egypt.
 They then cut out a sentence from the book of Hosea, "Out of Egypt
 have I called my Son," and apply it as a prophecy in that case. The
 words, "And called my Son out of Egypt," are in the Bible. But what
 of that? They are only part of a passage, and not a whole passage,
 and stand immediately connected with other words which show they
 refer to the children of Israel coming out of Egypt in the time of
 Pharaoh, and to the idolatry they committed afterwards.</p>
 
 <p>     Again, they tell us that when the soldiers came to break the
 legs of the crucified persons, they found Jesus was already dead,
 and, therefore, did not break his. They then, with some alteration
 of the original, cut out a sentence from Exodus, "a bone of him
 shall not be broken," and apply it as a prophecy of that case. The
 words "Neither shall ye break a bone thereof," (for they have
 altered the text,) are in the Bible. But what of that? They are, as
 in the former case, only part of a passage, and not a whole
 passage, and when read with the words they are immediately joined
 to, show it is the bones of a he-lamb or a he-goat of which the
 passage speaks.</p>
 
 <p>     These repeated forgeries and falsifications create a well-
 founded suspicion that all the cases spoken of concerning the
 person called Jesus Christ are made cases, on purpose to lug in,
 and that very clumsily, some broken sentences from the Old
 Testament, and apply them as prophecies of those cases; and that so
 far from his being the Son of God, he did not exist even as a man
 -- that he is merely an imaginary or allegorical character, as 
 Apollo, Hercules, Jupiter, and all the deities of antiquity were.
 There is no history written at the time Jesus Christ is said to
 have lived that speaks of the existence of such a person, even as
 a man.</p>
 
 <p>     Did we find in any other book pretending to give a system of
 religion, the falsehoods, falsifications, contradictions, and
 absurdities, which are to be met with in almost every page of the
 Old and New Testament, all the priests of the present day, who
 supposed themselves capable, would triumphantly shew their skill in
 criticism, and cry it down as a most glaring imposition. But since
 the books in question belong to their own trade and profession,
 they, or at least many of them, seek to stifle every inquiry into
 them and abuse those who have the honesty and the courage to do it.</p>
 
 <p>     When a book, as is the case with the Old and New Testament, is
 ushered into the world under the title of being the WORD OF GOD, it
 ought to be examined with the utmost strictness, in order to know
 if it has a well founded claim to that title or not, and whether we
 are or are not imposed upon: for as no poison is so dangerous as
 that which poisons the physic, so no falsehood is so fatal as that
 which is made an article of faith.</p>
 
 <p>     This examination becomes more necessary, because when the New
 Testament was written, I might say invented, the art of printing
 was not known, and there were no other copies of the Old Testament
 than written copies. A written copy of that book would cost about
 as much as six hundred common printed bibles now cost. Consequently
 the book was in the hands of very few persons, and these chiefly of
 the Church. This gave an opportunity to the writers of the New
 Testament to make quotations from the Old Testament as they
 pleased, and call them prophecies, with very little danger of being
 detected. Besides which, the terrors and inquisitorial fury of the
 Church, like what they tell us of the flaming sword that turned
 every way, stood sentry over the New Testament; and time, which
 brings every thing else to light, has served to thicken the
 darkness that guards it from detection.</p>
 
 <p>     Were the New Testament now to appear for the first time, every
 priest of the present day would examine it line by line, and
 compare the detached sentences it calls prophecies with the whole
 passages in the Old Testament from whence they are taken. Why then
 do they not make the same examination at this time, as they would
 make had the New Testament never appeared before? If it be proper
 and right to make it in one case, it is equally proper and right to
 do it in the other case. Length of time can make no difference in
 the right to do it at any time. But, instead of doing this, they go
 on as their predecessors went on before them, to tell the people
 there are prophecies of Jesus Christ, when the truth is there are
 none.</p>
 
 <p>     They tell us that Jesus rose from the dead, and ascended into
 heaven. It is very easy to say so; a great lie is as easily told as
 a little one. But if he had done so, those would have been the only
 circumstances respecting him that would have differed from the
 common lot of man; and, consequently, the only case that would
 apply exclusively to him, as prophecy, would be some passage in the
 Old Testament that foretold such things of him. But there is not a
 passage in the Old Testament that speaks of a person who, after
 being crucified, dead, and buried, should rise from the dead, and
 ascend into heaven. Our prophecy-mangers supply the silence the Old
 Testament guards upon such things, by telling us of passages they
 call prophecies, and that falsely so, about Joseph's dream, old
 clothes, broken bones, and such like trifling stuff.</p>
 
 <p>     In writing upon this, as upon every other subject, I speak a
 language full and intelligible. I deal not in hints and
 intimations. I have several reasons for this: First, that I may be
 clearly understood. Secondly, that it may be seen I am in earnest;
 and thirdly, because it is an affront to truth to treat falsehood
 with complaisance.</p>
 
 <p>     I will close this treatise with a subject I have already
 touched upon in the First Part of the Age of Reason.</p>
 
 <p>     The world has been amused with the term revealed religion, and
 the generality of priests apply this term to the books called the
 Old and New Testament. The Mahometans apply the same term to the
 Koran. There is no man that believes in revealed religion stronger
 than I do but it is not the reveries of the Old and New Testament,
 nor of the Koran, that I dignify with that sacred title. That which
 is revelation to me, exists in something which no human mind can
 invent, no human hand can counterfeit or alter.</p>
 
 <p>     The Word of God is the Creation we behold; and this word of
 God revealeth to man all that is necessary for man to know of his
 creator. Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the
 immensity of his creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We
 see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible
 whole is governed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We
 see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want
 to contemplate his mercy? We see it in his not withholding that
 abundance, even from the unthankful. Do we want to contemplate his
 will, so far as it respects man? The goodness he shows to all is a
 lesson for our conduct to each other.</p>
 
 <p>     In fine -- Do we want to know what God is? Search not the book
 called the Scripture, which any human hand might make, or any
 impostor invent; but the SCRIPTURE CALLED THE CREATION.</p>
 
 <p>     When, in the first part of the Age of Reason, I called the
 Creation the true revelation of God to man, I did not know that any
 other person had expressed the same idea. But I lately met with the
 writings of Doctor Conyers Middleton, published the beginning of
 last century, in which he expresses himself in the same manner,
 with respect to the Creation, as I have done in the Age of Reason.
 He was principal librarian of the University of Cambridge, in
 England, which furnished him with extensive opportunities of
 reading, and necessarily required he should be well acquainted with
 the dead as well as the living languages. He was a man of a strong
 original mind, had the courage to think for himself, and the
 honesty to speak his thoughts. He made a journey to Rome, from
 whence he wrote letters to show that the forms and ceremonies of
 the Romish Christian Church were taken from the degenerate state of
 the heathen mythology, as it stood in the latter times of the
 Greeks and Romans. He attacked without ceremony the miracles which
 the Church pretended to perform; and in one of his treatises, he
 calls the creation a revelation. The priests of England, of that
 day, in order to defend their citadel, by first defending its out-
 works, attacked him for attacking the Roman ceremonies; and one of
 them censures him for calling the creation a revelation. He thus
 replies to him:</p>
 
 <p>     "One of them," says he, "appears to be scandalized by the
 title of revelation which I have given to that discovery which God
 made of himself in the visible works of his creation. Yet it is no
 other than what the wise in all ages have given to it, who consider
 it as the most authentic and indisputable revelation which God has
 ever given of himself, from the beginning of the world to this day.
 It was this by which the first notice of him was revealed to the
 inhabitants of the earth, and by which alone it has been kept up
 ever since among the several nations of it. From this the reason of
 man was enabled to trace out his nature and attributes, and, by a
 gradual deduction of consequences, to learn his own nature also,
 with all the duties belonging to it, which relate either to God or
 to his fellow-creatures. This constitution of things was ordained
 by God, as an universal law, or rule of conduct to man; the source
 of all his knowledge; the test of all truth, by which all
 subsequent revelations, which are supposed to have been given by
 God in any other manner must be tried, and cannot be received as
 divine any further than as they are found to tally and coincide
 with this original standard.</p>
 
 <p>     "It was this divine law which I referred to in the passage
 above recited, [meaning the passage on which they had attacked
 him,] being desirous to excite the reader's attention to it, as it
 would enable him to judge more freely of the argument I was
 handling. For by contemplating this law, he would discover the
 genuine way which God himself has marked out to us for the
 acquisition of true knowledge; not from the authority or reports of
 our fellow-creatures, but from the information of the facts and
 material objects which, in his providential distribution of worldly
 things, he hath presented to the perpetual observation of our
 senses. For as it was from these that his existence and nature, the
 most important articles of all knowledge, were first discovered to
 man, so that grand discovery furnished new light towards tracing
 out the rest, and made all the inferior subjects of human knowledge
 more easily discoverable to us by the same method.</p>
 
 <p>     "I had another view likewise in the same passage, and
 applicable to the same end, of giving the reader a more enlarged
 notion of the question in dispute, who, by turning his thoughts to
 reflect on the works of the Creator, as they are manifested to us
 in this fabric of the world, could not fail to observe that they
 are all of them great, noble, and suitable to the majesty of his
 nature; carrying with them the proofs of their origin, and showing
 themselves to be the production of an all-wise and almighty being;
 and by accustoming his mind to these sublime reflections, he will
 be prepared to determine whether those miraculous interpositions,
 so confidently affirmed to us by the primitive fathers, can
 reasonably be thought to make a part in the grand scheme of the 
 Divine administration, or whether it be agreeable that God, who
 created all things by his will, and can give what turn to them he
 pleases by the same will, should, for the particular purposes of
 his government and the services of the church, descend to the
 expedient of visions and revelations, granted sometimes to boys for
 the instruction of the elders, and sometimes to women to settle the
 fashion and length of their veils, and sometimes to Pastors of the
 Church to enjoin them to ordain one man a lecturer, another a
 priest; or that he should scatter a profusion of miracles around
 the stake of a martyr, yet all of them vain and insignificant, and
 without any sensible effect, either of preserving the life or
 easing the sufferings of the saint, or even of mortifying his
 persecutors, who were always left to enjoy the full triumph of
 their cruelty, and the poor martyr to expire in a miserable death.
 When these things, I say, are brought to the original test, and
 compared with the genuine and indisputable works of the Creator,
 how minute, how trifling, how contemptible must they be? And how
 incredible must it be thought that, for the instruction of his
 Church, God should employ ministers so precarious, unsatisfactory,
 and inadequate, as the extacies of women and boys, and the visions
 of interested priests, which were derided at the very time by men
 of sense to whom they were proposed.</p>
 
 <p>     "That this universal law [continues Middleton, meaning the law
 revealed in the works of the creation] was actually revealed to the
 heathen world long before the gospel was known, we learn from all
 the principal sages of antiquity, who made it the capital subject
 of their studies and writings.</p>
 
 <p>     "Cicero [says Middleton] has given us a short abstract of it,
 in a fragment still remaining from one of his books on government,
 which [says Middleton] I shall here transcribe in his own words, as
 they will illustrate my sense also, in the passages that appear so
 dark and dangerous to my antagonist:</p>
 
 <p>     "The true law, [it is Cicero who speaks] is right reason,
 conformable to the nature of things, constant, eternal, diffused
 through all, which calls us to duty by commanding, deters us from
 sin by forbidding; which never loses its influence with the good,
 nor ever preserves it with the wicked. This law cannot be over-
 ruled by any other, nor abrogated in whole or in part; nor can we
 be absolved from it either by the senate or by the people; nor are
 we to seek any other comment or interpreter of it but himself; nor
 can there be one law at Rome and another at Athens; one now and
 another hereafter; but the same eternal immutable law comprehends
 all nations at all times, under one common master and governor of
 all -- GOD. He is the inventor, propounder, enactor of this law;
 and whoever will not obey it must first renounce himself, and throw
 off the nature of man; by doing which, he will suffer the greatest
 punishments though he should escape all the other torments which
 are commonly believed to be prepared for the wicked.' Here ends the
 quotation from Cicero.</p>
 
 <p>     Our Doctors [continues Middleton] perhaps will look on this as
 RANK DEISM; but let them call it what they will, I shall ever avow
 and defend it as the fundamental, essential, and vital part of all
 true religion." Here ends the quotation from Middleton.</p>
 
 <p>     I have here given the reader two sublime extracts from men who
 lived in ages of time far remote from each other, but who thought
 alike. Cicero lived before the time in which they tell us Christ
 was born. Middleton may be called a man of our own time, as he
 lived within the same century with ourselves.</p>
 
 <p>     In Cicero we see that vast superiority of mind, that sublimity
 of right reasoning and justness of ideas, which man acquires, not
 by studying bibles and testaments, and the theology of schools
 built thereon, but by studying the creator in the immensity and
 unchangeable order of his creation, and the immutability of his
 law. "There cannot," says Cicero, "be one law now, and another
 hereafter; but the same eternal immutable law comprehends all
 nations, at all times, under one common master and governor of all
 -- GOD." But according to the doctrine of schools which priests
 have set up, we see one law, called the Old Testament, given in one
 age of the world, and another law, called the New Testament, given
 in another age of the world. As all this is contradictory to the
 eternal immutable nature, and the unerring and unchangeable wisdom
 of God, we must be compelled to hold this doctrine to be false, and
 the old and the new law, called the Old and the New Testament, to
 be impositions, fables, and forgeries.</p>
 
 <p>     In Middleton, we see the manly eloquence of an enlarged mind
 and the genuine sentiments of a true believer in his Creator.
 Instead of reposing his faith on books, by whatever name they may
 be called, whether Old Testament or New, he fixes the creation as
 the great original standard by which every other thing called the
 word or work of God is to be tried. In this we have an indisputable
 scale where-by to measure every word or work imputed to him. If the
 thing so imputed carries not in itself the evidence of the same
 Almightiness of power, of the same unerring truth and wisdom, and
 the same unchangeable order in all its parts, as are visibly
 demonstrated to our senses, and comprehensible by our reason, in
 the magnificent fabric of the universe, that word or that work is
 not of God. Let then the two books called the Old and New Testament
 be tried by this rule, and the result will be that the authors of
 them, whoever they were, will be convicted of forgery.</p>
 
 <p>     The invariable principles, and unchangeable order, which
 regulate the movements of all the parts that compose the universe,
 demonstrate both to our senses and our reason that its creator is
 a God of unerring truth. But the Old Testament, beside the
 numberless absurd and bagatelle stories it tells of God, represents
 him as a God of deceit, a God not to be confided in. Ezekiel makes
 God to say, (xiv. 9), "And if the prophet be deceived when he hath
 spoken a thing, I, the Lord have deceived that prophet." And at xx.
 25, he makes God, in speaking of the children of Israel, to say
 "Wherefore I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments
 by which they should not live." This, so far from being the word of
 God, is horrid blasphemy against him. Reader, put thy confidence in
 thy God, and put no trust in the bible.</p>
 
 <p>     The same Old Testament, after telling us that God created the
 heavens and the earth in six days, makes the same almighty power
 and eternal wisdom employ itself in giving directions how a
 priest's garments should be cut, and what sort of stuff they should
 be made of, and what their offerings should be, Gold, and Silver,
 and Brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and
 goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and badger skins, etc. (xxv.
 3); and in one of the pretended prophecies I have just examined,
 God is made to give directions how they should kill, cook, and eat
 a he-lamb or a he-goat. And Ezekiel, (iv.,) to fill up the measure
 of abominable absurdity, makes God to order him to take wheat, and
 barley, and beans, and lintels, and millet, and fitches, and make
 a loaf or a cake thereof, and bake it with human dung and eat it;
 but as Ezekiel complained that this mess was too strong for his
 stomach, the matter was compromised from man's dung to cow-dung.
 Compare all this ribaldry, blasphemously called the word of God,
 with the Almighty power that created the universe, and whose
 eternal wisdom directs and governs all its mighty movements, and we
 shall be at a loss to find a name sufficiently contemptible for it.</p>
 
 <p>     In the promises which the Old Testament pretends that God made
 to his people, the same derogatory ideas of him prevail. It makes
 God to promise to Abraham that his seed should be like the stars in
 heaven and the sand on the sea shore for multitude, and that he
 would give them the land of Canaan as their inheritance forever.
 But observe, reader, how the performance of this promise was to
 begin, and then ask thine own reason, if the wisdom of God, whose
 power is equal to his will, could, consistently with that power and
 that wisdom, make such a promise. The performance of the promise
 was to begin, according to that book, by four hundred years of
 bondage and affliction. Genesis xv. 13, "And he said unto Abraham,
 Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that
 is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them
 four hundred years." This promise then to Abraham and his seed
 forever, to inherit the land of Canaan, had it been a fact instead
 of a fable, was to operate, in the commencement of it, as a curse
 upon all the people and their children, and their children's
 children, for four hundred years.</p>
 
 <p>     But the case is, the book of Genesis was written after the
 bondage in Egypt had taken place; and in order to get rid of the
 disgrace of the Lord's chosen people, as they called themselves,
 being in bondage to the Gentiles, they make God to be the author of
 it, and annex it as a condition to a pretended promise; as if God,
 in making that promise, had exceeded his power in performing it,
 and consequently his wisdom in making it, and was obliged to
 compromise with them for one half, and with the Egyptians, to whom
 they were to be in bondage, for the other half.</p>
 
 <p>     Without degrading my own reason by bringing those wretched and
 contemptible tales into a comparative view with the Almighty power
 and eternal wisdom, which the Creator hath demonstrated to our
 senses in the creation of the universe, I will confine myself to
 say, that if we compare them with the divine and forcible
 sentiments of Cicero, the result will be that the human mind has
 degenerated by believing them. Man, in a state of grovelling
 superstition from which he has not courage to rise, loses the
 energy of his mental powers.</p>
 
 <p>     I will not tire the reader with more observations on the Old
 Testament.</p>
 
 <p>     As to the New Testament, if it be brought and tried by that
 standard which, as Middleton wisely says, God has revealed to our
 senses, of his Almighty power and wisdom in the creation and
 government of the visible universe, it will be found equally as
 false, paltry, and absurd, as the Old.</p>
 
 <p>     Without entering, in this place, into any other argument, that
 the story of Christ is of human invention and not of divine origin,
 I will confine myself to shew that it is derogatory to God, by the
 contrivance of it; because the means it supposes God to use, are
 not adequate to the end to be obtained; and, therefore, are
 derogatory to the Almightiness of his power, and the eternity of
 his wisdom.</p>
 
 <p>     The New Testament supposes that God sent his Son upon earth to
 make a new covenant with man, which the Church calls the covenant
 of grace; and to instruct mankind in a new doctrine, which it calls
 Faith, meaning thereby, not faith in God, for Cicero and all true
 Deists always had and always will have this, but faith in the
 person called Jesus Christ; and that whoever had not this faith
 should, to use the words of the New Testament, be DAMNED.</p>
 
 <p>     Now, if this were a fact, it is consistent with that attribute
 of God called his goodness, that no time should be lost in letting
 poor unfortunate man know it; and as that goodness was united to
 Almighty power, and that power to Almighty wisdom, all the means
 existed in the hand of the Creator to make it known immediately
 over the whole earth, in a manner suitable to the Almightiness of
 his divine nature, and with evidence that would not leave man in
 doubt; for it is always incumbent upon us, in all cases, to believe
 that the Almighty always acts, not by imperfect means as imperfect
 man acts, but consistently with his Almightiness. It is this only
 that can become the infallible criterion by which we can possibly
 distinguish the works of God from the works of man.</p>
 
 <p>     Observe now, reader, how the comparison between this supposed
 mission of Christ, on the belief or disbelief of which they say man
 was to be saved or damned -- observe, I say, how the comparison
 between this, and the Almighty power and wisdom of God demonstrated
 to our senses in the visible creation, goes on.</p>
 
 <p>     The Old Testament tells us that God created the heavens and
 the earth, and everything therein, in six days. The term 'six days'
 is ridiculous enough when applied to God; but leaving out that
 absurdity, it contains the idea of Almighty power acting unitedly
 with Almighty wisdom, to produce an immense work, that of the
 creation of the universe and every thing therein, in a short time.
 Now as the eternal salvation of man is of much greater importance
 than his creation, and as that salvation depends, as the New
 Testament tells us, on man's knowledge of and belief in the person
 called Jesus Christ, it necessarily follows from our belief in the
 goodness and justice of God, and our knowledge of his Almighty
 power and wisdom, as demonstrated in the Creation, that ALL THIS,
 if true, would be made known to all parts of the world, in as
 little time at least, as was employed in making the world. To
 suppose the Almighty would pay greater regard and attention to the
 creation and organization of inanimate matter, than he would to the
 salvation of innumerable millions of souls, which himself had
 created, "as the image of himself," is to offer an insult to his
 goodness and his justice.</p>
 
 <p>     Now observe, reader, how the promulgation of this pretended
 salvation by a knowledge of, and a belief in Jesus Christ went on,
 compared with the work of creation. In the first place, it took
 longer time to make the child than to make the world, for nine
 months were passed away and totally lost in a state of pregnancy;
 which is more than forty times longer time than God employed in
 making the world, according to the bible account. Secondly, several
 years of Christ's life were lost in a state of human infancy. But
 the universe was in maturity the moment it existed. Thirdly,
 Christ, as Luke asserts, was thirty years old before be began to
 preach what they call his mission. Millions of souls died in the
 mean time without knowing it. Fourthly, it was above three hundred
 years from that time before the book called the New Testament was
 compiled into a written copy, before which time there was no such
 book. Fifthly, it was above a thousand years after that before it
 could be circulated; because neither Jesus nor his apostles had
 knowledge of, or were inspired with, the art of printing: and,
 consequently, as the means for making it universally known did not
 exist, the means were not equal to the end, and therefore it is not
 the work of God.</p>
 
 <p>     I will here subjoin the nineteenth Psalm, which is truly
 deistical, to shew how universally and instantaneously the works of
 God make themselves known, compared with this pretended salvation
 by Jesus Christ:</p>
 
 <p>     "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
 showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto
 night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language where
 their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the
 earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set
 a chamber for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his
 chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. His going
 forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends
 of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof."</p>
 
 <p>     Now, had the news of salvation by Jesus Christ been inscribed
 on the face of the Sun and the Moon, in characters that all nations
 would have understood, the whole earth had known it in twenty-four
 hours, and all nations would have believed it; whereas, though it
 is now almost two thousand years since, as they tell us, Christ
 came upon earth, not a twentieth part of the people of the earth
 know anything of it, and among those who do, the wiser part do not
 believe it.</p>
 
 <p>     I have now, reader, gone through all the passages called
 prophecies of Jesus Christ, and shown there is no such thing.</p>
 
 <p>     I have examined the story told of Jesus Christ, and compared
 the several circumstances of it with that revelation which, as
 Middleton wisely says, God has made to us of his Power and Wisdom
 in the structure of the universe, and by which every thing ascribed
 to him is to be tried. The result is, that the story of Christ has 
 not one trait, either in its character or in the means employed,
 that bears the least resemblance to the power and wisdom of God, as
 demonstrated in the creation of the universe. All the means are
 human means, slow, uncertain, and inadequate to the accomplishment
 of the end proposed; and therefore the whole is a fabulous
 invention, and undeserving of credit.</p>
 
 <p>     The priests of the present day profess to believe it. They
 gain their living by it, and they exclaim against something they
 call infidelity. I will define what it is. HE THAT BELIEVES IN THE
 STORY OF CHRIST IS AN INFIDEL TO GOD.</p>

 <h2>AUTHOR'S APPENDIX</h2>
 
 <h3>CONTRADICTORY DOCTRINES BETWEEN MATTHEW AND MARK</h3>
 
      IN the New Testament (Mark xvi. 16), it is said "He that
 believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not
 shall be damned." [NOTE: One of the concluding twelve verses not
 found in the earlier manuscripts of the second gospel. -- Editor.]
 This is making salvation, or, in other words, the happiness of man
 after this life, to depend entirely on believing, or on what
 Christians call faith.
 
 <p>     But The Gospel according to Matthew makes Jesus Christ preach
 a direct contrary doctrine to 'The Gospel according to Mark;' for
 it makes salvation, or the future happiness of man, to depend
 entirely on 'good works;' and those good works are not works done
 to God, for he needs them not, but good works done to man. The
 passage referred to in Matthew is the account there given of what
 is called the last day, or the day of judgment, where the whole
 world is represented to be divided into two parts, the righteous
 and the unrighteous, metaphorically called the sheep and the goats.
 To the one part called the righteous, or the sheep, it says, "Come,
 ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
 the beginning of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me
 meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye
 took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited
 me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous
 answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed
 thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger,
 and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee
 sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the king shall answer
 and say unto them, Verily I say unto, Inasmuch as ye have done it
 unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
 me."</p>
 
 <p>     Here is nothing about believing in Christ -- nothing about
 that phantom of the imagination called Faith. The works here spoken
 of are works of humanity and benevolence, or, in other words, an
 endeavor to make God's creation happy. Here is nothing about
 preaching and making long prayers, as if God must be dictated to by
 man; nor about building churches and meetings, nor hiring priests
 to pray and preach in them. Here is nothing about predestination,
 that lust which some men have for damning one another. Here is 
 nothing about baptism, whether by sprinkling or plunging, nor about
 any of those ceremonies for which the Christian Church has been
 fighting, persecuting, and burning each other ever since the
 Christian Church began.</p>
 
 <p>     If it be asked, why do not priests preach the doctrine
 contained in this chapter, the answer is easy: they are not fond of
 practicing it themselves. It does not answer for their trade. They
 had rather get than give. Charity with them begins and ends at
 home.</p>
 
 <p>     Had it been said, 'Come ye blessed, ye have been liberal in
 paying the preachers of the word, ye have contributed largely
 towards building churches and meeting-houses, there is not a hired
 priest in Christendom but would have thundered it Continually in
 the ears of his congregation. But as it is altogether on good works
 done to men, the priests pass over it in silence, and they will
 abuse me for bringing it into notice.</p>

 <h2>MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS ON A FUTURE STATE.</h2>
 
      I HAVE said, in the first. part of the Age of Reason, that "I
 hope for happiness after this life." This hope is comfortable to
 me, and I presume not to go beyond the comfortable idea of hope,
 with respect to a future state.
 
 <p>     I consider myself in the hands of my creator, and that he will
 dispose of me after this life consistently with his justice and
 goodness. I leave all these matters to him, as my creator and
 friend, and I hold it to be presumption in man to make an article
 of faith as to what the creator will do with us hereafter.</p>
 
 <p>     I do not believe because a man and a woman make a child, that
 it imposes on the creator the unavoidable obligation of keeping the
 being so made in eternal existence hereafter. It is in his power to
 do so, or not to do so, and it is not in our power to decide which
 he will do.</p>
 
 <p>     The book called the New Testament, which I hold to be fabulous
 and have shown to be false, gives an account in Matthew xxv. of
 what is there called the last day, or the day of judgment. The
 whole world, according to that account, is divided into two parts,
 the righteous and the unrighteous, figuratively called the sheep
 and the goats. They are then to receive their sentence. To the one,
 figuratively called the sheep, it says, "Come ye blessed of my
 Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
 the world." To the other, figuratively called the goats, it says,
 "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
 devil and his angels."</p>
 
 <p>     Now the case is, the world cannot be thus divided: the moral
 world, like the physical world, is composed of numerous degrees of
 character, running imperceptibly one into the other, in such a
 manner that no fixed point of division can be found in either. That
 point is no where, or is everywhere. The whole world might be 
 divided into two parts numerically, but not as to moral character;
 and therefore the metaphor of dividing them, as sheep and goats can
 be divided, whose difference is marked by their external figure, is
 absurd. All sheep are still sheep; all goats are still goats; it is
 their physical nature to be so. But one part of the world are not
 all good alike, nor the other part all wicked alike. There are some
 exceedingly good; others exceedingly wicked. There is another
 description of men who cannot be ranked with either the one or the
 other -- they belong neither to the sheep nor the goats; and there
 is still another description of them who are so very insignificant,
 both in character and conduct, as not to be worth the trouble of
 damning or saving, or of raising from the dead.</p>
 
 <p>     My own opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in
 doing good, and endeavoring to make their fellow-mortals happy, for
 this is the only way in which we can serve God, will be happy
 hereafter and that the very wicked will meet with some punishment.
 But those who are neither good nor bad, or are too insignificant
 for notice, will be drooped entirely. This is my opinion. It is
 consistent with my idea of God's justice, and with the reason that
 God has given me, and I gratefully know that he has given me a
 large share of that divine gift.</p>
