 <h2>Question VI</h2>
 <h3>Concerning Witches who copulate with Devils. Why is it that Women are chiefly addicted to Evil superstitions?</h3></center>
 
         
 There is also, concerning witches who copulate with devils, much difficulty 
 in considering the methods by which such abominations are consummated. On 
 the part of the devil: first, of what element the body is made that he 
 assumes; secondly, whether the act is always accompanied by the injection 
 of semen received from another; thirdly, as to time and place, whether he 
 commits this act more frequently at one time than at another; fourthly, 
 whether the act is invisible to any who may be standing by. And on the part 
 of the women, it has to be inquired whether only they who were themselves 
 conceived in this filthy manner are often visited by devils; or secondly, 
 whether it is those who were offered to devils by midwives at the time of 
 their birth; and thirdly, whether the actual venereal delectation of such is 
 of a weaker sort. But we cannot here reply to all these questions, both 
 because we are only engaged in a general study, and because in the second 
 part of this work they are all singly explained by their operations, as will 
 appear in the fourth chapter, where mention is made of each separate method. 
 Therefore, let us now chiefly consider women; and first, why this kind of 
 perfidy is found more in so fragile a sex than in men. And our inquiry will 
 first be general, as to the general conditions of women; secondly, particular, 
 as to which sort of women are found to be given to superstition and 
 witchcraft; and thirdly, specifically with regard to midwives, who surpass 
 all others in wickedness.
 
 
 
 <center><i>Why Superstition is chiefly found in Women.</i></center>
 
 
         
 As for the first question, why a greater number of witches is found in the 
 fragile feminine sex than among men; it is indeed a fact that it were idle 
 to contradict, since it is accredited by actual experience, apart from the 
 verbal testimony of credibly witnesses. And without in any way detracting 
 from a sex in which God has always taken great glory that His might should 
 be spread abroad, let us say that various men have assigned various reasons 
 for this fact, which nevertheless agree in principle. Wherefore it is good, 
 for the admonition of women, to speak of this matter; and it has often been 
 proved by experience that they are eager to hear of it, so long as it is set 
 forth with discretion.<br>
 
         
 For some learned men propound this reason; that there are three things in 
 nature, the Tongue, an Ecclesiastic, and a Woman, which know no moderation 
 in goodness or vice; and when they exceed the bounds of their condition they 
 reach the greatest heights and the lowest depths of goodness and vice. When 
 they are governed by a good spirit, they are most excellent in virtue; but 
 when they are governed by an evil spirit, they indulge the worst possible 
 vices.<br>
 
         
 This is clear in the case of the tongue, since by its ministry most of the 
 kingdoms have been brought into the faith of Christ; and the Holy Ghost 
 appeared over the Apostles of Christ in tongues of fire. Other learned 
 preachers also have had as it were the tongues of dogs, licking wounds and 
 sores of the dying Lazarus. As it is said: With the tongues of dogs ye save 
 your souls from the enemy.<br>
 
         
 For this reason S. Dominic, the leader and 
 father of the Order of Preachers, is represented in the figure of a barking to 
 dog with a lighted torch in his mouth, that even to this day he may by his 
 barking keep off the heretic wolves from the flock of Christ's sheep.<br>
 
         
 It is also a matter of common experience that the tongue of one prudent man 
 can subdue the wrangling of a multitude; wherefore not unjustly Solomon 
 sings much in their praise, in <i>Proverbs</i> x.: In the lips of him that 
 hath understanding wisdom is found. And again, The tongue of the just is as 
 choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. And again, The lips 
 of the righteous feed many; but fools die for want of wisdom. For this 
 cause he adds in chapter xvi, The preparations of the heart belong to man; 
 but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.<br>
 
         
 But concerning an evil tongue you will find in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxviii: 
 A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to 
 nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of 
 great men. And by a backbiting tongue it means a third party who rashly or 
 spitefully interferes between two contending parties.<br>
 
         
 Secondly, concerning Ecclesiastics, that is to say, clerics and religious of 
 either sex, S. John Chrysostom speaks on the 
 text, He cast out them that bought and sold from the temple. From the 
 priesthood arises everything good, and everything evil. S. Jerome in his 
 epistle to Nepotian says: Avoid as you would the plague a trading priest, 
 who has risen from poverty to riches, from a low to a high estate. And 
 Blessed Bernard in his 23rd Homily <i>On the Psalms</i> says of clerics: If 
 one should arise as an open heretic, let him be cast out and put to silence; 
 if he is a violent enemy, let all good men flee from him. But how are we to 
 know which ones to cast out or to flee from? For they are confusedly friendly 
 and hostile, peaceable and quarrelsome, neighbourly and utterly selfish.<br>
 
         
 And in another place: Our bishops are become spearmen, and our pastors 
 shearers. And by bishops here is meant those proud Abbots who impose heavy 
 labours on their inferiors, which they would not themselves touch with their 
 little finger. And S. Gregory says concerning pastors: No one does more harm 
 in the Church than he who, having the name or order of sanctity, lives in 
 sin; for no one dares to accuse him of sin, and therefore the sin is widely 
 spread, since the sinner is honoured for the sanctity of his order. Blessed 
 Augustine also speaks of monks to Vincent the Donatist: I freely confess to 
 your charity before the Lord our God, which is the witness of my soul from 
 the time I began to serve God, what great difficulty I have experienced in 
 the fact that it is impossible to find either worse of better men than those 
 who grace or disgrace the monasteries.<br>
 
         
 Now the wickedness of women is spoken of in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxv: There 
 is no head above the head of a serpent: and there is no wrath above the 
 wrath of a woman. I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep 
 house with a wicked woman. And among much which in that place precedes and 
 follows about a wicked woman, he concludes: All wickedness is but little to 
 the wickedness of a woman. Wherefore S. John Chrysostom says on the text, 
 It is not good to marry (<i>S. Matthew</i> xix): 
 What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an unescapable punishment, a 
 necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic 
 danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colours! 
 Therefore if it be a sin to divorce her when she ought to be kept, it is 
 indeed a necessary torture; for either we commit adultery by divorcing her, 
 or we must endure daily strife. Cicero in his second book of <i>The 
 Rhetorics</i> says: The many lusts of men lead them into one sin, but the 
 lust of women leads them into all sins; for the root of all woman's vices 
 is avarice. And Seneca says in his <i>Tragedies:</i> A woman either loves 
 or hates; there is no third grade. And the tears of woman are a deception, 
 for they may spring from true grief, or they may be a snare. When a woman 
 thinks alone, she thinks evil.<br>
 
         
 But for good women there is so much praise, that we read that they have 
 brought beatitude to men, and have saved nations, lands, and cities; as is 
 clear in the case of Judith, Debbora, and Esther. See also I <i>Corinthians</i> 
 vii: If a woman hath a husband that believeth not, let her not leave him. For 
 the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife. And 
 <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxvi: Blessed is the man who has a virtuous wife, for 
 the number of his days shell be doubled. And throughout that chapter much 
 high praise is spoken of the excellence of good women; as also in the last 
 chapter of <i>Proverbs</i> concerning a virtuous woman.<br>
 
         
 And all this is made clear also in the New Testament concerning women and 
 virgins and other holy women who have by faith led nations and kingdoms 
 away from the worship of idols to the Christian religion. Anyone who looks 
 at Vincent of Beauvais (<i>in Spe. Histo.</i>, XXVI. 9) will find 
 marvellous things of the conversion of Hungary by the most Christian 
 Gilia, and of the Franks by 
 Clotilda, the wife of Clovis. Wherefore in 
 many vituperations that we read against women, the word woman is used to 
 mean the lust of the flesh. As it is said: I have found a woman more bitter 
 than death, and good woman subject to carnal lust.<br>
 
         
 Other again have propounded other reasons why there are more superstitious 
 women found than men. And the first is, that they are more credulous; and 
 since the chief aim of the devil is to corrupt faith, therefore he rather 
 attacks them. See <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xix: He that is quick to believe is 
 light-minded, and shall be diminished. The second reason is, that women are 
 naturally more impressionable, and more ready to receive the influence of 
 a disembodied spirit; and that when they use this quality well they are 
 very good, but when they use it ill they are very evil.<br>
 
         
 The third reason is that they have slippery tongues, and are unable to 
 conceal from the fellow-women those things which by evil arts they know; and, 
 since they are weak, they find an easy and secret manner of vindicating 
 themselves by witchcraft. See <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> as quoted above: I had 
 rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep house with a wicked 
 woman. All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman. And to 
 this may be added that, as they are very impressionable, they act 
 accordingly.<br>
 
         
 There are also others who bring forward yet other reasons, of which preachers 
 should be very careful how they make use. For it is true that in the Old 
 Testament the Scriptures have much that is evil to say about women, and this 
 because of the first temptress, Eve, and her imitators; yet afterwards in 
 the New Testament we find a change of name, as from Eva to Ave (as S. 
 Jerome says), and the whole sin of Eve taken away by the benediction of 
 Mary. Therefore preachers should always say as much praise of them as 
 possible.<br>
 
         
 But because in these times this perfidy is more often found in women than 
 in men, as we learn by actual experience, if anyone is curious as to the 
 reason, we may add to what has already been said the following: that since 
 they are feebler both in mind and body, it is not surprising that they 
 should come more under the spell of witchcraft.<br>
 
         
 For as regards intellect, or the understanding of spiritual things, they 
 seem to be of a different nature from men; a fact which is vouched for by 
 the logic of the authorities, backed by various examples from the Scriptures. 
 Terence says: Women are intellectually like 
 children. And Lactantius (<i>Institutiones</i>, III): No woman understood 
 philosophy except Temeste. And <i>Proverbs</i> 
 xi, as it were describing a woman, says: As a jewel of gold in a swine's 
 snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.<br>
 
         
 But the natural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as is clear 
 from her many carnal abominations. And it should be noted that there was a 
 defect in the formation of the first woman, since she was formed from a 
 bent rib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as it were in a 
 contrary direction to a man. And since through this defect she is an 
 imperfect animal, she always deceives. For Cato says: When a woman weeps 
 she weaves snares. And again: When a woman weeps, she labours to deceive a 
 man. And this is shown by Samson's wife, who coaxed him to tell her the 
 riddle he had propounded to the Philistines, and told them the answer, and 
 so deceived him. And it is clear in the case of the first woman that she 
 had little faith; for when the serpent asked why they did not eat of every 
 tree in Paradise, she answered: Of every tree, etc. - lest perchance we 
 die. Thereby she showed that she doubted, and had little in the word of God. 
 And all this is indicated by the etymology of the word; for <i>Femina</i> 
 comes from <i>Fe</i> and <i>Minus</i>, since she is ever weaker to hold and 
 preserve the faith. And this as regards faith is of her very nature; 
 although both by grace and nature faith never failed in the Blessed Virgin, 
 even at the time of Christ's Passion, when it failed in all men.<br>
 
         
 Therefore a wicked woman is by her nature quicker to waver in her faith, and 
 consequently quicker to abjure the faith, which is the root of witchcraft.<br>
 
         
 And as to her other mental quality, that is, her natural will; when she hates 
 someone whom she formerly loved, then she seethes with anger and impatience 
 in her whole soul, just as the tides of the sea are always heaving and 
 boiling. Many authorities allude to this cause. <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxv: 
 There is no wrath above the wrath of a woman. And Seneca (<i>Tragedies</i>, 
 VIII): No might of the flames or the swollen 
 winds, no deadly weapon, is so much to be feared as the lust and hatred of 
 a woman who has been divorced from the marriage bed.<br>
 
         
 This is shown too in the woman who falsely accused Joseph, and caused him to 
 be imprisoned because he would not consent to the crime of adultery with 
 her (<i>Genesis</i> xxx). And truly the most powerful cause which contributes 
 to the increase of witches is the woeful rivalry between married folk and 
 unmarried women and men. This is so even among holy women, so what must it 
 be among the others? For you see in <i>Genesis</i> xxi. how impatient and 
 envious Sarah was of Hagar when she conceived: How jealous Rachel was of 
 Leah because she had no children (<i>Genesis</i> xxx): and Hannah, who was 
 barren, of the fruitful Peninnah (I. <i>Kings</i> i): and how Miriam 
 (<i>Numbers</i> xii) murmured and spoke ill of Moses, and was therefore 
 stricken with leprosy: and how Martha was jealous of Mary Magdalen, because 
 she was busy and Mary was sitting down (<i>S. Luke</i> x). To this point is 
 <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxxvii: Neither consult with a woman touching her of 
 whom she is jealous. Meaning that it is useless to consult with her, since 
 there is always jealousy, that is, envy, in a wicked woman. And if women 
 behave thus to each other, how much more will they do so to men.<br>
