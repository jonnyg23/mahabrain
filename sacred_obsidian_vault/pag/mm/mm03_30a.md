 <h2>Question XXX</h2>
 <h3>Of One who has Confessed to Heresy, is Relapsed, and is also Impenitent</h3></center>
 
 
         
 THE eleventh method of concluding and terminating a process on 
 behalf of the Faith is used when the person accused of heresy, 
 after a diligent discussion of the circumstances of the process 
 in consultation with learned men, is found to have confessed her 
 heresy, and to be impenitent, and to have relapsed into it. And 
 this is when the accused confesses with her own mouth in Court 
 that she believes and has practiced such and such. The procedure 
 in this case is the same as that above; and because she is 
 manifestly a heretic, sentence shall be pronounced in the 
 following manner in the presence of the Bishop and Judges:<br> 
 
         
 We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the 
 territories of such Prince, seeing that you N., of such a place 
 in such a Diocese, were formerly accused before us (or before 
 such and such, our predecessors) of the crime of heresy (naming 
 them), and that you were legally convicted of that crime by your 
 own confession and the testimony of worthy men, and that you 
 obstinately persisted in it for so many years; but that 
 afterwards, having listened to better advice, you publicly 
 abjured those heresies in such a place and in the form required 
 by the Church, on which account the aforesaid Bishop and Judge, 
 believing that you had truly renounced the said errors and had 
 returned with Catholic faith to the bosom of the Church, granted 
 you the benefit of absolution, releasing you from the sentence of 
 excommunication by which you were formerly bound, and, setting 
 you a salutary penance if with true heart and faith unfeigned you 
 remained converted to the unity of the Holy Church, received you 
 back in mercy. For the Holy Church of God is not closed to such 
 as return to her bosom.<br> 
 
         
 But after all the aforesaid you have to our great grief been 
 accused before us of having again fallen into those damnable 
 heresies which you formerly abjured in public; yea, you have done 
 so and so (naming them) in contravention of the said abjuration 
 and to the damage of your soul; and although we are sore wounded 
 and cut to the heart to have heard such things of you, yet we 
 were in justice compelled to inquire into the matter, to examine 
 the witnesses, and to summon and question you on oath as it 
 behoved us, and in every particular to proceed as we are bidden 
 by the canonical institutions. And as we wished to conclude this 
 case beyond any doubt, we summoned a solemn council of men 
 learned in the Theological faculty and of those skilled in the 
 Canon and Civil Laws.<br> 
 
         
 And having obtained the mature and considered judgement of the 
 said learned men upon every single particular which had been 
 brought to notice and done in this case, after repeated 
 examination of the whole process and careful and diligent 
 discussion of every circumstance, as law and justice demanded, we 
 find that you are legally convicted both by the evidence of 
 credible witnesses and by your own repeated confession, that you 
 have fallen, and fallen again, into the heresies which you 
 abjured. For we find that you have said or done such and such 
 (naming them), wherefore we have reason, in the opinion of the 
 said learned men, and compelled thereto by your own excesses, to 
 judge you as a backslider according to the canonical decrees. And 
 that we say this with grief, and grieve to say it, He knows from 
 Whom nothing is hid and Who seeth into the secrets of all hearts. 
 And with all our hearts we desired and still desire to lead you 
 back to the unity of the Holy Church and to drive out from your 
 heart the said foul heresy, that so you may save your soul and 
 preserve your body and soul from the destruction in hell, and we 
 have exerted our utmost endeavor by various fitting methods to 
 convert to salvation; but you have been given up to your sin and 
 led away and seduced by an evil spirit, and have chosen to be 
 tortured with fearful and eternal torment in hell, and that your 
 temporal body should here be consumed in the flames, rather than 
 to give ear to better counsels and renounce your damnable and 
 pestilent errors, and to return to the merciful bosom of our Holy 
 Mother Church.<br> 
 
         
 Wherefore since the Church of God can do nothing more for you, 
 having done all that was possible to convert you: We the Bishop 
 and Judges named in this cause on behalf of the faith, sitting in 
 tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy Gospels 
 that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and 
 our eyes see with equity, and having before our eyes only God and 
 the honour of the Holy Catholic Faith, on this day at this hour 
 and place before assigned to you for the hearing of your final 
 sentence, we pronounce judgement upon you N., here present before 
 us, and condemn and sentence you as a truly impenitent and 
 relapsed heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to 
 secular justice; and by this our definitive sentence we cast you 
 out as a truly impenitent and relapsed heretic from our 
 ecclesiastical Court, and deliver and abandon you to the power of 
 the secular Court; praying that the said secular Court will 
 temper or moderate its sentence of death against you. This 
 sentence was give, etc.
