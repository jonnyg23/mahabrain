 <h2>Question II</h2>
 <h3>Introduction, wherein is Set Forth the Difficulty of this Question.</h3></center>
 
         
 Is it lawful to remove witchcraft by means of further witchcraft, or by any 
 other forbidden means?<br>
 
         
 It is argued that it is not; for it has already been shown that in the 
 <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, and the 8th Distinction, all the Doctors 
 agree that it is unlawful to use the help of devils, since to do so involves 
 apostasy from the Faith. And, it is argued, no witchcraft can be removed 
 without the help of devils. For it is submitted that it must be cured either 
 by human power, or by diabolic, or by Divine power. It cannot be by the 
 first; for the lower power cannot counteract the higher, having no control 
 over that which is outside its own natural capacity. Neither can it be by 
 Divine power; for this would be a miracle, which God performs only at His 
 own will, and not at the instance of men. For when His Mother besought 
 Christ to perform a miracle to supply the need for wine, He answered: Woman, 
 what have I to do with thee? And the Doctors explain this as meaning, 
 What association is there between you and me in the working of a 
 miracle? Also it appears that it is 
 very rarely that men are delivered from a bewitchment by calling on God's 
 help or the prayers of the Saints. Therefore it follows that they can only 
 be delivered by the help of devils; and it is unlawful to seek such help.<br>
 
         
 Again it is pointed out that the common method in practice of taking off a 
 bewitchment, although it is quite unlawful, is for the bewitched persons to 
 resort to wise women, by whom they are very frequently cured, and not by 
 priests or exorcists. So experience shows that such curses are effected by 
 the help of devils, which it is unlawful to seek; therefore it cannot be 
 lawful thus to cure a bewitchment, but it must patiently be borne.<br>
 
         
 It is further argued that S. Thomas and S. Bonaventura, in Book IV, dist. 
 34, have said that a bewitchment must be permanent because it can have no 
 human remedy; for if there is a remedy, it is either unknown to men or 
 unlawful. And these words are taken to mean that this infirmity is incurable 
 and must be regarded as permanent; and they add that, even if God should 
 provide a remedy by coercing the devil, and the devil should remove his 
 plague from a man, and the man should be cured, that cure would not be a 
 human one. Therefore, unless God should cure it, it is not lawful for a man 
 to himself to try in any way to look for a cure.<br>
 
         
 In the same place these two Doctors add that it is unlawful even to seek a 
 remedy by the superadding of another bewitchment. For they say that, 
 granting this to be possible, and that the original spell be removed, yet 
 the witchcraft is none the less to be considered permanent; for it is in no 
 way lawful to invoke the devil's help through witchcraft.<br>
 
         
 Further, it is submitted that the exorcisms of the Church are not always 
 effective in the repression of devils in the 
 matter of bodily afflictions, since such are cured only at the discretion 
 of God; but they are effective always against those molestations of devils 
 against which they are chiefly instituted, as, for example, against men who 
 are possessed, or in the matter of exorcising children.<br>
 
         
 Again, it does not follow that, because the devil has been given power over 
 someone on account of his sins, that power must come to an end on the 
 cessation of the sin. For very often a man may cease from sinning, but his 
 sins still remain. So it seems from these sayings that the two Doctors we 
 have cited were of the opinion that it is unlawful to remove a bewitchment, 
 but that it must be suffered, just as it is permitted by the Lord God, Who 
 can remove it when it seems good to Him.<br>
 
         
 Against this opinion it is argued that just as God and Nature do not abound 
 in superfluities, so also they are not deficient in necessities; and it is 
 a necessity that there should be given to the faithful against such devils' 
 work not only a means of protection (of which we treat in the beginning of 
 this Second Part), but also curative remedies. For otherwise the faithful 
 would not be sufficiently provided for by God, and the works of the devil 
 would seem to be stronger than God's work.<br>
 
         
 Also there is the gloss on that text in <i>Job</i>. There is no power on 
 earth, etc. The gloss says that, although the devil has power over all 
 things human, he is nevertheless subject to the merits of the Saints, and 
 even to the merits of saintly men in this life.<br>
 
         
 Again, S. Augustine (<i>De moribus Ecclesiae</i>) 
 says: No Angel is more powerful than our mind, when we hold fast to God. For 
 if power is a virtue in this world, then the mind that keeps close to God is 
 more sublime than the whole world. Therefore such minds can undo the works 
 of the devil.<br>
 
         
 <i>Answer</i>. Here are two weighty opinions which, it seems, are at 
 complete variance with each other.<br>
 
         
 For there are certain Theologians and Canonists who agree that it is lawful 
 to remove witchcraft even by superstitious and vain means. And of this 
 opinion are Duns Scotus, Henry of Segusio, 
 and Godfrey, and all the Canonists. But it is the opinion of the other 
 Theologians, especially the ancient ones, and of some of the modern ones, 
 such as S. Thomas, S. Bonaventura, Blessed Albert, Peter a Palude, and many 
 others, that in no case must evil be done that good may result, and that a 
 man ought rather to die than consent to be cured by superstitious and vain 
 means.<br>
 
         
 Let us now examine their opinions, with a view to bringing them as far as 
 possible into agreement. Scotus, in his Fourth Book, dist. 34, on 
 obstructions and impotence caused by witchcraft, says that it is foolish 
 to maintain that it is unlawful to remove a bewitchment even by superstitious 
 and vain means, and that to do so is in no way contrary to the Faith; for he 
 who destroys the work of the devil is not an accessory to such works, but 
 believes that the devil has the power and inclination to help in the 
 infliction of an injury only so long as the outward token or sign of that 
 injury endures. Therefore when that token is destroyed he puts an end to the 
 injury. And he adds that it is meritorious to destroy the works of the devil. 
 But, as he speaks of tokens, we will give an example.<br>
 
         
 There are women who discover a witch by the following token. When a cow's 
 supply of milk has been diminished by witchcraft, they hang a pail of milk 
 over the fire, and uttering certain superstitious words, beat the pail with 
 a stick. And though it is the pail that the women beat, yet the devil carries 
 all those blows to the back of the witch; and in this way both the witch and 
 the devil are made weary. But the devil does this in order that he may lead 
 on the woman who beats the pail to worse practices. And so, if it were not 
 for the risk which it entails, there would be no difficulty in accepting 
 the opinion of this learned Doctor. Many other examples could be given.<br>
 
         
 Henry of Segusio, in his eloquent <i>Summa</i> on genital impotence caused 
 by witchcraft, says that in such cases recourse must be had to the remedies 
 of physicians; and although some of these remedies seem to be vain and 
 superstitious cantrips and charms, yet everyone must be trusted in his own 
 profession, and the Church may well tolerate the suppression of vanities by 
 means of others vanities.<br>
 
         
 Ubertinus also, in his Fourth Book, uses 
 these words: A bewitchment can be removed either by prayer or by the same 
 art by which it was inflicted.<br>
 
         
 Godfrey says in his <i>Summa:</i> A bewitchment cannot always be removed by 
 him who caused it, either because he is dead, or because he does not know 
 how to cure it, or because the necessary charm is lost. But if he knows how 
 to effect relief, it is lawful for him to cure it. Our author is speaking 
 against those who said that an obstruction of the carnal act could not be 
 caused by witchcraft, and that it could never be permanent, and therefore 
 did not annul a marriage already contracted.<br>
 
         
 Besides, those who maintained that no spell is permanent were moved by the 
 following reasons: they thought that every bewitchment could be removed 
 either by another magic spell, or by the exorcisms of the Church which are 
 ordained for the suppression of the devil's power, or by true penitence, 
 since the devil has power only over sinners. So in the first respect they 
 agree with the opinion of the others, namely, that a spell can be removed by 
 superstitious means.<br>
 
         
 But S. Thomas is of the contrary opinion when he says: If a spell cannot be 
 revoked except by some unlawful means, such as the devil's help or anything 
 of that sort, even if it is known that it can be revoked in that way, it is 
 nevertheless to be considered permanent; for the remedy is not lawful.<br>
 
         
 Of the same opinion are S. Bonaventura, Peter a Palude, Blessed Albert, and 
 all the Theologians. For, touching briefly on the question of invoking the 
 help of the devil either tacitly or expressedly, they seem to hold that 
 such spells may only be removed by lawful exorcism or true penitence (as is 
 set down in the Canon Law concerning sortilege), being moved, as it seems, 
 by the considerations mentioned in the beginning of this Question.<br>
 
         
 But it is expedient to bring these various opinions of the learned Doctors 
 as far as possible into agreement, and this can be done in one respect. For 
 this purpose it is to be noted that the methods by which a spell of 
 witchcraft can be removed are as follows: - either by the agency of another 
 witch and another spell; or without the agency of a witch, but by means of 
 magic and unlawful ceremonies. And this last method may be divided into two; 
 namely, the use of ceremonies which are both unlawful and vain, or the use 
 of ceremonies which are vain but not unlawful.<br>
 
         
 The first remedy is altogether unlawful, in respect both of the agent and of 
 the remedy itself. But it may be accomplished in two ways; either with some 
 injury to him who worked the spell, or without an injury, but with magic and 
 unlawful ceremonies. In the latter case it can be included with the second 
 method, namely, that by which the spell is removed not by the agency of a 
 witch, but by magic and unlawful ceremonies; and in this case it is still to 
 be judged unlawful, though not to the same extent as the first method.<br>
 
         
 We may summarize the position as follows. There are three conditions by 
 which a remedy is rendered unlawful. First, when a spell is removed through 
 the agency of another witch, and by further witchcraft, that is, by the 
 power of some devil. Secondly, when it is not removed by a witch, but by 
 some honest person, in such a way, however, that the spell is by some 
 magical remedy transferred from one person to another; and this again is 
 unlawful. Thirdly, when the spell is removed without imposing it on another 
 person, but some open or tacit invocation of devils is used; and then again 
 it is unlawful.<br>
 
         
 And it is with reference to these methods that the Theologians say that it 
 is better to die than to consent to them. But there are two other methods by 
 which, according to the Canonists, it is lawful, or not idle and vain, to 
 remove a spell; and that such methods may be used when all the remedies of 
 the Church, such as exorcisms and the prayers of the Saints and true 
 penitence, have been tried and have failed. But for a clearer understanding 
 of these remedies we will recount some examples known to our experience.<br>
 
         
 In the time of Pope Nicolas there had come to Rome on some business a 
 certain Bishop from Germany, whom it is charitable not to name although he 
 had now paid the debt of all nature. There he fell in love with a girl, and 
 sent her to his diocese in charge of two servants and certain other of his 
 possessions, including some rich jewels, which were indeed very valuable, 
 and began to think in her heart that, if only the Bishop were to die through 
 some witchcraft, she would be able to take possession of the rings, the 
 pendants and carcanets. The next night the Bishop suddenly fell ill, and the 
 physicians and his servants gravely suspected that he had been poisoned; for 
 there was such a fire in his breast that he had to take continual draughts 
 of cold water to assuage it. On the third day, when there seemed no hope of 
 his life, an old woman came and begged that she might see him. So they let 
 her in, and she promised the Bishop that she could heal him if he would 
 agree to her proposals. When the Bishop asked what it was to which he had to 
 agree in order to regain his health, as he so greatly desired, the old woman 
 answered: Your illness has ben caused by a spell of witchcraft, and you can 
 only be healed by another spell, which will transfer the illness from you to 
 the witch who caused it, so that she will die. The Bishop was astounded; and 
 seeing that he could be healed in no other way, and not wishing to come to a 
 rash decision, decided to ask the advice of the Pope. Now the Holy Father 
 loved him very dearly, and when he learned that he could only be healed by 
 the death of the witch, he agreed to permit the lesser of two evils, and 
 signed this permission with his seal. So the old woman was again approached 
 and told that both he and the Pope had agreed to the death of the witch, on 
 condition that he was restored to his former health; and the old woman went 
 away, promising him that he would be healed on the following night. And 
 behold! when about the middle of the night he felt himself cured and free 
 from all illness, he sent a messenger to learn what had happened to the girl; 
 and he came back and reported that she had suddenly been taken ill in the 
 middle of the night while sleeping by her mother's side.<br>
 
         
 It is to be understood that at the very same hour and moment the illness 
 left the Bishop and afflicted the girl witch, through the agency of the old 
 witch; and so the evil spirit, by ceasing to plague the Bishop, appeared to 
 restore him to health by chance, whereas it was not he but God who permitted 
 him to afflict im, and it was God Who properly speaking restored him; and 
 the devil, by reason of his compact with the second witch, who envied the 
 fortune of the girl, has to afflict the Bishop's mistress. And it must be 
 thought that those two evil spells were not worked by one devil serving two 
 persons, but by two devils serving two separate witches. For the devils do 
 not work against themselves, but work as much 
 as possible in agreement for the perdition of souls.
