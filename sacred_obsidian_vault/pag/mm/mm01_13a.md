 <h2>Question XIII</h2>
 <h3>Herein is set forth the Question, concerning the Two Divine Permissions which God justly allows, namely, that the Devil, the Author or all Evil, should Sin, and that our First Parents should Fall, from which Origins the Works of Witches are justly suffered to take place.</h3></center>
 
         
 The second question and proposition is that God justly permitted certain 
 Angels to sin in deed, which He could not have allowed unless they were 
 capable of sin; and that in like manner He preserved certain creatures 
 through grace, without their having previously suffered temptation; and that 
 He justly allows man both to be tempted and to sin. And all this is clearly 
 shown as follows. For it is a part of Divine providence that each single 
 thing should be left to its own nature, and not be altogether impeded in its 
 natural works. For, as Dionysius says (<i>de Diuin. Nom.</i>, IV), Providence 
 is not a destroyer, but a preserver of nature. This being so, it is manifest 
 that, just as the good of the race is better than the good of the individual 
 (Aristotle, <i>Ethics</i>, I), so also the good of the universe takes 
 precedence over the good of any particular creature. Therefore we must add 
 that, if men were prevented from sinning, many steps to perfection would be 
 removed. For that nature would be removed which has it in its power to sin 
 or not to sin; but it has already been shown that this is a natural property 
 of man's nature.<br>
 
         
 And let it be answered that, if there had been no sin, but immediate 
 confirmation, then there would never have appeared what debt of grace in 
 good works is due to God, and what the power of sin has been able to effect, 
 and many other things without which the universe would suffer great loss. 
 For it behoved that Satan should sin, not through some outside suggestion, 
 but that he should find in himself the occasion of sin. And this he did when 
 he wished to be equal to God. Now this is to be understood neither simply 
 and directly, nor indirectly, but only with a reservation; and this is 
 declared according to the authority of <i>Esaias</i> xiv: I will ascend above 
 the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. For it must not be 
 understood simply and directly, because in that case he would have had a 
 limited and erring understanding, in seeking something which was impossible 
 for him. For he knew that he was a creature created by God, and therefore 
 he knew that it was impossible for him to become equal to his Creator. 
 Neither, again, must it be understood indirectly; for since the whole 
 transparence of the air consists in its subjection to the sun's rays; 
 therefore nothing which would be contrary to the good of its nature could be 
 sought for by an Angel. But he sought for equality with God, not absolutely, 
 but with a reservation, which was as follows. The nature of God has two 
 qualities, that of blessedness and goodness, and the fact that all the 
 blessedness and goodness of His creatures issues from Him. Therefore the 
 Angel, seeing that the dignity of his own nature transcended that of the 
 other creatures, wished and asked that the blessedness and goodness of all 
 the inferior creatures should be derived from him. And he sought this in his 
 own natural capacity, that just as he was the first to be endowed in nature 
 with those qualities, so the other creatures should receive them from the 
 nobility of his nature. And he sought this of God, in perfect willingness to 
 remain subject to God so long as he had that power granted to him. Therefore 
 he did not wish to be made equal with God absolutely, but only with a 
 reservation.<br>
 
         
 It is further to be noted that, wishing to bring his desire to the point of 
 action, he suddenly made it known to others; and the understanding of the 
 other Angels of his desire, and their perverse consenting to it, was also 
 sudden. Therefore the sin of the First Angel exceeded and preceded the sins 
 of the others in respect of the magnitude of his guilt and causality, but 
 not in respect of duration. See <i>Apocalypse</i> xii. The dragon falling 
 from heaven drew with him the third part of the stars. And he lives in the 
 form of Leviathan, and is king over all the children or pride. And, 
 according to Aristotle (<i>Metaph.</i>, V), he is called king of princes, 
 inasmuch as he moves those who are subject to him according to his will and 
 command. Therefore his sin was the occasion of sin in others, since he first, 
 not having been tempted from outside, was the external temptation of others.<br>
 
         
 And that all these things happened instantaneously may be exemplified by 
 physical things; for the ignition of a gas, the sight of the flame, and the 
 impression formed by that sight all happen at one and the same time.<br>
 
         
 I have put this matter at some length; for in the consideration of that 
 stupendous Divine permission in the case of the most noble creatures with 
 regard to the one sin of ambition, it will be easier to admit particular 
 permissions in the case of the works of witches, which are in some certain 
 circumstances even greater sins. For in certain circumstances the sins of 
 witches are greater than that of the Angel or of our first parents, as will 
 be shown in the Second Part.<br>
 
         
 Now the fact that the providence of God permitted the first man to be 
 tempted and to sin is sufficiently clear from what has been said concerning 
 the transgression of the Angels. For both man and the Angel were created 
 to the same end, and left with free-will, in order that they might receive 
 the reward of blessedness not without merit. Therefore, just as the Angel 
 was not preserved from his fall, in order that the power of sin on the one 
 side and the power of the confirmation of grace on the other side might work 
 together for the glory of the universe, so also ought it to be considered in 
 the case of man.<br>
 
         
 Wherefore S. Thomas (II, 23, art. 2) says: That by which God is glorified 
 ought not to be hindered from within. But God is glorified in sin, when He 
 pardons in mercy and when He punishes in justice; therefore it behoves Him 
 not to hinder sin. Let us, then, return to a brief recapitulation of our 
 proposition, namely, that by the just providence of God man is permitted to 
 sin for many reasons. First, that the power of God may be shown, Who alone 
 is unchanging while every creature is variable. Secondly, that the wisdom of 
 God may be declared, Who can bring good out of evil, which could not be 
 unless God had allowed the creature to sin. Thirdly, that the mercy of God 
 may be made manifest, by which Christ through His death liberated man who 
 was lost. Fourthly, that the justice of God may be shown, which not only 
 rewards the good, but also punishes the wicked. Fifthly, that the condition 
 of man may not be worse than that of other creatures, all of whom God so 
 governs that He allows them to act after their own nature; wherefore it 
 behoved Him to leave man to his own judgement. Sixthly, for the glory of 
 men; that is, the glory of the just man who could transgress but has not. And 
 seventhly, for the adorning of the universe; for as there is a threefold 
 evil in sin, namely, guilty, pain, and loss, so is the universe adorned by 
 the corresponding threefold good, namely, righteousness, pleasure, and 
 usefulness. For righteousness is adorned by guilt, pleasure by pain, and all 
 usefullness by loss. And by this the answer to the arguments is made plain.
 
 
 <center><i>Solutions to the Arguments.</i></center>
 
 
 
         
 According to the first argument it is heretical to maintain that the devil 
 is allowed power to injure men. But the opposite appears rather to be true; 
 for it is heretical to assert that God does not permit man, of his own 
 free-will, to sin when he wishes. And God permits much sin, by reason of 
 His power to hurt men in the punishment of the wicked for the adorning of 
 the universe. For it is said by S. Augustine in his <i>Book of Soliloques:</i> 
 Thou, Lord, hast commanded, and it is so, that the shame of guilt should 
 never be without the glory of punishment.<br>
 
         
 And that is not a valid proof of the argument which is taken from the wise 
 ruler who keeps away all defect and evil as far as he can. For it is quite 
 different with God, Who has an universal care, from one who has only a 
 particular care. For God, Whose care is universal, can bring good out of 
 evil, as is shown by what has been said.<br>
 
         
 For the second argument, it is clear that God's power as well as His 
 goodness and justice are manifest in His permission of sin. So when it is 
 argued that God either can or cannot prevent evil, the answer is that He 
 can prevent it, but that for the reasons already shown it does not behove 
 Him to do so.<br>
 
         
 Neither is it valid to object that He therefore wishes evil to be; since He 
 can prevent it but will not; for, as has been shown in the arguments for the 
 truth, God cannot wish evil to be. He neither wishes nor does not wish it, 
 but He permits it for the perfecting of the universe.<br>
 
         
 In the third argument S. Augustine and Aristotle are quoted on the subject 
 of human knowledge, saying that it is better for a man not to have knowledge 
 of that which is evil and vile for two reasons: first, that then he will 
 have less opportunity to think of evil, since we cannot understand many 
 things at the same time. And secondly, because knowledge of evil sometimes 
 perverts the will towards evil. But these arguments do not concern God, Who 
 without and detriment understands all the deeds of men and of witches.<br>
 
         
 For the fourth argument: S. Paul excepts the care of God from oxen, to show 
 that a rational creature has through free-will command over its actions, as 
 has been said. Therefore God has a special providence over him, that either 
 blame or merit may be imputed to him, and he may receive either punishment 
 or reward; but that God does not in this way care for the irrational beasts.<br>
 
         
 But to argue from that authority that the individuals of irrational creation 
 have no part in Divine providence would be heretical; for it would be to 
 maintain that all things are not subject to Divine providence, and would be 
 contrary to the praise which is spoken in Holy Scripture concerning the 
 Divine wisdom, which stretches mightily from end to end and disposes all 
 things well; and it would be the error of the Rabbi Moses as was shown in 
 the arguments for the truth.<br>
 
         
 For the fifth argument, man did not institute nature, but puts the works of 
 nature to the greatest use known to his skill and strength. Therefore human 
 providence does not extend to the inevitable phenomena of nature, as that 
 the sun will rise to-morrow. But God's providence does extend to these 
 things, since He is Himself the author of nature. Wherefore also defects in 
 nature, even if they arise out of the natural course of things, are subject 
 to Divine providence. And therefore Democritus and the other natural 
 philosophers were in error when they ascribed whatever happened to the 
 inferior creation to the mere chance of matter.<br>
 
         
 For the last argument: although every punishment is inflicted by God for sin, 
 yet the greatest sinners are not always afflicted with witchcraft. And this 
 may be because the devil does not wish to afflict and tempt those whom he 
 sees to belong to him by just title, or because he does not wish them to be 
 turned back to God. As it is said: Their plagues were multiplied, and they 
 turned them to God, etc. And that all punishment is inflicted by God for sin 
 is shown by what follows; for according to S. Jerome: Whatever we suffer, we 
 deserve for our sins.<br>
 
         
 Now it is declared that the sins of witches are more grievous than those of 
 the bad angels and our first parents. Wherefore, just as the innocent are 
 punished for the sins of their fathers, so are many blameless people damned 
 and bewitched for the sins of witches.
