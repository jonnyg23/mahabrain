 <h2>Question XIX</h2>
 <h3>Of the Various Degrees of Overt Suspicion which render the Accused liable to be Sentenced</h3></center>
 
 
         
 BOTH the old and the new legislature provide an answer to the question as to 
 in how many and what ways a person can be held suspect of heresy or any other 
 crime, and whether they can be judged and sentenced by reason of such 
 suspicions. For the gloss on the chapter <i>nos in quemquam</i>, which we 
 quoted in the last Question, says that there are four means of convicting a 
 prisoner: either by the depositions of witnesses in Court, or by the evidence 
 of the facts, or by reason of previous convictions against the prisoner, or 
 because of a grave suspicion.<br> 
 
         
 And the Canonists note that suspicion is of three kinds. The first of which 
 the Canon says, You shall not judge anyone because he is suspect in your 
 own opinion. The second is Probably; and this, but not the first, leads 
 to a purgation. The third is Grave, and leads to a conviction; and S. Jerome 
 understands this kind of suspicion when he says that a wife may be divorced 
 either for fornication or for a reasonably suspected fornication.<br> 
 
         
 It must further be noted that the second, or highly probable and 
 circumstantial, suspicion is admitted as a kind of half-proof; that is to say, 
 it helps to substantiate other proofs. Therefore it can also lead to a 
 judgement, and not only to a purgation. And as for the grave suspicion, which 
 suffices for a conviction, note that it is of two kinds. One is of the law and 
 by the law, as when the law fixes and determines some point against which no 
 proof can be admitted. For example, if a man has given a woman a promise of 
 matrimony, and copulation has ensued, then matrimony is presumed, and no proof 
 to the contrary is admitted. The second is of the law but not by the law, as 
 where the law presumes but does not determine a fact. For example, if a man 
 has lived for a long time with a woman, she is presumed to have had connexion 
 with him; but against this proofs are admitted.<br> 
 
         
 Applying this to our discussion of the heresy of witches and to the modern 
 laws, we say that in law there are three degrees of suspicion in the matter of 
 heresy: the first slight, the second great, and the third very great.<br> 
 
         
 The first is in law called a light suspicion. Of this it is said in the 
 chapter <i>Accusatus, de Haeret</i>. Lib. 6: If the accused has incurred only 
 a light and small suspicion, and if she should again fall under that 
 suspicion, although she is to be severely punished for this, she ought not to 
 suffer the punishment of those who have relapsed into heresy. And this 
 suspicion is called small or light, both because it can be removed by a small 
 and light defence, and because it arises from small and light conjectures. 
 Therefore it is called small, because of the small proofs of it; and light, 
 because of the light conjectures.<br> 
 
         
 As an example of simple heresy, if people are found to be meeting together 
 secretly for the purpose of worship, or differing in their manner of life and 
 behaviour from the usual habits of the faithful; or if they meet together in 
 sheds and barns, or at the more Holy Seasons in the remoter fields or woods, 
 by day or by night, or are in any way found to separate themselves and not to 
 attend Mass at the usual times or in the usual manner, or form secret 
 friendships with suspected witches: such people incur at least a light 
 suspicion of heresy, because it is proved that heretics often act in this 
 manner. And of this light suspicion the Canon says: They who are by a slight 
 argument discovered to have deviated from the teaching and path of the 
 Catholic religion are not to be classed as heretics, nor is a sentence to be 
 pronounced against them.<br> 
 
         
 Henry of Segusio agrees with this in his <i>Summa; de Praesumptione</i>, where 
 he says: It is to be noted that although a heretic be convicted by a slight 
 argument of that matter of which he is suspected, he is not on that account to 
 be considered a heretic; and he proves it by the above reasoning.<br> 
 
         
 The second or grave suspicion is in law called grave or vehement, and of this 
 the above Canon (<i>Accusatus</i>) again says: One who is accused or suspected 
 of heresy, against whom a grave or vehement suspicion of this crime has 
 arisen, etc. And it goes on: And these are not two kinds but the same kind of 
 suspicion. Giovanni d’Andrea also says: Vehement is the same as strong, as the 
 Archdeacon says speaking of this Canon. Also Bernardus 
 Papiensis and Huguccio say that vehement is 
 the same as strong or great. S. Gregory also, in the First Book of his 
 <i>Morals</i> says: A vehement wind sprang up. Therefore we say that anyone 
 has a vehement case when he has a strong one. So much for this.<br> 
 
         
 Therefore a great suspicion is called vehement or strong; and it is so called 
 because it is dispelled only by a vehement and strong defence, and because it 
 arises from great, vehement, and strong conjectures, arguments, and evidence. 
 As, to take an example of simple heresy, when people are found to shelter 
 known heretics, and show favour to them, or visit and associate with them and 
 give gifts to them, receive them into their houses and protect them, and such 
 like: such people are vehemently suspected of heresy. And similarly in the 
 heresy of witches, they are brought under suspicion when they share in the 
 crimes of witches.<br> 
 
         
 And here are especially to be noted those men or women who cherish some 
 inordinate love or excessive hatred, even if they do not use to work any harm 
 against men or animals in other ways. For, as we have said, those who behave 
 in this way in any heresy are strongly to be suspected. And this is shown by 
 the Canon where it says that there is no doubt that such persons act in this 
 way out of some heretical sympathy.<br> 
 
         
 The third and greatest suspicion is in law called grave or violent: for the 
 Canon and the glosses of the Archdeacon and Giovanni d’Andrea explain that the 
 word vehement does not mean the same as the word violent. And of this 
 suspicion the Canon says (dist. 34): This presumption or suspicion is called 
 violent because it violently constrains and compels a Judge to believe it, and 
 cannot be cast off by any evasion; and also because it arises from violent and 
 convincing conjectures.<br> 
 
         
 For example, in simple heresy, if persons are found to show a reverent love 
 for heretics, to receive consolation or communion from them, or perpetrate any 
 other such matter in accordance with their rites and ceremonies: such persons 
 would fall under and be convicted of a violent suspicion of heresy and 
 heretical beliefs. (See many chapters on this subject in Book VI of the 
 Canon.) For there is no doubt that such persons act in this way out of a 
 belief in some heresy.<br> 
 
         
 It is the same, as regards the heresy of witches, with those who perform and 
 persist in performing any of the actions which pertain to the rites of 
 witches. Now these are of various kinds. Sometimes it is only some threatening 
 speech, such as You shall soon feel what will happen to you, or 
 something similar. Sometimes it is a touch, just laying their hands curiously 
 on a man or a beast. Sometimes it is only a matter of being seen, when they 
 show themselves by day or by night to others who are sleeping in their beds; 
 and this they do when they wish to bewitch men or beasts. But for raising 
 hailstorms they observe various other methods and ceremonies, and perform 
 various ritual actions round about a river, as we have shown before where we 
 discussed the manner and methods of working witchcraft. When such are found 
 and are publicly notorious they are convicted of a violent suspicion of the 
 heresy of witchcraft; especially when some effect of witchcraft has followed 
 upon their actions, either immediately or after some interval. For then there 
 is direct evidence when any instruments of witchcraft are found hidden in some 
 place. And although when some interval of time has elapsed the evidence of the 
 fact is not so strong, such a person still remains under strong suspicion of 
 witchcraft, and therefore much more of simple heresy.<br> 
 
         
 And if it be asked whether the devil cannot inflict injury upon men and beasts 
 without the means of a woman being seen in a vision or by her touch, we answer 
 that he can, when God permits it. But the permission of God is more readily 
 granted in the case of a creature that was dedicated to God, but by denying 
 the faith has consented to other horrible crimes; and therefore the devil more 
 often uses such means to harm creatures. Further, we may say that, although 
 the devil can work without a witch, he yet very much prefers to work with one, 
 for the many reasons which we showed earlier in this work.<br> 
 
         
 To sum up our conclusions on this matter, it is to be said that, following the 
 above distinctions, those who are suspected of the heresy of witchcraft are 
 separated into three categories, since some are lightly, some strongly, and 
 some gravely suspected. And they are lightly suspected who act in such a way as 
 to give rise to a small or light suspicion against hem of this heresy. And 
 although, as has been said, a person who is found to be suspected in this way 
 is not to be branded as a heretic, yet he must undergo a canonical purgation, 
 or he must be caused to pronounce a solemn abjuration as in the case of one 
 convicted of a slight heresy.<br> 
 
         
 For the Canon (cap. <i>excommunicamus</i>) says: Those who have been found to 
 rest under a probable suspicion (that is, says Henry of Segusio, a light 
 suspicion), unless, having respect to the nature of the suspicion and the 
 quality of their persons, they should prove their innocent by a fitting 
 purgation, they are to be stricken with the sword of anathema as a worthy 
 satisfaction in the sight of all men. And if they continue obstinate in their 
 excommunication for the period of a year, they are to utterly condemned as 
 heretics.<br> 
 
         
 And note that, in the purgation imposed upon them, whether or not they consent 
 to it, and whether or not they fail in it, they are throughout to be judged as 
 reputed heretics on whom a canonical purgation is to be imposed.<br> 
 
         
 And that a person under this light suspicion can and should be caused to 
 pronounce a solemn abjuration is shown in the chapter <i>Accusatus</i>, where 
 it says: A person accused or suspected of heresy, against whom there is a 
 strong suspicion of this crime, if he abjures the heresy before the Judge and 
 afterwards commits it, then, by a sort of legal fiction, he shall be judged to 
 have relapsed into heresy, although the heresy was not proved against him 
 before his abjuration. But if the suspicion was in the first place a small or 
 light one, although such a relapse renders the accused liable to severe 
 punishment, yet he is not to suffer the punishment of those who relapse into 
 heresy.<br> 
 
         
 But those who are strongly suspected, that is, those who have acted in such a 
 way as to engender a great and strong suspicion; even those are not 
 necessarily heretics or to be condemned as such. For it is expressly stated in 
 the Canon that no one is to be condemned of so great a crime by reason of a 
 strong suspicion. And it says:<br> 
 
         
 Therefore we order that, when the accused is only under suspicion, even if it 
 be a strong one, we do not wish him to be condemned of so grave a crime; but 
 such a one so strongly suspected must be commanded to abjure all heresy in 
 general, and in particular that of which he is strongly suspected.<br> 
 
         
 But if he afterwards relapses either into his former heresy or into any other, 
 or if he associates with those whom he knows to be witches or heretics, or 
 visits them, receives, consults with, forgives, or favours them, he shall not 
 escape the punishment of backsliders, according to the chapter 
 <i>Accusatus</i>. For it says there: He who has been involved in one kind or 
 sect of heresy, or has erred in one article of the faith or sacrament of the 
 Church, and has afterwards specifically and generally abjured his heresy: if 
 thereafter he follows another kind or sect of heresy, or errs in another 
 article or sacrament of the Church, it is our will that he be judged a 
 backslider. He, therefore, who is known to have lapsed into heresy before his 
 abjuration, if after his abjuration he receives heretics, visits them, gives 
 or sends them presents or gifts, or shows favour to them, etc., he is worthily 
 and truly to judged a backslider; for by this proof there is no doubt that he 
 was in the first place guilty. Such is the tenor of the Canon.<br> 
 
         
 From these words it is clear that there are three cases in which a person 
 under strong suspicion of heresy shall, after his abjuration, be punished as a 
 backslider. The first is when he falls back into the same heresy of which he 
 was strongly suspected. The second is when he has abjured al heresy in 
 general, and yet lapses into another heresy, even if he has never before been 
 suspected or accused of that heresy. The third is when he receives and shows 
 favour to heretics. And this last comprises and embraces many cases.<br> 
 
         
 But it is asked what should be done when a person who has fallen under so 
 strong a suspicion steadily refuses to comply with his Judge’s order to abjure 
 his heresy: is he to be at once handed over to the secular Court to be 
 punished? We answer that by no means must this be done; for the Canon (<i>ad 
 abolendam</i>) expressly speaks, not of suspects, but of those who are 
 manifestly taken in heresy. And more rigorous action is to be employed against 
 those who are manifestly taken than against those who are only suspected.<br> 
 
         
 And if it is asked, How then is such a one to be proceeded against? We answer 
 that the Judge must proceed against him in accordance with the chapter 
 <i>excommunicamus</i>, and he must be excommunicated. And if he continues 
 obstinate after a year’s excommunication, he is to be condemned as a 
 heretic.<br> 
 
         
 There are others again who are violently or gravely suspected, whose actions 
 give rise to a violent suspicion against them; and such a one is to be 
 considered as a heretic, and throughout he is to be treated as if he were 
 taken in heresy, in accordance with the Canon Law. For these either confess 
 their crime or not; and if they do, and wish to return to the faith and abjure 
 their heresy, they are to be received back into penitence. But if they refuse 
 to abjure, they are to be handed over to the secular Court for punishment.<br> 
 
         
 But if he does not confess his crime after he has been convicted, and does not 
 consent to abjure his heresy, he is to be condemned as an impenitent heretic. 
 For a violent suspicion is sufficient to warrant a conviction, and admits no 
 proof to the contrary.<br> 
 
         
 Now this discussion deals with simple heresy, where there is no direct or 
 indirect evidence of the fact, as will be shown in the sixth method of passing 
 sentence, where a man is to be condemned as a heretic even though he may not 
 actually be one: then how much more is it applicable to the heresy of witches, 
 where there is always in addition either the direct evidence of bewitched 
 children, men, or animals, or the indirect evidence of instruments of 
 witchcraft which have been found.<br> 
 
         
 And although in the case of simple heresy those who are penitent and abjure 
 are, as has been said, admitted to penitence and imprisonment for life; yet in 
 this heresy, although the ecclesiastic Judge may receive the prisoner into 
 penitence, yet the civil Judge can, because of her temporal injuries, that is 
 to say, the harms she has done to men, cattle, and goods, punish her with 
 death; nor can the ecclesiastic Judge prevent this, for even if he does not 
 hand her over to be punished, yet he is compelled to deliver her up at the 
 request of the civil Judge.<br>
