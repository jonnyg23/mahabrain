 <h2>Question IV</h2>
 <h3>By which Devils are the Operations of Incubus and Succubus Practised?</h3></center>
 
         
 Is it Catholic to affirm that the functions of Incubi and Succubi belong 
 indifferently and equally to all unclean spirits? <i>And it seems</i> that 
 it is so; for to affirm the opposite would be to maintain that there is some 
 good order among them. It is argued that just as in the computation of the 
 Good there are degrees and orders (see S. Augustine in his book on 
 the nature of the Good), 
 so also the computation of the Evil is based upon confusion. But as among 
 the good Angels nothing can be without order, so among the bad all is 
 disorder, and therefore they all indifferently follows these practices. See 
 <i>Job x.</i>: A land of darkness, as darkness 
 itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light 
 is as darkness.<br>
 
         
 Again, if they do not all indifferently follow these practices, this quality 
 in them comes either from their nature, or from sin, or from punishment. But 
 it does not come from their nature, since they are all without distinction 
 given to sin, as was set out in the preceding question. For they are by 
 nature impure spirits, yet not so unclean as to pejorate their good parts; 
 subtle in wickedness, eager to do harm, swollen with pride, etc. Therefore 
 these practices in them are due either to sin or to punishment. Then again, 
 where the sin is greater, there is the punishment greater; and the higher 
 angels sinned more greatly, therefore their punishment they have the more to 
 follow these filthy practices. If this is not so, another reason will be 
 given why they do not indifferently practise these things.<br>
 
         
 And again, it is argued that where there is no discipline or obedience, 
 there all work without distinction; and it is submitted that there is no 
 discipline or obedience among devils, and no agreement. 
 <i>Proverbs</i> xiii.: Among the proud there is 
 always contention.<br>
 
         
 Again, just as because of sin they will all equally be case into Hell after 
 the Day of Judgement, so before that time they are detained in the lower 
 mists on account of the duties assigned to them. We do not read that there 
 is equality on account of emancipation, therefore neither is there equality 
 in the matter of duty and temptation.<br>
 
         
 But <i>against</i> this there is the first gloss on 
 I <i>Corinthians</i> xv: As long as the world 
 endures Angels are set over Angels, men over men, and devils over devils. 
 Also in <i>Job</i> xl 
 it speaks of the scales of Leviathan, which signify the members of the devil, 
 how one cleaves to another. Therefore there is among them diversity both of 
 order and of action.<br>
 
         
 Another question arises, whether or not the devils can be restrained by the 
 good Angels from pursuing these foul practices. It must be said that the 
 Angels to whose command the adverse Influences are subject are called 
 Powers, as S. Gregory says, and S. Augustine 
 (<i>de Trinitate</i>, 3). A rebellious and sinful 
 spirit of life is subject to an obedient, pious and just spirit of life. 
 And those Creatures which are more perfect and nearer to God have authority 
 over the others: for the whole order of preference is originally and in the 
 first place in God, and is shared by His creatures according as they approach 
 more nearly to Him. Therefore the good Angels, who are nearest to God on 
 account of their fruition in Him, which the devils lack, have preference 
 over the devils, and rule over them.<br>
 
         
 And when it is urged that devils work much harm without any medium, or that 
 they are not hindered because they are not subject to good Angels who might 
 prevent them; or that if they are so subject, then the evil that is done by 
 the subject is due to negligence on the part of the master, and there seems 
 to be some negligence among the good Angels: the answer is that the Angels 
 are ministers of the Divine wisdom. It follows then that, as the Divine 
 wisdom permits certain evil to be done by bad Angels or men, for the sake of 
 the good that He draws therefrom, so also the good Angels do not altogether 
 prevent wicked men or devils from doing evil.<br>
 
         
 <i>Answer</i>. It is Catholic to maintain that there is a certain order of 
 interior and exterior actions, and a degree of preference among devils. 
 Whence it follows that certain abominations are committed by the lowest 
 orders, from which the higher orders are precluded on account of the 
 nobility of their natures. And this is generally said to arise from a 
 threefold congruity, in that such things harmonize with their nature, with 
 the Divine wisdom, and with their own wickedness.<br>
 
         
 But more particularly as touching their nature. It is agreed that from the 
 beginning of Creation some were always by nature superior, since they differ 
 among themselves as to form; and no two Angels are alike in form. This 
 follows the more general opinion, which also agrees with the words of the 
 Philosophers. Dionysus also lays it down in his tenth chapter 
 <i>On the Celestial Hierarchy</i> 
 that in the same order there are three separate degrees; and we must agree 
 with this, since they are both immaterial and incorporeal. See also 
 S. Thomas (ii. 2). 
 For sin does not take away their nature, and the devils after the Fall did 
 not lose their natural gifts, as has been said before; and the operations 
 of things follow their natural conditions. Therefore both in nature and in 
 operation they are various and multiple.<br>
 
         
 This harmonizes also with the Divine wisdom; for that which is ordained is 
 ordained by God 
 (<i>Romans</i> xiii). 
 And since devils were deputed by God for the temptation of men and the 
 punishment of the damned, therefore they work upon men from without by many 
 and various means.<br>
 
         
 It harmonizes also with their own wickedness. For since they are at war with 
 the human race, they fight in an orderly manner; for so they think to do 
 greater harm to men, and so they do. Whence it follows that they do not 
 share in an equal manner in their most unspeakable abominations.<br>
 
         
 And this is more specifically proved as follows. For since, as has been said, 
 the operation follows the nature of the thing, it follows also that those 
 whose natures are subordinate must in turn be subordinate to themselves in 
 operation, just as is the case in corporeal matters. For since the lower 
 bodies are by natural ordination below the celestial bodies, and their 
 actions and motions are subject to the actions and motions of the celestial 
 bodies; and since the devils, as has been said, differ among themselves in 
 natural order; therefore they also differ among themselves in their natural 
 actions, both extrinsic and instrinsic, and especially in the performance of 
 the abominations in question.<br>
 
         
 From which it is concluded that since the practice of these abominations is 
 for the most part foreign to the nobility of the angelic nature, so also in 
 human actions the foulest and beastliest acts are to be considered by 
 themselves, and not in relation to the duty of human nature and procreation.<br>
 
         
 Finally, since some are believed to have fallen from every order, it is not 
 unsuitable to maintain that those devils who fell from the lowest choir, and 
 even in that held the lowest rank, are deputed to and perform these and 
 other abominations.<br>
 
         
 Also it must be carefully noted that, though the Scripture speaks of Incubi 
 and Succubi lusting after women, yet nowhere do we read that Incubi and 
 Succubi fell into vices against nature. We do not speak only of sodomy, but 
 of any other sin whereby the act is wrongfully performed outside the 
 rightful channel. And the very great enormity of such as sin in this way is 
 shown by the fact that all devils equally, of whatsoever order, abominate 
 and think shame to commit such actions. And it seems that the gloss on 
 <i>Ezekiel</i> xix 
 means this, where it says: I will give thee into the hands of the dwellers 
 in Palestine, that is devils, who shall blush at your iniquities, meaning 
 vices against nature. And the student will see what should be 
 authoritatively understood concerning devils. For no sin has God so often 
 punished by the shameful death of multitudes.<br>
 
         
 Indeed many say, and it is truly believed, that no one can unimperilled 
 persevere in the practice of such vices beyond the period of the mortal life 
 of Christ, which lasted for thirty-three years, unless he should be saved by 
 some special grace of the Redeemer. And this is proved by the fact that 
 there have often been ensnared by this vice octogenarians and centenarians, 
 who had up to that time ruled their lives according to the discipline of 
 Christ; and, having forsaken Him, they have found the very greatest 
 difficulty in obtaining deliverance, and in abandoning themselves to such 
 vices.<br>
 
         
 Moreover, the names of the devils indicate what order there is among them, 
 and what office is assigned to each. For though one and the same name, that 
 of devil, is generally used in Scripture because of their various qualities, 
 yet the Scriptures teach that One is set over these filthy actions, just as 
 certain other vices are subject to Another. For it is the practice of 
 Scripture and of speech to name every unclean spirit Diabolus, from Dia, 
 that is Two, and Bolus, that is Morsel; for he kills two thing, the body and 
 the soul. And this is in accordance with etymology, although in Greek 
 <i>Diabolus</i> means shut in Prison, which also is apt, since he is not 
 permitted to do as much harm as he wishes. Or Diabolus may mean Downflowing, 
 since he flowed down, that is, fell down, both specifically and locally. He 
 is also named Demon, that is, Cunning over Blood, since he thirsts for and 
 procures sin with a threefold knowledge, being powerful in the subtlety of 
 his nature, in his age-long experience, and in the revelation of the good 
 spirits. He is called also Belial, which means Without Yoke or Master; for 
 he can fight against him to whom he should be subject. He is called also 
 Beelzebub, which means Lord of Flies, that is, of the souls of sinners who 
 have left the true faith of Christ. Also Satan, that is, the Adversary; see 
 I <i>S. Peter</i> ii: For your adversary the devil 
 goeth about, etc. Also Behemoth, that is, Beast, because he makes men bestial.<br>
 
         
 But the very devil of Fornication, and the chief of that abomination, is 
 called Asmodeus, which means the Creature of Judgement: for because of this 
 kind of sin a terrible judgement was executed upon Sodom and the four other 
 cities. Similarly the devil of Pride is called Leviathan, which means Their 
 Addition; because when Lucifer tempted our first parents he promised them, 
 out of his pride, the addition of Divinity. Concerning him the Lord said 
 through Esaias: I shall visit it upon Leviathan, that old and tortuous 
 serpent. And the devil of Avarice and Riches is called Mammon, whom also 
 Christ mentions in the Gospel 
 (<i>S. Matthew</i> vi): Ye cannot serve God, etc.<br>
 
         
 To the arguments. <i>First</i>, that good can be found without evil, but 
 evil cannot be found without good; for it is poured upon a creature that is 
 good in itself. And therefore the devils, in so far as they have a good 
 nature, were ordained in the course of nature; and for their actions see 
 <i>Job</i> x.<br>
 
         
 <i>Secondly</i>, it can be said that the devils deputed to work are not in 
 Hell, but in the lower mists. And they have here an order among themselves, 
 which they will not have in Hell. From which it may be said that all order 
 ceased among them, as touching the attainment of blessedness, at that time 
 when they fell irrecoverably from such rank. And it may be said that even in 
 Hell there will be among them a gradation of power, and of the affliction of 
 punishments, inasmuch as some, and not others, will be deputed to torment the 
 souls. But this gradation will come rather from God than from themselves, as 
 will also their torments.<br>
 
         
 <i>Thirdly</i>, when it is said that the higher devils, because they sinned 
 the more, are the more punished, and must therefore be the more bound to the 
 commission of these filthy acts, it is answered that sin bears relation to 
 punishment, and not to the act or operation of nature; and therefore it is 
 by reason of their nobility of nature that these are not given to such 
 filthiness, and it has nothing to do with their sin or punishment. And 
 though they are all impure spirits, and eager to do harm, yet one is more 
 so than another, in proportion as their natures are the further thrust into 
 darkness.<br>
 
         
 <i>Fourthly</i>, it is said that there is agreement among devils, but of 
 wickedness rather than friendship, in that they hate mankind, and strive 
 their utmost against justice. For such agreement is found among the wicked, 
 that they band themselves together, and depute those whose talents seem 
 suitable to the pursuit of particular iniquities.<br>
 
         
 <i>Fifthly</i>, although imprisonment is equally decreed for all, now in the 
 lower atmosphere and afterwards in Hell, yet not therefore are equal 
 penalties and duties equally ordained for them: for the nobler they are in 
 nature and the more potent in office, the heavier is the torment to which 
 they are subjected. See 
 <i>Wisdom</i> vi: 
 The powerful shall powerfully suffer torments.
