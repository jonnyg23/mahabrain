 <h2>Question XXVI</h2>
 <h3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who is both Suspect and Defamed</h3></center>
 
 
         
 THE seventh method of bringing to a conclusion a process on behalf of the 
 faith is employed when the person accused of the sin of heresy, after a 
 careful examination of the merits of the process in consultation with men 
 learned in the law, is found to be both suspected and defamed of heresy. And 
 this is when the accused is not legally convicted by his own confession or by 
 the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate production of witnesses; but is 
 found to be publicly defamed, and there are also other indications which 
 render him lightly or strongly suspected of heresy: as that he has held much 
 familiarity with heretics. And such a person must, because of his defamation, 
 undergo a canonical purgation; and because of the suspicion against him he 
 must abjure the heresy.<br> 
 
         
 The procedure in such a case will be as follows. Such a person, being publicly 
 defamed for heresy, and being in addition to this suspected of heresy by 
 reason of certain other indications, shall first publicly purge himself in the 
 manner which we explained in the second method. Having performed this 
 purgation, he shall immediately, as one against whom there are other 
 indications of the suspected heresy, abjure that heresy in the following 
 manner, having before him, as before, the Book of the Gospels:<br> 
 
         
 I., N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing my trial in person before 
 you my Lords, N., Bishop of such city and Judge in the territory of such 
 Prince, having touched with my hands the Holy Gospels placed before me, swear 
 that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips that Holy Apostolic Faith 
 which the Roman Church believes, professes, preaches and observes. And 
 consequently I abjure, detest, renounce and revoke every heresy which rears 
 itself up against the Holy and Apostolic Church, of whatever sect or error it 
 be, etc., as above.<br> 
 
         
 Also I swear and promise that I will never hereafter do or say or cause to be 
 done such and such (naming them), for which I am justly defamed as having 
 committed them, and of which you hold be suspected. Also I swear and promise 
 that I will perform to the best of my strength every penance which you impose 
 on me, nor will I omit any part of it, so help me God and this Holy Gospel. 
 And if hereafter I should act in any way contrary to this oath and abjuration 
 (which God forbid), I here and now freely submit, oblige, and bind myself to 
 the legal punishment for such, to the limit of sufferance, when it shall have 
 been proved that I have committed such things.<br> 
 
         
 But it must be noted that when the indications are so strong as to render the 
 accused, either with or without the aforesaid defamation, strongly suspected 
 of heresy, then he shall, as above, abjure all heresy in general. And if he 
 relapsed into any heresy, he shall suffer the due punishment of a backslider. 
 But if the indications are so small and slight as, even taken together with 
 the said defamation, not to render him strongly, but only lightly, suspected 
 of heresy, then it is enough if he makes not a general abjuration, but 
 specifically abjures that heresy of which he is suspected; so that, if he were 
 to relapse into another form of heresy, he would not be liable to the penalty 
 for backsliders. And even if he were to relapse into the same heresy which he 
 had abjured, he would still not be liable to the said penalty, although he 
 would be more severely punished than would have been the case if he had not 
 abjured.<br> 
 
         
 But there is a doubt whether he would be liable to the penalty for backsliders 
 if, after his canonical purgation, he should relapse into the same heresy of 
 which he was canonically purged. And it would seem that this would be so, from 
 the Canon Law, c. <i>excommunicamus</i> and c. <i>ad abolendam</i>. Therefore 
 the Notary must take great care to set it down whether such a person has made 
 his abjuration as one under a light or a strong suspicion of heresy; for, as 
 we have often said, there is a great difference between these. And when this 
 has been done, sentence or penance shall be pronounced in the following 
 manner:<br> 
 
         
 We., N., Bishop of such city or Judge in the territories of such Prince, 
 having diligently in mind that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, 
 have been accused before us of such heresy (naming it); and wishing to inquire 
 judicially whether you have fallen into the said heresy, by examining 
 witnesses, by summoning and questioning you upon oath, and by all convenient 
 means in our power, we have acted and proceeded as it behoved.<br> 
 
         
 Having digested, observed and diligently inspected all the facts, and having 
 discussed the merits of the process of this case, examining al and singular 
 which has been done and said, and having consulted with and obtained the 
 mature opinion of many learned Theologians and lawyers, we find that you have 
 been in such place or places publicly defamed by good and sober men for the 
 said heresy; wherefore, as we are bidden by the canonical institutions, we 
 have imposed upon you a canonical purgation by which you and your sponsors 
 have here publicly purged yourself before us. We find also that you have 
 committed such and such (naming them), by reason of which we have just cause t 
 hold you strongly or lightly (let it be said whether it is one or the other) 
 suspected of the said heresy; and therefore we have caused you to abjure 
 heresy as one under such suspicion (here, if he has abjured as one under 
 strong suspicion, let them say all heresy; and if as one under 
 light suspicion, the said heresy).<br> 
 
         
 But because we cannot and must not in any way tolerate that which you have 
 done, but are in justice compelled to abominate it, that you may become more 
 careful in the future, and that your crimes may not remain unpunished, and 
 that others may not be encouraged to fall into the like sins, and that the 
 injuries to the Creator may not easily be passed over: Therefore against you, 
 N., having so purged yourself and abjured, standing personally in our presence 
 in this place at the time which was assigned to you, We, the aforesaid Bishop 
 or Judge, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy 
 Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our 
 eyes see with equity, pronounce sentence or penance in the following manner, 
 namely, that you must, etc.<br> 
 
         
 And let them pronounce sentence as shall seem most to the honour of the faith 
 and the extermination of the sin of heresy: as that on certain Sundays and 
 Festivals he must stand at the door of such a church, holding a candle of such 
 a weight, during the solemnization of Holy Mass, with head uncovered and bare 
 feet, and offer the said candle at the altar; and that he must fast on 
 Fridays, and that for a certain period he must not dare to depart from that 
 place, but present himself before the Bishop or Judge on certain days of the 
 week; and any similar penance which seemed to be demanded by the particular 
 nature of his guilt; for it is impossible to give a hard-and-fast rule. This 
 sentence was given, etc. And let it be put into execution after it has been 
 pronounced; and it can be cancelled, mitigated or changed as may be required 
 by the condition of the penitent and for his correction and humiliation; for 
 the Bishop has this power by law.
