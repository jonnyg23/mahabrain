 <h2>Question II</h2>
 <h3>Of the Number of Witnesses</h3></center>
 
 
         
 Since we have said that in the second method the evidence of the witnesses 
 is to be written down, it is necessary to know how many witnesses there 
 should be, and of what condition. The question is whether a Judge may 
 lawfully convict any person of the heresy of witchcraft on the evidence of 
 two legitimate witnesses whose evidence is entirely concordant, or whether 
 more than two are necessary. And we say that the evidence of witnesses is 
 not entirely concordant when it is only partially so; that is, when two 
 witnesses differ in their accounts, but agree in the substance or effect: as 
 when one says She bewitched my cow, and the other says, 
 She bewitched my child, but they agree as to the fact of 
 witchcraft.<br>
 
         
 But here we are concerned with the case of two witnesses being in entire, 
 not partial, agreement. And the answer is that, although two witnesses seem 
 to be enough to satisfy the rigour of law (for the rule is that that which 
 is sworn to by two or three is taken for the truth); yet in a charge of this 
 kind two witnesses do not seem sufficient to ensure an equitable judgement, 
 on account of the heinousness of the crime in question. For the proof of an 
 accusation ought to be clearer than daylight; and especially ought this to 
 be so in the case of the grave charge of heresy.<br>
 
         
 But it may be said that very little proof is required in a charge of this 
 nature, since it takes very little argument to expose a person's guilt; for 
 it is said in the Canon <i>de Haereticis</i>, lib. II, that a man makes 
 himself a heretic if in the least of his opinions he wanders from the 
 teaching and the path of the Catholic religion. We answer that this is true 
 enough with reference to the presumption that a person is a heretic, but not 
 as regards a condemnation. For in a charge of this sort the usual order of 
 judicial procedure is cut short, since the defendant does not see the 
 witnesses take the oath, nor are they made known to him, because this might 
 expose them to grave danger; therefore, according to the statute, the 
 prisoner is not permitted to know who are his accusers. But the Judge himself 
 must by virtue of his office, inquire into any personal enmity felt by the 
 witnesses towards the prisoner; and such witnesses cannot be allowed, as 
 will be shown later. And when the witnesses give confused evidence on account 
 of something lying on their conscience, the Judge is empowered to put them 
 through a second interrogatory. For the less opportunity the prisoner has to 
 defend himself, the more carefully and diligently should the Judge conduct 
 his inquiry.<br>
 
         
 Therefore, although there are two legitimate and concordant witnesses 
 against a person, even so I do not allow that this would be sufficient 
 warrant for a Judge to condemn a person on so great a charge; but if the 
 prisoner is the subject of an evil report, a period should be set for his 
 purgation; and if he is under strong suspicion on account of the evidence 
 of two witnesses, the Judge should make him abjure the heresy, or question 
 him, or defer his sentence. For it does not seem just to condemn a man of 
 good name on so great a charge on the evidence of only two witnesses, though 
 the case is otherwise with a person of bad reputation. This matter is fully 
 dealt with in the Canon Law of heretics, where it is set down that the 
 Bishop shall cause three or more men of good standing to give evidence on 
 oath to speak the truth as to whether they have any knowledge of the 
 existence of heretics in such a parish.<br>
 
         
 Again it may be asked whether the Judge can justly condemn a person of such 
 heresy only on the evidence of witnesses who in some respects differ in 
 their evidence, or merely on the strength of a general accusation. We 
 answer that he cannot do so on either of the above grounds. Especially since 
 the proofs of a charge ought, as we have said, to be clearer than daylight; 
 and in this particular charge no one is to be condemned on merely presumptive 
 evidence. Therefore in the case of a prisoner who is the subject of a general 
 accusation, a period of purgation shall be set for him; and in the case of 
 one who is under strong suspicion arising from the evidence of witnesses, 
 he shall be made to abjure his heresy. But when, in spite of certain 
 discrepancies, the witnesses agree in the main facts, then the matter shall 
 rest with the Judge's discretion; and indirectly the question arises how 
 often the witnesses can be examined.
