 1. INTRODUCTION<br>
 <br>
 Since 1981 I have been assigned to the Behavioral Science Unit at <br>
 the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and have specialized in <br>
 studying all aspects of the sexual victimization of children. The <br>
 FBI Behavioral Science Unit provides assistance to criminal justice <br>
 professionals in the United States and foreign countries. It <br>
 attempts to develop practical applications of the behavioral <br>
 sciences to the criminal justice system. As a result of training and <br>
 research conducted by the Unit and its successes in analyzing <br>
 violent crime, many professionals contact the Behavioral Science <br>
 Unit for assistance and guidance in dealing with violent crime, <br>
 especially those cases considered different, unusual, or bizarre. <br>
 This service is provided at no cost and is not limited to crimes <br>
 under the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI.<br>
 <br>
 In 1983 and 1984, when I first began to hear stories of what sounded <br>
 like satanic or occult activity in connection with allegations of <br>
 sexual victimization of children (allegations that have come to be <br>
 referred to most often as "ritual" child abuse), I tended to believe <br>
 them. I had been dealing with bizarre, deviant behavior for many <br>
 years and had long since realized that almost anything is possible. <br>
 Just when you think that you have heard it all, along comes another <br>
 strange case. The idea that there are a few cunning, secretive <br>
 individuals in positions of power somewhere in this country <br>
 regularly killing a few people as part of some satanic ritual or <br>
 ceremony and getting away with it is certainly within the realm of <br>
 possibility. But the number of alleged cases began to grow and grow. <br>
 We now have hundreds of victims alleging that thousands of offenders <br>
 are abusing and even murdering tens of thousands of people as part <br>
 of organized satanic cults, and there is little or no corroborative <br>
 evidence. The very reason many "experts" cite for believing these <br>
 allegations (i.e. many victims, who never met each other, reporting <br>
 the same events), is the primary reason I began to question at least <br>
 some aspects of these allegations. <br>
 <br>
 I have devoted more than seven years part-time, and eleven years <br>
 full-time, of my professional life to researching, training, and <br>
 consulting in the area of the sexual victimization of children. The <br>
 issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation are a big part of my <br>
 professional life's work. I have no reason to deny their existence <br>
 or nature. In fact I have done everything I can to make people more <br>
 aware of the problem Some have even blamed me for helping to create <br>
 the hysteria that has led to these bizarre allegations. I can accept <br>
 no outside income and am paid the same salary by the FBI whether or <br>
 not children are abused and exploited - and whether the number is <br>
 one or one million. As someone deeply concerned about and <br>
 professionally committed to the issue, I did not lightly question <br>
 the allegations of hundreds of victims child sexual abuse and <br>
 exploitation.<br>
 <br>
 In response to accusations by a few that I am a "satanist" who has <br>
 infiltrated the FBI to facilitate cover-up, how does anyone (or <br>
 should anyone have to) disprove such allegations? Although reluctant <br>
 to dignify such absurd accusations with a reply, all I can say to <br>
 those who have made such allegations that they are wrong and to <br>
 those who heard such allegations is to carefully consider the <br>
 source.<br>
 <br>
 The reason I have taken the position I have is not because I support <br>
 or believe in "satanism", but because I sincerely believe that my <br>
 approach is the proper and most effective investigative strategy. I <br>
 believe that my approach is in the best interest of victims of child <br>
 sexual abuse. It would have been easy to sit back, as many have, and <br>
 say nothing publicly about this controversy. I have spoken out and <br>
 published on this issue because I am concerned about the credibility <br>
 of the child sexual abuse issue and outraged that, in some cases, <br>
 individuals are getting away with molesting children because we <br>
 can't prove they are satanic devil worshippers who engage in <br>
 brainwashing, human sacrifice, and cannibalism as part of a large <br>
 conspiracy.<br>
 <br>
 There are many valid perspectives from which to assess and evaluate <br>
 victim allegations of sex abuse and exploitation. Parents may choose <br>
 to believe simply because their children make the claims. The level <br>
 of proof necessary may be minimal because the consequences of <br>
 believing are within the family. One parent correctly told me, "I <br>
 believe what my child needs me to believe."<br>
 <br>
 Therapists may choose to believe simply because their professional <br>
 assessment is that their patient believes the victimization and <br>
 describes it so vividly. The level of proof necessary may be no more <br>
 than therapeutic evaluation because the consequences are between <br>
 therapist and patient. No independent corroboration may be required.<br>
 <br>
 A social worker must have more real, tangible evidence of abuse in <br>
 order to take protective action and initiate legal proceedings. The <br>
 level of proof necessary must be higher because the consequences <br>
 (denial of visitation, foster care) are greater.<br>
 <br>
 The law enforcement officer deals with the criminal justice system. <br>
 The levels of proof necessary are reasonable suspicion, probable <br>
 cause, and beyond a reasonable doubt because the consequences <br>
 (criminal investigation, search and seizure, arrest, incarceration) <br>
 are so great. This discussion will focus primarily on the criminal <br>
 justice system and the law enforcement perspective. The level of <br>
 proof necessary for taking action on allegations of criminal acts <br>
 must be more than simply the victim alleged it and it is possible. <br>
 This in no way denies the validity and importance of the parental, <br>
 therapeutic, social welfare, or any other perspective of these <br>
 allegations.<br>
 <br>
 When, however, therapists and other professionals begin to conduct <br>
 training, publish articles, and communicate through the media, the <br>
 consequences become greater, and therefore the level of proof must <br>
 be greater. The amount of corroboration necessary to act upon <br>
 allegations of abuse is dependent upon the consequences of such <br>
 action. We need to be concerned about the distribution and <br>
 publication of unsubstantiated allegations of bizarre sexual abuse. <br>
 Information needs to be disseminated to encourage communication and <br>
 research about the phenomena. The risks, however, of intervenor and <br>
 victim "contagion" and public hysteria are potential negative <br>
 aspects of such dissemination. Because of the highly emotional and <br>
 religious nature of this topic, there is a greater possibility that <br>
 the spreading of information will result in a kind of self-<br>
 fulfilling prophesy.<br>
 <br>
 If such extreme allegations are going to be disseminated to the <br>
 general public, they must be presented in the context of being <br>
 assessed and evaluated, at least, from the professional perspective <br>
 of the disseminator and, at best, also from the professional <br>
 perspective of relevant others. This is what I will attempt to do in <br>
 this discussion. The assessment and evaluation of such allegations <br>
 are areas where law enforcement, mental health, and other <br>
 professionals (anthropologists, folklorists, sociologists, <br>
 historians, engineers, surgeons, etc.) may be of some assistance to <br>
 each other in validating these cases individually and in general. <br>
 <br>
 2. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW<br>
 <br>
 In order to attempt to deal with extreme allegations of what <br>
 constitute child sex rings, it is important to have an historical <br>
 perspective of society's attitudes about child sexual abuse. I will <br>
 provide a brief synopsis of recent attitudes in the United States <br>
 here, but those desiring more detailed information about such <br>
 societal attitudes, particularly in other cultures and in the more <br>
 distant past, should refer to Florence Rush's book _The Best Kept <br>
 Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children_ (1980) and Sander J. Breiner's <br>
 book _Slaughter of the Innocents_ (1990).<br>
 <br>
 Society's attitude about child sexual abuse and exploitation can be <br>
 summed up in one word: *denial*. Most people do not want to hear <br>
 about it and would prefer to pretend that child sexual victimization <br>
 just does not occur. Today, however, it is difficult to pretend that <br>
 it does not happen. Stories and reports about child sexual <br>
 victimization are daily occurrences.<br>
 <br>
 It is important for professionals dealing with child sexual abuse to <br>
 recognize and learn to manage this denial of a serious problem. <br>
 Professionals must overcome the denial and encourage society to deal <br>
 with, report, and prevent sexual victimization of children.<br>
 <br>
 Some professionals, however, in their zeal to make American society <br>
 more aware of this victimization, tend to exaggerate the problem. <br>
 Presentations and literature with poorly documented or misleading <br>
 claims about one in three children being sexually molested, the $5 <br>
 billion child pornography industry, child slavery rings, and 50,000 <br>
 stranger-abducted children are not uncommon. The problem is bad <br>
 enough; it is not necessary to exaggerate it. Professionals should <br>
 cite reputable and scientific studies and note the sources of <br>
 information. If they do not, when the exaggerations and distortions <br>
 are discovered, their credibility and the credibility of the issue <br>
 are lost.<br>
 <br>
 -- a. "STRANGER DANGER".<br>
 <br>
 During the 1950s and 1960s the primary focus in the literature and <br>
 discussions on sexual abuse of children was on "stranger danger" - <br>
 the dirty old man in the wrinkled raincoat. If one could not deny <br>
 the existence of child sexual abuse, one described victimization in <br>
 simplistic terms of good and evil. The "stranger danger" approach to <br>
 preventing child sexual abuse is clear-cut. We immediately know who <br>
 the good guys and bad guys are and what they look like.<br>
 <br>
 The FBI distributed a poster that epitomized this attitude. It <br>
 showed a man, with his hat pulled down, hiding behind a tree with a <br>
 bag of candy in his hands. He was waiting for a sweet little girl <br>
 walking home from school alone. At the top it read: "Boys and Girls, <br>
 color the page, memorize the rules." At the bottom it read: "For <br>
 your protection, remember to turn down gifts from strangers, and <br>
 refuse rides offered by strangers." The poster clearly contrasts the <br>
 evil of the offender with the goodness of the child victim.<br>
 <br>
 The myth of the child molester as the dirty old man in the wrinkled <br>
 raincoat is now being reevaluated, based on what we now know about <br>
 the kinds of people who victimize children. The fact is a child <br>
 molester can look like anyone else and even be someone we know and <br>
 like.<br>
 <br>
 There is another myth that is still with us and is far less likely <br>
 to be discussed. This is the myth of the child victim as a <br>
 completely innocent little girl walking down the street minding her <br>
 own business. It may be more important to dispel this myth than the <br>
 myth of the evil offender, especially when talking about the sexual <br>
 exploitation of children and child sex rings. Child victims can be <br>
 boys as well as girls, and not all victims are little "angels".<br>
 <br>
 Society seems to have a problem dealing with any sexual abuse case <br>
 in which the offender is not completely "bad" or the victim is not <br>
 completely "good". Child victims who, for example, simply behave <br>
 like human beings and respond to the attention and affection of <br>
 offenders by voluntarily and repeatedly returning to the offender's <br>
 home are troubling. It confuses us to see the victims in child <br>
 pornography giggling or laughing. At professional conferences on <br>
 child sexual abuse, child prostitution is almost never discussed. It <br>
 is the form of sexual victimization of children most unlike the <br>
 stereotype of the innocent girl victim. Child prostitutes, by <br>
 definition, participate in and often initiate their victimization. <br>
 Furthermore child prostitutes and the participants in child sex <br>
 rings are frequently boys. One therapist recently told me that a <br>
 researcher's data on child molestation were misleading because many <br>
 of the child victims in question were child prostitutes. This <br>
 implies that child prostitutes are not "real" child victims. In a <br>
 survey by the _Los Angeles Times_, only 37 percent of those <br>
 responding thought that child prostitution constituted child sexual <br>
 abuse (Timnik, 1985). Whether or not it seems fair, when adults and <br>
 children have sex, the child is always the victim.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. INTRAFAMILIAL CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE.<br>
 <br>
 During the 1970s, primarily as a result of the women's movement, <br>
 society began to learn more about the sexual victimization of <br>
 children. We began to realize that most children are sexually <br>
 molested by someone they know who is usually a relative - a father, <br>
 step-father, uncle, grandfather, older brother, or even a female <br>
 relative. Some mitigate the difficulty of accepting this by adopting <br>
 the view that only members of socio-economic groups other than <br>
 theirs engage in such behavior.<br>
 <br>
 It quickly became apparent that warnings about not taking gifts from <br>
 strangers were not good enough to prevent child sexual abuse. <br>
 Consequently, we began to develop prevention programs based on more <br>
 complex concepts, such as good touching and bad touching. the <br>
 "yucky" feeling, and the child's right to say no. These are not the <br>
 kinds of things you can easily and effectively communicate in fifty <br>
 minutes to hundreds of kids packed into a school auditorium. These <br>
 are very difficult issues, and programs must he carefully developed <br>
 and evaluated.<br>
 <br>
 In the late 1970s child sexual abuse became almost synonymous with <br>
 incest, and incest meant father-daughter sexual relations. <br>
 Therefore, the focus of child sexual abuse intervention became <br>
 father-daughter incest. Even today, the vast majority of training <br>
 materials, articles, and books on this topic refer to child sexual <br>
 abuse only in terms of intrafamilial father-daughter incest.<br>
 <br>
 Incest is, in fact, sexual relations between individuals of any age <br>
 too closely related to marry. It need not necessarily involve an <br>
 adult and a child, and it goes beyond child sexual abuse. But more<br>
 importantly child sexual abuse goes beyond father-daughter incest. <br>
 Intrafamilial incest between an adult and child may be the most <br>
 common form of child sexual abuse, but it is not the only form.<br>
 <br>
 The progress of the 1970s in recognizing that child sexual abuse was <br>
 not simply a result of "stranger danger" was an important <br>
 breakthrough in dealing with society's denial. The battle, however, <br>
 is not over. The persistent voice of society luring us back to the <br>
 more simple concept of "stranger danger" may never go away. It is <br>
 the voice of denial.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. RETURN TO "STRANGER DANGER".<br>
 <br>
 In the early 1980s the issue of missing children rose to prominence <br>
 and was focused primarily on the stranger abduction of little <br>
 children. Runaways, throwaways, noncustodial abductions, nonfamily <br>
 abductions of teenagers - all major problems within the missing <br>
 children's issue - were almost forgotten. People no longer wanted to <br>
 hear about good touching and bad touching and the child's right to <br>
 say "no". They wanted to be told, in thirty minutes or less, how <br>
 they could protect their children from abduction by strangers. We <br>
 were back to the horrible but simple and clear-cut concept of <br>
 "stranger danger".<br>
 <br>
 In the emotional zeal over the problem of missing children, isolated <br>
 horror stories and distorted numbers were sometimes used. The <br>
 American public was led to believe that most of the missing children <br>
 had been kidnapped by pedophiles - a new term for child molesters. <br>
 The media, profiteers, and well-intentioned zealots all played big <br>
 roles in this hype and hysteria over missing children.<br>
 <br>
 -- d. THE ACQUAINTANCE MOLESTER.<br>
 <br>
 Only recently has society begun to deal openly with a critical piece <br>
 in the puzzle of child sexual abuse - acquaintance molestation. This <br>
 seems to be the most difficult aspect of the problem for us to face. <br>
 People seem more willing to accept a father or stepfather, <br>
 particularly one from another socio-economic group, as a child <br>
 molester than a parish priest, a next-door neighbor, a police <br>
 officer, a pediatrician, an FBI agent, or a Scout leader. The <br>
 acquaintance molester, by definition, is one of us. These kinds of <br>
 molesters have always existed, but our society has not been willing <br>
 to accept that fact.<br>
 <br>
 Sadly, one of the main reasons that the criminal justice system and <br>
 the public were forced to confront the problem of acquaintance <br>
 molestation was the preponderance of lawsuits arising from the <br>
 negligence of many institutions.<br>
 <br>
 One of the unfortunate outcomes of society's preference for the <br>
 "stranger danger" concept is what I call "say no, yell, and tell" <br>
 guilt. This is the result of prevention programs that tell potential <br>
 child victims to avoid sexual abuse by saying no, yelling, and <br>
 telling. This might work with the stranger hiding behind a tree. <br>
 Adolescent boys seduced by a Scout leader or children who actively <br>
 participate in their victimization often feel guilty and blame <br>
 themselves because they did not do what they were "supposed" to do. <br>
 They may feel a need to describe their victimization in more <br>
 socially acceptable but sometimes inaccurate ways that relieve them <br>
 of this guilt.<br>
 <br>
 While American society has become increasingly more aware of the <br>
 problem of the acquaintance molester and related problems such as <br>
 child pornography, the voice calling us back to "stranger danger" <br>
 still persists.<br>
 <br>
 -- e. SATANISM: A NEW FORM OF "STRANGER DANGER".<br>
 <br>
 In today's version of "stranger danger", it is the satanic devil <br>
 worshipers who are snatching and victimizing the children. Many who <br>
 warned us in the early 1980s about pedophiles snatching fifty <br>
 thousand kids a year now contend they were wrong only about who was <br>
 doing the kidnapping, not about the number abducted. This is again <br>
 the desire for the simple and clear-cut explanation for a complex <br>
 problem.<br>
 <br>
 For those who know anything about criminology, one of the oldest <br>
 theories of crime is demonology: The devil makes you do it. This <br>
 makes it even easier to deal with the child molester who is the <br>
 "pillar of the community". It is not his fault; it is not our fault. <br>
 There is no way we could have known; the devil made him do it. This <br>
 explanation has tremendous appeal because, like "stranger danger", <br>
 it presents the clear-cut, black-and-white struggle between good and <br>
 evil as the explanation for child abduction, exploitation, and <br>
 abuse.<br>
 <br>
 In regard to satanic "ritual" abuse, today we may not be where we <br>
 were with incest in the 1960s, but where we were with missing <br>
 children in the early 1980s. The best data now available (the 1990 <br>
 _National Incidence Studies on Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and <br>
 Thrownaway Children in America_) estimate the number of <br>
 stereotypical child abductions at between 200 and 300 a year, and <br>
 the number of stranger abduction homicides of children at between 43 <br>
 and 147 a year. Approximately half of the abducted children are <br>
 teenagers. Today's facts are significantly different from <br>
 yesterday's perceptions, and those who exaggerated the problem, <br>
 however well-intentioned, have lost credibility and damaged the <br>
 reality of the problem.<br>
 <br>
 3. LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING<br>
 <br>
 The belief that there is a connection between satanism and crime is <br>
 certainly not new. As previously stated, one of the oldest theories <br>
 concerning the causes of crime is demonology. Fear of satanic or <br>
 occult activity has peaked from time to time throughout history. <br>
 Concern in the late 1970s focused primarily on "unexplained" deaths <br>
 and mutilations of animals, and in recent years has focused on child <br>
 sexual abuse and the alleged human sacrifice of missing children. In <br>
 1999 it will probably focus on the impending "end of the world".<br>
 <br>
 Today satanism and a wide variety of other terms are used <br>
 interchangeably in reference to certain crimes. This discussion will <br>
 analyze the nature of "satanic, occult, ritualistic" crime primarily <br>
 as it pertains to the abuse of children and focus on appropriate <br>
 *law enforcement* responses to it.<br>
 <br>
 Recently a flood of law enforcement seminars and conferences have <br>
 dealt with satanic and ritualistic crime. These training conferences <br>
 have various titles, such as "Occult in Crime", "Satanic Cults", <br>
 'Ritualistic Crime Seminar", "Satanic Influences in Homicide", <br>
 "Occult Crimes, Satanism and Teen Suicide", and "Ritualistic Abuse <br>
 of Children".<br>
 <br>
 The typical conference runs from one to three days, and many of them <br>
 include the same presenters and instructors. A wide variety of <br>
 topics are usually discussed during this training either as <br>
 individual presentations by different instructors or grouped <br>
 together by one or more instructors. Typical topics covered include <br>
 the following:<br>
 <br>
 -- Historical overview of satanism, witchcraft, and paganism from <br>
 ancient to modern times.<br>
 <br>
 -- Nature and influence of fantasy role-playing games, such as <br>
 "Dungeons and Dragons".<br>
 <br>
 -- Lyrics, symbolism, and influence of rock and roll, Heavy Metal, <br>
 and Black Metal music.<br>
 <br>
 -- Teenage "stoner" gangs, their symbols, and their vandalism.<br>
 <br>
 -- Teenage suicide by adolescents dabbling in the occult.<br>
 <br>
 -- Crimes committed by self-styled satanic practitioners, including <br>
 grave and church desecrations and robberies, animal mutilations, and <br>
 even murders.<br>
 <br>
 -- Ritualistic abuse of children as part of bizarre ceremonies and <br>
 human sacrifices.<br>
 <br>
 -- Organized, Traditional, or Multigenerational satanic groups <br>
 involved in organized conspiracies, such as taking over day care <br>
 centers, infiltrating police departments, and trafficking in human <br>
 sacrifice victims.<br>
 <br>
 -- The "Big Conspiracy" theory, which implies that satanists are <br>
 responsible for such things as Adolph Hitler, World War II, <br>
 abortion, illegal drugs, pornography, Watergate, and Irangate, and <br>
 have infiltrated the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, and the <br>
 White House.<br>
 <br>
 During the conferences, these nine areas are linked together through <br>
 the liberal use of the word "satanism" and some common symbolism <br>
 (pentagrams, 666, demons, etc.). The implication often is that all <br>
 are part of a continuum of behavior, a single problem or some common <br>
 conspiracy. The distinctions among the different areas are blurred <br>
 even if occasionally a presenter tries to make them. The information <br>
 presented is a mixture of fact, theory, opinion, fantasy, and <br>
 paranoia, and because some of it can be proven or corroborated <br>
 (symbols on rock albums, graffiti on walls, desecration of <br>
 cemeteries, vandalism, etc.), the implication is that it is all true <br>
 and documented. Material produced by religious organizations, <br>
 photocopies and slides of newspaper articles, and videotapes of <br>
 tabloid television programs are used to supplement the training and <br>
 are presented as "evidence" of the existence and nature of the <br>
 problem.<br>
 <br>
 All of this is complicated by the fact that almost any discussion of <br>
 satanism and the occult is interpreted in the light of the religious <br>
 beliefs of those in the audience. Faith, not logic and reason, <br>
 governs the religious beliefs of most people. As a result, some <br>
 normally skeptical law enforcement officers accept the information <br>
 disseminated at these conferences without critically evaluating it <br>
 or questioning the sources. Officers who do not normally depend on <br>
 church groups for law enforcement criminal intelligence, who know <br>
 that media accounts of their own cases are notoriously inaccurate, <br>
 and who scoff at and joke about tabloid television accounts of <br>
 bizarre behavior suddenly embrace such material when presented in <br>
 the context of satanic activity. Individuals not in law enforcement <br>
 seem even more likely to do so. Other disciplines, especially <br>
 therapists, have also conducted training conferences on the <br>
 characteristics and identification of "ritual" child abuse. Nothing <br>
 said at such conferences will change the religious beliefs of those <br>
 in attendance. Such conferences illustrate the highly emotional <br>
 nature of and the ambiguity and wide variety of terms involved in <br>
 this issue. <br>
 <br>
 4. DEFINITIONS<br>
 <br>
 The words "satanic", "occult", and "ritual" are often used <br>
 interchangeably. It is difficult to define "satanism" precisely. No <br>
 attempt will be made to do so here However, it is important to <br>
 realize that, for some people, any religious belief system other <br>
 than their own is "satanic". The Ayatollah Khomeini and Saddam <br>
 Hussein referred to the United States as the "Great Satan". In the <br>
 British Parliament a Protestant leader called the Pope the <br>
 Antichrist. In a book titled _Prepare For War_ (1987), Rebecca <br>
 Brown, M.D. has a chapter entitled "Is Roman Catholicism <br>
 Witchcraft?" Dr. Brown also lists among the "doorways" to satanic <br>
 power and/or demon infestation the following: fortune tellers, <br>
 horoscopes, fraternity oaths, vegetarianism, yoga, self-hypnosis, <br>
 relaxation tapes, acupuncture, biofeedback, fantasy role-playing <br>
 games, adultery, homosexuality, pornography, judo, karate, and rock <br>
 music. Dr. Brown states that rock music "was a carefully <br>
 masterminded plan by none other than Satan himself" (p. 84). The <br>
 ideas expressed in this book may seem extreme and even humorous. <br>
 This book, however, has been recommended as a serious reference in <br>
 law enforcement training material on this topic.<br>
 <br>
 In books, lectures, handout material, and conversations, I have <br>
 heard all of the following referred to as satanism: <br>
 	<br>
 -- Church of Satan<br>
 -- Ordo Templi Orientis<br>
 -- Temple of Set<br>
 -- Demonology<br>
 -- Witchcraft<br>
 -- Occult<br>
 -- Paganism<br>
 -- Santeria<br>
 -- Voodoo<br>
 -- Rosicrucians<br>
 -- Freemasonry<br>
 -- Knights Templar<br>
 -- Stoner Gangs<br>
 -- Heavy Metal Music<br>
 -- Rock Music<br>
 -- KKK<br>
 -- Nazis<br>
 -- Skinheads<br>
 -- Scientology<br>
 -- Unification Church<br>
 -- The Way<br>
 -- Hare Krishna<br>
 -- Rajneesh<br>
 -- Religious Cults<br>
 -- New Age<br>
 -- Astrology<br>
 -- Channeling<br>
 -- Transcendental Meditation<br>
 -- Holistic Medicine<br>
 -- Buddhism<br>
 -- Hinduism<br>
 -- Mormonism<br>
 -- Islam<br>
 -- Orthodox Church<br>
 -- Roman Catholicism<br>
 <br>
 At law enforcement training conferences, it is witchcraft, santeria, <br>
 paganism, and the occult that are most often referred to as forms of <br>
 satanism. It may be a matter of definition, but these things are not <br>
 necessarily the same as traditional satanism. The worship of lunar <br>
 goddesses and nature and the practice of fertility rituals are not <br>
 satanism. Santeria is a combination of 17th century Roman<br>
 Catholicism and African paganism.<br>
 <br>
 Occult means simply "hidden". All unreported or unsolved crimes <br>
 might be regarded as occult, but in this context the term refers to <br>
 the action or influence of supernatural powers, some secret <br>
 knowledge of them, or an interest in paranormal phenomena, and does <br>
 not imply satanism, evil, wrongdoing, or crime. Indeed, <br>
 historically, the principal crimes deserving of consideration as <br>
 "occult crimes" are the frauds perpetrated by faith healers, fortune <br>
 tellers and "psychics" who for a fee claim cures, arrange <br>
 visitations with dead loved ones, and commit other financial crimes <br>
 against the gullible.<br>
 <br>
 Many individuals define satanism from a totally Christian <br>
 perspective, using this word to describe the power of evil in the <br>
 world. With this definition, any crimes, especially those which are <br>
 particularly bizarre, repulsive, or cruel, can be viewed as satanic <br>
 in nature. Yet it is just as difficult to precisely define satanism <br>
 as it is to precisely define Christianity or any complex spiritual <br>
 belief system. <br>
 <br>
 -- a. WHAT IS RITUAL?<br>
 <br>
 The biggest confusion is over the word "ritual". During training <br>
 conferences on this topic, ritual almost always comes to mean <br>
 "satanic" or at least "spiritual". "Ritual" can refer to a <br>
 prescribed religious ceremony, but in its broader meaning refers to <br>
 any customarily-repeated act or series of acts. The need to repeat <br>
 these acts can be cultural, sexual, or psychological as well as <br>
 spiritual.<br>
 <br>
 Cultural rituals could include such things as what a family eats on <br>
 Thanksgiving Day, or when and how presents are opened at Christmas. <br>
 The initiation ceremonies of fraternities, sororities, gangs, and <br>
 other social clubs are other examples of cultural rituals.<br>
 <br>
 Since 1972 I have lectured about sexual ritual, which is nothing <br>
 more than repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a <br>
 certain manner because of a *sexual* need. In order to become <br>
 aroused and/or gratified, a person must engage in the act in a <br>
 certain way. This sexual ritual can include such things as the <br>
 physical characteristics, age, or gender of the victim, the <br>
 particular sequence of acts, the bringing or taking of specific <br>
 objects, and the use of certain words or phrases. This is more than <br>
 the concept of M.O. (Method of Operation) known to most police <br>
 officers. M.O. is something done by an offender because it works. <br>
 Sexual ritual is something done by an offender because of a need. <br>
 Deviant acts, such as urinating on, defecating on, or even <br>
 eviscerating a victim, are far more likely to be the result of <br>
 sexual ritual than religious or "satanic" ritual.<br>
 <br>
 From a criminal investigative perspective, two other forms of <br>
 ritualism must be recognized. The _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual <br>
 of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-III-R) (APA, 1987) defines "Obsessive- <br>
 Compulsive Disorder" as "repetitive, purposeful, and intentional <br>
 behaviors that are performed in response to an obsession, or <br>
 according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion" (p. 247). <br>
 Such compulsive behavior frequently involves rituals. Although such <br>
 behavior usually involves noncriminal activity such as excessive <br>
 hand washing or checking that doors are locked, occasionally <br>
 compulsive ritualism can be part of criminal activity. Certain <br>
 gamblers or firesetters, for example, are thought by some <br>
 authorities to be motivated in part through such compulsions. Ritual <br>
 can also stem from psychotic hallucinations and delusions. A crime <br>
 can be committed in a precise manner because a voice told the <br>
 offender to do it that way or because a divine mission required it.<br>
 <br>
 To make this more confusing, cultural, religious, sexual, and <br>
 psychological ritual can overlap. Some psychotic people are <br>
 preoccupied with religious delusions and hear the voice of God or <br>
 Satan telling them to do things of a religious nature. Offenders who <br>
 feel little, if any, guilt over their crimes may need little <br>
 justification for their antisocial behavior. As human beings, <br>
 however, they may have fears, concerns, and anxiety over getting <br>
 away with their criminal acts. It is difficult to pray to God for <br>
 success in doing things that are against His Commandments. A <br>
 negative spiritual belief system may fulfill their human need for <br>
 assistance from and belief in a greater power or to deal with their <br>
 superstitions. Compulsive ritualism (e.g., excessive cleanliness or <br>
 fear of disease) can be introduced into sexual behavior. Even many <br>
 "normal" people have a need for order and predictability and <br>
 therefore may engage in family or work rituals. Under stress or in <br>
 times of change, this need for order and ritual may increase.<br>
 <br>
 Ritual crime may fulfill the cultural, spiritual, sexual, and <br>
 psychological needs of an offender. Crimes may be ritualistically <br>
 motivated or may have ritualistic elements. The ritual behavior may <br>
 also fulfill basic criminal needs to manipulate victims, get rid of <br>
 rivals, send a message to enemies, and intimidate co-conspirators. <br>
 The leaders of a group may want to play upon the beliefs and <br>
 superstitions of those around them and try to convince accomplices <br>
 and enemies that they, the leaders, have special or "supernatural" <br>
 powers. <br>
 <br>
 The important point for the criminal investigator is to realize that <br>
 most ritualistic criminal behavior is not motivated simply by <br>
 satanic or any religious ceremonies. At some conferences, presenters <br>
 have attempted to make an issue of distinguishing between "ritual", <br>
 "ritualized", and "ritualistic" abuse of children. These subtle <br>
 distinctions, however, seem to be of no significant value to the <br>
 criminal investigator.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. WHAT IS "RITUAL" CHILD ABUSE?<br>
 <br>
 I cannot define "ritual child abuse" precisely and prefer not to use <br>
 the term. I am frequently forced to use it (as throughout this <br>
 discussion) so that people will have some idea what I am discussing. <br>
 Use of the term, however, is confusing, misleading, and <br>
 counterproductive. The newer term "satanic ritual abuse" <br>
 (abbreviated "SRA") is even worse. Certain observations, however, <br>
 are important for investigative understanding.<br>
 <br>
 Most people today use the term to refer to abuse of children that is <br>
 part of some evil spiritual belief system, which almost by <br>
 definition must be satanic.<br>
 <br>
 Dr. Lawrence Pazder, coauthor of _Michelle Remembers_, defines <br>
 "ritualized abuse of children" as "repeated physical, emotional, <br>
 mental, and spiritual assaults combined with a systematic use of <br>
 symbols and secret ceremonies designed to turn a child against <br>
 itself, family, society, and God" (presentation, Richmond, Va., May <br>
 7,1987). He also states that "the sexual assault has ritualistic <br>
 meaning and is not for sexual gratification".<br>
 <br>
 This definition may have value for academics, sociologists, and <br>
 therapists, but it creates potential problems for law enforcement. <br>
 Certain acts engaged in with children (i.e. kissing, touching, <br>
 appearing naked, etc.) may be criminal if performed for sexual <br>
 gratification. If the ritualistic acts were in fact performed for <br>
 spiritual indoctrination, potential prosecution can be jeopardized, <br>
 particularly if the acts can be defended as constitutionally <br>
 protected religious expression. The mutilation of a baby's genitals<br>
 for sadistic sexual pleasure is a crime. The circumcision of a <br>
 baby's genitals for religious reasons is most likely *not* a crime. <br>
 The intent of the acts is important for criminal prosecution.<br>
 <br>
 Not all spiritually motivated ritualistic activity is satanic. <br>
 Santeria, witchcraft, voodoo, and most religious cults are not <br>
 satanism. In fact, most spiritually- or religiously-based abuse of <br>
 children has nothing to do with satanism. Most child abuse that <br>
 could be termed "ritualistic" by various definitions is more likely <br>
 to be physical and psychological rather than sexual in nature. If a <br>
 distinction needs to be made between satanic and nonsatanic child <br>
 abuse, the indicators for that distinction must be related to <br>
 specific satanic symbols, artifacts, or doctrine rather than the <br>
 mere presence of any ritualistic element.<br>
 <br>
 Not all such ritualistic activity with a child is a crime. Almost <br>
 all parents with religious beliefs indoctrinate their children into <br>
 that belief system. Is male circumcision for religious reasons child <br>
 abuse? Is the religious circumcision of females child abuse? Does <br>
 having a child kneel on a hard floor reciting the rosary constitute <br>
 child abuse? Does having a child chant a satanic prayer or attend a <br>
 black mass constitute child abuse? Does a religious belief in <br>
 corporal punishment constitute child abuse? Does group care of <br>
 children in a commune or cult constitute child abuse? Does the fact <br>
 that any acts in question were performed with parental permission <br>
 affect the nature of the crime? Many ritualistic acts, whether <br>
 satanic or not, are simply not crimes. To open the Pandora's box of <br>
 labeling child abuse as "ritualistic" simply because it involves a <br>
 spiritual belief system means to apply the definition to all acts by <br>
 all spiritual belief systems. The day may come when many in the <br>
 forefront of concern about ritual abuse will regret they opened the <br>
 box. <br>
 <br>
 When a victim describes and investigation corroborates what sounds <br>
 like ritualistic activity. several possibilities must be considered. <br>
 The ritualistic activity may be part of the excessive religiosity of <br>
 mentally disturbed, even psychotic offenders. It may be a <br>
 misunderstood part of sexual ritual. The ritualistic activity may be <br>
 incidental to any real abuse. The offender may be involved in <br>
 ritualistic activity with a child and also may be abusing a child, <br>
 but one may have little or nothing to do with the other.<br>
 <br>
 The offender may be deliberately engaging in ritualistic activity <br>
 with a child as part of child abuse and exploitation. The <br>
 motivation, however, may be not to indoctrinate the child into a <br>
 belief system, but to lower the inhibitions of, control, manipulate, <br>
 and/or confuse the child. In all the turmoil over this issue, it <br>
 would be very effective strategy for any child molester deliberately <br>
 to introduce ritualistic elements into his crime in order to confuse <br>
 the child and therefore the criminal justice system. This would, <br>
 however, make the activity M.O. and not ritual.<br>
 <br>
 The ritualistic activity and the child abuse may be integral parts <br>
 of some spiritual belief system. In that case the greatest risk is <br>
 to the children of the practitioners. But this is true of all cults <br>
 and religions, not just satanic cults. A high potential of abuse <br>
 exists for any children raised in a group isolated from the <br>
 mainstream of society, especially if the group has a charismatic <br>
 leader whose orders are unquestioned and blindly obeyed by the <br>
 members. Sex, money, and power are often the main motivations of the <br>
 leaders of such cults.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. WHAT MAKES A CRIME SATANIC, OCCULT, OR RITUALISTIC?<br>
 <br>
 Some would answer that it is the offender's spiritual beliefs or <br>
 membership in a cult or church. If that is the criterion, why not<br>
 label the crimes committed by Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in <br>
 the same way? Are the atrocities of Jim Jones in Guyana Christian <br>
 crimes?<br>
 <br>
 Some would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols in the <br>
 possession or home of the perpetrator. What does it mean then to <br>
 find a crucifix, Bible, or rosary in the possession or home of a <br>
 bank robber, embezzler, child molester, or murderer? If different <br>
 criminals possess the same symbols, are they necessarily part of one <br>
 big conspiracy?<br>
 <br>
 Others would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols such <br>
 as pentagrams, inverted crosses, and 666 at the crime scene. What <br>
 does it mean then to find a cross spray painted on a wall or carved <br>
 into the body of a victim? What does it mean for a perpetrator, as <br>
 in one recent case profiled by my Unit, to leave a Bible tied to his <br>
 murder victim? What about the possibility that an offender <br>
 deliberately left such symbols to make it look like a "satanic" <br>
 crime?<br>
 <br>
 Some would argue that it is the bizarreness or cruelness of the <br>
 crime: body mutilation, amputation, drinking of blood, eating of <br>
 flesh, use of urine or feces. Does this mean that all individuals <br>
 involved in lust murder, sadism, vampirism, cannibalism, urophilia, <br>
 and coprophilia are satanists or occult practitioners? What does <br>
 this say about the bizarre crimes of psychotic killers such as Ed <br>
 Gein or Richard Trenton Chase, both of whom mutilated their victims <br>
 as part of their psychotic delusions? Can a crime that is not <br>
 sexually deviant, bizarre, or exceptionally violent be satanic? Can <br>
 white collar crime be satanic?<br>
 <br>
 A few might even answer that it is the fact that the crime was <br>
 committed on a date with satanic or occult significance (Halloween, <br>
 May Eve, etc.) or the fact that the perpetrator claims that Satan <br>
 told him to commit the crime. What does this mean for crimes <br>
 committed on Thanksgiving or Christmas? What does this say about <br>
 crimes committed by perpetrators who claim that God or Jesus told <br>
 them to do it? One note of interest is the fact that in handout and <br>
 reference material I have collected, the number of dates with <br>
 satanic or occult significance ranges from 8 to 110. This is <br>
 compounded by the fact that it is sometimes stated that satanists <br>
 can celebrate these holidays on several days on either side of the <br>
 official date or that the birthdays of practitioners can also be <br>
 holidays. The exact names and exact dates of the holidays and the <br>
 meaning of symbols listed may also vary depending on who prepared <br>
 the material The handout material is often distributed without <br>
 identifying the author or documenting the original source of the <br>
 information. It is then frequently photocopied by attendees and <br>
 passed on to other police officers with no one really knowing its <br>
 validity or origin.<br>
 <br>
 Most, however, would probably answer that what makes a crime <br>
 satanic, occult, or ritualistic is the motivation for the crime. It <br>
 is a crime that is spiritually motivated by a religious belief <br>
 system. How then do we label the following true crimes?<br>
 <br>
 -- Parents defy a court order and send their children to an <br>
 unlicensed Christian school.<br>
 <br>
 -- Parents refuse to send their children to any school because they <br>
 are waiting for the second coming of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 -- Parents beat their child to death because he or she will not <br>
 follow their Christian belief.<br>
 <br>
 -- Parents violate child labor laws because they believe the Bible<br>
 requires such work.<br>
 <br>
 -- Individuals bomb an abortion clinic or kidnap the doctor because <br>
 their religious belief system says abortion is murder.<br>
 <br>
 -- A child molester reads the Bible to his victims in order to <br>
 justify his sex acts with them.<br>
 <br>
 -- Parents refuse life-saving medical treatment for a child because <br>
 of their religious beliefs.<br>
 <br>
 -- Parents starve and beat their child to death because their <br>
 minister said the child was possessed by demonic spirits.<br>
 <br>
 Some people would argue that the Christians who committed the above <br>
 crimes misunderstood and distorted their religion while satanists <br>
 who commit crimes are following theirs. But who decides what <br>
 constitutes a misinterpretation of a religious belief system? The <br>
 individuals who committed the above-described crimes, however <br>
 misguided, believed that they were following their religion as they <br>
 understood it. Religion was and is used to justify such social <br>
 behavior as the Crusades, the Inquisition, Apartheid, segregation, <br>
 and recent violence in Northern Ireland, India, Lebanon and Nigeria.<br>
 <br>
 Who decides exactly what "satanists" believe? In this country, we <br>
 cannot even agree on what Christians believe. At many law <br>
 enforcement conferences The _Satanic Bible_ is used for this, and it <br>
 is often contrasted or compared with the Judeo-Christian Bible. The <br>
 _Satanic Bible_ is, in essence, a short paperback book written by <br>
 one man, Anton LaVey, in 1969. To compare it to a book written by <br>
 multiple authors over a period of thousands of years is ridiculous, <br>
 even ignoring the possibility of Divine revelation in the Bible. <br>
 What satanists believe certainly isn't limited to other people's <br>
 interpretation of a few books. More importantly it is subject to <br>
 some degree of interpretation by individual believers just as <br>
 Christianity is. Many admitted "satanists" claim they do not even <br>
 believe in God, the devil, or any supreme deity. The criminal <br>
 behavior of one person claiming belief in a religion does not <br>
 necessarily imply guilt or blame to others sharing that belief. In <br>
 addition, simply claiming membership in a religion does not <br>
 necessarily make you a member.<br>
 <br>
 The fact is that far more crime and child abuse has been committed <br>
 by zealots in the name of God, Jesus, Mohammed, and other mainstream <br>
 religion than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. Many <br>
 people, including myself, don't like that statement, but the truth <br>
 of it is undeniable. <br>
 <br>
 Although defining a crime as satanic, occult, or ritualistic would <br>
 probably involve a combination of the criteria set forth above, I <br>
 have been unable to clearly define such a crime. Each potential <br>
 definition presents a different set of problems when measured <br>
 against an objective, rational, and constitutional perspective. In a <br>
 crime with multiple subjects, each offender may have a different <br>
 motivation for the same crime. Whose motivation determines the label <br>
 for the crime? It is difficult to count or track something you <br>
 cannot even define.<br>
 <br>
 I have discovered, however, that the facts of so-called "satanic <br>
 crimes" are often significantly different from what is described st <br>
 training conferences or in the media. The actual involvement of <br>
 satanism or the occult in these cases usually turns out to be <br>
 secondary, insignificant, or nonexistent. Occult or ritual crime <br>
 surveys done by the states of Michigan (1990) and Virginia (1991) <br>
 have only confirmed this "discovery". Some law enforcement officers, <br>
 unable to find serious "satanic" crime in their communities, assume<br>
 they are just lucky or vigilant and the serious problems must be in <br>
 other jurisdictions. The officers in the other jurisdictions, also <br>
 unable find it, assume the same. <br>
 <br>
 5. MULTlDlMENSlONAL CHILD SEX RINGS<br>
 <br>
 Sometime in early 1983 I was first contacted by a law enforcement <br>
 agency for guidance in what was then thought to be an unusual case. <br>
 The exact date of the contact is unknown because its significance <br>
 was not recognized at the time. In the months and years that <br>
 followed, I received more and more inquiries about "these kinds of <br>
 cases". The requests for assistance came (and continue to come) from <br>
 all over the United States. Many of the aspects of these cases <br>
 varied, but there were also some commonalties. Early on, however, <br>
 one particularly difficult and potentially significant issue began <br>
 to emerge.<br>
 <br>
 These cases involved and continue to involve unsubstantiated <br>
 allegations of bizarre activity that are difficult either to prove <br>
 or disprove. Many of the unsubstantiated allegations, however, do <br>
 not seem to have occurred or even be possible. These cases seem to <br>
 call into question the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse <br>
 and exploitation. These are the most polarizing, frustrating, and <br>
 baffling cases I have encountered in more than 18 years of studying <br>
 the criminal aspects of deviant sexual behavior. I privately sought <br>
 answers, but said nothing publicly about those cases until 1985.<br>
 <br>
 In October 1984 the problems in investigating and prosecuting one of <br>
 these cases in Jordan, Minnesota became publicly known. In February <br>
 1985, at the FBI Academy, the FBI sponsored and I coordinated the <br>
 first national seminar held to study "these kinds of cases". Later <br>
 in 1985, similar conferences sponsored by other organizations were <br>
 held in Washington, D.C.; Sacramento, California; and Chicago, <br>
 Illinois. These cases have also been discussed at many recent <br>
 regional and national conferences dealing with the sexual <br>
 victimization of children and Multiple Personality Disorder. Few <br>
 answers have come from these conferences. I continue to be contacted <br>
 on these cases on a regular basis. Inquiries have been received from <br>
 law enforcement officers, prosecutors, therapists, victims, families <br>
 of victims, and the media from all over the United States and now <br>
 foreign countries. I do not claim to understand completely all the <br>
 dynamics of these cases. I continue to keep an open mind and to <br>
 search for answers to the questions and solutions to the problems <br>
 they pose. This discussion is based on my analysis of the several <br>
 hundred of "these kinds of cases" on which I have consulted since <br>
 1983.<br>
 <br>
 -- a. DYNAMICS OF CASES.<br>
 <br>
 What are "these kinds of cases"? They were and continue to be <br>
 difficult to define. They all involve allegations of what sounds <br>
 like child sexual abuse, but with a combination of some atypical <br>
 dynamics. These cases seem to have the following four dynamics in <br>
 common: (1) multiple young victims, (2) multiple offenders, (3) fear <br>
 as the controlling tactic, and (4) bizarre or ritualistic activity.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) MULTIPLE YOUNG VICTIMS.<br>
 <br>
 In almost all the cases the sexual abuse was alleged to have taken <br>
 place or at least begun when the victims were between the ages of <br>
 birth and six. This very young age may be an important key to <br>
 understanding these cases. In addition the victims all described <br>
 multiple children being abused. The numbers ranged from three or <br>
 four to as many as several hundred victims.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (2) MULTIPLE OFFENDERS.<br>
 <br>
 In almost all the cases the victims reported numerous offenders. The <br>
 numbers ranged from two or three all the way up to dozens of <br>
 offenders. In one recent case the victims alleged 400-500 offenders <br>
 were involved. Interestingly many of the offenders (perhaps as many <br>
 as 40-50 percent) were reported to be females. The multiple <br>
 offenders were often family members and were described as being part <br>
 of a cult, occult, or satanic group.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (3) FEAR AS CONTROLLING TACTIC.<br>
 <br>
 Child molesters in general are able to maintain control and ensure <br>
 the secrecy of their victims in a variety of ways. These include <br>
 attention and affection, coercion, blackmail, embarrassment, <br>
 threats, and violence. In almost all of these cases I have studied, <br>
 the victims described being frightened and reported threats against <br>
 themselves, their families, their friends, and even their pets. They <br>
 reported witnessing acts of violence perpetrated to reinforce this <br>
 fear. It is my belief that this fear and the traumatic memory of the <br>
 events may be another key to understanding many of these cases.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (4) BIZARRE OR RITUALISTIC ACTIVITY.<br>
 <br>
 This is the most difficult dynamic of these cases to describe. <br>
 "Bizarre" is a relative term. Is the use of urine or feces in sexual <br>
 activity bizarre, or is it a well-documented aspect of sexual <br>
 deviancy, or is it part of established satanic rituals? As <br>
 previously discussed, the ritualistic aspect is even more difficult <br>
 to define. How do you distinguish acts performed in a precise manner <br>
 to enhance or allow sexual arousal from those acts that fulfill <br>
 spiritual needs or comply with "religious" ceremonies? Victims in <br>
 these cases report ceremonies, chanting, robes and costumes, drugs, <br>
 use of urine and feces, animal sacrifice, torture, abduction, <br>
 mutilation, murder, and even cannibalism and vampirism. All things <br>
 considered, the word "bizarre" is probably preferable to the word <br>
 "ritual" to describe this activity.<br>
 <br>
 When I was contacted on these cases, it was very common for a <br>
 prosecutor or investigator to say that the alleged victims have been <br>
 evaluated by an "expert" who will stake his or her professional <br>
 reputation on the fact that the victims are telling the "truth". <br>
 When asked how many cases this expert had previously evaluated <br>
 involving these four dynamics, the answer was always the same: none! <br>
 The experts usually had only dealt with one-on-one intrafamilial <br>
 sexual abuse cases. Recently an even more disturbing trend has <br>
 developed. More and more of the victims have been identified or <br>
 evaluated by experts who have been trained to identify and <br>
 specialize in satanic ritual abuse.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. CHARACTERISTICS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHILD SEX RINGS.<br>
 <br>
 As previously stated, a major problem in communicating, training, <br>
 and researching in this area is the term used to define "these kinds <br>
 of cases". Many refer to them as "ritual, ritualistic, or ritualized <br>
 abuse of children cases" or "satanic ritual abuse (SRA) cases". Such <br>
 words carry specialized meanings for many people and might imply <br>
 that all these cases are connected to occult or satanic activity. If <br>
 ritual abuse is not necessarily occult or satanic, but is "merely" <br>
 severe, repeated, prolonged abuse, why use a term that, in the minds <br>
 of so many, implies such specific motivation?<br>
 <br>
 Others refer to these cases as "multioffender/multivictim cases". <br>
 The problem with this term is that most multiple offender and victim <br>
 cases do not involve the four dynamics discussed above.<br>
 <br>
 For want of a better term, I have decided to refer to "these kinds<br>
 of cases" as "multidimensional child sex rings". Right now I seem to <br>
 be the only one using this term. I am, however, not sure if this is <br>
 truly a distinct kind of child sex ring case or just a case not <br>
 properly handled. Following are the general characteristics of these <br>
 multidimensional child sex ring cases as contrasted with more common <br>
 historical child sex ring cases [see my monograph _Child Sex Rings: <br>
 A Behavioral Analysis] (1989) for a discussion of the <br>
 characteristics of historical child sex ring cases].<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) FEMALE OFFENDERS.<br>
 <br>
 As many as 40-50 percent of the offenders in these cases are <br>
 reported to be women. This is in marked contrast to historical child <br>
 sex rings in which almost all the offenders are men.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (2) SITUATIONAL MOLESTERS.<br>
 <br>
 The offenders appear to be sexually interacting with the child <br>
 victims for reasons other than a true sexual preference for <br>
 children. The children are substitute victims, and the abusive <br>
 activity may have little to do with pedophilia [see my monograph <br>
 _Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis_ (1987) for a further <br>
 explanation about types of molesters].<br>
 <br>
 ---- (3) MALE AND FEMALE VICTIMS.<br>
 <br>
 Both boys and girls appear to be targeted, but with an apparent <br>
 preference for girls. Almost all the adult survivors are female, but <br>
 day care cases frequently involve male as well as female victims. <br>
 The most striking characteristic of the victims, however, is their <br>
 young age (generally birth to six years old when the abuse began).<br>
 <br>
 ---- (4) MULTIDIMENSIONAL MOTIVATION.<br>
 <br>
 Sexual gratification appears to be only part of the motivation for <br>
 the "sexual" activity. Many people today argue that the motivation <br>
 is "spiritual" - possibly part of an occult ceremony. It is my <br>
 opinion that the motivation may have more to do with anger, <br>
 hostility, rage and resentment carried out against weak and <br>
 vulnerable victims. Much of the ritualistic abuse of children may <br>
 not be sexual in nature. Some of the activity may, in fact, be <br>
 physical abuse directed at sexually-significant body parts (penis, <br>
 anus, nipples). This may also partially explain the large percentage <br>
 of female offenders. Physical abuse of children by females is well-<br>
 documented.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (5) PORNOGRAPHY AND PARAPHERNALIA.<br>
 <br>
 Although many of the victims of multidimensional child sex rings <br>
 claim that pictures and videotapes of the activity were made, no <br>
 such visual record has been found by law enforcement. In recent <br>
 years, American law enforcement has seized large amounts of child <br>
 pornography portraying children in a wide variety of sexual activity <br>
 and perversions. None of it, however, portrays the kind of bizarre <br>
 and/or ritualistic activity described by these victims. Perhaps <br>
 these offenders use and store their pornography and paraphernalia in <br>
 ways different from preferential child molesters (pedophiles). This <br>
 is an area needing additional research and investigation.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (6) CONTROL THROUGH FEAR.<br>
 <br>
 Control through fear may be the overriding characteristic of these <br>
 cases. Control is maintained by frightening the children. A very <br>
 young child might not be able to understand the significance of much <br>
 of the sexual activity but certainly understands fear. The stories <br>
 that the victims tell may be their perceived versions of severe<br>
 traumatic memories. They may be the victims of a severely <br>
 traumatized childhood in which being sexually abused was just one of <br>
 the many negative events affecting their lives.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. SCENARIOS.<br>
 <br>
 Multidimensional child sex rings typically emerge from one of four <br>
 scenarios: (1) adult survivors, (2) day care cases, (3) <br>
 family/isolated neighborhood cases, and (4) custody/visitation <br>
 disputes.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) ADULT SURVIVORS.<br>
 <br>
 In adult survivor cases, adults of almost any age - nearly always <br>
 women - are suffering the consequences of a variety of personal <br>
 problems and failures in their lives (e.g., promiscuity, eating <br>
 disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, failed relationships, self-<br>
 mutilation, unemployment). As a result of some precipitating stress <br>
 or crisis, they often seek therapy. They are frequently hypnotized, <br>
 intentionally or unintentionally, as part of the therapy and are <br>
 often diagnosed as suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. <br>
 Gradually, during the therapy, the adults reveal previously <br>
 unrecalled memories of early childhood victimization that includes <br>
 multiple victims and offenders, fear as the controlling tactic, and <br>
 bizarre or ritualistic activity. Adult survivors may also claim that <br>
 "cues" from certain events in their recent life "triggered" the <br>
 previously repressed memories.<br>
 <br>
 The multiple offenders are often described as members of a cult or <br>
 satanic group. Parents, family members, clergy, civic leaders, <br>
 police officers (or individuals wearing police uniforms), and other <br>
 prominent members of society are frequently described as present at <br>
 and participating in the exploitation. The alleged bizarre activity <br>
 often includes insertion of foreign objects, witnessing mutilations, <br>
 and sexual acts and murders being filmed or photographed. The <br>
 offenders may allegedly still be harassing or threatening the <br>
 victims. They report being particularly frightened on certain dates <br>
 and by certain situations. In several of these cases, women (called <br>
 "breeders") claim to have had babies that were turned over for human <br>
 sacrifice. This type of case is probably best typified by books like <br>
 _Michelle Remembers_ (Smith &amp; Pazder, 1980), _Satan's Underground_ <br>
 (Stratford, 1988), and _Satan's Children_ (Mayer, 1991).<br>
 <br>
 If and when therapists come to believe the patient or decide the law <br>
 requires it, the police or FBI are sometimes contacted to conduct an <br>
 investigation. The therapists may also fear for their safety because <br>
 they now know the "secret". The therapists will frequently tell law <br>
 enforcement that they will stake their professional reputation on <br>
 the fact that their patient is telling the truth. Some adult <br>
 survivors go directly to law enforcement. They may also go from <br>
 place to place in an effort to find therapists or investigators who <br>
 will listen to and believe them. Their ability to provide verifiable <br>
 details varies and many were raised in apparently religious homes. A <br>
 few adult survivors are now reporting participation in specific <br>
 murders or child abductions that are known to have taken place.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (2) DAY CARE CASES.<br>
 <br>
 In day care cases children currently or formerly attending a day <br>
 care center gradually describe their victimization at the center and <br>
 at other locations to which they were taken by the day care staff. <br>
 The cases include multiple victims and offenders, fear, and bizarre <br>
 or ritualistic activity, with a particularly high number of female <br>
 offenders. Descriptions of strange games, insertion of foreign <br>
 objects, killing of animals, photographing of activities, and <br>
 wearing of costumes are common. The accounts of the young children,<br>
 however, do not seem to be quite as "bizarre" as those of the adult <br>
 survivors, with fewer accounts of human sacrifice.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (3) FAMILY/ISOLATED NEIGHBORHOOD CASES.<br>
 <br>
 In family/isolated neighborhood cases, children describe their <br>
 victimization within their family or extended family. The group is <br>
 often defined by geographic boundary, such as a cul-de-sac, <br>
 apartment building, or isolated rural setting. Such accounts are <br>
 most common in rural or suburban communities with high <br>
 concentrations of religiously conservative people. The stories are <br>
 similar to those told of the day care setting, but with more male <br>
 offenders. The basic dynamics remain the same, but victims tend to <br>
 be more than six years of age, and the scenario may also involve a <br>
 custody or visitation dispute.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (4) CUSTODY/VISITATION DISPUTE.<br>
 <br>
 In custody/visitation dispute cases, the allegations emanate from a <br>
 custody or visitation dispute over at least one child under the age <br>
 of seven. The four dynamics described above make these cases <br>
 extremely difficult to handle. When complicated by the strong <br>
 emotions of this scenario, the cases can be overwhelming. This is <br>
 especially true if the disclosing child victims have been taken into <br>
 the "underground" by a parent during the custody or visitation <br>
 dispute. Some of these parents or relatives may even provide <br>
 authorities with diaries or tapes of their interviews with the <br>
 children. An accurate evaluation and assessment of a young child <br>
 held in isolation in this underground while being "debriefed" by a <br>
 parent or someone else is almost impossible. However well-<br>
 intentioned, these self-appointed investigators severely damage any <br>
 chance to validate these cases objectively.<br>
 <br>
 -- d. WHY ARE VICTIMS ALLEGING THINGS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE TRUE?<br>
 <br>
 Some of what the victims in these cases allege is physically <br>
 impossible (victim cut up and put back together, offender took the <br>
 building apart and then rebuilt it); some is possible but improbable <br>
 (human sacrifice, cannibalism, vampirism ); some is possible and <br>
 probable (child pornography, clever manipulation of victims); and <br>
 some is corroborated (medical evidence of vaginal or anal trauma, <br>
 offender confessions).<br>
 <br>
 The most significant crimes being alleged that do not *seem* to be <br>
 true are the human sacrifice and cannibalism by organized satanic <br>
 cults. In none of the multidimensional child sex ring cases of which <br>
 I am aware have bodies of the murder victims been found - in spite <br>
 of major excavations where the abuse victims claim the bodies were <br>
 located. The alleged explanations for this include: the offenders <br>
 moved the bodies after the children left, the bodies were burned in <br>
 portable high-temperature ovens, the bodies were put in double-<br>
 decker graves under legitimately buried bodies, a mortician member <br>
 of the cult disposed of the bodies in a crematorium, the offenders <br>
 ate the bodies, the offenders used corpses and aborted fetuses, or <br>
 the power of Satan caused the bodies to disappear. <br>
 <br>
 Not only are no bodies found, but also, more importantly, there is <br>
 no physical evidence that a murder took place. Many of those not in <br>
 law enforcement do not understand that, while it is possible to get <br>
 rid of a body, it is even more difficult to get rid of the physical <br>
 evidence that a murder took place, especially a human sacrifice <br>
 involving sex, blood, and mutilation. Such activity would leave <br>
 behind trace evidence that could be found using modern crime scene <br>
 processing techniques in spite of extraordinary efforts to clean it <br>
 up.<br>
 <br>
 The victims of these human sacrifices and murders are alleged to be <br>
 abducted missing children, runaway and throwaway children, <br>
 derelicts, and the babies of breeder women. It is interesting to <br>
 note that many of those espousing these theories are using the long-<br>
 since-discredited numbers and rhetoric of the missing children <br>
 hysteria in the early 1980s. Yet "Stranger-Abduction Homicides of <br>
 Children", a January 1989 _Juvenile Justice Bulletin_, published by <br>
 the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the <br>
 U.S. Department of Justice, reports that researchers now estimate <br>
 that the number of children kidnapped and murdered by nonfamily <br>
 members is between 52 and 158 a year and that adolescents 14 to 17 <br>
 years old account for nearly two-thirds of these victims. These <br>
 figures are also consistent with the 1990 National Incident Studies <br>
 previously mentioned.<br>
 <br>
 We live in a very violent society, and yet we have "only" about <br>
 23,000 murders a year. Those who accept these stories of mass human <br>
 sacrifice would have us believe that the satanists and other occult <br>
 practitioners are murdering more than twice as many people every <br>
 year in this country as all the other murderers combined.<br>
 <br>
 In addition, in none of the cases of which I am aware has any <br>
 evidence of a well-organized satanic cult been found. Many of those <br>
 who accept the stories of organized ritual abuse of children and <br>
 human sacrifice will tell you that the best evidence they now have <br>
 is the consistency of stories from all over America. It sounds like <br>
 a powerful argument. It is interesting to note that, without having <br>
 met each other, the hundreds of people who claim to have been <br>
 abducted by aliens from outer space also tell stories and give <br>
 descriptions of the aliens that are similar to each other. This is <br>
 not to imply that allegations of child abuse are in the same <br>
 category as allegations of abduction by aliens from outer space. It <br>
 is intended only to illustrate that individuals who never met each <br>
 other can sometimes describe similar events without necessarily <br>
 having experienced them.<br>
 <br>
 The large number of people telling the same story is, in fact, the <br>
 biggest reason to doubt these stories. It is simply too difficult <br>
 for that many people to commit so many horrendous crimes as part of <br>
 an organized conspiracy. Two or three people murder a couple of <br>
 children in a few communities as part of a ritual, and nobody finds <br>
 out? Possible. Thousands of people do the same thing to tens of <br>
 thousands of victims over many years? Not likely. Hundreds of <br>
 communities all over America are run by mayors, police departments, <br>
 and community leaders who are practicing satanists and who regularly <br>
 murder and eat people? Not likely. In addition, these community <br>
 leaders and high-ranking officials also supposedly commit these <br>
 complex crimes leaving no evidence, and at the same time function as <br>
 leaders and managers while heavily involved in using illegal drugs. <br>
 Probably the closest documented example of this type of alleged <br>
 activity in American history is the Ku Klux Klan, which ironically <br>
 used Christianity, not satanism, to rationalize its activity but <br>
 which, as might be expected, was eventually infiltrated by <br>
 informants and betrayed by its members.<br>
 <br>
 As stated, initially I was inclined to believe the allegations of <br>
 the victims. But as the cases poured in and the months and years <br>
 went by, I became more concerned about the lack of physical evidence <br>
 and corroboration for many of the more serious allegations. With <br>
 increasing frequency I began to ask the question: "Why are victims <br>
 alleging things that do not *seem* to be true?" Many possible <br>
 answers were considered. <br>
 <br>
 The first possible answer is obvious: clever offenders. The <br>
 allegations may not seem to be true but they are true. The criminal <br>
 justice system lacks the knowledge, skill, and motivation to get to<br>
 the bottom of this crime conspiracy. The perpetrators of this crime <br>
 conspiracy are clever, cunning individuals using sophisticated mind <br>
 control and brainwashing techniques to control their victims. Law <br>
 enforcement does not know how to investigate these cases.<br>
 <br>
 It is technically possible that these allegations of an organized <br>
 conspiracy involving taking over day care centers, abduction, <br>
 cannibalism, murder, and human sacrifice might be true. But if they <br>
 are true, they constitute one of the greatest crime conspiracies in <br>
 history.<br>
 <br>
 Many people do not understand how difficult it is to commit a <br>
 conspiracy crime involving numerous co-conspirators. One clever and <br>
 cunning individual has a good chance of getting away with a well- <br>
 planned interpersonal crime. Bring one partner into the crime and <br>
 the odds of getting away with it drop considerably. The more people <br>
 involved in the crime, the harder it is to get away with it. Why? <br>
 Human nature is the answer. People get angry and jealous. They come <br>
 to resent the fact that another conspirator is getting "more" than <br>
 they. They get in trouble and want to make a deal for themselves by <br>
 informing on others.<br>
 <br>
 If a group of individuals degenerate to the point of engaging in <br>
 human sacrifice, murder, and cannibalism, that would most likely be <br>
 the beginning of the end for such a group. The odds are that someone <br>
 in the group would have a problem with such acts and be unable to <br>
 maintain the secret.<br>
 <br>
 The appeal of the satanic conspiracy theory is twofold:<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) First, it is a simple explanation for a complex problem. <br>
 Nothing is more simple than "the devil made them do it". If we do <br>
 not understand something, we make it the work of some supernatural <br>
 force. During the Middle Ages, serial killers were thought to be <br>
 vampires and werewolves, and child sexual abuse was the work of <br>
 demons taking the form of parents and clergy. Even today, especially <br>
 for those raised to religiously believe so, satanism offers an <br>
 explanation as to why "good" people do bad things. It may also help <br>
 to "explain" unusual, bizarre, and compulsive sexual urges and <br>
 behavior.<br>
 <br>
 ---- (2) Second, the conspiracy theory is a popular one. We find it <br>
 difficult to believe that one bizarre individual could commit a <br>
 crime we find so offensive. Conspiracy theories about soldiers <br>
 missing in action (MlAs), abductions by UFOs, Elvis Presley <br>
 sightings, and the assassination of prominent public figures are the <br>
 focus of much attention in this country. These conspiracy theories <br>
 and allegations of ritual abuse have the following in common: (1) <br>
 self-proclaimed experts, (2) tabloid media interest, (3) belief the <br>
 government is involved in a coverup, and (4) emotionally involved <br>
 direct and indirect victim/witnesses.<br>
 <br>
 On a recent television program commemorating the one hundredth <br>
 anniversary of Jack the Ripper, almost fifty percent of the viewing <br>
 audience who called the polling telephone numbers indicated that <br>
 they thought the murders were committed as part of a conspiracy <br>
 involving the British Royal Family. The five experts on the program, <br>
 however, unanimously agreed the crimes were the work of one <br>
 disorganized but lucky individual who was diagnosed as a paranoid <br>
 schizophrenic. In many ways, the murders of Jack the Ripper are <br>
 similar to those allegedly committed by satanists today.<br>
 <br>
 If your child's molestation was perpetrated by a sophisticated <br>
 satanic cult, there is nothing you could have done to prevent it and <br>
 therefore no reason to feel any guilt. I have been present when <br>
 parents who believe their children were ritually abused at day care<br>
 centers have told others that the cults had sensors in the road, <br>
 lookouts in the air, and informers everywhere; therefore, the <br>
 usually recommended advice of unannounced visits to the day care <br>
 center would be impossible. <br>
 <br>
 6. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS<br>
 <br>
 Even if only part of an allegation is not true, what then is the <br>
 answer to the question "Why are victims alleging things that do not <br>
 *seem* to be true?" After consulting with psychiatrists, <br>
 psychologists, anthropologists, therapists, social workers, child <br>
 sexual abuse experts, and law enforcement investigators for more <br>
 than eight years, I can find no single, simple answer. The answer to <br>
 the question seems to be a complex set of dynamics that can be <br>
 different in each case. In spite of the fact that some skeptics keep <br>
 looking for it, there does not appear to be one answer to the <br>
 question that fits every case. Each case is different, and each case <br>
 may involve a different combination of answers.<br>
 <br>
 I have identified a series of possible alternative answers to this <br>
 question. The alternative answers also do not preclude the <br>
 possibility that clever offenders are sometimes involved. I will not <br>
 attempt to explain completely these alternative answers because I <br>
 cannot. They are presented simply as areas for consideration and <br>
 evaluation by child sexual abuse intervenors, for further <br>
 elaboration by experts in these fields, and for research by <br>
 objective social scientists. The first step, however, in finding the <br>
 answers to this question is to admit the possibility that some of <br>
 what the victims describe may not have happened. Some child <br>
 advocates seem unwilling to do this.<br>
 <br>
 -- a. PATHOLOGICAL DISTORTION.<br>
 <br>
 The first possible answer to why victims are alleging things that do <br>
 not *seem* to be true is *pathological distortion*. The allegations <br>
 may be errors in processing reality influenced by underlying mental <br>
 disorders such as dissociative disorders, borderline or histrionic <br>
 personality disorders, or psychosis. These distortions may be <br>
 manifested in false accounts of victimization in order to gain <br>
 psychological benefits such as attention and sympathy (factitious <br>
 disorder). When such individuals repeatedly go from place to place <br>
 or person to person making these false reports of their own <br>
 "victimization", it is called Munchausen Syndrome. When the repealed <br>
 false reports concern the "victimization" of their children or <br>
 others linked to them, it is called Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. I <br>
 am amazed when some therapists state that they believe the <br>
 allegations because they cannot think of a reason why the "victim", <br>
 whose failures are now explained and excused or who is now the <br>
 center of attention at a conference or on a national television <br>
 program, would lie. If you can be forgiven for mutilating and <br>
 killing babies, you can be forgiven for anything.<br>
 <br>
 Many "victims" may develop pseudomemories of their victimization and <br>
 eventually come to believe the events actually occurred. Noted <br>
 forensic psychiatrist Park E. Dietz (personal communication, Nov. <br>
 1991) states:<br>
 <br>
 "Pseudomemories have been acquired through dreams (particularly if <br>
 one is encouraged to keep a journal or dream diary and to regard <br>
 dream content as 'clues' about the past or as snippets of history), <br>
 substance-induced altered states of consciousness (alcohol or other <br>
 drugs), group influence (particularly hearing vivid accounts of <br>
 events occurring to others with whom one identifies emotionally such <br>
 as occurs in incest survivor groups), reading vivid accounts of <br>
 events occurring to others with whom one identifies emotionally, <br>
 watching such accounts in films or on television, and hypnosis. The<br>
 most efficient means of inducing pseudomemories is hypnosis.<br>
 <br>
 "It is characteristic of pseudomemories that the recollections of <br>
 complex events (as opposed to a simple unit of information, such as <br>
 a tag number) are incomplete and without chronological sequence. <br>
 Often the person reports some uncertainty because the pseudomemories <br>
 are experienced in a manner they describe as 'hazy', 'fuzzy', or <br>
 'vague'. They are often perplexed that they recall some details <br>
 vividly but others dimly.<br>
 <br>
 "Pseudomemories are not delusions. When first telling others of <br>
 pseudomemories, these individuals do not have the unshakable but <br>
 irrational conviction that deluded subjects have, but with social <br>
 support they often come to defend vigorously the truthfulness of the <br>
 pseudomemories.<br>
 <br>
 "Pseudomemories are not fantasies, but may incorporate elements from <br>
 fantasies experienced in the past. Even where the events described <br>
 are implausible, listeners may believe them because they are <br>
 reported with such intense affect (i.e. with so much emotion <br>
 attached to the story) that the listener concludes that the events <br>
 must have happened because no one could 'fake' the emotional aspects <br>
 of the retelling. It also occurs, however, that persons report <br>
 pseudomemories in such a matter-of-fact and emotionless manner that <br>
 mental health professionals conclude that the person has <br>
 'dissociated' intellectual knowledge of the events from emotional <br>
 appreciation of their impact."<br>
 <br>
 -- b. TRAUMATIC MEMORY.<br>
 <br>
 The second possible answer is *traumatic memory*. Fear and severe <br>
 trauma can cause victims to distort reality and confuse events. This <br>
 is a well-documented fact in cases involving individuals taken <br>
 hostage or in life-and-death situations. The distortions may be part <br>
 of an elaborate defense mechanism of the mind called "splitting" - <br>
 The victims create a clear-cut good-and-evil manifestation of their <br>
 complex victimization that is then psychologically more manageable.<br>
 <br>
 Through the defense mechanism of dissociation, the victim may escape <br>
 the horrors of reality by inaccurately processing that reality. In a <br>
 dissociative state a young child who ordinarily would know the <br>
 difference might misinterpret a film or video as reality.<br>
 <br>
 Another defense mechanism may tell the victim that it could have <br>
 been worse, and so his or her victimization was not so bad. They are <br>
 not alone in their victimization - other children were also abused. <br>
 Their father who abused them is no different from other prominent <br>
 people in the community they claim also abused them. Satanism may <br>
 help to explain why their outwardly good and religious parents did <br>
 such terrible things to them in the privacy of their home. Their <br>
 religious training may convince them that such unspeakable acts by <br>
 supposedly "good" people must be the work of the devil. The <br>
 described human sacrifice may be symbolic of the "death" of their <br>
 childhood.<br>
 <br>
 It may be that we should anticipate that individuals severely abused <br>
 as very young children by *multiple* offenders with *fear* as the <br>
 primary controlling tactic will distort and embellish their <br>
 victimization. Perhaps a horror-filled yet inaccurate account of <br>
 victimization is not only not a counterindication of abuse, but is <br>
 in fact a corroborative indicator of extreme physical, <br>
 psychological, and/or sexual abuse. I do not believe it is a <br>
 coincidence nor the result of deliberate planning by satanists that <br>
 in almost all the cases of ritual abuse that have come to my <br>
 attention, the abuse is alleged to have begun prior to the age of <br>
 seven and perpetrated by multiple offenders. It may well be that<br>
 such abuse, at young age by multiple offenders, is the most <br>
 difficult to accurately recall with the specific and precise detail <br>
 needed by the criminal justice system, and the most likely to be <br>
 distorted and exaggerated when it is recalled. In her book _Too <br>
 Scared to Cry_ (1990), child psychiatrist Lenore Terr, a leading <br>
 expert on psychic trauma in childhood, states "that a series of <br>
 early childhood shocks might not be fully and accurately <br>
 'reconstructed' from the dreams and behaviors of the adult" (p. 5).<br>
  <br>
 -- c. NORMAL CHILDHOOD FEARS AND FANTASY.<br>
 <br>
 The third possible answer may be *normal childhood fears and <br>
 fantasy*. Most young children are afraid of ghosts and monsters. <br>
 Even as adults, many people feel uncomfortable, for example, about <br>
 dangling their arms over the side of their bed. They still remember <br>
 the "monster" under the bed from childhood. While young children may <br>
 rarely invent stories about sexual activity, they might describe <br>
 their victimization in terms of evil as they understand it. In <br>
 church or at home, children may be told of satanic activity as the <br>
 source of evil. The children may be "dumping" all their fears and <br>
 worries unto an attentive and encouraging listener.<br>
 <br>
 Children do fantasize. Perhaps whatever causes a child to allege <br>
 something impossible (such as being cut up and put back together) is <br>
 similar to what causes a child to allege something possible but <br>
 improbable (such as witnessing another child being chopped up and <br>
 eaten).<br>
 <br>
 -- d. MISPERCEPTION, CONFUSION, AND TRICKERY.<br>
 <br>
 Misperception, confusion, and trickery may be a fourth answer. <br>
 Expecting young children to give accurate accounts of sexual <br>
 activity for which they have little frame of reference is <br>
 unreasonable. The Broadway play _Madame Butterfly_ is the true story <br>
 of a man who had a 15-year affair, including the "birth" of a baby, <br>
 with a "woman" who turns out to have been a man all along. If a <br>
 grown man does not know when he has had vaginal intercourse with a <br>
 woman, how can we expect young children not to be confused?<br>
 <br>
 Furthermore some clever offenders may deliberately introduce <br>
 elements of satanism and the occult into the sexual exploitation <br>
 simply to confuse or intimidate the victims. Simple magic and other <br>
 techniques may be used to trick the children. Drugs may also be <br>
 deliberately used to confuse the victims and distort their <br>
 perceptions. Such acts would then be M.O., not ritual.<br>
 <br>
 As previously stated, the perceptions of young victims may also be <br>
 influenced by any trauma being experienced. This is the most popular <br>
 alternative explanation, and even the more zealous believers of <br>
 ritual abuse allegations use it, but only to explain obviously <br>
 impossible events.<br>
  <br>
 -- e. OVERZEALOUS INTERVENORS.<br>
 <br>
 *Overzealous intervenors*, causing intervenor contagion, may be a <br>
 fifth answer. These intervenors can include parents, family members, <br>
 foster parents, doctors, therapists, social workers, law enforcement <br>
 officers, prosecutors, and any combination thereof. Victims have <br>
 been subtly as well as overtly rewarded and bribed by usually well-<br>
 meaning intervenors for furnishing further details. In addition, <br>
 some of what appears not to have happened may have originated as a <br>
 result of intervenors making assumptions about or misinterpreting <br>
 what the victims are saying. The intervenors then repeat, and <br>
 possibly embellish, these assumptions and misinterpretations, and <br>
 eventually the victims are "forced" to agree with or come to accept <br>
 this "official" version of what happened.<br>
 <br>
 The judgment of intervenors may be affected by their zeal to uncover <br>
 child sexual abuse, satanic activity, or conspiracies. However <br>
 "well-intentioned", these overzealous intervenors must accept <br>
 varying degrees of responsibility for the unsuccessful prosecution <br>
 of those cases where criminal abuse did occur. This is the most <br>
 controversial and least popular of the alternative explanations.<br>
 <br>
 -- f. URBAN LEGENDS.<br>
 <br>
 Allegations of and knowledge about ritualistic or satanic abuse may <br>
 also be spread through *urban legends*. In _The Vanishing <br>
 Hitchhiker_ (1981), the first of his four books on the topic, Dr. <br>
 Jan Harold Brunvand defines urban legends as "realistic stories <br>
 concerning recent events (or alleged events) with an ironic or <br>
 supernatural twist" (p. xi). Dr. Brunvand's books convincingly <br>
 explain that just because individuals throughout the country who <br>
 never met each other tell the same story does not mean that it is <br>
 true. Absurd urban legends about the corporate logos of Proctor and <br>
 Gamble and Liz Claiborne being satanic symbols persist in spite of <br>
 all efforts to refute them with reality. Some urban legends about <br>
 child kidnappings and other threats to citizens have even been <br>
 disseminated unknowingly by law enforcement agencies. Such legends <br>
 have always existed, but today the mass media aggressively <br>
 participate in their rapid and more efficient dissemination. Many <br>
 Americans mistakenly believe that tabloid television shows check out <br>
 and verify the details of their stories before pulling them on the <br>
 air. Mass hysteria may partially account for large numbers of <br>
 victims describing the same symptoms or experiences.<br>
 <br>
 Training conferences for all the disciplines involved in child <br>
 sexual abuse may also play a role in the spread of this contagion. <br>
 At one child abuse conference I attended, an exhibitor was selling <br>
 more than 50 different books dealing with satanism and the occult. <br>
 By the end of the conference, he had sold nearly all of them. At <br>
 another national child sexual abuse conference, I witnessed more <br>
 than 100 attendees copying down the widely disseminated 29 "Symptoms <br>
 Characterizing Satanic Ritual Abuse" in preschool-aged children. Is <br>
 a four-year-old child's "preoccupation with urine and feces" an <br>
 indication of satanic ritual abuse or part of normal development?<br>
 <br>
 -- g. COMBINATION.<br>
 <br>
 Most multidimensional child sex ring cases probably involve a <br>
 *combination* of the answers previously set forth, as well as other <br>
 possible explanations unknown to me at this time. Obviously, cases <br>
 with adult survivors are more likely to involve some of these <br>
 answers than those with young children. Each case of sexual <br>
 victimization must be individually evaluated on its own merits <br>
 without any preconceived explanations. All the possibilities must be <br>
 explored if for no other reason than the fact that the defense <br>
 attorneys for any accused subjects will almost certainly do so.<br>
 <br>
 Most people would agree that just because a victim tells you one <br>
 detail that turns out to be true, this does not mean that every <br>
 detail is true. But many people seem to believe that if you can <br>
 disprove one part of a victim's story, then the entire story is <br>
 false. As previously stated, one of my main concerns in these cases <br>
 is that people are getting away with sexually abusing children or <br>
 committing other crimes because we cannot prove that they are <br>
 members of organized cults that murder and eat people.<br>
 <br>
 I have discovered that the subject of multidimensional child sex <br>
 rings is a very emotional and polarizing issue. Everyone seems to <br>
 demand that one choose a side. On one side of the issue are those <br>
 who say that nothing really happened and it is all a big witch hunt<br>
 led by overzealous fanatics and incompetent "experts". The other <br>
 side says, in essence, that everything happened; victims never lie <br>
 about child sexual abuse, and so it must be true.<br>
 <br>
 There is a middle ground. It is the job of the professional <br>
 investigator to listen to all the victims and conduct appropriate <br>
 investigation in an effort to find out what happened, considering <br>
 all possibilities. Not all childhood trauma is abuse. Not all child <br>
 abuse is a crime. The great frustration of these cases is the fact <br>
 that you are often convinced that something traumatic happened to <br>
 the victim, but do not know with any degree of certainty exactly <br>
 what happened, when it happened, or who did it. <br>
 <br>
 7. DO VICTIMS LIE ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION?<br>
 <br>
 The crucial central issue in the evaluation of a response to cases <br>
 of multidimensional child sex rings is the statement "Children never <br>
 lie about sexual abuse or exploitation. If they have details, it <br>
 must have happened." This statement, oversimplified by many, is the <br>
 basic premise upon which some believe the child sexual abuse and <br>
 exploitation movement is based. It is almost never questioned or <br>
 debated at training conferences. In fact, during the 1970s, there <br>
 was a successful crusade to eliminate laws requiring corroboration <br>
 of child victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. The best way <br>
 to convict child molesters is to have the child victims testify in <br>
 court. If we believe them, the jury will believe them. Any challenge <br>
 to this basic premise was viewed as a threat to the movement and a <br>
 denial that the problem existed.<br>
 <br>
 I believe that children *rarely* lie about sexual abuse or <br>
 exploitation, if a lie is defined as a statement deliberately and <br>
 maliciously intended to deceive. The problem is the <br>
 oversimplification of the statement. Just because a child is not <br>
 lying does not necessarily mean the child is telling the truth. I <br>
 believe that in the majority of these cases, the victims are not <br>
 lying. They are telling you what they have come to believe has <br>
 happened to them. Furthermore the assumption that children rarely <br>
 lie about sexual abuse does not necessarily apply to everything a <br>
 child says during a sexual abuse investigation. Stories of <br>
 mutilation, murder, and cannibalism are not really about sexual <br>
 abuse.<br>
 <br>
 Children rarely lie about sexual abuse or exploitation. but they do <br>
 fantasize, furnish false information, furnish misleading <br>
 information, misperceive events, try to please adults, respond to <br>
 leading questions, and respond to rewards. Children are not adults <br>
 in little bodies and do go through developmental stages that must be <br>
 evaluated and understood. In many ways, however, children are no <br>
 better and no worse than other victims or witnesses of a crime. They <br>
 should not be automatically believed, nor should they be <br>
 automatically disbelieved.<br>
 <br>
 The second part of the statement - if children can supply details, <br>
 the crime must have happened - must also be carefully evaluated. The <br>
 details in question in most of the cases of multidimensional child <br>
 sex rings have little to do with sexual activity. Law enforcement <br>
 and social workers must do more than attempt to determine how a <br>
 child could have known about the sex acts. These cases involve <br>
 determining how a victim could have known about a wide variety of <br>
 bizarre and ritualistic activity. Young children may know little <br>
 about specific sex acts, but they may know a lot about monsters, <br>
 torture, kidnapping, and murder.<br>
 <br>
 Victims may supply details of sexual and other acts using <br>
 information from sources other than their own direct victimization. <br>
 Such sources must be evaluated carefully by the investigator of<br>
 multidimensional child sex rings.<br>
 <br>
 -- a. PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.<br>
 <br>
 The victim may have personal knowledge of the sexual or ritual acts, <br>
 but not as a result of the alleged victimization. The knowledge <br>
 could have come from viewing pornography, sex education, or occult <br>
 material; witnessing sexual or ritual activity in the home; or <br>
 witnessing the sexual abuse of others. It could also have come from <br>
 having been sexually or physically abused, but by other than the <br>
 alleged offenders and in ways other than the alleged offense.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. OTHER CHILDREN OR VICTIMS.<br>
 <br>
 Young children today are socially interacting more often and at a <br>
 younger age than ever before. Many parents are unable to provide <br>
 possibly simple explanations for their children's stories because <br>
 they were not with the children when the events occurred. They do <br>
 not even know what videotapes their children may have seen, what <br>
 games they may have played, or what stories they may have been told <br>
 or overheard. Children are being placed in day care centers for <br>
 eight, ten, or twelve hours a day starting as young as six weeks of <br>
 age. The children share experiences by playing house, school, or <br>
 doctor. Bodily functions such as urination and defecation are a <br>
 focus of attention for these young children. To a certain extent, <br>
 each child shares the experiences of all the other children.<br>
 <br>
 The odds are fairly high that in any typical day care center there <br>
 might be some children who are victims of incest; victims of <br>
 physical abuse; victims of psychological abuse; children of cult <br>
 members (even satanists); children of sexually open parents; <br>
 children of sexually indiscriminate parents; children of parents <br>
 obsessed with victimization; children of parents obsessed with the <br>
 evils of satanism; children without conscience; children with a <br>
 teenage brother or pregnant mother; children with heavy metal music <br>
 and literature in the home; children with bizarre toys, games, <br>
 comics, and magazines; children with a VCR and slasher films in <br>
 their home; children with access to dial-a-porn, party lines, or <br>
 pornography; or children victimized by a day care center staff <br>
 member. The possible effects of the interaction of such children <br>
 prior to the disclosure of the alleged abuse must be evaluated, <br>
 Adult survivors may obtain details from group therapy sessions, <br>
 support networks, church groups, or self-help groups. The <br>
 willingness and ability of siblings to corroborate adult survivor <br>
 accounts of ritual abuse varies. Some will support and partially <br>
 corroborate the victim's allegations. Others will vehemently deny <br>
 them and support their accused parents or relatives.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. MEDIA.<br>
 <br>
 The amount of sexually explicit, occult, anti-occult, or violence-<br>
 oriented material available to adults and even children in the <br>
 modern world is overwhelming. This includes movies, videotapes, <br>
 television, music, toys, and books. There are also documentaries on <br>
 satanism, witchcraft, and the occult that are available on <br>
 videotape. Most of the televangelists have videotapes on the topics <br>
 that they are selling on their programs.<br>
 <br>
 The National Coalition on Television Violence News (1988) estimates <br>
 that 12% of the movies produced in the United States can be <br>
 classified as satanic horror films. Cable television and the home <br>
 VCR make all this material readily available even to young children. <br>
 Religious broadcasters and almost all the television tabloid and <br>
 magazine programs have done shows on satanism and the occult. Heavy <br>
 metal and black metal music, which often has a satanic theme, is <br>
 readily available and popular. In addition to the much-debated<br>
 fantasy role-playing games, there are numerous popular toys on the <br>
 market with an occult-oriented, bizarre, or violent theme.<br>
 <br>
 Books on satanism and the occult, both fiction and nonfiction, are <br>
 readily available in most bookstores, especially Christian <br>
 bookstores. Several recent books specifically discuss the issue of <br>
 ritual abuse of children. Obviously, very young children do not read <br>
 this material, but their parents, relatives, and therapists might <br>
 and then discuss it in front of or with them. Much of the material <br>
 intended to fight the problem actually fuels the problem and damages <br>
 effective prosecution.<br>
 <br>
 -- d. SUGGESTIONS AND LEADING QUESTIONS.<br>
 <br>
 This problem is particularly important in cases stemming from <br>
 custody/visitation disputes involving at least one child under the <br>
 age of seven. It is my opinion that most suggestive, leading <br>
 questioning of children by intervenors is inadvertently done as part <br>
 of a good-faith effort to learn the truth. Not all intervenors are <br>
 in equal positions to potentially influence victim allegations. <br>
 Parents and relatives especially are in a position to subtly <br>
 influence their young children to describe their victimization in a <br>
 certain way. Children may also overhear their parents discussing the <br>
 details of the case. Children often tell their parents what they <br>
 believe their parents want or need to hear. Some children may be <br>
 instinctively attempting to provide "therapy" for their parents by <br>
 telling them what seems to satisfy them and somehow makes them feel <br>
 better. In one case a father gave the police a tape recording to <br>
 "prove" that his child's statements were spontaneous disclosures and <br>
 not the result of leading, suggestive questions. The tape recording <br>
 indicated just the opposite. Why then did the father voluntarily <br>
 give it to the police? Probably because he truly believed that he <br>
 was not influencing his child's statements - but he was. <br>
 <br>
 Therapists are probably in the best position to influence the <br>
 allegations of adult survivors. The accuracy and reliability of the <br>
 accounts of adult survivors who have been hypnotized during therapy <br>
 is certainly open to question. One nationally-known therapist <br>
 personally told me that the reason police cannot find out about <br>
 satanic or ritualistic activity from child victims is that they do <br>
 not know how to ask leading questions. Highly suggestive books and <br>
 pictures portraying "satanic" activity have been developed and <br>
 marketed to therapists for use during evaluation and treatment. <br>
 Types and styles of verbal interaction useful in therapy may create <br>
 significant problems in a criminal investigation. It should be <br>
 noted, however, that when a therapist does a poor investigative <br>
 interview as part of a criminal investigation, that is the fault of <br>
 the criminal justice system that allowed it and not the therapist <br>
 who did it.<br>
 <br>
 The extremely sensitive, emotional, and religious nature of these <br>
 cases makes problems with leading questions more likely than in <br>
 other kinds of cases. Intervenors motivated by religious fervor <br>
 and/or exaggerated concerns about sexual abuse of children are more <br>
 likely to lose their objectivity.<br>
 <br>
 -- e. MISPERCEPTION AND CONFUSION.<br>
 <br>
 In one case, a child's description of the apparently impossible act <br>
 of walking through a wall turned out to be the very possible act of <br>
 walking between the studs of an unfinished wall in a room under <br>
 construction. In another case, pennies in the anus turned out to be <br>
 copper-foil-covered suppositories. The children may describe what <br>
 they believe happened. It is not a lie, but neither is it an <br>
 accurate account of what happened.<br>
 <br>
 -- f. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS PROGRAMS.<br>
 <br>
 Some well-intentioned awareness programs designed to prevent child <br>
 set abuse, alert professionals, or fight satanism may in fact be <br>
 unrealistically increasing the fears of professionals, children, and <br>
 parents and creating self-fulfilling prophesies. Some of what <br>
 children and their parents are telling intervenors may have been <br>
 learned in or fueled by such programs. Religious programs, books, <br>
 and pamphlets that emphasize the power and evil force of Satan may <br>
 be adding to the problem. In fact most of the day care centers in <br>
 which ritualistic abuse is alleged to hate taken place are church-<br>
 affiliated centers, and many of the adult survivors alleging it come <br>
 from apparently religious families. <br>
 <br>
 8. LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE.<br>
 <br>
 The perspective with which one looks at satanic, occult, or <br>
 ritualistic crime is extremely important. As stated, sociologists, <br>
 therapists, religious leaders, parents, and just plain citizens each <br>
 have their own valid concerns and views about this issue. This <br>
 discussion, however, deals primarily with the law enforcement or <br>
 criminal justice perspective.<br>
 <br>
 When you combine an emotional issue such as the sexual abuse of <br>
 children with an even more emotional issue such as people's <br>
 religious beliefs, it is difficult to maintain objectivity and <br>
 remember the law enforcement perspective. Some police officers may <br>
 even feel that all crime is caused by evil, all evil is caused by <br>
 Satan, and therefore, all crime is satanic crime. This may be a <br>
 valid religious perspective, but it is of no relevance to the <br>
 investigation of crime for purposes of prosecution.<br>
 <br>
 Many of the police officers who lecture on satanic or occult crime <br>
 do not even investigate such cases. Their presentations are more a <br>
 reflection of their personal religious beliefs than documented <br>
 investigative information. They are absolutely entitled to their <br>
 beliefs, but introducing themselves as current or former police <br>
 officers and then speaking as religious advocates causes confusion. <br>
 As difficult as it might be, police officers must separate the <br>
 religious and law enforcement perspectives when they are lecturing <br>
 or investigating in their official capacities as law enforcement <br>
 officers. Many law enforcement officers begin their presentations by <br>
 stating that they are not addressing or judging anyone's religious <br>
 beliefs, and then proceed to do exactly that.<br>
 <br>
 Some police officers have resigned rather than curtail or limit <br>
 their involvement in this issue as ordered by their departments. <br>
 Perhaps such officers deserve credit for recognizing that they could <br>
 no longer keep the perspectives separate.<br>
 <br>
 Law enforcement officers and all professionals in this field should <br>
 avoid the "paranoia" that has crept into this issue and into some of <br>
 the training conferences. Paranoid type belief systems are <br>
 characterized by the gradual development of intricate, complex, and <br>
 elaborate systems of thinking based on and often proceeding <br>
 logically from misinterpretation of actual events. Paranoia <br>
 typically involves hypervigilance over the perceived threat, the <br>
 belief that danger is around every corner, and the willingness to <br>
 take up the challenge and do something about it. Another very <br>
 important aspect of this paranoia is the belief that those who do <br>
 not recognize the threat are evil and corrupt. In this extreme view, <br>
 you are either with them or against them. You are either part of the <br>
 solution or part of the problem.<br>
 <br>
 Overzealousness and exaggeration motivated by the true religious <br>
 fervor of those involved is more acceptable than that motivated by<br>
 ego or profit. There are those who are deliberately distorting and <br>
 hyping this issue for personal notoriety and profit. Satanic and <br>
 occult crime and ritual abuse of children has become a growth <br>
 industry. Speaking fees, books, video and audio tapes, prevention <br>
 material, television and radio appearances all bring egoistic and <br>
 financial rewards.<br>
 <br>
 Bizarre crime and evil can occur without organized satanic activity. <br>
 The professional perspective requires that we distinguish between <br>
 what we know and what we're not sure of.<br>
 <br>
 The facts are:<br>
 <br>
 -- a. Some individuals believe in and are involved in something <br>
 commonly called satanism and the occult.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. Some of these individuals commit crime.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. Some groups of individuals share these beliefs and involvement <br>
 in this satanism and the occult.<br>
 <br>
 -- d. Some members of these groups commit crime together.<br>
 <br>
 The unanswered questions are:<br>
 <br>
 -- a. What is the connection between the belief system and the <br>
 crimes committed?<br>
 <br>
 -- b. Is there an organized conspiracy of satanic and occult <br>
 believers responsible for interrelated serious crime (e.g., <br>
 molestation, murder)?<br>
 <br>
 After all the hype and hysteria are put aside, the realization sets <br>
 in that most satanic/occult activity involves the commission of *no* <br>
 crimes, and that which does usually involves the commission of <br>
 relatively minor crimes such as trespassing, vandalism, cruelty to <br>
 animals, or petty thievery.<br>
 <br>
 The law enforcement problems most often linked to satanic or occult <br>
 activity are:<br>
 <br>
 -- a. Vandalism.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. Desecration of churches and cemeteries.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. Thefts from churches and cemeteries.<br>
 <br>
 -- d. Teenage gangs<br>
 <br>
 -- e. Animal mutilations.<br>
 <br>
 -- f. Teenage suicide.<br>
 <br>
 -- g. Child abuse.<br>
 <br>
 -- h. Kidnapping.<br>
 <br>
 -- i. Murder and human sacrifice<br>
 <br>
 Valid evidence shows some "connection" between satanism and the <br>
 occult and the first six problems (#a-f) set forth above. The <br>
 "connection" to the last three problems (#g-i) is far more <br>
 uncertain.<br>
 <br>
 Even where there seems to be a "connection", the nature of the <br>
 connection needs to be explored. It is easy to blame involvement in<br>
 satanism and the occult for behaviors that have complex motivations. <br>
 A teenager's excessive involvement in satanism and the occult is <br>
 usually a symptom of a problem and not the cause of a problem. <br>
 Blaming satanism for a teenager's vandalism, theft, suicide, or even <br>
 act of murder is like blaming a criminal's offenses on his tattoos: <br>
 Both are often signs of the same rebelliousness and lack of self-<br>
 esteem that contribute to the commission of crimes.<br>
 <br>
 The rock band Judas Priest was recently sued for allegedly inciting <br>
 two teenagers to suicide through subliminal messages in their <br>
 recordings. In 1991 Anthony Pratkanis of the University of <br>
 California at Santa Cruz, who served as an expert witness for the <br>
 defense, stated the boys in question "lived troubled lives, lives of <br>
 drug and alcohol abuse, run-ins with the law ... family violence, <br>
 and chronic unemployment. What issues did the trial and the <br>
 subsequent mass media coverage emphasize? Certainly not the need for <br>
 drug treatment centers; there was no evaluation of the pros and cons <br>
 of America's juvenile justice system, no investigation of the <br>
 schools, no inquiry into how to prevent family violence, no <br>
 discussion of the effects of unemployment on a family. Instead our <br>
 attention was mesmerized by an attempt to count the number of <br>
 subliminal demons that can dance on the end of a record needle" (p. <br>
 1).<br>
 <br>
 The law enforcement investigator must objectively evaluate the legal <br>
 significance of any criminal's spiritual beliefs. In most cases, <br>
 including those involving satanists, it will have little or no legal <br>
 significance. If a crime is committed as part of a spiritual belief <br>
 system, it should make no difference which belief system it is. The <br>
 crime is the same whether a child is abused or murdered as part of a <br>
 Christian, Hare Krishna, Moslem, or any other belief system. We <br>
 generally don't label crimes with the name of the perpetrator's <br>
 religion. Why then are the crimes of child molesters, rapists, <br>
 sadists, and murderers who happen to be involved in satanism and the <br>
 occult labeled as satanic or occult crimes? If criminals use a <br>
 spiritual belief system to rationalize and justify or to facilitate <br>
 and enhance their criminal activity, should the focus of law <br>
 enforcement be on the belief system or on the criminal activity? <br>
 <br>
 Several documented murders have been committed by individuals <br>
 involved in one way or another in satanism or the occult. In some of <br>
 these murders the perpetrator has even introduced elements of the <br>
 occult (e.g. satanic symbols at crime scene). Does that <br>
 automatically make these satanic murders? It is my opinion that the <br>
 answer is no. Ritualistic murders committed by serial killers or <br>
 sexual sadists are not necessarily satanic or occult murders. <br>
 Ritualistic murders committed by psychotic killers who hear the <br>
 voice of Satan are no more satanic murders than murders committed by <br>
 psychotic killers who hear the voice of Jesus are Christian murders.<br>
 <br>
 Rather a satanic murder should be defined as one committed by two or <br>
 more individuals who rationally plan the crime and whose *primary* <br>
 motivation is to fulfill a prescribed satanic ritual calling for the <br>
 murder. By this definition I have been unable to identify even one <br>
 documented satanic murder in the United States. Although such <br>
 murders may have and can occur, they appear to be few in number. In <br>
 addition the commission of such killings would probably be the <br>
 beginning of the end for such a group. It is highly unlikely that <br>
 they could continue to kill several people, every year, year after <br>
 year, and not be discovered.<br>
 <br>
 A brief typology of satanic and occult practitioners is helpful in <br>
 evaluating what relationship, if any, such practices have to crimes <br>
 under investigation. The following typology is adapted from the <br>
 investigative experience of Officer Sandi Gallant of the San <br>
 Francisco Police Department, who began to study the criminal aspects<br>
 of occult activity long before it became popular. No typology is <br>
 perfect, but I use this typology because it is simple and offers <br>
 investigative insights. Most practitioners fall into one of three <br>
 categories, any of which can be practiced alone or in groups:<br>
 <br>
 -- a. "YOUTH SUBCULTURE.<br>
 <br>
 "Most teenagers involved in fantasy role-playing games, heavy metal <br>
 music, or satanism and the occult are going through a stage of <br>
 adolescent development and commit no significant crimes. The <br>
 teenagers who have more serious problems are usually those from <br>
 dysfunctional families or those who have poor communication within <br>
 their families. These troubled teenagers turn to satanism and the <br>
 occult to overcome a sense of alienation, to rebel, to obtain power, <br>
 or to justify their antisocial behavior. For these teenagers it is <br>
 the symbolism, not the spirituality, that is more important. It is <br>
 either the psychopathic or the oddball, loner teenager who is most <br>
 likely to get into serious trouble. Extreme involvement in the <br>
 occult is a symptom of a problem, not the cause. This is not to <br>
 deny, however, that satanism and the occult can be negative <br>
 influences for a troubled teenager. But to hysterically warn <br>
 teenagers to avoid this "mysterious, powerful and dangerous" thing <br>
 called satanism will drive more teenagers right to it. Some <br>
 rebellious teenagers will do whatever will most shock and outrage <br>
 society in order to flaunt their rejection of adult norms.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. "DABBLERS (SELF-STYLED).<br>
 <br>
 "For these practitioners there is little or no spiritual motivation. <br>
 They may mix satanism, witchcraft, paganism, and any aspects of the <br>
 occult to suit their purposes. Symbols mean whatever they want them <br>
 or believe them to mean. Molesters, rapists, drug dealers, and <br>
 murderers may dabble in the occult and may even commit their crimes <br>
 in a ceremonial or ritualistic way. This category has the potential <br>
 to be the most dangerous, and most of the "satanic" killers fall <br>
 into this category. Their involvement in satanism and the occult is <br>
 a symptom of a problem, and a rationalization and justification of <br>
 antisocial behavior. Satanic/occult practices (as well as those of <br>
 other spiritual belief systems) can also be used as a mechanism to <br>
 facilitate criminal objectives.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. "TRADITIONAL (ORTHODOX).<br>
 <br>
 "These are the so-called true believers. They are often wary of <br>
 outsiders. Because of this and constitutional issues, such groups <br>
 are difficult for law enforcement to penetrate. Although there may <br>
 be much we don't know about these groups, as of now there is little <br>
 or no hard evidence that as a group they are involved in serious, <br>
 organized criminal activity. In addition, instead of being self-<br>
 perpetuating master crime conspirators, "true believers" probably <br>
 have a similar problem with their teenagers rebelling against their <br>
 belief system. To some extent even these Traditional satanists are <br>
 self-stylized. They practice what they have come to believe is <br>
 "satanism". There is little or no evidence of the much-discussed <br>
 multigenerational satanists whose beliefs and practices have <br>
 supposedly been passed down through the centuries. Many admitted <br>
 adult satanists were in fact raised in conservative Christian <br>
 homes."<br>
 <br>
 _Washington Post_ editor Walt Harrington reported in a 1986 story on <br>
 Anton LaVey and his Church of Satan that "sociologists who have <br>
 studied LaVey's church say that its members often had serious <br>
 childhood problems like alcoholic parents or broken homes, or that <br>
 they were traumatized by guilt-ridden fundamentalist upbringings, <br>
 turning to Satanism as a dramatic way to purge their debilitating <br>
 guilt" (p. 14).<br>
 <br>
 Some have claimed that the accounts of ritual abuse victims coincide <br>
 with historical records of what traditional or multigenerational <br>
 satanists are known to have practiced down through the ages. Jeffrey <br>
 Burton Russell, Professor of History at the University of California <br>
 at Santa Barbara and the author of numerous scholarly books on the <br>
 devil and satanism, believes that the universal consensus of modern <br>
 historians on satanism is (personal communication, Nov. 1991):<br>
 <br>
 "(1) incidents of orgy, infanticide, cannibalism, and other such <br>
 conduct have occurred from the ancient world down to the present; <br>
 (2) such incidents were isolated and limited to local antisocial <br>
 groups; (3) during the period of Christian dominance in European <br>
 culture, such groups were associated with the Devil in the minds of <br>
 the authorities; (4) in some cases the sectaries believed that they <br>
 were worshiping Satan; (5) no organized cult of Satanists existed in <br>
 the Christian period beyond localities, and on no account was there <br>
 ever any widespread Satanist organization or conspiracy; (6) no <br>
 reliable historical sources indicate that such organizations <br>
 existed; (7) the black mass appears only once in the sources before <br>
 the late nineteenth century."<br>
  <br>
 Many police officers ask what to look for during the search of the <br>
 scene of suspected satanic activity. The answer is simple: Look for <br>
 evidence of a crime. A pentagram is no more criminally significant <br>
 than a crucifix unless it corroborates a crime or a criminal <br>
 conspiracy. If a victim's description of the location or the <br>
 instruments of the crime includes a pentagram, then the pentagram <br>
 would be evidence. But the same would be true if the description <br>
 included a crucifix. In many cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse, <br>
 investigation can find evidence that the claimed offenders are <br>
 members only of mainstream churches and are often described as very <br>
 religious.<br>
 <br>
 There is no way any one law enforcement officer can become <br>
 knowledgeable about all the symbols and rituals of every spiritual <br>
 belief system that might become part of a criminal investigation. <br>
 The officer needs only to be trained to recognize the possible <br>
 investigative significance of such signs, symbols, and rituals. <br>
 Knowledgeable religious scholars, academics, and other true experts <br>
 in the community can be consulted if a more detailed analysis is <br>
 necessary.<br>
 <br>
 Any analysis, however, may have only limited application, especially <br>
 to cases involving teenagers, dabblers, and other self-styled <br>
 practitioners. The fact is signs, symbols, and rituals can mean <br>
 anything that practitioners want them to mean and/or anything that <br>
 observers interpret them to mean.<br>
 <br>
 The meaning of symbols can also change over time, place, and <br>
 circumstance. Is a swastika spray-painted on a wall an ancient <br>
 symbol of prosperity and good fortune, a recent symbol of Nazism and <br>
 anti-Semitism, or a current symbol of hate, paranoia, and adolescent <br>
 defiance? The peace sign which in the 1960s was a familiar antiwar <br>
 symbol is now supposed to be a satanic symbol. Some symbols and <br>
 holidays become "satanic" only because the antisatanists say they <br>
 are. Then those who want to be "satanists" adopt them, and now you <br>
 have "proof" they are satanic.<br>
 <br>
 In spite of what is sometimes said or suggested at law enforcement <br>
 training conferences, police have no authority to seize any satanic <br>
 or occult paraphernalia they might see during a search. A legally-<br>
 valid reason must exist for doing so. It is not the job of law <br>
 enforcement to prevent satanists from engaging in noncriminal <br>
 teaching, rituals, or other activities. <br>
 <br>
 9. INVESTIGATING MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHILD SEX RINGS.<br>
 <br>
 Multidimensional child sex rings can be among the most difficult, <br>
 frustrating, and complex cases that any law enforcement officer will <br>
 ever investigate. The investigation of allegations of recent <br>
 activity from multiple young children under the age of seven <br>
 presents one set of problems and must begin quickly, with interviews <br>
 of *all* potential victims being completed as soon as possible. The <br>
 investigation of allegations of activity ten or more years earlier <br>
 from adult survivors presents other problems and should proceed, <br>
 unless victims are at immediate risk, more deliberately, with <br>
 gradually-increasing resources as corroborated facts warrant.<br>
 <br>
 In spite of any skepticism, allegations of ritual abuse should be <br>
 aggressively and thoroughly investigated, This investigation should <br>
 attempt to corroborate the allegations of ritual abuse. but should <br>
 *simultaneously* also attempt to identify alternative explanations. <br>
 The only debate is over how much investigation is enough. Any law <br>
 enforcement agency must be prepared to defend and justify its <br>
 actions when scrutinized by the public, the media, elected <br>
 officials, or the courts. This does not mean, however, that a law <br>
 enforcement agency has an obligation to prove that the alleged <br>
 crimes did not occur. This is almost always impossible to do and <br>
 investigators should be alert for and avoid this trap.<br>
 <br>
 One major problem in the investigation of multidimensional child sex <br>
 rings is the dilemma of recognizing soon enough that you have one. <br>
 Investigators must be alert for cases with the potential for the <br>
 four basic dynamics: (a) multiple young victims, (b) multiple <br>
 offenders, (c) fear as the controlling tactic, and (d) bizarre or <br>
 ritualistic activity. The following techniques apply primarily to <br>
 the investigation of such multidimensional child sex rings:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 -- a. MINIMIZE SATANIC/OCCULT ASPECT.<br>
 <br>
 There are those who claim that one of the major reasons more of <br>
 these cases have not been successfully prosecuted is that the <br>
 satanic/occult aspect has not been aggressively pursued. One state <br>
 has even introduced legislation creating added penalties when <br>
 certain crimes are committed as part of a ritual or ceremony. A few <br>
 states have passed special ritual crime laws. I strongly disagree <br>
 with such an approach. It makes no difference what spiritual belief <br>
 system was used to enhance and facilitate or rationalize and justify <br>
 criminal behavior. It serves no purpose to "prove" someone is a <br>
 satanist. As a matter of fact, if it is alleged that the subject <br>
 committed certain criminal acts under the influence of or in order <br>
 to conjure up supernatural spirits or forces, this may very well be <br>
 the basis for an insanity or diminished capacity defense, or may <br>
 damage the intent aspect of a sexually motivated crime. The defense <br>
 may very well be more interested in all the "evidence of satanic <br>
 activity". Some of the satanic crime "experts" who train law <br>
 enforcement wind up working or testifying for the defense in these <br>
 cases.<br>
 <br>
 It is best to focus on the crime and all the evidence to corroborate <br>
 its commission. Information about local satanic or occult activity <br>
 is only of value if it is based on specific law enforcement <br>
 intelligence and not on some vague, unsubstantiated generalities <br>
 from religious groups. Cases are not solved by decoding signs, <br>
 symbols, and dates using undocumented satanic crime "manuals". In <br>
 one case a law enforcement agency executing a search warrant seized <br>
 only the satanic paraphernalia and left behind the other evidence <br>
 that would have corroborated victim statements. Cases are solved by <br>
 people- and behavior-oriented investigation. Evidence of satanic or <br>
 occult activity may help explain certain aspects of the case, but<br>
 even offenders who commit crimes in a spiritual context are usually <br>
 motivated by power, sex, and money.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. KEEP INVESTIGATION AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS SEPARATE.<br>
 <br>
 I believe that one of the biggest mistakes any investigator of these <br>
 cases can make is to attribute supernatural powers to the offenders. <br>
 During an investigation a good investigator may sometimes be able to <br>
 use the beliefs and superstitions of the offenders to his or her <br>
 advantage. The reverse happens if the investigator believes that the <br>
 offenders possess supernatural powers. Satanic/occult practitioners <br>
 have no more power than any other human beings. Law enforcement <br>
 officers who believe that the investigation of these cases puts them <br>
 in conflict with the supernatural forces of evil should probably not <br>
 be assigned to them. The religious beliefs of officers should <br>
 provide spiritual strength and support for them but should not <br>
 affect the objectivity and professionalism of the investigation.<br>
 <br>
 It is easy to get caught up in these cases and begin to see <br>
 "satanism" everywhere. Oversensitization to this perceived threat <br>
 may cause an investigator to "see" satanism in a crime when it <br>
 really is not there (quasi-satanism). Often the eye sees what the <br>
 mind perceives. It may also cause an investigator not to recognize a <br>
 staged crime scene deliberately seeded with "satanic clues" in order <br>
 to mislead the police (pseudo-satanism). On rare occasions an <br>
 overzealous investigator or intervenor may even be tempted to plant <br>
 "evidence of satanism" in order to corroborate such allegations and <br>
 beliefs. Supervisors need to be alert for and monitor these <br>
 reactions in their investigators.<br>
 <br>
 -- c. LISTEN TO THE VICTIMS.<br>
 <br>
 It is not the investigator's duty to believe the victims; it is his <br>
 or her job to listen and be an objective fact finder. Interviews of <br>
 young children should be done by investigators trained and <br>
 experienced in such interviews. Investigators must have direct <br>
 access to the alleged victims for interview purposes. Therapists for <br>
 an adult survivor sometimes want to act as intermediaries in their <br>
 patient's interview. This should be avoided if at all possible. <br>
 Adult survivor interviews are often confusing difficult and <br>
 extremely time-consuming. The investigator must remember however <br>
 that almost anything is possible. Most important the investigator <br>
 must remember that there is much middle ground. Just because one <br>
 event did happen does not mean that all reported events happened, <br>
 and just because one event did not happen does not mean that all <br>
 other events did not happen. Do not become such a zealot that you <br>
 believe it all nor such a cynic that you believe nothing. Varying <br>
 amounts and parts of the allegation may be factual. Attempting to <br>
 find evidence of what did happen is the great challenge of these <br>
 cases. *All* investigative interaction with victims must be <br>
 carefully and thoroughly documented.<br>
 <br>
 -- d. ASSESS AND EVALUATE VICTIM STATEMENTS.<br>
 <br>
 This is the part of the investigative process in child sexual <br>
 victimization cases that seems to have been lost. Is the victim <br>
 describing events and activities that are consistent with law <br>
 enforcement documented criminal behavior, or that are consistent <br>
 with distorted media accounts and erroneous public perceptions of <br>
 criminal behavior? Investigators should apply the "template of <br>
 probability". Accounts of child sexual victimization that are more <br>
 like books, television, and movies (e.g. big conspiracies, child sex <br>
 slaves, organized pornography rings) and less like documented cases <br>
 should be viewed with skepticism but thoroughly investigated. <br>
 Consider and investigate all possible explanations of events. It is <br>
 the investigator's job, and the information learned will be<br>
 invaluable in counteracting the defense attorneys when they raise <br>
 the alternative explanations.<br>
 <br>
 For example, an adult survivor's account of ritual victimization <br>
 might be explained by any one of at least four possibilities: First, <br>
 the allegations may be a fairly accurate account what actually <br>
 happened. Second, they may be deliberate lies (malingering), told <br>
 for the usual reasons people lie (e.g. money, revenge, jealousy). <br>
 Third, they may be deliberate lies (factitious disorder) told for <br>
 atypical reasons (e.g. attention, forgiveness). Lies so motivated <br>
 are less likely to be recognized by the investigator and more likely <br>
 to be rigidly maintained by the liar unless and until confronted <br>
 with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Fourth, the allegations <br>
 may be a highly inaccurate account of what actually happened, but <br>
 the victim truly believes it (pseudomemory) and therefore is not <br>
 lying. A polygraph examination of such a victim would be of limited <br>
 value. Other explanations or combinations of these explanations are <br>
 also possible. *Only* thorough *investigation* will point to the <br>
 correct or most likely explanation. <br>
 <br>
 Investigators cannot rely on therapists or satanic crime experts as <br>
 a shortcut to the explanation. In one case, the "experts" confirmed <br>
 and validated the account of a female who claimed to be a 15-year-<br>
 old deaf-mute kidnapped and held for three years by a satanic cult <br>
 and forced to participate in bizarre rituals before recently <br>
 escaping. Active investigation, however, determined she was a 27-<br>
 year-old woman who could hear and speak, who had not been kidnapped <br>
 by anyone, and who had a lengthy history of mental problems and at <br>
 least three other similar reports of false victimization. Her <br>
 "accurate" accounts of what the "real satanists" do were simply the <br>
 result of having read, while in mental hospitals, the same books <br>
 that the "experts" had. A therapist may have important insights <br>
 about whether an individual was traumatized, but knowing the exact <br>
 cause of that trauma is another matter. There have been cases where <br>
 investigation has discovered that individuals diagnosed by <br>
 therapists as suffering from Post-Vietnam Syndrome were never in <br>
 Vietnam or saw no combat.<br>
 <br>
 Conversely, in another case, a law enforcement "expert" on satanic <br>
 crime told a therapist that a patient's accounts of satanic murders <br>
 in a rural Pacific Northwest town were probably true because the <br>
 community was a hotbed of such satanic activity. When the therapist <br>
 explained that there was almost no violent crime reported in the <br>
 community, the officer explained that that is how you know it is the <br>
 satanists. If you knew about the murders or found the bodies, it <br>
 would not be satanists. How do you argue with that kind of logic?<br>
 <br>
 The first step in the assessment and evaluation of victim statements <br>
 is to determine the disclosure sequence, including how much time has <br>
 elapsed since disclosure was first made and the incident was <br>
 reported to the police or social services. The longer the delay, the <br>
 bigger the potential for problems. The next step is to determine the <br>
 number and purpose of *all prior* interviews of the victim <br>
 concerning the allegations. The more interviews conducted before the <br>
 investigative interview, the larger the potential for problems. <br>
 Although there is nothing wrong with admitting shortcomings and <br>
 seeking help, law enforcement should never abdicate its control over <br>
 the investigative interview. When an investigative interview is <br>
 conducted by or with a social worker or therapist using a team <br>
 approach, law enforcement must direct the process. Problems can also <br>
 be created by interviews conducted by various intervenors *after* <br>
 the investigative interview(s).<br>
 <br>
 The investigator must closely and carefully evaluate events in the <br>
 victim's life before, during, and after the alleged abuse.<br>
 <br>
 Events to be evaluated *before* the alleged abuse include:<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) Background of victim.<br>
 ---- (2) Abuse of drugs in home.<br>
 ---- (3) Pornography in home.<br>
 ---- (4) Play, television, and VCR habits.<br>
 ---- (5) Attitudes about sexuality in home.<br>
 ---- (6) Extent of sex education in home.<br>
 ---- (7) Activities of siblings.<br>
 ---- (8) Need or craving for attention.<br>
 ---- (9) Religious beliefs and training.<br>
 ---- (10) Childhood fears.<br>
 ---- (11) Custody/visitation disputes.<br>
 ---- (12) Victimization of or by family members.<br>
 ---- (13) Interaction between victims.<br>
 <br>
 Events to be evaluated *during* the alleged abuse include:<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) Use of fear or scare tactics.<br>
 ---- (2) Degree of trauma.<br>
 ---- (3) Use of magic deception or trickery.<br>
 ---- (4) Use of rituals.<br>
 ---- (5) Use of drugs.<br>
 ---- (6) Use of pornography.<br>
 <br>
 Events to be evaluated *after* the alleged abuse include:<br>
 <br>
 ---- (1) Disclosure sequence.<br>
 ---- (2) Background of prior interviewers.<br>
 ---- (3) Background of parents.<br>
 ---- (4) Co-mingling of victims.<br>
 ---- (5) Type of therapy received.<br>
 <br>
 -- e. EVALUATE CONTAGION.<br>
 <br>
 Consistent statements obtained from different multiple victims are <br>
 powerful pieces of corroborative evidence - that is as long as those <br>
 statements were not "contaminated". Investigation must carefully <br>
 evaluate both pre- and post-disclosure contagion, and both victim <br>
 and intervenor contagion. Are the different victim statements <br>
 consistent because they describe common experiences or events, or <br>
 because they reflect contamination or urban legends?<br>
 <br>
 The sources of potential contagion are widespread. Victims can <br>
 communicate with each other both prior to and after their <br>
 disclosures. Intervenors can communicate with each other and with <br>
 victims. The team or cell concepts of investigation are attempts to <br>
 deal with potential investigator contagion. All the victims are not <br>
 interviewed by the same individuals, and interviewers do not <br>
 necessarily share information directly with each other. Teams report <br>
 to a leader or supervisor who evaluates the information and decides <br>
 what other investigators need to know.<br>
 <br>
 Documenting existing contagion and eliminating additional contagion <br>
 are crucial to the successful investigation and prosecution of these <br>
 cases. There is no way, however, to erase or undo contagion. The <br>
 best you can hope for is to identify and evaluate it and attempt to <br>
 explain it. Mental health professionals requested to evaluate <br>
 suspected victims must be carefully selected. Having a victim <br>
 evaluated by one of the self-proclaimed experts on satanic ritual <br>
 abuse or by some other overzealous intervenor may result in the <br>
 credibility of that victim's testimony being severely damaged.<br>
 <br>
 In order to evaluate the contagion element, investigators must <br>
 meticulously and aggressively investigate these cases. The precise <br>
 disclosure sequence of the victim must be carefully identified and<br>
 documented. Investigators must verify through active investigation <br>
 the exact nature and content of each disclosure outcry or statement <br>
 made by the victim. Second-hand information about disclosure is not <br>
 good enough.<br>
 <br>
 Whenever possible, personal visits should be made to all locations <br>
 of alleged abuse and the victim's homes. Events prior to the alleged <br>
 abuse must be carefully evaluated. Investigators may have to view <br>
 television programs, films, and videotapes seen by the victims. It <br>
 may be necessary to conduct a background investigation and <br>
 evaluation of everyone, both professional and nonprofessional, who <br>
 interviewed the victims about the allegations prior to and after the <br>
 investigative interview(s). Investigators must be familiar with the <br>
 information about ritual abuse of children being disseminated in <br>
 magazines, books, television programs, videotapes, and conferences. <br>
 Every possible way that a victim could have learned about the <br>
 details of the abuse must be explored if for no other reason than to <br>
 eliminate them and counter the defense's arguments.<br>
 <br>
 There may, however, be validity to these contagion factors. *They <br>
 may explain some of the "unbelievable" aspects of the case and <br>
 result in the successful prosecution of the substance of the case.* <br>
 Consistency of statements becomes more significant if contagion is <br>
 identified or disproved by independent investigation. The easier <br>
 cases are the ones where there is a single, identifiable source of <br>
 contagion. Most cases, however, seem to involve multiple contagion <br>
 factors.<br>
 <br>
 Munchausen Syndrome and Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy are complex and <br>
 controversial issues in these cases. No attempt will be made to <br>
 discuss them in detail, but they are documented facts (Rosenberg, <br>
 1987). Most of the literature about them focuses on their <br>
 manifestation in the medical setting as false or self-inflicted <br>
 illness or injury. They are also manifested in the criminal justice <br>
 setting as false or self-inflicted crime victimization. If parents <br>
 would poison their children to prove an illness, they might sexually <br>
 abuse their children to prove a crime. "Victims" have been known to <br>
 destroy property, manufacture evidence, and mutilate themselves in <br>
 order to convince others of their victimization. The motivation is <br>
 psychological gain (i.e. attention, forgiveness, etc.) and not <br>
 necessarily money, jealousy, or revenge. These are the unpopular, <br>
 but documented, realities of the world. Recognizing their existence <br>
 does not mean that child sexual abuse and sexual assault are not <br>
 real and serious problems.<br>
 <br>
 -- f. ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS.<br>
 <br>
 The importance and difficulty of this technique in extrafamilial <br>
 cases involving young children cannot be overemphasized. An <br>
 investigator must maintain ongoing communication with the parents of <br>
 victims in these abuse cases. Not all parents react the same way to <br>
 the alleged abuse of their children. Some are very supportive and <br>
 cooperative. Others overreact and some even deny the victimization. <br>
 Sometimes there is animosity and mistrust among parents with <br>
 different reactions. Once the parents lose faith in the police or <br>
 prosecutor and begin to interrogate their own children and conduct <br>
 their own investigation, the case may be lost forever. Parents from <br>
 one case communicate the results of their "investigation" with each <br>
 other, and some have even contacted the parents in other cases. Such <br>
 parental activity is an obvious source of potential contamination.<br>
 <br>
 Parents must be made to understand that their children's credibility <br>
 will be jeopardized when and if the information obtained turns out <br>
 to be unsubstantiated or false. To minimize this problem, within the <br>
 limits of the law and without jeopardizing investigative techniques, <br>
 parents must be told on a regular basis how the case is progressing.<br>
 Parents can also be assigned constructive things to do (e.g. <br>
 lobbying for new legislation, working on awareness and prevention <br>
 programs) in order to channel their energy, concern, and "guilt".<br>
 <br>
 -- g. DEVELOP A CONTINGENCY PLAN.<br>
 <br>
 If a department waits until actually confronted with a case before a <br>
 response is developed, it may be too late. In cases involving <br>
 ongoing abuse of children, departments must respond quickly, and <br>
 this requires advanced planning. There are added problems for small- <br>
 to medium-sized departments with limited personnel and resources. <br>
 Effective investigation of these cases requires planning, <br>
 identification of resources, and, in many cases, mutual aid <br>
 agreements between agencies. The U.S. Department of Defense has <br>
 conducted specialized training and has developed such a plan for <br>
 child sex ring cases involving military facilities and personnel. <br>
 Once a case is contaminated and out of control, I have little advice <br>
 on how to salvage what may once have been a prosecutable criminal <br>
 violation. A few of these cases have even been lost on appeal after <br>
 a conviction because of contamination problems.<br>
 <br>
 -- h. MULTIDISCIPLINARY TASK FORCES.<br>
 <br>
 Sergeant Beth Dickinson, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, <br>
 was the chairperson of the Multi-Victim, Multi-Suspect Child Sexual <br>
 Abuse Subcommittee. Sergeant Dickinson states (personal <br>
 communication, Nov. 1989):<br>
 <br>
 "One of the biggest obstacles for investigators to overcome is the <br>
 reluctance of law enforcement administrators to commit sufficient <br>
 resources early on to an investigation that has the potential to be <br>
 a multidimensional child sex ring. It is important to get in and get <br>
 on top of the investigation in a timely manner - to get it <br>
 investigated in a timely manner in order to assess the risk to <br>
 children and to avoid hysteria, media sensationalism, and cross-<br>
 contamination of information. The team approach reduces stress on <br>
 individual investigators, allowing for peer support and minimizing <br>
 feelings of being overwhelmed."<br>
 <br>
 The team approach and working together does not mean, however, that <br>
 each discipline forgets its role and starts doing the other's job.<br>
 <br>
 -- i. SUMMARY.<br>
 <br>
 The investigation of child sex rings can be difficult and time <br>
 consuming. The likelihood, however, of a great deal of corroborative <br>
 evidence in a multivictim/multioffender case increases the chances <br>
 of a successful prosecution if the crime occurred. Because there is <br>
 still so much we do not know or understand about the dynamics of <br>
 multidimensional child sex rings, investigative techniques are less <br>
 certain. Each new case must be carefully evaluated in order to <br>
 improve investigative procedures.<br>
 <br>
 Because mental health professionals seem to be unable to determine, <br>
 with any degree of certainty, the accuracy of victim statements in <br>
 these cases, law enforcement must proceed using the corroboration <br>
 process. If some of what the victim describes is accurate, some <br>
 misperceived, some distorted, and some contaminated, what is the <br>
 jury supposed to believe? Until mental health professionals can come <br>
 up with better answers, the jury should be asked to believe what the <br>
 *investigation* can corroborate. Even if only a portion of what <br>
 these victims allege is factual, that may still constitute <br>
 significant criminal activity. <br>
 <br>
 10. CONCLUSION.<br>
 <br>
 There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why <br>
 victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true. The first <br>
 step in finding those answers is to admit the possibility that some <br>
 of what the victims describe may not have happened. Some experts <br>
 seem unwilling to even consider this. Most of these victims are also <br>
 probably not lying and have come to believe that which they are <br>
 alleging actually happened. There are alternative explanations for <br>
 why people who never met each other can tell the same story.<br>
 <br>
 I believe that there is a middle ground - a continuum of possible <br>
 activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, <br>
 some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or <br>
 symbolic, and some may be "contaminated" or false. The problem and <br>
 challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is <br>
 which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe <br>
 that the majority of victims alleging "ritual" abuse are in fact <br>
 victims of some form of abuse or trauma. That abuse or trauma may or <br>
 may not be criminal in nature. After a lengthy discussion about <br>
 various alternative explanations and the continuum of possible <br>
 activity, one mother told me that for the first time since the <br>
 victimization of her young son she felt a little better. She had <br>
 thought her only choices were that either her son was a pathological <br>
 liar or, on the other hand, she lived in a community controlled by <br>
 satanists.<br>
 <br>
 Law enforcement has the obvious problem of attempting to determine <br>
 what actually happened for criminal justice purposes. Therapists, <br>
 however, might also be interested in what really happened in order <br>
 to properly evaluate and treat their patients. How and when to <br>
 confront patients with skepticism is a difficult and sensitive <br>
 problem for therapists.<br>
 <br>
 Any professional evaluating victims' allegations of "ritual" abuse <br>
 cannot ignore or routinely dismiss the lack of physical evidence (no <br>
 bodies or physical evidence left by violent murders); the difficulty <br>
 in successfully committing a large-scale conspiracy crime (the more <br>
 people involved in any crime conspiracy, the harder it is to get <br>
 away with it); and human nature (intragroup conflicts resulting in <br>
 individual self-serving disclosures are likely to occur in any group <br>
 involved in organized kidnapping, baby breeding, and human <br>
 sacrifice). If and when members of a destructive cult commit <br>
 murders, they are bound to make mistakes, leave evidence, and <br>
 eventually make admissions in order to brag about their crimes or to <br>
 reduce their legal liability. The discovery of the murders in <br>
 Matamoros, Mexico in 1989 and the results of the subsequent <br>
 investigation are good examples of these dynamics.<br>
 <br>
 Overzealous intervenors must accept the fact that some of their <br>
 well-intentioned activity is contaminating and damaging the <br>
 prosecutive potential of the cases where criminal acts did occur. We <br>
 must all (i.e., the media, churches, therapists, victim advocates, <br>
 law enforcement, and the general public) ask ourselves if we have <br>
 created an environment where victims are rewarded, listened to, <br>
 comforted, and forgiven in direct proportion to the severity of <br>
 their abuse. Are we encouraging needy or traumatized individuals to <br>
 tell more and more outrageous tales of their victimization? Are we <br>
 making up for centuries of denial by now blindly accepting any <br>
 allegation of child abuse no matter how absurd or unlikely? Are we <br>
 increasing the likelihood that rebellious, antisocial, or attention-<br>
 seeking individuals will gravitate toward "satanism" by publicizing <br>
 it and overreacting to it? The overreaction to the problem can be <br>
 worse than the problem.<br>
 <br>
 The amount of "ritual" child abuse going on in this country depends <br>
 on how you define the term. One documented example of what I might <br>
 call "ritual" child abuse was the horror chronicled in the book _A<br>
 Death in White Bear Lake_ (Siegal, 1990). The abuse in this case, <br>
 however, had little to do with anyone's spiritual belief system. <br>
 There are many children in the United States who, starting early in <br>
 their lives, are severely psychologically, physically, and sexually <br>
 traumatized by angry, sadistic parents or other adults. Such abuse, <br>
 however, is not perpetrated only or primarily by satanists. The <br>
 statistical odds are that such abusers are members of mainstream <br>
 religions. If 99.9% of satanists and 0.1% of Christians abuse <br>
 children as part of their spiritual belief system, that still means <br>
 that the vast majority of children so abused were abused by <br>
 Christians.<br>
 <br>
 Until hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, the public should <br>
 not be frightened into believing that babies are being bred and <br>
 eaten, that 50,000 missing children are being murdered in human <br>
 sacrifices, or that satanists are taking over America's day care <br>
 centers or institutions. No one can prove with absolute certainty <br>
 that such activity has *not* occurred. The burden of proof, however, <br>
 as it would be in a criminal prosecution, is on those who claim that <br>
 it has occurred.<br>
 <br>
 The explanation that the satanists are too organized and law <br>
 enforcement is too incompetent only goes so far in explaining the <br>
 lack of evidence. For at least eight years American law enforcement <br>
 has been aggressively investigating the allegations of victims of <br>
 ritual abuse. There is little or no evidence for the portion of <br>
 their allegations that deals with large-scale baby breeding, human <br>
 sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies. Now it is up to <br>
 mental health professionals, not law enforcement, to explain why <br>
 victims are alleging things that don't seem to have happened. <br>
 Professionals in this field must accept the fact that there is still <br>
 much we do not know about the sexual victimization of children, and <br>
 that this area desperately needs study and research by rational, <br>
 objective social scientists.<br>
 <br>
 If the guilty are to be successfully prosecuted, if the innocent are <br>
 to be exonerated, and if the victims are to be protected and <br>
 treated, better methods to evaluate and explain allegations of <br>
 "ritual" child abuse must be developed or identified. Until this is <br>
 done, the controversy will continue to cast a shadow over and fuel <br>
 the backlash against the validity and reality of child sexual abuse. <br>

 12. SUGGESTED READING.<br>
 <br>
 -- a. Cooper, John Charles, _The Black Mask: Satanism in America <br>
 Today_. Old Tappen, N.J.: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1990.<br>
 <br>
 Probably the best of the large number of books available primarily <br>
 in Christian bookstores and written from the Christian perspective. <br>
 This one, however, is written without the hysteria and <br>
 sensationalism of most. Recommended for investigators who want <br>
 information from this perspective.<br>
 <br>
 -- b. Hicks, Robert D., _In Pursuit of Satan: The Police and the <br>
 Occult_. Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1991.<br>
 <br>
 Undoubtedly the best book written to date on the topic of satanism <br>
 and the occult from the law enforcement perspective. Robert D. Hicks <br>
 is a former police officer who is currently employed as a criminal <br>
 justice analyst for the state of Virginia. Must reading for any <br>
 criminal justice professional involved in this issue. Unfortunately, <br>
 in the chapter on "Satanic Abuse of Children", the author appears to <br>
 have been overly influenced by extreme skeptics with minimal or <br>
 questionable credentials in this area. The book is easy to read, <br>
 logical, and highly recomended.
