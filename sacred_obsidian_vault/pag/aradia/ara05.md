 <p>Diana was the first created before all creation; in her were all things; out of herself, the first darkness, she divided herself; into darkness and light she was divided. Lucifer, her brother and son, herself and her other half, was the light.</p> 
 <p>And when <i>Diana</i> saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn.</p> 
 <p>But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light which files into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat.</p> 
 <p>Then <i>Diana</i> went to the fathers of the Beginning, to the mothers, the spirits who were before the first spirit, and lamented unto them that she could not prevail with Lucifer. And they praised her for her courage, they told her that to rise she must fall; to become the chief of goddesses she must become a mortal.</p> 
 <p>And in the ages, in the course of time, when the world was made, <i>Diana</i> went on earth, as did Lucifer,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p> 
 <p>who had fallen, and <i>Diana</i> taught magic and sorcery, whence came witches and fairies and goblins--all that is like man, yet not mortal.</p> 
 <p>And it came thus that <i>Diana</i> took the form of a cat. Her brother had a cat whom he loved beyond all creatures, and it slept every night on his bed, a cat beautiful beyond all other creatures, a fairy: he did not know it.</p> <i>
 </i><p>Diana prevailed with the cat to change forms with her, so she lay with her brother, and in the darkness assumed her own form, and so by Lucifer became the mother of Aradia. But when in the morning he found that he lay by his sister, and that light had been conquered by darkness, Lucifer was extremely angry; but <i>Diana</i> sang to him a spell, a song of power, and he was silent, the song of the night which soothes to sleep; he could say nothing. So <i>Diana</i> with her wiles of witchcraft so charmed him that he yielded to her love. This was the first fascination, she hummed the song, it was as the buzzing of bees (or a top spinning round), a spinning-wheel spinning life. She spun the lives of all men; all things were spun from the wheel of <i>Diana</i>. Lucifer turned the wheel.</p> <i>
 </i><p>Diana was not known to the witches and spirits, the fairies and elves who dwell in desert place, the goblins, as their mother; she hid herself in humility and was a mortal, but by her will she rose again above all. She had such passion for witchcraft, and became so powerful therein, that her greatness could not be hidden.</p> 
 <p>And thus it came to pass one night, at the meeting</p> 
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a></p> 
 <p>of all the sorceresses and fairies, she declared that she would darken the heavens and turn all the stars into mice.</p> 
 <p>All those who were present said--</p> 
 <p>"If thou canst do such a strange thing, having risen to such power, thou shalt be our queen."</p> 
 <p>Diana went into the street; she took the bladder of an ox and a piece of witch-money, which has an edge like a knife--with such money witches cut the earth from men's foot-tracks--and she cut the earth, and with it and many mice she filled the bladder, and blew into the bladder till it burst.</p> 
 <p>And there came a great marvel, for the earth which was in the bladder became the round heaven above, and for three days there was a great rain; the mice became stars or rain. And having made the heaven and the stars and the rain, <i>Diana</i> became Queen of the Witches; she was the cat who ruled the star-mice, the heaven and the rain.</p>
