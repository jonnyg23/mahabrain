 <center><h3>Notes on Margaret Murray</h3>
 <h4>by J.B. Hare</h4>
 <h5>Revised 1/17/2001</h5>

 <p>
 The books of Margaret Murray, which appear on the Internet for the first time
 here at sacred-texts, are ground zero for the modern pagan revival.
 Murray was one of the first to objectively review the evidence of the
 'burning times' witch trials to try to extract a kernel of truth.
 </p><p>
 If you are a Wiccan or Neopagan and want to understand the intellectual
 background of the movement, you need to be familiar with Murray's
 hypothesis.  It is important to review the documentary evidence (which
 she provides in great detail) for yourself, and draw your own conclusions.
 </p><p>
 Murray had an original approach to the witch trials;
 she decided to treat the testimony of the accused
 witches as ethnographic data.
 The ethnographic approach attempts to analyze the statements of the
 participants in a culture without prejudice, no matter how 
 how illogical or repulsive they may seem to one's own cultural viewpoint.
 Eventually Murray put together a framework which explained all of the
 witchcraft testimony in a very literal way.
 </p><p>
 The puzzle she was trying to solve was this: why, in an age when
 there was no mass communication, was the testimony of the witch trials
 so consistent? Time and again, the women and men accused of witchcraft
 confessed the same bizarre story: that they had signed a pact with
 the devil (in person) which was sealed by being tattooed,
 that they had participated in orgiastic nocturnal
 ceremonies where they had ritual sexual contact with the devil
 and other witches, that they had magical powers such as levitation, control
 over the fertility of humans, animals and fields,
 and so on, with certain specific details repeated
 across social and geographic boundaries
 <i>ad nauseum</i>. 
 </p><p>
 Until Murray, it was believed that this was the result of 
 answers to leading questions, extracted under torture by the witch hunters.
 It was believed that the witch hunters were 'on the same page'
 because they all used certain texts such as the '<a href="mm/index.htm">
 Malleus Malificarum</a>'
 ('the Hammer of Witches'), which is a perverse textbook describing
 how to ferret out witches.
 </p><p>
 Murray, upon examination of the evidence, concluded that
 as barbaric as the witch trials were, they were conducted
 according to long-established legal procedures;
 that there was material evidence, witnesses corroborated each other,
 and (perhaps most tellingly) that <i>not all confessions were
 extracted under torture</i>.  In some cases the accused testified
 willingly. They even went to their deaths unrepentantly
 insisting that their faith was the true religion and Christianity
 was false.
 </p><p>
 Murray's hypothesis was that there was an underground nature religion
 in Europe which originated in the Neolithic and survived well into
 the 18th Century.  This 'cult' (by which she simply means a belief system
 without any of the overtones which are popularly assigned to the word)
 had a cell structure like most underground movements.
 Murry believed that it was not a goddess religion,
 at least in the form it survived in during the modern era, although
 it was not totally male-dominated.
 </p><p>
 The witches worshiped a horned male god; however women were on a
 fairly equal footing with men and could rise to leadership roles. 
 Its leader dressed up in an animal costume; when
 the leader conducted ceremonies dressed in this costume
 he (or she) was treated as the incarnation of the horned god.
 In this form the leader of the coven was called
 called the 'Devil' by Christians, simply known as 'God' by the witches.
 So when a witch described meeting 'the Devil' in a confession,
 there was in actuality nothing supernatural happening; this simply meant
 that they were meeting the leader of their coven dressed up in an animal
 costume.
 </p><p>
 This is understandably a controversial proposal; it was so when Murray
 published her first book, the
 <a href="wcwe/index.htm">Witch Cult in Western Europe</a>,
 in 1921 (at a time when witchcraft was still illegal in Britain).
 To this day it still arouses fierce debate among the Neopagan intellegensia.
 </p><p>
 The most controversial aspect of Murray's hypothesis was
 that the witch cult performed rituals involving
 human sacrifice and cannibalism (particuarly of unbaptised infants).
 Naturally this is a very sensitive issue for modern
 Neopagans, whose practices most emphatically do <b>not</b> include 
 child abuse or human sacrifice, despite
 what a small but vocal group of (admittedly non-mainstream) Christians claim.
 For a debunking of the modern witch hunters
 see <a href="lanning.htm">this document</a>.
 </p><p>
 It is hardly neccesary to point out that the medieval Inquisition made
 identical accusations against Jews. Of course these accusations were
 and are absurd.  It is easy to confirm that there are no
 such practices by Jews and never have been.
 It is harder to confirm anything about this hypothetical underground
 witch cult, since we don't know specifically
 what they believed or practiced, other than second-hand information
 extracted mostly under duress.
 </p><p>
 It is known the ancient mystery religions
 (of which ancient Christianity is only one example)
 were based on a mythological cycle about
 the death and rebirth of a sun-god, as described in great detail in
 Sir James Frazers' the <a href="frazer/index.htm">Golden Bough</a>.
 This may have been enacted in an actual ritual at some point
 involving human sacrifice and cannibalism, which softened at a later
 date to a symbolic ceremony where proxies were used.
 It has also been pointed out that the rituals Murray
 described have similarities to ceremonies practised
 in other parts of the world (such as certain archaic Tantric rituals);
 this information was not available to Murray at the time, so it tends to
 support her.
 </p><p>
 Another controversial aspect of her thesis was her assertion
 that there were covens of witches very highly placed
 in the court of James VI, who tried to use magic and
 poison to assasinate the King;
 and advance the cause of their leader, Francis Stewart, 
 the Earl of Bothwell, who was a successor to the throne
 of Scotland, and potentially of England.
 Murray also hypothesized that Joan of Arc and her companion
 Giles de Rais were avatars of the witch god,
 ritually assasinated at the end of their reigns.
 </p><p>
 Murray's interpretation of history is not provable by the strict
 standards of the historian.
 She was highly selective about which historical evidence she utilized,
 which left her open for criticism by the academic establishment.
 </p><p>
 Murray also proposed that Fairies (and Elves, Dwarves, Brownies, etc.)
 were an actual subculture of (full-sized, if slightly
 stunted by their diet) human beings who lived secretively 
 in the British Isles, persecuted along with the witches.
 She speculated that the Fairies
 were a survival of a pastoralist neolithic culture.
 This culture survived, like the Romany (Gypsy) people, on the periphery,
 avoiding contact with the dominant culture.
 The fairy hills of legend were descriptions of their underground residences.
 They were later converted into the 'wee folk' of legend by Shakespeare,
 and the folklorists.
 One interesting aspect of her hypothesis about Faries is that
 they appeared to have a matriarchial culture.
 She presents incidental documentary evidence for the existence
 of a subterranian fairy race, but to
 my knowledge there is no actual material evidence.
 I am unaware of any other scholar, either in academia or
 Wiccan circles, who wholeheartedly
 endorses this hypothesis about the Fairies.
 </p><p>
 As for levitation, Murray noted that the witches used herbal ungents
 which contained known hallucinogens before 'flying', which would have
 produced ecstatic effects. In addition, the description of the
 witches' ceremonials included prolonged dancing.
 It is now known that <a href="../sha/index.htm">Shamans</a>
 used similar techniques, resulting in altered mental states
 including the sensation of flying.
 This portion of the hypothesis <i>has</i>
 been corroborated by other scholars.
 </p><p>
 As Margot Adler has pointed out in her contemporary book, Drawing Down the Moon,
 it may be Murray's age in addition to her role as
 an outspoken academic iconoclast which has caused her
 ideas to be treated with disdain to the present day.
 Murray was in her sixties when 'Witch Cult' was published.
 It might reasonably be argued that her gender has caused academia to
 ignore her as well.
 She responded to her noteriety with typical
 British reserve in the preface to her popularization
 God of the Witches,
 published in 1933:</p><p>
 </p><dir>
 <cite>
 "I have received many letters containing criticisms,
 some complimentary, some condemnatory,
 of that book [the Witch Cult in Western Europe]. If other correspondents 
 honour me with similar private criticisms of the present volume,
 I ask of them that they will sign their communications,
 even when the opinions they express are adverse.
 Anonymous letters, of which I received a number, reflect no credit 
 on their writers."
 </cite>
 </dir>
 <p>
 Indeed, we received a flurry of anxious emails after
 we posted this work at sacred-texts,
 several quite hostile, in specific, to Murray's
 Joan of Arc thesis.
 There are several other 'disgraced' authors'
 books enshrined here at
 <a href="../index.htm">sacred-texts</a>, <i>e.g.</i>
 <a href="../atl/ataw/index.htm">Atlantis,
 The Antidiluvian World</a>, none have which have elicited any
 <i>personal</i> hate mail (at least yet...).
 In any case, I have re-edited this essay based on some of
 the more rational feedback.
 </p>
 <p>
 This little ripple from one stone thrown into
 the pond of western thought has in time grown into a tidal wave.
 Selective portions of Murray's thesis were used as a basis for
 the Neopagan doctrine of Gerald Gardner.
 Other influences on Gardner and his circle
 were Robert Graves' The White Goddess
 and Charles Lelands' <a href="aradia.htm">Aradia</a>,
 which added a Goddess-oriented component.
 </p><p>
 Whether or not Murrays literalistic intepretation of the Witch trial evidence
 is correct, whether or not all Neopagans accept all of her views,
 Murrays' ideas are at the basis of modern Neopaganism, and as such
 deserve serious study, as well as a healthy dose of critical thinking.
