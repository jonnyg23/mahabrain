 <h1>The White Goddess by Robert Graves</h1>
 </center>
 <p>The White Goddess is a key book for modern Pagans
 and Wiccans. Subtitled 'A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth',
 Robert Graves investigates the links between poetry,
 mythology and the worship of the Goddess.
 The White Goddess had a profound influence on Gerald Gardner,
 the modern reinventor of Paganism.</p>
 
 <p>The White Goddess was one of the first widely available books
 which uncompromisingly advocated a Goddess-centered spirituality.
 It builds on Frazier's <a href="frazer/index.htm">Golden Bough</a>, but
 written from the point of view of a working poet
 struggling to reconcile the ancient crafts of poetry and
 mythology with the brutality of the twentieth century.
 Although it is a 'difficult book' it will also prove
 very rewarding.
 It does not provide details of ancient rituals or
 try to reinvent them for a modern context;
 rather it gives details on the profound
 links between ancient runic alphabets, 
 mysterious (and previously unexplained) Drudic and Bardic
 poetry and the Celtic lunar year.
 It bears the same relation to more practical books about
 Wicca as a theoretical physics textbook does to
 a users' manual for a computer.
 Reading the White Goddess will
 enhance your understanding of Wicca by giving you
 deep background on the craft.
