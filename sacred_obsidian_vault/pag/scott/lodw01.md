 <p>     Origin of the general Opinions respecting Demonology      among Mankind -- The Belief in the Immortality of the Soul is the main inducement      to credit its occasional re-appearance -- The Philosophical Objections      to the Apparition of an Abstract Spirit little understood by the Vulgar and      Ignorant -- The situations of excited Passion incident to Humanity,      which teach Men to wish or apprehend Supernatural Apparitions --  They      are often presented by the Sleeping Sense --  Story of Somnambulism      --  The Influence of Credulity contagious, so that Individuals will      trust the Evidence of others in despite of their own Senses --  Examples      from the "Historia Verdadera" of Bernal Dias del Castillo, and from the Works      of Patrick Walker --  The apparent Evidence of Intercourse with the      Supernatural World is sometimes owing to a depraved State of the bodily Organs --      Difference between this Disorder and Insanity, in which the Organs      retain their tone, though that of the Mind is lost --  Rebellion of      the Senses of a Lunatic against the current of his Reveries --  Narratives      of a contrary Nature, in which the Evidence of the Eyes overbore the Conviction      of the Understanding Example of a London Man of Pleasure --  Of Nicolai,      the German Bookseller and Philosopher --  Of a Patient of Dr. Gregory      --  Of an Eminent Scottish Lawyer, deceased --  Of this same fallacious      Disorder are other instances, which have but sudden and momentary endurance      --  Apparition of Maupertuis --  Of a late illustrious modern      Poet --  The Cases quoted chiefly relating to false Impressions on the    Visual Nerve, those upon the Ear next considered --  Delusions of the    Touch chiefly experienced in Sleep --  Delusions. of the Taste --    And of the Smelling --  Sum of the Argument.   
 </p><p> </p></blockquote> 
 <p>     You have asked of me, my dear friend, that I    should assist the "Family Library" with the history of a dark chapter in human    nature, which the increasing civilization of all well-instructed countries has    now almost blotted out, though the subject attracted no ordinary degree of consideration    in the older times of their history. 
 </p><p>     Among much reading of my earlier days, it is    no doubt true that I travelled a good deal in the twilight regions of superstitious    disquisitions. Many hours have I lost -- "I would their debt were less    !" --  in examining, old as well as more recent narratives of this character,    and even in looking into some of the criminal trials so frequent in early days,    upon a subject which our fathers considered as a matter of the last importance.    And, of late years, the very curious extracts published by Mr. Pitcairn, from    the Criminal Records of Scotland, are, besides their historical value, of a    nature so much calculated to illustrate the credulity of our ancestors on such    subjects, that, by perusing them, I have been induced more recently to recall    what I bad read and thought upon the subject at a former period. 
 </p><p>     As, however, my information is only miscellaneous,    and I make no pretensions, either to combat the systems of those by whom I am    anticipated in consideration of the subject, or to erect any new one of my own,    my purpose is, after a general account of Demonology and Witchcraft, to confine    myself to narratives of remarkable cases, and to the observations which naturally    and easily arise out of them; --  in the confidence that such a plan is,    at the present time of day, more likely to suit the pages of a popular miscellany,    than an attempt to reduce the contents of many hundred tomes, from the largest    to the smallest size, into an abridgement, which, however compressed, must remain    greatly too large for the reader's powers of patience.  A few general remarks on the nature of Demonology,    and the original cause of the almost universal belief in communication betwixt    mortals and beings of a power superior to themselves, and of a nature not to    be comprehended by human organs, are a necessary introduction to the subject. 
 </p><p>     The general, or, it may be termed, the universal    belief of the inhabitants of the earth, in the existence of spirits separated    from the encumbrance and incapacities of the body, is grounded on the consciousness    of the divinity that speaks in our bosoms, and demonstrates to all men, except    the few who are hardened to the celestial voice, that there is within us a portion    of the divine substance, which is not subject to the law of death and dissolution,    but which, when the body is no longer fit for its abode, shall seek its own    place, as a sentinel dismissed from his post. Unaided by revelation, it cannot    be hoped that mere earthly reason should be able to form any rational or precise    conjecture concerning the destination of the soul when parted from the body    ; but the conviction that such an indestructible essence exists, the belief    expressed by the poet in a different sense<i>, Non omnis moriar</i>, must infer    the existence of many millions of spirits who have not been annihilated, though    they have become invisible to mortals who still see, hear, and perceive, only    by means of the imperfect organs of humanity. Probability may lead some of the    most reflecting to anticipate a state of future rewards and punishments; as    those experienced in the education of the deaf and dumb find that their pupils,    even while cut off from all instruction by ordinary means, have been able to    farm, out of their own unassisted conjectures, some ideas of the existence of    a Deity, and of the distinction between the soul and body --  a circumstance    which proves how naturally these truths arise in the human mind. The principle    that they do so arise, being taught or communicated, leads to further conclusions. 
 </p><p>     These spirits, in a state of separate existence,    being  admitted to exist, are not, it may be supposed,    indifferent to the affairs of mortality, perhaps not incapable of influencing    them. It is true that, in a more advanced state of society, the philosopher    may challenge the possibility of a separate appearance of a disembodied spirit,    unless in the case of a direct miracle, to which, being a suspension of the    laws of nature, directly wrought by the Maker of these laws, for some express    purpose, no bound or restraint can possibly be assigned. But under this necessary    limitation and exception, philosophers might plausibly argue that, when the    soul is divorced from the body, it loses all those qualities which made it,    when clothed with a mortal shape, obvious to the organs of its fellow-men. The    abstract idea of a spirit certainly implies that it has neither substance, form,    shape, voice, or anything which can render its presence visible or sensible    to human faculties. But these sceptic doubts of philosophers on the possibility    of the appearance of such separated spirits, do not arise till a certain degree    of information has dawned upon a country, and even then only reach a very small    proportion of reflecting and better-informed members of society. To the multitude,    the indubitable fact, that so many millions of spirits exist around and even    amongst us, seems sufficient to support the belief that they are, in certain    instances at least, by some means or other, able to communicate with the world    of humanity. The more numerous part of mankind cannot form in their mind the    idea of the spirit of the deceased existing, without possessing or having the    power to assume the appearance which their acquaintance bore during his life,    and do not push their researches beyond this point. 
 </p><p>     Enthusiastic feelings of an impressive and solemn    nature occur both in private and public life, which seem to add ocular testimony    to an intercourse betwixt earth and the world beyond it. For example, the son    who has been lately deprived of his father feels a sudden crisis approach, in    which he is anxious to have recourse to his sagacious  advice --  or a bereaved husband earnestly    desires again to behold the form of which the grave has deprived him for ever    --  or, to use a darker yet very common instance, the wretched man who    has dipped his hand in his fellow-creature's blood, is haunted by the apprehension    that the phantom of the slain stands by the bedside of his murderer. In all    or any of these cases, who shall doubt that imagination, favoured by circumstances,    has power to summon up to the organ of sight, spectres which only exist in the    mind of those by whom their apparition seems to be witnessed? 
 </p><p>     If we add, that such a vision may take place    in the course of one of those lively dreams in which the patient, except in    respect to the single subject of one strong impression, is, or seems, sensible    of the real particulars of the scene around him, a state of slumber which often    occurs; if be is so far conscious, for example, as to know that he is lying    on his own bed, and surrounded by his own familiar furniture at the time when    the supposed apparition is manifested, it becomes almost in vain to argue with    the visionary against the reality of his dream, since the spectre, though itself    purely fanciful, is inserted amidst so many circumstances which he feels must    be true beyond the reach of doubt or question. That which is undeniably certain    becomes, in a manner, a warrant for the reality of the appearance to which doubt    would have been otherwise attached. And if any event, such as the death of the    person dreamt of, chances to take place, so as to correspond with the nature    and the time of the apparition, the coincidence, though one which must be frequent,    since our dreams usually refer to the accomplishment of that which haunts our    minds when awake, and often presage the most probable events, seems perfect,    and the chain of circumstances touching the evidence may not unreasonably be    considered as complete. Such a concatenation, we repeat, must frequently take    place, when it is considered of what stuff dreams are made --  how naturally    they turn upon those  who occupy our mind while awake, and, when a    soldier is exposed to death in battle, when a sailor is incurring the dangers    of the sea, when a beloved wife or relative is attacked by disease, how readily    our sleeping imagination rushes to the very point of alarm, which when waking    it had shuddered to anticipate. The number of instances in which such lively    dreams have been quoted, and both asserted and received as spiritual communications,    is very great at all periods; in ignorant times, where the natural cause of    dreaming is misapprehended and confused with an idea of mysticism, it is much    greater. Yet, perhaps, considering the many thousands of dreams which must,    night after night, pass through the imagination of individuals, the number of    coincidences between the vision and real event are fewer and less remarkable    than a fair calculation of chances would warrant us to expect. But in countries    where such presaging dreams are subjects of attention, the number of those which    seemed to be coupled with the corresponding issue, is large enough to spread    a very general belief of a positive communication betwixt the living and the    dead. 
 </p><p>     Somnambulism and other nocturnal deceptions frequently    lend their aid to the formation of such <i>phantasmata </i>as are formed in    this middle state, betwixt sleeping and waking. A most respectable person, whose    active life had been spent as master and part owner of a large merchant vessel    in the Lisbon trade, gave the writer an account of such an instance which came    under his observation. He was lying in the Tagus, when he was put to great anxiety    and alarm by the following incident and its consequences. One of his crew was    murdered by a Portuguese assassin, and a report arose that the ghost of the    slain man haunted the vessel. Sailors are generally superstitious, and those    of my friend's vessel became unwilling to remain on board the ship; and it was    probable they might desert rather then return to England with the ghost for    a passenger. To prevent so  great a calamity, the captain determined to examine    the story to the bottom. He soon found that, though all pretended to have seen    lights and heard noises, and so forth, the weight of the evidence lay upon the    statement of one of his own mates, an Irishman and a Catholic, which might increase    his tendency to superstition, but in other respects a veracious, honest, and    sensible person, whom Captain -- -had no reason to suspect would wilfully deceive    him. He affirmed to Captain S -- -with the deepest obtestations, that the spectre    of the murdered man appeared to him almost nightly, took him from his place    in the vessel, and, according to his own expression, worried his life out. He    made these communications with a degree of horror which intimated the reality    of his distress and apprehensions. The captain, without any argument at the    time, privately resolved to watch the motions of the ghost-seer in the night;    whether alone, or with a witness, I have forgotten. As the ship bell struck    twelve, the sleeper started up, with a ghastly and disturbed countenance, and    lighting a candle, proceeded to the galley or cook-room of the vessel. He sate    down with his eyes open, staring before him as on some terrible object which    he beheld with horror, yet from which he could not withhold his eyes. After    a short space be arose, took up a tin can or decanter, filled it with water,    muttering to himself all the while --  mixed salt in the water, and sprinkled    it about the galley. Finally, he sighed deeply, like one relieved from a heavy    burden, and, returning to his hammock, slept soundly. In the next morning the    haunted man told the usual precise story of his apparition, with the additional    circumstances, that the ghost had led him to the galley, but that be had fortunately,    he knew not how, obtained possession of some holy water, and succeeded in getting    rid of his unwelcome visitor. The visionary was then informed of the real transactions    of the night, with so many particulars as to satisfy him he had been the dupe    of his imagination; be acquiesced in his commander's reasoning,  and the dream, as often happens in these cases,    returned no more after its imposture had been detected, In this case, we find    the excited imagination acting upon the half-waking senses, which were intelligent    enough for the purpose of making him sensible where he was, but not sufficiently    so to judge truly of the objects before him. 
 </p><p>     But it is not only private life alone, or that    tenor of thought which has been depressed into melancholy by gloomy anticipations    respecting the future, which disposes the mind to mid-day fantasies, or to nightly    apparitions --  a state of eager anxiety, or excited exertion, is equally    favourable to the indulgence of such supernatural communications. The anticipation    of a dubious battle, with all the doubt and uncertainty of its event, and the    conviction that it must involve his own fate and that of his country, was powerful    enough to conjure up to the anxious eye of Brutus the spectre of his murdered    friend Caesar, respecting whose death he perhaps thought himself less justified    than at the Ides of March, since, instead of having achieved the freedom of    Rome, the event had only been the renewal of civil wars, and the issue might    appear most likely to conclude in the total subjection of liberty. It is not    miraculous that the masculine spirit of Marcus Brutus, surrounded by darkness    and solitude, distracted probably by recollection of the kindness and favour    of the great individual whom he bad put to death to avenge the wrongs of his    country, though by the slaughter of his own friend, should at length place before    his eyes in person the appearance which termed itself his evil genius, and promised    again to meet him at Philippi. Brutus own intentions, and his knowledge of the    military art, had probably long since assured him that the decision of the civil    war must take place at or near that place; and, allowing that his own imagination    supplied that part of his dialogue with the spectre, there is nothing else which    might not be fashioned in a vivid dream or a waking reverie, approaching, in    absorbing and engrossing character, the  usual matter of which dreams consist. That Brutus,    well acquainted with the opinions of the Platonists, should be disposed to receive    without doubt the idea that he had seen a real apparition, and was not likely    to scrutinize very minutely the supposed vision, may be naturally conceived;    and it is also natural to think, that although no one saw the figure but himself,    his contemporaries were little disposed to examine the testimony of a man so    eminent, by the strict rules of cross-examination and conflicting evidence,    which they might have thought applicable to another person, and a less dignified    occasion. 
 </p><p>     Even in the field of death, and amid the mortal    tug of combat itself, strong belief has wrought the same wonder, which we have    hitherto mentioned as occurring in solitude and amid darkness; and those who    were themselves on the verge of the world of spirits, or employed in dispatching    others to these gloomy regions, conceived they beheld the apparitions of those    beings whom their national mythology associated with such scenes. In such moments    of undecided battle, amid the violence, hurry, and confusion of ideas incident    to the situation, the ancients supposed that they saw their deities, Castor    and Pollux, fighting in the van for their encouragement; the heathen Scandinavian    beheld the Choosers of the slain; and the Catholics were no less easily led    to recognize the warlike Saint George or Saint James in the very front of the    strife, showing them the way to conquest. Such apparitions being generally visible    to a multitude, have in all times been supported by the greatest strength of    testimony. When the common feeling of danger, and the animating burst of enthusiasm,    act on the feelings of many men at once, their minds hold a natural correspondence    with each other, as it is said is the case with stringed instruments tuned to    the same pitch, of which, when one is played, the chords of the others are supposed    to vibrate in unison with the tones produced. If an artful or enthusiastic individual    exclaims, in the heat of action, that he perceives   an apparition of the romantic kind which has    been intimated, his companions catch at the idea with emulation, and most are    willing to sacrifice the conviction of their own senses, rather than allow that    they did not witness the same favourable emblem, from which all draw confidence    and hope. One warrior catches the idea from another; all are alike eager to    acknowledge the present miracle, and the battle is won before the mistake is    discovered.' In such cases, the number of persons present, which would otherwise    lead to detection of the fallacy, becomes the means of strengthening it. 
 </p><p>     Of this disposition, to see as much of the supernatural    as is seen by others around, or, in other words, to trust to the eyes of others    rather than to our own, we may take the liberty to quote two remarkable instances. 
 </p><p>     The first is from the " Historia Verdadera" of    Don Bernal Dias del Castillo, one of the companions of the celebrated Cortez    in his Mexican conquest. After having given an account of a great victory over    extreme odds, he mentions the report inserted in the contemporary Chronicle    of Gomara, that Saint Iago had appeared on a white horse in van of the combat,    and led on his beloved Spaniards to victory. It is very curious to observe the    Castilian cavalier's internal conviction that the rumour arose out of a mistake,    the cause of which he explains from his own observation; whilst, at the same    time, he does not venture to disown the miracle. The honest Conquestador owns    that he himself did not see this animating vision ; nay, that he beheld an individual    cavalier, named Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut horse, and fighting    strenuously in the very place where Saint James is said to have appeared. But    instead of proceeding to draw the necessary inference, the devout Conquestador    exclaims -- " Sinner that I am, what am I that I should have beheld the    blessed apostle!" 
 </p><p>     The other instance of the infectious character    of superstition occurs in a Scottish book, and there can be little  doubt that it refers, in its first origin, to    some uncommon appearance of the aurora borealis, or the northern lights, which    do not appear to have been seen in Scotland so frequently as to be accounted    a common and familiar atmospherical phenomenon, until the beginning of the eighteenth    century. The passage is striking and curious, for the narrator, Peter Walker,    though an enthusiast, was a man of credit, and does not even affect to have    seen the wonders, the reality of which he unscrupulously adopts on the testimony    of others, to whose eyes he trusted rather than to his own. The conversion    of the sceptical gentleman of whom he speaks is highly illustrative of popular    credulity carried away into enthusiasm, or into imposture, by the evidence of    those around, and at once shows the imperfection of such a general testimony,    and the ease with which it is procured, since the general excitement of the    moment impels even the more cold-blooded and judicious persons present to catch    up the ideas and echo the exclamations of the majority, who, from the first,    had considered the heavenly phenomenon as a supernatural weapon-schaw, held    for the purpose of a sign and warning of civil wars to come. 
 </p><p>     " In the year 1686, in the months of June and    July," says the honest chronicler, " many yet alive can witness that about the    Crossford Boat, two miles beneath Lanark, especially at the Mains, on the water    of Clyde, many people gathered together for several afternoons, where there    were showers of bonnets, bats, guns, and swords, which covered the trees and    the ground; companies of men in arms marching in order upon the waterside; companies    meeting companies, going all through other, and then all falling to the ground    and disappearing; other companies immediately appeared, marching the same way.    I went there three afternoons together, and, as I observed, there were two-thirds    of the people that were together saw, and a third that saw not; and, <i>though    I could see nothing,</i> there was such a fright and trembling on those that    did see, that was discernible to all  from those that saw not. There was a gentleman    standing next to me who spoke as too many gentlemen and others speak, who said,    'A pack of damned witches and warlocks that have the second sight! the devil    ha't do I see;' and immediately there was a discernible change in his countenance.    With as much fear and trembling as any woman I saw there, he called out, ' All    you that do not see, say nothing; for I persuade you it is matter of fact, and    discernible to all that is not stone-blind.' And those who did see told what    works (<i>i.e.</i>, locks) the guns had, and their length and wideness, and    what handles the swords had, whether small or three-barr'd, or Highland guards,    and the closing knots of the bonnets, black or blue; and those who did see them    there, whenever they went abroad, saw a bonnet and a sword drop in the way." <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> 
 </p><p>     This singular phenomenon, in which a multitude    believed, although only two-thirds of them saw what must, if real, have been    equally obvious to all, may be compared with the exploit of the humourist, who    planted himself in an attitude of astonishment, with his eyes riveted on the    well-known bronze lion that graces the front of Northumberland House in the    Strand, and having attracted the attention of those who looked at him by muttering,    " By heaven it wags! it wags again !" contrived in a few minutes to blockade    the whole street with an immense crowd, some conceiving that they had absolutely    seen the lion of Percy wag his tail, others expecting to witness the same phenomenon. 
 </p><p>     On such occasions as we have hitherto mentioned,    we have supposed that the ghost-seer has been in full possession of his ordinary    powers of perception, unless in the case of dreamers, in whom they may have    been obscured by temporary slumber, and the possibility of correcting vagaries    of  the imagination rendered more difficult by want    of the ordinary appeal to the evidence of the bodily senses. In other respects    their blood beat temperately, they possessed the ordinary capacity of ascertaining    the truth or discerning the falsehood of external appearances by an appeal to    the organ of sight. Unfortunately, however, as is now universally known and    admitted, there certainly exists more than one disorder known to professional    men of which one important symptom is a disposition to see apparitions. 
 </p><p>     This frightful disorder is not properly insanity,    although it is somewhat allied to that most horrible of maladies, and may, in    many constitutions, be the means of bringing it oil, and although such hallucinations    are proper to both. The difference I conceive to be that, in cases of insanity,    the mind of the patient is principally affected, while the senses, or organic    system, offer in vain to the lunatic their decided testimony against the fantasy    of a deranged imagination. Perhaps the nature of this collision --  between    a disturbed imagination and organs of sense possessed of their usual accuracy    --  cannot be better described than in the embarrassment expressed by    an insane patient confined in the Infirmary of Edinburgh. The poor man's malady    had taken a gay turn. The house, in his idea, was his own, and he contrived    to account for all that seemed inconsistent with his imaginary right of property    --  there were many patients in it, but that was owing to the benevolence    of his nature, which made him love to see the relief of distress. He went little,    or rather never abroad --  but then his habits were of a domestic and    rather sedentary character. He did not see much company --  but he daily    received visits from the first characters in the renowned medical school of    this city, and he could not therefore be much in want of society. With so many    supposed comforts around him --  with so many visions of wealth and splendour    --  one thing alone disturbed the peace of the poor optimist, and would    indeed have confounded most <i>bons vivants. </i>" He was curious," he said,    "in  his table, choice in his selection of cooks,    bad every day a dinner of three regular courses and a dessert ; and yet, somehow    or other, everything he eat <i>tasted of porridge." </i>This dilemma could be    no great wonder to the friend to whom the poor patient communicated it, who    knew the lunatic eat nothing but this simple aliment at any of his meals. The    case was obvious. The disease lay in the extreme vivacity of the patient's imagination,    deluded in other, instances, yet not absolutely powerful enough to contend with    the honest evidence of his stomach and palate, which, like Lord Peter's brethren    in " The Tale of a Tub," were indignant at the attempt to impose boiled oatmeal    upon them, instead of such a banquet as Ude would have displayed when peers    were to partake of it. Here, therefore, is one instance of actual insanity,    in which the sense of taste controlled and attempted to restrain the ideal hypothesis    adopted by a deranged imagination. But the disorder to which I previously alluded    is entirely of a bodily character, and consists principally in a disease of    the visual organs, which present to the patient a set of spectres or appearances    which have no actual existence. It is a disease of the same nature which renders    many men incapable of distinguishing colours; only the patients go a step further,    and pervert the external form of objects. In their case, therefore, contrary    to that of the maniac, it is not the mind, or rather the imagination, which    imposes upon and overpowers the evidence of the senses, but the sense of seeing    (or bearing) which betrays its duty and conveys false ideas to a sane intellect 
 </p><p>     More than one learned physician, who have given    their attestations to the existence of this most distressing complaint, have    agreed that it actually occurs, and is occasioned by different causes. The most    frequent source of the malady is in the dissipated and intemperate habits of    those who, by a continued series of intoxication, become subject to what is    popularly called the Blue Devils, instances  of which mental disorder may be known to most    who have lived for any period of their lives in society where hard drinking    was a common vice. The joyous visions suggested, by intoxication when the habit    is first acquired, in time disappear, and are supplied by frightful impressions    and scenes, which destroy the tranquillity of the unhappy debauchee. Apparitions    of the most unpleasant appearance are his companions in solitude, and intrude    even upon his hours of society: and when by an alteration of habits, the mind    is cleared of these frightful ideas, it requires but the slightest renewal of    the association to bring back the full tide of misery upon the repentant libertine, 
 </p><p>     Of this the following instance was told to the    author by a gentleman connected with the sufferer. A young man of fortune, who    had led what is called so gay a life as considerably to injure both his health    and fortune, was at length obliged to consult the physician upon the means of    restoring, at least, the former. One of his principal complaints was the frequent    presence of a set of apparitions, resembling a band of figures dressed in green,    who performed in his drawing-room a singular dance, to which he was compelled    to bear witness, though he knew, to his great annoyance, that the whole <i>corps    de ballet </i>existed only in his own imagination. His physician immediately    informed him that he had lived upon town too long and too fast not to require    an exchange to a more healthy and natural course of life. He therefore prescribed    a gentle course of medicine, but earnestly recommended to his patient to retire    to his own house in the country, observe a temperate diet and early hours, practising    regular exercise, on the same principle avoiding fatigue, and assured him that    by doing so he might bid adieu to black spirits and white, blue, green, and    grey, with all their trumpery. The patient observed the advice, and prospered.    His physician, after the interval of a month, received a grateful letter from    him, acknowledging the success of his regimen. The greens goblins had disappeared,  and with them the unpleasant train of emotions    to which their visits had given rise, and the patient had ordered his town-house    to be disfurnished and sold, while the furniture was to be sent down to his    residence in the country, where he was determined in future to spend his life,    without exposing himself to the temptations of town. One would have supposed    this a well-devised scheme for health. But, alas ! no sooner had the furniture    of the London drawing-room been placed in order in the gallery of the old manor-house,    than the former delusion returned in full force: the green <i>figurantes</i>,    whom the patient's depraved imagination had so long associated with these moveables,    came capering and frisking to accompany them, exclaiming with great glee, as    if the sufferer should have been rejoiced to see them, " Here we all are --    here we all are !" The visionary, if I recollect right, was so much shocked    at their appearance, that he retired abroad, in despair that any part of Britain    could shelter him from the daily persecution of this domestic ballet. 
 </p><p>     There is reason to believe that such cases are    numerous, and that they may perhaps arise not only from the debility of stomach    brought on by excess in wine or spirits, which derangement often sensibly affects    the eyes and sense of sight, but also because the mind becomes habitually predominated    over by a train of fantastic visions, the consequence of frequent intoxication;    and is thus, like a dislocated joint, apt again to go wrong, even when a different    cause occasions the derangement. 
 </p><p>     It is easy to be supposed that habitual excitement    by means of any other intoxicating drug, as opium, or its various substitutes,    must expose those who practise the dangerous custom to the same inconvenience.    Very frequent use of the nitrous oxide which affects the senses so strongly,    and produces a short but singular state of ecstasy, would probably be found    to occasion this species of disorder. But there are many other causes which    medical men   find attended with the same symptom, of embodying    before the eyes of a patient imaginary illusions which are visible to no one    else. This persecution of spectral deceptions is also found to exist when no    excesses of the patient can be alleged as the cause, owing, doubtless, to a    deranged state of the blood or nervous system. 
 </p><p>     The learned and acute Dr. Ferriar of Manchester    was the first who brought before the English public the leading case, as it    may be called, in this department, namely, that of Mons. Nicolai, the celebrated    bookseller of Berlin. This gentleman was not a man merely of books, but of letters,    and had the moral courage to lay before the Philosophical Society of Berlin    an account of his own sufferings, from having been, by disease, subjected to    a series of spectral illusions. The leading circumstances of this case may be    stated very shortly, as it has been repeatedly before the public, and is insisted    on by Dr. Ferriar, Dr. Hibbert, and others who have assumed Demonology as a    subject. Nicolai traces his illness remotely to a series of disagreeable incidents    which had happened to him in the beginning of the year 1791. The depression    of spirits which was occasioned by these unpleasant occurrences, was aided by    the consequences of neglecting a course of periodical bleeding which he had    been accustomed to observe. This state of health brought on the disposition    to see <i>phantasmata</i>, who visited, or it may be more properly said frequented,    the apartments of the learned bookseller, presenting crowds of persons who moved    and acted before him, nay, even spoke to and addressed him. These phantoms afforded    nothing unpleasant to the imagination of the visionary either in sight or expression,    and the patient was possessed of too much firmness to be otherwise affected    by their presence than with a species of curiosity, as he remained convinced    from the beginning to the end of the disorder, that these singular effects were    merely symptoms of the state of his health, and did not in any other respect    regard them as   a subject of apprehension. After a certain time,    and some use of medicine, the phantoms became less distinct in their outline,    less vivid in their colouring, faded, as it were, on the eye of the patient,    and at length totally disappeared. 
 </p><p>     The case of Nicolai has unquestionably been that    of many whose love of science has not been able to overcome their natural reluctance    to communicate to the public the particulars attending the visitation of a disease    so peculiar. That such illnesses have been experienced, and have ended fatally,    there can be no doubt; though it is by no means to be inferred, that the symptom    of importance to our present discussion has, on all occasions, been produced    from the same identical cause. 
 </p><p>     Dr. Hibbert, who has most ingeniously, as well    as philosophically, handled this subject, has treated it also in a medical point    of view, with science to which we make no pretence, and a precision of detail    to which our superficial investigation affords us no room for extending ourselves. 
 </p><p>      The visitation of spectral phenomena is described    by this learned gentleman as incidental to sundry complaints; and he mentions,    in particular, that the symptom occurs not only in plethora, as in the case    of the learned Prussian we have just mentioned, but is a frequent hectic symptom    -- often an associate of febrile and inflammatory disorders-frequently accompanying    inflammation of the brain-a concomitant also of highly excited nervous irritability    -- equally connected with hypochondria -- and finally united in some cases with    gout, and in others with the effects of excitation produced by several gases.    In all these cases there seems to be a morbid degree of sensibility, with which    this symptom is ready to ally itself, and which, though inaccurate as a medical    definition, may be held sufficiently descriptive of one character of the various    kinds of disorder with which this painful symptom may be found allied.  
 </p><p>      A very singular and interesting illustration    of such combinations as Dr. Hibbert has recorded of the spectral illusion  with an actual disorder, and that of a dangerous    kind, was frequently related in society by the late learned and accomplished    Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh, and sometimes, I believe, quoted by him in his lectures.    The narrative, to the author's best recollection, was as follows: -- A patient    of Dr. Gregory, a person, it is understood, of some rank, having requested the    doctor's advice, made the following extraordinary statement of his complaint.    "I am in the habit," he said, " of dining at five, and exactly as the hour of    six arrives I am subjected to the following painful visitation. The door of    the room, even when I have been weak enough to bolt it, which I have sometimes    done, flies wide open; an old hag, like one of those who haunted the heath of    Forres, enters with a frowning and incensed countenance, comes straight up to    me with every demonstration of spite and indignation which could characterize    her who haunted the merchant Abudah in the Oriental tale; she rushes upon me,    says something, but so hastily that I cannot discover the purport, and then    strikes me a severe blow with her staff. I fall from my chair in a swoon, which    is of longer or shorter endurance. To the recurrence of this apparition I am    daily subjected. And such is my new and singular complaint." The doctor immediately    asked whether his patient had invited any one to sit with him when he expected    such a visitation. He was answered in the negative. The nature of the complaint,    he said, was so singular, it was so likely to be imputed to fancy, or even to    mental derangement, that he bad shrunk from communicating the circumstance to    anyone. "Then," -- said the doctor, "with your permission, I will dine with    you to-day, <i>tete-a-tete</i>, and we will see if your malignant old woman    will venture to join our company." The patient accepted the proposal with hope    and gratitude, for he had expected ridicule rather than sympathy. They met at    dinner, and Dr. Gregory, who suspected some nervous disorder, exerted his powers    of conversation, well known to be of the most varied and  brilliant character, to keep the attention of    his host engaged, and prevent him from thinking on the approach of the fated    hour, to which he was accustomed to look forward with so much terror. He succeeded    in his purpose better than he bad hoped, The hour of six came almost unnoticed,    and it was hoped might pass away without any evil consequence; but it was scarce    a moment struck when the owner of the house exclaimed, in an alarmed voice,    "The hag comes again !" and dropped back in his chair in a swoon, in the way    he had himself described. The physician caused him to be let blood, and satisfied    himself that the periodical shocks of which his patient complained arose from    a tendency to apoplexy. 
 </p><p>     The phantom with the crutch was only a species    of machinery, such as that with which fancy is found to supply the disorder    called <i>Ephialtes</i>, or nightmare, or indeed any other external impression    upon our organs in sleep, which the patient's morbid imagination may introduce    into the dream preceding the swoon. In the nightmare an oppression and suffocation    is felt, and our fancy instantly conjures up a spectre to lie on our bosom.    In like manner it may be remarked, that any sudden noise which the slumberer    hears, without being actually awakened by it -- any casual touch of his person    occurring in the same manner -- becomes instantly adopted in his dream, and    accommodated to the tenor of the current train of thought, whatever that may    happen to be; and nothing is more remarkable than the rapidity with which imagination    supplies a complete explanation of the interruption, according to the previous    train of ideas expressed in the dream, even when scarce a moment of time is    allowed for that purpose. In dreaming, for example, of a duel, the external    sound becomes, in the twinkling of an eye, the discharge of the combatants'    pistols; -- is an orator haranguing in his sleep, the sound becomes the applause    of his supposed audience; -- is the dreamer wandering among supposed ruins,    the  noise is that of the fall of some part of the    mass. In short, an explanatory system is adopted during sleep with such extreme    rapidity, that supposing the intruding alarm to have been the first call of    some person to awaken the slumberer, the explanation, though requiring some    process of argument or deduction, is usually formed and perfect before the second    effort of the speaker has restored the dreamer to the waking world and its realities.    So rapid and intuitive is the succession of ideas in sleep, as to remind us    of the vision of the prophet Mahommed, in which he saw the whole wonders of    heaven and hell, though the jar of water which fell when his ecstasy commenced,    had not spilled its contents when he returned to ordinary existence. 
 </p><p>     A second, and equally remarkable instance, was    communicated to the author by the medical man under whose observation it fell,    but who was, of course, desirous to keep private the name of the hero of so    singular a history. Of the friend by whom the facts were attested I can only    say, that if I found myself at liberty to name him, the rank which he holds    in his profession, as well as his attainments in science and philosophy, form    an undisputed claim to the most implicit credit. 
 </p><p>     It was the fortune of this gentleman to be called    in to attend the illness of a person now long deceased, who in his lifetime    stood, as I understand, high in a particular department of the law, which often    placed the property of others at his discretion and control, and whose conduct,    therefore, being open to public observation, he had for many years borne the    character of a man of unusual steadiness, good sense, arid integrity. He was,    at the time of my friend's visits, confined principally to his sick-room, sometimes    to bed, yet occasionally attending to business, and exerting his mind, apparently    with all its usual strength and energy, to the conduct of important affairs    intrusted to him; nor did there, to a superficial observer, appear anything    in his conduct, while so engaged, that could argue vacillation  of intellect, or depression of mind. His outward    symptoms of malady argued no acute or alarming disease. But slowness of pulse,    absence of appetite, difficulty of digestion, and constant depression of spirits,    seemed to draw their origin from some hidden cause, which the patient was determined    to conceal. The deep gloom of the unfortunate gentleman -- the embarrassment,    which he could not conceal from his friendly physician -- the briefness and    obvious constraint with which he answered the interrogations of his medical    adviser, induced my friend to take other methods for prosecuting his inquiries.    He applied to the sufferer's family, to learn, if possible, the source of that    secret grief which was gnawing the heart and sucking the life-blood of his unfortunate    patient. The persons applied to, after conversing together previously, denied    all knowledge of any cause for the burden which obviously affected their relative.    So far as they knew -- and they thought they could hardly be deceived -- his    worldly affairs were prosperous; no family loss had occurred which could be    followed with such persevering distress; no entanglements of affection could    be supposed to apply to his age, and no sensation of severe remorse could be    consistent with his character. The medical gentleman had finally recourse to    serious argument with the invalid himself, and urged to him the folly of devoting    himself to a lingering and melancholy death, rather than tell the subject of    affliction which was thus wasting him. He specially pressed upon him the injury    which he was doing to his own character, by suffering it to be inferred that    the secret cause of his dejection and its consequences was something too scandalous    or flagitious to be made known, bequeathing in this manner to his family a suspected    and dishonoured name, and leaving a memory with which might be associated the    idea of guilt, which the criminal had died without confessing. The patient,    more moved by this species of appeal than by any which had yet been urged, expressed    his desire to speak out frankly to  Dr. -- . Every one else was removed, and the    door of the sick-room made secure, when he began his confession in the following    manner:--  
 </p><p>     " You cannot, my dear friend, be more conscious    than I, that I am in the course of dying under the oppression of the fatal disease    which consumes my vital powers; but neither can you understand the nature of    my complaint, and manner in which it acts upon me, nor, if you did, I fear,    could your zeal and skill avail to rid me of it." -- " It is possible," said    the physician, " that my skill may not equal my wish of serving you; yet medical    science has many resources, of which those unacquainted with its powers never    can form an estimate. But until you plainly tell me your symptoms of complaint,    it is impossible for either of us to say what may or may not be in my power,    or within that of medicine." -- " I may answer you," replied the patient, "    that my case is not a Singular one, since we read of it in the famous novel    of Le Sage. You remember, doubtless, the disease of which the Duke d'Olivarez    is there stated to have died?" -- "Of the idea," answered the medical gentleman,    " that he was haunted by an apparition, to the actual existence of which he    gave no credit, but died, nevertheless, because he was overcome and heart-broken    by its imaginary presence." -- " I, my dearest doctor," said the sick man, "    am in that very case; and so painful and abhorrent is the presence of the persecuting    vision, that my reason is totally inadequate to combat the effects of my morbid    imagination, and I am sensible I am dying, a wasted victim to an imaginary disease."    The medical gentleman listened with anxiety to his patient's statement, and    for the present judiciously avoiding any contradiction of the sick man's preconceived    fancy, contented himself with more minute inquiry into the nature of the apparition    with which be conceived himself haunted, and into the history of the mode by    which so singular a disease had made itself master of his imagination, secured,    as it seemed, by strong powers  of the understanding, against an attack so irregular.    The sick person replied by stating that its advances were gradual, and at first    not of a terrible or even disagreeable character. To illustrate this, he gave    the following account of the progress of his disease: --  
 </p><p>     " My visions," he said, " commenced two or three    years since, when I found myself from time to time embarrassed by the presence    of a large cat, which came and disappeared I could not exactly tell how, till    the truth was finally forced upon me, and I was compelled to regard it as no    domestic household cat, but as a bubble of the elements, which had no existence    save in my deranged visual organs or depraved imagination. Still I had not that    positive objection to the animal entertained by a late gallant Highland chieftain,    who has been seen to change to all the colours of his own plaid if a cat by    accident happened to be in the room with him, even though he did not see it.    On the contrary, I am rather a friend to cats, and endured with so much equanimity    the presence of my imaginary attendant, that it had become almost indifferent    to me; when, within the course of a few months, it gave place to, or was succeeded    by, a spectre of a more important sort, or which at least had a more imposing    appearance. This was no other than the apparition of a gentleman-usher, dressed    as if to wait upon a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, a Lord High Commissioner of    the Kirk, or any other who bears on his brow the rank and stamp of delegated    sovereignty. 
 </p><p>     " This personage, arrayed in a court dress, with    bag and sword, tamboured waistcoat, and chapeau-bras, glided beside me like    the ghost of Beau Nash; and, whether in my own house or in another, ascended    the stairs before me, as if to announce me in the drawing-room, and at sometimes    appeared to mingle with the company, though it was sufficiently evident that    they were not aware of his presence, and that I alone was sensible of the visionary    honours which this imaginary being seemed desirous to render me. This  freak of the fancy did not produce much impression    on me, though it led me to entertain doubts on the nature of my disorder and    alarm for the effect it might produce on my intellects. But that modification    of my disease also had its appointed duration. After a few months the phantom    of the gentleman-usher was seen no more, but was succeeded by one horrible to    the sight and distressing to the imagination, being no other than the image    of death itself -- the apparition of a <i>skeleton</i>. Alone or in company,"    said the unfortunate invalid, " the presence of this last phantom never quits    me. I in vain tell myself a hundred times over that it is no reality, but merely    an image summoned up by the morbid acuteness of my own excited imagination and    deranged organs of sight. But what avail such reflections, while the emblem    at once and presage of mortality is before my eyes, and while I feel myself,    though in fancy only, the companion of a phantom representing a ghastly inhabitant    of the grave, even while I yet breathe on the earth? Science, philosophy, even    religion, has no cure for such a disorder; and I feel too surely that I shall    die the victim to so melancholy a disease, although I have no belief whatever    in the reality of the phantom which it places before me." 
 </p><p>      The physician was distressed to perceive, from    these details, how strongly this visionary apparition was fixed in the imagination    of his patient. He ingeniously urged the sick man, who was then in bed, with    questions concerning the circumstances of the phantom's appearance, trusting    he might lead him, as a sensible man, into such contradictions and inconsistencies    as might bring his common-sense, which seemed to be unimpaired, so strongly    into the field as might combat successfully the fantastic disorder which produced    such fatal effects. " This skeleton, then," said the doctor, " seems to you    to be always present to your eyes?" " It is my fate, unhappily," answered the    invalid, " always to see it." " Then I understand," continued the physician,    " it is now present to your imagination?" " To my imagination  it certainly is so," replied the sick man. "    And in what part of the chamber do you now conceive the apparition to appear?"    the physician inquired. " Immediately at the foot of my bed. When the curtains    are left a little open," answered the invalid, " the skeleton, to my thinking,    is placed between them, and fills the vacant space." " You say you are sensible    of the delusion," said his friend; " have you firmness to convince yourself    of the truth of this? Can you take courage enough to rise and place yourself    in the spot so seeming to be occupied, and convince yourself of the illusion?"    The poor man sighed, and shook his head negatively. " Well," said the doctor,    " we will try the experiment otherwise." Accordingly, he rose from his chair    by the bedside, and placing himself between the two half-drawn curtains at the    foot of the bed, indicated as the place occupied by the apparition, asked if    the spectre was still visible? " Not entirely so," replied the patient, " because    your person is betwixt him and me; but I observe his skull peering above your    shoulder." 
 </p><p>      It is alleged the man of science started on    the instant, despite philosophy, on receiving an answer ascertaining, with such    minuteness, that the ideal spectre was close to his own person. He resorted    to other means of investigation and cure, but with equally indifferent success.    The patient sunk into deeper and deeper dejection, and died in the same distress    of mind in which he had spent the latter months of his life; and his case remains    a melancholy instance of the power of imagination to kill the body, even when    its fantastic terrors cannot overcome the intellect, of the unfortunate persons    who suffer under them. The patient, in the present case, sunk under his malady;    and the circumstances of his singular disorder remaining concealed, he did not,    by his death and last illness, lose any of his well-merited reputation for prudence    and sagacity which had attended him during the whole course of his life. 
 </p><p>      Having added these two remarkable instances    to the  general train of similar facts quoted by Ferriar,    Hibbert, and other writers who have more recently considered the subject, there    can, we think, be little doubt of the proposition, that the external organs    may, from various causes, become so much deranged as to make false representations    to the mind; and that, in such cases, men, in the literal sense, really <i>see</i>    the empty and false forms and <i>hear </i>the ideal sounds which, in a more    primitive state of society, are naturally enough referred to the action of demons    or disembodied spirits. In such unhappy cases the patient is intellectually    in the condition of a general whose spies have been bribed by the enemy, and    who must engage himself in the difficult and delicate task of examining and    correcting, by his own powers of argument, the probability of the reports which    are too inconsistent to be trusted to. 
 </p><p>      But there is a corollary to this proposition,    which is worthy of notice. The same species of organic derangement which, as    a continued habit of his deranged vision, presented the subject of our last    tale with the successive apparitions of his cat, his gentleman-usher, and the    fatal skeleton, may occupy, for a brief or almost momentary space, the vision    of men who are otherwise perfectly clear-sighted. Transitory deceptions are    thus presented to the organs which, when they occur to men of strength of mind    and of education, give way to scrutiny, and their character being once investigated,    the true takes the place of the unreal representation. But in ignorant times    those instances in which any object is misrepresented, whether through the action    of the senses, or of the imagination, or the combined influence of both, for    however short a space of time, may be admitted as direct evidence of a supernatural    apparition; a proof the more difficult to be disputed if the phantom has been    personally witnessed by a man of sense and estimation, who, perhaps satisfied    in the general as to the actual existence of apparitions, has not taken time    or trouble to correct his first impressions. This species of deception is so    frequent that one  of the greatest poets of the present time answered    a lady who asked him if he believed in ghosts: -- " No, madam; I have seen too    many myself." I may mention one or two instances of the kind, to which no doubt    can be attached. 
 </p><p>      The first shall be the apparition of Maupertuis    to a brother professor in the Royal Society of Berlin. 
 </p><p>      This extraordinary circumstance appeared in    the Transactions of the Society, but is thus stated by M. Thiebault in his "    Recollections of Frederick the Great and the Court of Berlin." It is necessary    to premise that M. Gleditsch, to whom the circumstance happened, was a botanist    of eminence, holding the professorship of natural philosophy at Berlin, and    respected as a man of an habitually serious, simple, and tranquil character. 
 </p><p>      A short time after the death of Maupertuis, <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a>    M. Gleditsch being obliged to traverse the hall in which the Academy held its    sittings, having some arrangements to make in the cabinet of natural history,    which was under his charge, and being willing to complete them on the Thursday    before the meeting, he perceived, on entering the hall, the apparition of M.    de Maupertuis, upright and stationary, in the first angle on his left hand,    having his eyes fixed on him. This was about three o'clock, afternoon. The professor    of natural philosophy was too well acquainted with physical science to suppose    that his late president, who had died at Bâle, in the family of Messrs.    Bernoulhe, could have found his way back to Berlin in person. He regarded the    apparition in no other light than as a phantom produced by some derangement    of his own proper organs. M. Gleditsch went to his own business, without stopping    longer than to ascertain exactly the appearance of that object. But be related    the vision to his brethren, and assured them that it was as defined and perfect    as the actual person of Maupertuis could have presented.  When it is recollected that Maupertuis died at    a distance from Berlin, once the scene of his triumphs -- overwhelmed by the    petulant ridicule of Voltaire, and out of favour with Frederick, with whom to    be ridiculous was to be worthless -- we can hardly wonder at the imagination    even of a man of physical science calling up his Eidolon in the hall of his    former greatness. 
 </p><p>      The sober-minded professor did not, however,    push his investigation to the point to which it was carried by a gallant soldier,    from whose mouth a particular friend of the author received the following circumstances    of a similar story. 
 </p><p>      Captain C -- -- was a native of Britain, but    bred in the Irish Brigade. He was a man of the most dauntless courage, which    he displayed in some uncommonly desperate adventures during the first years    of the French Revolution, being repeatedly employed by the royal family in very    dangerous commissions. After the King's death he came over to England, and it    was then the following circumstance took place. 
 </p><p>      Captain C -- -- was a Catholic, and, in his    hour of adversity at least, sincerely attached to the duties of his religion.    His confessor was a clergyman who was residing as chaplain to a man of rank    in the west of England, about four miles from the place where Captain C -- --    lived. On riding over one morning to see this gentleman, his penitent had the    misfortune to find him very ill from a dangerous complaint. He retired in great    distress and apprehension of his friend's life, and the feeling brought back    upon him many other painful and disagreeable recollections. These occupied him    till the hour of retiring to bed, when, to his great astonishment, he saw in    the room the figure of the absent confessor. He addressed it, but received no    answer -- the eyes alone were impressed by the appearance. Determined to push    the matter to the end, Captain C -- -- advanced on the phantom, which appeared    to retreat gradually before him. In this manner he followed it round the bed,    when it  seemed to sink down on an elbow-chair, and remain    there in a sitting posture. To ascertain positively the nature of the apparition,    the soldier himself sate down on the same chair, ascertaining thus, beyond question,    that the whole was illusion; yet he owned that, had his friend died about the    same time, he would not well have known what name to give to his vision. But    as the confessor recovered, and, in Dr. Johnson's phrase, " nothing came of    it," the incident was only remarkable as showing that men of the strongest nerves    are not exempted from such delusions. 
 </p><p>      Another illusion of the same nature we have    the best reason for vouching as a fact, though, for certain reasons, we do not    give the names of the parties. Not long after the death of a late illustrious    poet, who had filled, while living, a great station in the eye of the public,    a literary friend, to whom the deceased had been well known, was engaged, during    the darkening twilight of an autumn evening, in perusing one of the publications    which professed to detail the habits and opinions of the distinguished individual    who was now no more. As the reader had enjoyed the intimacy of the deceased    to a considerable degree, he was deeply interested in the publication, which    contained some particulars relating to himself and other friends. A visitor    was sitting in the apartment, who was also engaged in reading. Their sitting-room    opened into an entrance-hall, rather fantastically fitted up with articles of    armour, skins of wild animals, and the like. It was when laying down his book,    and passing into this hall, through which the moon was beginning to shine, that    the individual of whom I speak saw, right before him, and in a standing posture,    the exact representation of his departed friend, whose recollection had been    so strongly brought to his imagination. He stopped for a single moment, so as    to notice the wonderful accuracy with which fancy had impressed upon the bodily    eye the peculiarities of dress and posture of the illustrious poet. Sensible,    however, of the delusion, he felt no sentiment  save that of wonder at the extraordinary accuracy    of the resemblance, and stepped onwards towards the figure, which resolved itself,    as he approached, into the various materials of which it was composed. These    were merely a screen, occupied by great-coats, shawls, plaids, and such other    articles as usually are found in a country entrance-hall. The spectator returned    to the spot from which he had seen the illusion, and endeavoured, with all his    power, to recall the image which had been so singularly vivid. But this was    beyond his capacity; and the person who had witnessed the apparition, or, more    properly, whose excited state had been the means of raising it, had only to    return into the apartment, and tell his young friend under what a striking hallucination    he had for a moment laboured. 
 </p><p>      There is every reason to believe that instances    of this kind are frequent among persons of a certain temperament, and when such    occur in an early period of society, they are almost certain to be considered    as real supernatural appearances. They differ from those of Nicolai, and others    formerly noticed, as being of short duration, and constituting no habitual or    constitutional derangement of the system. The apparition of Maupertuis to Monsieur    Gleditsch, that of the Catholic clergyman to Captain C -- -- , that of a late    poet to his friend, are of the latter character. They bear to the former the    analogy, as we may say, which a sudden and temporary fever-fit has to a serious    feverish illness. But, even for this very reason, it is more difficult to bring    such momentary impressions back to their real sphere of optical illusions, since    they accord much better with our idea of glimpses of the future world than those    in which the vision is continued or repeated for hours, days, and months, affording    opportunities of discovering, from other circumstances, that the symptom originates    in deranged health. 
 </p><p>      Before concluding these observations upon the    deceptions of the senses, we must remark that the eye is the organ most essential    to the purpose of realizing to our mind the  appearance of external objects, and that when    the visual organ becomes depraved for a greater or less time, and to a farther    or more limited extent, its misrepresentation of the objects of sight is peculiarly    apt to terminate in such hallucinations as those we have been detailing. Yet    the other senses or organs, in their turn, and to the extent of their power,    are as ready, in their various departments, as the sight itself, to retain false    or doubtful impressions, which mislead, instead of informing, the party to whom    they are addressed. 
 </p><p>      Thus, in regard to the ear, the next organ in    importance to the eye, we are repeatedly deceived by such sounds as are imperfectly    gathered up and erroneously apprehended. From the false impressions received    from this organ also arise consequences similar to those derived from erroneous    reports made by the organs of sight. A whole class of superstitious observances    arise, and are grounded upon inaccurate and imperfect hearing. To the excited    and imperfect state of the ear we owe the existence of what Milton sublimely    calls --  <br> <br> The airy tongues that syllable men's names, <br> On shores, in desert sands, and wildernesses. <br> 
 </p><p>     These also appear such natural causes of alarm,    that we do not sympathize more readily with Robinson Crusoe's apprehensions    when he witnesses the print of the savage's foot in the sand, than in those    which arise from his being waked from sleep by some one calling his name in    the solitary island, where there existed no man but the shipwrecked mariner    himself. Amidst the train of superstitions deduced from the imperfections of    the ear, we may quote that visionary summons which the natives of the Hebrides    acknowledged as one sure sign of approaching fate. The voice of some absent,    or probably some deceased, relative was, in such cases, heard as repeating the    party's name. Sometimes the aerial summoner intimated his own death, and at    others it was no uncommon circumstance that the person  who fancied himself so called, died in consequence;    -- for the same reason that the negro pines to death who is laid under the ban    of an Obi woman, or the Cambro-Briton, whose name is put into the famous cursing    well, with the usual ceremonies, devoting him to the infernal gods, wastes away    and dies, as one doomed to do so. It may be remarked also, that Dr. Johnson    retained a deep impression that, while he was opening the door of his college    chambers, he heard the voice of his mother, then at many miles' distance, call    him by his name; and it appears he was rather disappointed that no event of    consequence followed a summons sounding so decidedly supernatural. It is unnecessary    to dwell on this sort of auricular deception, of which most men's recollection    will supply instances. The following may he stated as one serving to show by    what slender accidents the human ear may be imposed upon. The author was walking,    about two years since, in a wild and solitary scene with a young friend, who    laboured under the infirmity of a severe deafness, when he heard what he conceived    to be the cry of a distant pack of hounds, sounding intermittedly. As the season    was summer, this, on a moment's reflection, satisfied the hearer that it could    not be the clamour of an actual chase, and yet his ears repeatedly brought back    the supposed cry. He called upon his own dogs, of which two or three were with    the walking party. They came in quietly, and obviously had no accession to the    sounds which had caught the author's attention, so that he could not help saying    to his companion, " I am doubly sorry for your infirmity at this moment, for    I could otherwise have let you hear the cry of the Wild Huntsman." As the young    gentleman used a hearing tube, he turned when spoken to, and, in doing so, the    cause of the phenomenon became apparent. The supposed distant sound was in fact    a nigh one, being the singing of the Wind in the instrument which the young    gentleman was obliged to use, but which, from various circumstances, had never    occurred  to his elder friend as likely to produce the    sounds he had heard. 
 </p><p>      It is scarce necessary to add, that the highly    imaginative superstition of the Wild Huntsman in Germany seems to have had its    origin in strong fancy, operating upon the auricular deceptions, respecting    the numerous sounds likely to occur in the dark recesses of pathless forests.    The same clew may be found to the kindred Scottish belief, so finely embodied    by the nameless author of " Albania:" --  <br> <br> " There, since of old the haughty Thanes of Ross <br> Were wont, with clans and ready vassals thronged, <br> To wake the bounding stag or guilty wolf; <br> There oft is heard at midnight or at noon, <br> Beginning faint, but rising still more loud, <br> And louder, voice of hunters, and of hounds, <br> And horns hoarse-winded, blowing far and keen. <br> Forthwith the hubbub multiplies, the air <br> Labours with louder shouts and rifer din <br> Of close pursuit, the broken cry of deer <br> Mangled by throttling dogs, the shouts of men, <br> And hoofs, thick-beating on the hollow hill: <br> Sudden the grazing heifer in the vale <br> Starts at the tumult, and the herdsman's ears <br> Tingle with inward dread. Aghast he eyes <br> The upland ridge, and every mountain round, <br> But not one trace of living wight discerns, <br> Nor knows, o'erawed and trembling as he stands, <br> To what or whom he owes his idle fear -- <br> To ghost, to witch, to fairy, or to fiend, <br> But wonders, and no end of wondering finds." <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a> <br> 
 </p><p>      It must also be remembered, that to the auricular    deceptions practised by the means of ventriloquism or otherwise,  may be traced many, of the most successful impostures    which credulity has received as supernatural communications. 
 </p><p>      The sense of touch seems less liable to perversion    than either that of sight or smell, nor are there many cases in which it can    become accessary to such false intelligence as the eye and ear, collecting their    objects from a greater distance and by less accurate enquiry, are but too ready    to convey. Yet there is one circumstance in which the Sense of touch as well    as others is very apt to betray its possessor into inaccuracy, in respect to    the circumstances which it impresses on its owner. The case occurs during sleep,    when the dreamer touches with his hand some other part of his own person. He    is clearly, in this case, both the actor and patient, both the proprietor of    the member touching, and of that which is touched; while, to increase the complication,    the hand is both toucher of the limb on which it rests, and receives an impression    of touch from it; and the same is the case with the limb, which at one and the    same time receives an impression from the band, and conveys to the mind a report    respecting the size, substance, and the like, of the member touching. Now, as    during sleep the patient is unconscious that both limbs are his own identical    property, his mind is apt to be much disturbed by the complication of sensations    arising from two parts of his person being at once acted upon, and from their    reciprocal action; and false impressions are thus received, which, accurately    enquired into, would afford a clew to many puzzling phenomena in the theory    of dreams. This peculiarity of the organ of touch, as also that it is confined    to no particular organ, but is diffused over the whole person of the man, is    noticed by Lucretius: --  <br> <br> " Ut si forte mana, quam vis jam corporis, ipse <br> Tute tibi partem ferias, æque experiare." <br> 
 </p><p>     A remarkable instance of such an illusion was    told me by a late nobleman. He had fallen asleep, with some uneasy  feelings arising from indigestion. They operated    in their usual course of visionary terrors. At length they were all summed up    in the apprehension that the phantom of a dead man held the sleeper by the wrist,    and endeavoured to drag him out of bed. He awaked in horror, and still felt    the cold dead grasp of a corpse's hand on his right wrist. It was a minute before    he discovered that his own left hand was in a state of numbness, and with it    he had accidentally encircled his right arm. 
 </p><p>      The taste and the smell, like the touch, convey    more direct intelligence than the eye and the ear, and are less likely than    those senses to aid in misleading the imagination. We have seen the palate,    in the case of the porridge-fed lunatic, enter its protest against the acquiescence    of eyes, ears, and touch, in the gay visions which gilded the patient's confinement.    The palate, however, is subject to imposition as well as the other senses. The    best and most acute <i>bon vivant</i> loses his power of discriminating betwixt    different kinds of wine, if he is prevented from assisting his palate by the    aid of his eyes, -- that is, if the glasses of each are administered indiscriminately    while he is blindfolded. Nay, we are authorized to believe that individuals    have died in consequence of having supposed themselves to have taken poison,    when, in reality, the draught they had swallowed as such was of an innoxious    or restorative quality. The delusions of the stomach can seldom bear upon our    present subject, and are not otherwise connected with supernatural appearances,    than as a good dinner and its accompaniments are essential in fitting out a    daring Tam of Shanter, who is fittest to encounter them when the poet's observation    is not unlikely to apply --  <br> <br> " Inspiring bauld John Barleycorn, <br> What dangers thou canst make us scorn! <br> Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil, <br> Wi' usquebae we'll face the devil. <br> The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle, <br> Fair play, he caredna deils a bodle!" 
 </p><p>   Neither has the sense of smell, in its ordinary    state, much connexion with our present subject. Mr. Aubrey tells us, indeed,    of an apparition which disappeared with a curious perfume as well as a most    melodious twang; and popular belief ascribes to the presence of infernal spirits    a strong relish of the sulphureous element of which they are inhabitants. Such    accompaniments, therefore, are usually united with other materials for imposture.    If, as a general opinion assures us, which is not positively discountenanced    'by Dr. Hibbert, by the inhalation of certain gases or poisonous "herbs, necromancers    can dispose a person to believe he sees phantoms, it is likely that the nostrils    are made to inhale such suffumigation as well as the mouth. <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a> 
 </p><p>      I have now arrived, by a devious path, at the    conclusion of this letter, the object of which is to show from what attributes    of our nature, whether mental or corporeal, arises that predisposition to believe    in supernatural occurrences. It is, I think, conclusive that mankind, from a    very early period, have their minds prepared for such events by the consciousness    of the existence of a spiritual world, inferring in the general proposition    the undeniable truth that each man, from the monarch to the beggar, who has    once acted his part on the stage, continues to exist, and may again, even in    a disembodied state, if such is the pleasure of Heaven, for aught that we know    to the contrary, be permitted or ordained to mingle amongst those who yet remain    in the body. The abstract possibility of apparitions must be admitted by every    one who believes in a Deity, and His superintending omnipotence. But imagination    is apt to  intrude its explanations and inferences founded    on inadequate evidence. Sometimes our violent and inordinate passions, originating    in sorrow for our friends, remorse for our crimes, our eagerness of patriotism,    or our deep sense of devotion -- these or other violent excitements of a moral    character, in the visions of night, or the rapt ecstasy of the day, persuade    us that we witness, with our eyes and ears, an actual instance of that supernatural    communication, the possibility of which cannot be denied. At other times the    corporeal organs impose upon the mind, while the eye and the ear, diseased,    deranged, or misled, convey false impressions to the patient. Very often both    the mental delusion and the physical deception exist at the same time, and men's    belief of the phenomena presented to them, however erroneously, by the senses,    is the firmer and more readily granted, that the physical impression corresponded    with the mental excitement. 
 </p><p>      So many causes acting thus upon each other in    various degrees, or sometimes separately, it must happen early in the infancy    of every society that there should occur many apparently well-authenticated    instances of supernatural intercourse, satisfactory enough to authenticate peculiar    examples of the general proposition which is impressed upon us by belief of    the immortality of the soul. These examples of undeniable apparitions (for they    are apprehended to be incontrovertible), fall like the seed of the husbandman    into fertile and prepared soil, and are usually followed by a plentiful crop    of superstitious figments, which derive their sources from circumstances and    enactments in sacred and profane history, hastily adopted, and perverted from    their genuine reading. This shall be the subject of my next letter. <br> <br>
