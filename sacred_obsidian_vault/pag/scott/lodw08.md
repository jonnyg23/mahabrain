 <p>     OUR account of Demonology in England must naturally,    as in every other country, depend chiefly on the instances which history contains    of the laws and prosecutions against witchcraft. Other superstitions arose and    decayed, were dreaded or despised, without greater embarrassment, in the provinces  in which they have a temporary currency, than    that cowards and children go out more seldom at night, while the reports of    ghosts and fairies are peculiarly current. But when the alarm of witchcraft    arises, Superstition dips her hand in the blood of the persons accused, and    records in the annals of jurisprudence their trials and the causes alleged in    vindication of their execution. Respecting other fantastic allegations, the    proof is necessarily transient and doubtful, depending upon the inaccurate testimony    of vague report and of doting tradition. But in cases of witchcraft we have    before us the recorded evidence upon which judge and jury acted, and can form    an opinion with some degree of certainty of the grounds, real or fanciful, on    which they acquitted or condemned. It is, therefore, in tracing this part of    Demonology, with its accompanying circumstances, that we have the best chance    of obtaining an accurate view of our subject. 
 </p><p>      The existence of witchcraft was, no doubt, received    and credited in England, as in the countries on the Continent, and originally    punished accordingly. But after the fourteenth century the practices which fell    under such a description were thought unworthy of any peculiar animadversion,    unless they were connected with something which would have been of itself a    capital crime, by whatever means it had been either essayed or accomplished.    Thus the supposed paction between a witch and the demon was perhaps deemed in    itself to have terrors enough to prevent its becoming an ordinary crime, and    was not, therefore, visited with any statutory penalty. But to attempt or execute    bodily harm to others through means of evil spirits, or, in a word, by the black    art, was actionable at common law as much as if the party accused had done the    same harm with an arrow or pistol-shot. The destruction or abstraction of goods    by the like instruments, supposing the charge proved, would, in like manner,    be punishable. <i>A fortiori</i>, the consulting soothsayers, familiar spirits,    or the like, and the obtaining  and circulating pretended prophecies to the unsettlement    o the State and the endangering of the King's title, is yet a higher degree    of guilt. And it may be remarked that the inquiry into the date of the King's    life bears a close affinity with the desiring or compassing the death of the    Sovereign, which is the essence of high treason. Upon such charges repeated    trials took place in the courts of the English, and condemnations were pronounced,    with sufficient justice, no doubt, where the connexion between the resort to    sorcerers and the design to perpetrate a felony could be clearly proved. We    would not, indeed, be disposed to go the length of so high an authority as Selden,    who pronounces (in his "Table-Talk") that if a man heartily believed that he    could take the life of another by waving his hat three times and crying Buzz    ! and should, under this fixed opinion, wave his hat and cry Buzz! accordingly,    he ought to be executed as a murderer. But a false prophecy of the King's death    is not to be dealt with exactly on the usual principle; because, however idle    in itself, the promulgation of such a prediction has, in times such as we are    speaking of, a strong tendency to work its completion. 
 </p><p>      Many persons, and some of great celebrity, suffered    for the charge of trafficking with witches, to the prejudice of those in authority.    We have already mentioned the instance of the Duchess of Gloucester, in Henry    the Sixth's reign, and that of the Queen Dowager's kinsmen, in the Protectorate    of Richard, afterwards the Third. In 1521, the Duke of Buckingham was beheaded,    owing much to his having listened to the predictions of one Friar Hopkins. In    the same reign, the Maid of Kent, who had been esteemed a prophetess, was put    to death as a cheat. She suffered with seven persons who had managed her fits    for the support of the Catholic religion, and confessed her fraud upon the scaffold.    About seven years after this, Lord Hungerford was beheaded for consulting certain    soothsayers concerning the length of Henry the Eighth's life. But these cases    rather  relate to the purpose for which the sorcery was    employed, than to the fact of using it. 
 </p><p>      Two remarkable statutes were passed in the Year    1541; one against false prophecies, the other against the act of conjuration,    witchcraft, and sorcery, and at the same time against breaking and destroying    crosses. The former enactment was certainly made to ease the suspicious and    wayward fears of the tetchy King Henry. The prohibition against witchcraft might    be also dictated by the king's jealous doubts of hazard to the succession. The    enactment against breaking crosses was obviously designed to check the ravages    of the Reformers, who in England as well as elsewhere desired to sweep away    Popery with the besom of destruction. This latter statute was abrogated in the    first year of Edward VI., perhaps as placing an undue restraint on the zeal    of good Protestants against idolatry. 
 </p><p>      At length, in 1562, a formal statute against    sorcery, as penal in itself, was actually passed; but as the penalty was limited    to the pillory for the first transgression, the legislature probably regarded    those who might be brought to trial as impostors rather than wizards. There    are instances of individuals tried and convicted as impostors and cheats, and    who acknowledged themselves such before the court and people; but in their articles    of visitation the prelates directed enquiry to be made after those who should    use enchantments, witchcraft, sorcery, or any like craft, <i>invented by the    devil.</i> 
 </p><p>      But it is here proper to make a pause for the    purpose of enquiring in what manner the religious disputes which occupied all    Europe about this time influenced the proceedings of the rival sects in relation    to Demonology. 
 </p><p>      The Papal Church had long reigned by the proud    and absolute humour which she had assumed, of maintaining every doctrine which    her rulers had adopted in dark ages; but this pertinacity at length made her    citadel too large to be defended at every point by a garrison whom prudence  would have required to abandon positions which    had been taken in times of darkness, and were unsuited to the warfare of a more    enlightened age. The sacred motto of the Vatican was, <i>"Vestigia nulla retrorsum;"</i>    and this rendered it impossible to comply with the more wise and moderate of    her own party, who would otherwise have desired to make liberal concessions    to the Protestants, and thus prevent, in its commencement, a formidable schism    in the Christian world. 
 </p><p>      To the system of Rome the Calvinists offered    the most determined opposition, affecting upon every occasion and on all points    to observe an order of church-government, as well as of worship, expressly in    the teeth of its enactments; -- in a word, to be a good Protestant, they held    it almost essential to be in all things diametrically opposite to the Catholic    form and faith. As the foundation of this sect was laid in republican states,    as its clerical discipline was settled on a democratic basis, and as the countries    which adopted that form of government were chiefly poor, the preachers having    lost the Tank and opulence enjoyed by the Roman Church, were gradually thrown    on the support of the people. Insensibly they became occupied with the ideas    and tenets natural to the common people, which, if they have usually the merit    of being, honestly conceived and boldly expressed, are not the less often adopted    with credulity and precipitation, and carried into effect with unhesitating,    harshness and severity. 
 </p><p>      Betwixt these extremes the Churchmen of England    endeavoured to steer a middle course retaining a portion of the ritual and forms    of Rome, as in themselves admirable, and at any rate too greatly venerated by    the people to be changed merely for opposition's sake. Their comparatively undilapidated    revenue, the connexion of their system with the state, with views of ambition    as ample as the station of a churchman ought to command, Tendered them independent    of the necessity of courting their flocks by any means  save regular discharge of their duty; and the    excellent provisions made for their education afforded them learning to confute    ignorance and enlighten prejudice. 
 </p><p>      Such being the general character of the three    Churches, their belief in and persecution of such crimes as witchcraft and sorcery    were necessarily modelled upon the peculiar tenets which each system professed,    and. gave rise to various results in the countries where they were severally    received. 
 </p><p>      The Church of Rome, as we have seen, was unwilling,    in of undisputed power, to call in the secular arm men for witchcraft a crime    which fell especially under ecclesiastical cognizance, and could, according    to her belief, be subdued by the spiritual arm alone. The learned men at the    head of the establishment might safely despise the attempt at those hidden arts    as impossible; or, even if they were of a more credulous disposition, they might    be unwilling to make laws by which their own enquiries in the mathematics, algebra,    chemistry, and other pursuits vulgarly supposed to approach the confines of    magic art, might be inconveniently restricted. The more selfish part of the    priesthood might think that a general belief in the existence of witches should    be permitted to remain, as a source both of power and of revenue -- that if    there were no possessions, there could be no exorcism-fees -- and, in short,    that a wholesome faith in all the absurdities of the vulgar creed as to supernatural    influences was necessary to maintain the influence of Diana of Ephesus. They    suffered spells to be manufactured, since every friar had the power of reversing    them; they permitted poison to be distilled, because every convent had the antidote    which was disposed of to all who chose to demand it. It was not till the universal    progress of heresy, in the end of the fifteenth century, that the bull of Pope    Innocent VIII., already quoted, called to convict, imprison, and condemn the    sorcerers, chiefly because it was the object to transfer the odium of these    crimes to the Waldenses,  and excite and direct the public hatred against    the new sect by confounding their doctrines with the influence of the devil    and his fiends. The bull of Pope Innocent was afterwards, in the year 1523,    enforced by Adrian VI. with a new one, in which excommunication was directed    against <i>sorcerers and heretics.</i> 
 </p><p>      While Rome thus positively declared herself    against witches and sorcerers, the Calvinists, in whose numbers must be included    the greater part of the English Puritans, who, though they had not finally severed    from the communion of the Anglican Church, yet disapproved of her ritual and    ceremonies as retaining too much of the Papal stamp, ranked themselves, in accordance    with their usual policy, in diametrical opposition to the doctrine of the Mother    Church. They assumed in the opposite sense whatever Rome pretended to as a proof    of her omnipotent authority. The exorcisms, forms, and rites, by which good    Catholics believed that incarnate fiends could be expelled and evil spirits    of every kind rebuked -- these, like the holy water, the robes of the priest,    and the sign of the cross, the Calvinists considered either with scorn and contempt    as the tools of deliberate quackery and imposture, or with horror and loathing,    as the fit emblems and instruments of an idolatrous system. 
 </p><p>      Such of them as did not absolutely deny the    supernatural powers of which the Romanists made boast, regarded the success    of the exorcising priest, to whatever extent they admitted it, as at best a    casting out of devils by the power of Beelzebub, the King of the Devils. They    saw also, and resented bitterly, the attempt to confound any dissent from the    doctrines of Rome with the proneness to an encouragement of rites of sorcery.    On the whole, the Calvinists, generally speaking, were of all the contending    sects the most suspicions of sorcery, the most undoubting believers in its existence,    and the most eager to follow it up with what they conceived to be the due punishment    of the most fearful of crimes.   The leading divines of the Church of England    were, without doubt, fundamentally as much opposed to the doctrines of Rome    as those who altogether disclaimed opinions and ceremonies merely because she    had entertained them. But their position in society tended strongly to keep    them from adopting, on such subjects as we are now discussing, either the eager    credulity of the Vulgar mind or the fanatic ferocity of their Calvinistic rivals.    We have no purpose to discuss the matter in detail -- enough has probably been    said to show generally why the Romanist should have cried out a miracle respecting    an incident which the Anglican would have contemptuously termed an imposture;    while the Calvinist, inspired with a darker zeal, and, above all, with the unceasing    desire of open controversy with the Catholics, would have styled the same event    an operation of the devil. 
 </p><p>      It followed that, while the divines of the Church    of England possessed the upper hand in the kingdom, witchcraft, though trials    and even condemnations for that offence occasionally occurred, did not create    that epidemic terror which the very suspicion of the offence carried with it    elsewhere; so that Reginald Scot and others alleged it was the vain pretences    and empty forms of the Church of Rome, by the faith reposed in them, which had    led to the belief of witchcraft or sorcery in general. Nor did prosecutions    on account of such charges frequently involve a capital punishment, while learned    judges were jealous of the imperfection of the evidence to support the charge,    and entertained a strong and growing suspicion that legitimate grounds for such    trials seldom actually existed. On the other hand, it usually happened that    wherever the Calvinist interest became predominant in Britain, a general persecution    of sorcerers and witches seemed to take place of consequence. Fearing and hating    sorcery more than other Protestants, connecting its ceremonies and usages with    those of the detested Catholic Church, the Calvinists were  more eager than other sects in searching after    the traces this crime, and, of course, unusually successful, as they might suppose,    in making discoveries of guilt, and pursuing it to the expiation of the fagot.    In a word, a principle already referred to by Dr. Francis Hutchison will be    found to rule the tide and the reflux of such cases in the different churches.    The numbers of witches, and their supposed dealings with Satan, will increase    or decrease according as such doings are accounted probable or impossible. Under    the former supposition, charges and convictions will be found augmented in a    terrific degree. When the accusations are disbelieved and dismissed as not worthy    of attention, the crime becomes unfrequent, ceases to occupy the public mind,    and affords little trouble to the judges. 
 </p><p>      The passing of Elizabeth's statute against witchcraft    in 1562 does not seem to have been intended to increase the number of trials,    or cases of conviction at least ; and the fact is, it did neither the one nor    the other. Two children were tried in 1574 for counterfeiting possession, and    stood in the pillory for impostors. Mildred Norrington, called the Maid of Westwell,    furnished another instance of possession; but she also confessed her imposture,    and publicly showed her fits and tricks of mimicry. The strong influence already    possessed by the Puritans may probably be sufficient to account for the darker    issue of certain cases, in which both juries and judges in Elizabeth's time    must be admitted to have shown fearful severity. 
 </p><p>      These cases of possession were in some respects    sore snares to the priests of the Church of Rome, who, while they were too sagacious    not to be aware that the pretended fits, contortions, strange sounds, and other    extravagances, produced as evidence of the demon's influence on the possessed    person, were nothing else than marks of imposture by some idle vagabond, were    nevertheless often tempted to admit them as real, and take the credit of curing    them. The period was one when the Catholic Church had much  occasion to rally around her all the respect    that remained to her in a schismatic and heretical kingdom; and when her fathers    and doctors announced the existence of such a dreadful disease, and of the power    of the church's prayers, relics, and ceremonies, to cure it, it was difficult    for a priest, supposing him more tender of the interest of his order than that    of truth, to avoid such a tempting opportunity as a supposed case of possession    offered for displaying the high privilege in which his profession made him a    partaker, or to abstain from conniving at the imposture, in order to obtain    for his church the credit of expelling the demon. It was hardly to be wondered    at, if the ecclesiastic was sometimes induced to aid the fraud of which such    motives forbade him to be the detector. At this he might hesitate the less,    as he was not obliged to adopt the suspected and degrading course of holding    an immediate communication <i>in limine </i>with the impostor, since a hint    or two, dropped in the supposed sufferer's presence, mightgive him the necessary    information what was the most exact mode of performing his part, and if the    patient was possessed by a devil of any acuteness or dexterity, he wanted no    further instruction how to play it. Such combinations were sometimes detected,    and brought more discredit on the Church of Rome than was counterbalanced by    any which might be more cunningly managed. On this subject the reader may turn    to Dr. Harsnett's celebrated book on Popish Impostures, wherein he gives the    history of several notorious cases of detected fraud, in which Roman ecclesiastics    had not hesitated to mingle themselves. That of Grace Sowerbutts, instructed    by a Catholic priest to impeach her grandmother of witchcraft, was a very gross    fraud. 
 </p><p>      Such cases were not, however, limited to the    ecclesiastics of Rome. We have already stated that, as extremes usually approach    each other, the Dissenters, in their violent opposition to the Papists, adopted    some of their ideas respecting demoniacs; and we have now to add that they also  claimed, by the vehemence of prayer and the authority    o their own sacred commission, that power of expelling devils which the Church    of Rome pretended to exercise by rites, ceremonies, and relics. The memorable    case of Richard Dugdale, called the Surrey Impostor, was one of the most remarkable    which the Dissenters brought forward. This youth was supposed to have sold his    soul to the devil, on condition of being made the best dancer in Lancashire,    and during his possession played a number of fantastic tricks, not much different    from those exhibited by expert posture-masters of the present day. This person    threw himself into the hands of the Dissenters, who, in their eagerness, caught    at an opportunity to relieve an afflicted person, whose case the regular clergy    appeared to have neglected. They fixed a committee of their number, who weekly    attended the supposed sufferer, and exercised themselves in appointed days of    humiliation and fasting during the course of a whole year. All respect for the    demon seems to have abandoned the reverend gentlemen, after they had relieved    guard in this manner for some little time, and they got so regardless of Satan    as to taunt him with the mode in which he executed his promise to teach his    vassal dancing. The following specimen of raillery is worth commemoration: --    "What, Satan! is this the dancing that Richard gave himself to thee for? &amp;c.    Canst thou dance no better? &amp;c. Ransack the old records of all past times    and places in thy memory; canst thou not there find out some better way of trampling?    Pump thine invention dry; cannot the universal seed-plot of subtile wiles and    stratagems spring up one new method of cutting capers? 'Is this the top of skill    and pride, to shuffle feet and brandish knees thus, and to trip like a doe and    skip like a squirrel? And wherein differ thy leapings from the hoppings of a    frog, or the bouncings of a goat, or friskings of a dog, or gesticulations of    a monkey? And cannot a palsy shake such a loose lea as that ? Dost thou not    twirl like a calf that hath the turn, and twitch up thy houghs just  like a springhault tit?" <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">54</font></a> One    might almost conceive the demon replying to this raillery in the words of Dr.    Johnson, "This merriment of parsons is extremely offensive." 
 </p><p>      The dissenters were probably too honest, however    simple, to achieve a complete cure on Dugdale by an amicable understanding;    so, after their year of vigil, they relinquished their task by degrees. Dugdale,    weary of his illness, which now attracted little notice, attended a regular    physician, and was cured of that part of his disease which was not affected    in a regular way <i>par ordonnance du médecin. </i>But the reverend gentlemen    who had taken his case in hand still assumed the credit of curing him, and if    anything could have induced them to sing <i>Te</i> <i>Deum,</i> it would have    been this occasion. They said that the effect of their public prayers had been    for a time suspended, until seconded by the continued earnestness of their private    devotions! 
 </p><p>      The ministers of the Church of England, though,    from education, intercourse with the world, and other advantages, they were    less prone to prejudice than those of other sects, are yet far from being entirely    free of the charge of encouraging in particular instances the witch superstition.    Even while Dr. Hutchison pleads that the Church of England has the least to    answer for in that matter, he is under the necessity of acknowledging that some    regular country clergymen so far shared the rooted prejudices of congregations,    and of the government which established laws against it, as to be active in    the persecution of the suspected, and even in countenancing the superstitious    signs by which in that period the vulgar thought it possible to ascertain the    existence of the afflictions by witchcraft, and obtain the knowledge of the    perpetrator. A singular case is mentioned of three women, called the Witches    of Warbois. Indeed, their story is a matter of solemn enough record; for Sir    Samuel Cromwell, having received the sum of forty pounds as lord of the manor,    out of the estate of the poor persons  who suffered, turned it into a rent-charge of    forty shillings yearly, for the endowment of an annual lecture on the subject    of witchcraft, to be preached by a doctor or bachelor of divinity of Queen's    College, Cambridge. The accused, one Samuel and his wife were old and very poor    persons, and their daughter a young woman. The daughter of a Mr. Throgmorton,    seeing the poor old woman in a black knitted cap, at a time when she was not    very well, took a whim that she had bewitched her, and was ever after exclaiming    against her. The other children of this fanciful family caught up the same cry,    and the eldest of them at last got up a vastly pretty drama, in which she herself    furnished all the scenes and played all the parts. 
 </p><p>      Such imaginary scenes, or <i>make-believe </i>stories,    are the common amusement of lively children ; and most readers may remember    having had some Utopia of their own. But the nursery drama of Miss Throgmorton    had a horrible conclusion. This young lady and her sisters were supposed to    be haunted by nine spirits, dispatched by the wicked Mother Samuel for that    purpose. The sapient parents heard one part of the dialogue, when the children    in their fits returned answers, as was supposed, to the spirits who afflicted    them; and when the patients from time to time recovered, they furnished the    counterpart by telling what the spirits had said to them. The names of the spirits    were Pluck, Hardname, Catch, Blue, and three Smacks, who were cousins. Mrs.    Joan Throgmorton, the eldest (who, like other young women of her age, about    fifteen, had some disease on her nerves, and whose fancy ran apparently on love    and gallantry), supposed that one of the Smacks was her lover, did battle for    her with the less friendly spirits, and promised to protect her against Mother    Samuel herself; and the following curious extract will show on what a footing    of familiarity the damsel stood with her spiritual gallant:"From whence come    you, Mr. Smack?" says the afflicted young lady ; "and what news do you bring?"  Smack, nothing abashed, informed her he came    from fighting with Pluck: the weapons, great cowl-staves; the scene, a ruinous    bakehouse in Dame Samuel's yard. "And who got the mastery, I pray you?" said    the damsel. Smack answered, be had broken Pluck's head. "I would," said the    damsel, "he had broken your neck also." "Is that the thanks I am to have for    my labour?" said the disappointed Smack. "Look you for thanks at my hand?" said    the distressed maiden. "I would you were all hanged up against each other, with    your dame for company, for yon are all naught." On this repulse, exit Smack,    and enter Pluck, Blue, and Catch, the first with his head broken, the other    limping, and the third with his arm in a sling, all trophies of Smack's victory.    They disappeared after having threatened vengeance upon the conquering Smack.    However, he soon afterwards appeared with his laurels. He told her of his various    conflicts. "I wonder," said Mrs. Joan, or Jane, "that you are able to beat them;    you are little, and they very big." "He cared not for that," he replied; "he    would beat the best two of them, and his cousins Smacks would beat the other    two." This most pitiful mirth, for such it certainly is, was mixed with tragedy    enough. Miss Throgmorton and her sisters railed against Dame Samuel; and when    Mr. Throgmorton brought her to his house by force, the little fiends longed    to draw blood of her, scratch her, and torture her, as the witch-creed of that    period recommended; yet the poor woman incurred deeper suspicion when she expressed    a wish to leave a house where she was so coarsely treated and lay under such    odious suspicions. 
 </p><p>      It was in vain that this unhappy creature endeavoured    to avert their resentment by submitting to all the ill-usage they chose to put    upon her; in vain that she underwent unresistingly the worst usage at the hand    of Lady Cromwell, her landlady, who, abusing her with the worst epithets, tore    her cap from her head, clipped out some of her hair, and  gave it to Mrs. Throgmorton to burn it for a    counter-charm. Nay, Mother Samuel's complaisance in the latter case only led    to a new charge. It happened that the Lady Cromwell, on her return home, dreamed    of her day's work, and especially of the old dame and her cat; and, as her ladyship    died in a <i>year</i> <i>and quarter</i> from that very day, it was sagaciously    concluded that she must have fallen a victim to the witcheries of the terrible    Dame Samuel. Mr. Throgmorton also compelled the old woman and her daughter to    use expressions which put their lives in the Power of these malignant children,    who had carried on the farce so long that they could not well escape from their    own web of deceit but by the death of these helpless creatures. For example,    the prisoner, Dame Samuel, was induced to say to the supposed spirit, "As I    am a witch, and a causer of Lady Cromwell's death, I charge thee to come out    of the maiden." The girl lay still; and this was accounted a proof that the    poor woman, who, only subdued and crushed by terror and tyranny, did as she    was bidden, was a witch. One is ashamed of an English judge and jury when it    must be repeated that the evidence of these enthusiastic and giddy-pated girls    was deemed sufficient to the condemnation of three innocent persons. Goody Samuel,    indeed, was at length worried into a confession of her guilt by the various    vexations which were practised on her. But her husband and daughter continued    to maintain their innocence. The last showed a high spirit and proud value for    her character. She was advised by some, who pitied her youth, to gain at least    a respite by pleading pregnancy; to which she answered disdainfully, "No, I    will not be both held witch and strumpet!" The mother, to show her sanity of    mind and the real value of her confession, caught at the advice recommended    to her daughter. As her years put such a plea out of the question, there was    a laugh among the unfeeling audience, in which the poor old victim joined loudly    and heartily. Some there were who thought it no joking matter, and were inclined    to  think they had a Joanna Southcote before them,    and that the devil must be the father. These unfortunate Samuels were condemned    at Huntingdon, before Mr. justice Fenner, 4th April, 1593. It was a singular    case to be commemorated by an annual lecture, as provided by Sir Samuel Cromwell,    for the purposes of justice were never so perverted, nor her sword turned to    a more flagrant murder. 
 </p><p>      We may here mention, though mainly for the sake    of contrast, the much-disputed case of Jane Wenham, the Witch of Walkerne, as    she was termed, which was of a much later date. Some of the country clergy were    carried away by the land-flood of superstition in this instance also, and not    only encouraged the charge, but gave their countenance to some of the ridiculous    and indecent tricks resorted to as proofs of witchcraft by the lowest vulgar.    But the good sense of the judge, seconded by that of other reflecting and sensible    persons, saved the country from the ultimate disgrace attendant on too many    of these unhallowed trials. The usual sort of evidence was brought against this    poor woman, by pretences of bewitched persons vomiting fire -- a trick very    easy to those who chose to exhibit such a piece of jugglery amongst such as    rather desire to be taken in by it than to detect the imposture. The witchfinder    practised upon her the most vulgar and ridiculous tricks or charms; and out    of a perverted examination they drew what they called a confession, though of    a forced and mutilated character. Under such proof the jury brought her in guilty,    and she was necessarily condemned to die. More fortunate, however, than many    persons placed in the like circumstances, Jane Wenham was tried before a sensible    and philosophic judge, who could not understand that the life of an English-woman,    however mean, should be taken away by a set of barbarous tricks and experiments,    the efficacy of which depended on popular credulity. He reprieved the witch    before be left the assize-town. The rest of the history is equally a contrast    to some we have told and others we shall  have to recount. A humane and high-spirited gentleman,    Colonel Plummer of Gilston, putting at defiance popular calumny, placed the    poor old woman in a small house near his own and under his immediate protection.    Here she lived and died, in honest and fair reputation, edifying her visitors    by her accuracy and attention in repeating her devotions; and, removed from    her brutal and malignant neighbours, never afterwards gave the slightest cause    of suspicion or offence till her dying day. As this was one of the last cases    of conviction in England, Dr Hutchison has been led to dilate upon it with some    strength of eloquence as well as argument. 
 </p><p>      He thus expostulates with some of the better    class who were eager for the prosecution: -- "(1) What single fact of sorcery    did this Jane Wenham do? What charm did she use, or what act of witchcraft could    you prove upon her? Laws are against evil actions that can be proved to be of    the person's doing. What single fact that was against the statute could you    fix upon her? I ask (2) Did she so much as speak an imprudent word, or do an    immoral action, that you could put into the narrative of her case? When she    was denied a few turnips, she laid them down very submissively; when she was    called witch and bitch, she only took the proper means for the vindication of    her good name ; when she saw this storm coming upon her she locked herself in    her own house and tried to keep herself out of your cruel hands; when her door    was broken open, and you gave way to that barbarous usage that she met with,    she protested her innocence, fell upon her knees, and begged she might pot go    to gaol, and, in her innocent simplicity, would have let you swim her; and at    her trial she declared herself a clear woman. This was her behaviour. And what    could any of us have done better, excepting in that case where she complied    with you too much, and offered to let you swim her ? 
 </p><p>      "(3) When you used the meanest of paganish and    popish  superstitions -- when you scratched and mangled    and ran pins into her flesh, and used that ridiculous trial of the bottle, &amp;c.    -- whom did you consult, and from whom did you expect your answers? Who was    your father? and into whose hands did you put yourselves? and (if the true sense    of the statute had been turned upon you) which way would you have defended yourselves?    (4) Durst you have used her in this manner if she had been rich? and doth not    her poverty increase rather than lessen your guilt in what you did ? 
 </p><p>      "And therefore, instead of closing your book    with a <i>liberavimus animas nostras </i>and reflecting upon the court, I ask    you (5) Whether you have not more reason to give God thanks that you met with    a wise judge, and a sensible gentleman, who kept you from shedding innocent    blood, and reviving the meanest and cruelest of all superstitions amongst us?" <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">55</font></a> 
 </p><p>      But although individuals of the English Church    might on some occasions be justly accused of falling into lamentable errors    on a subject where error was so general, it was not an usual point of their    professional character; and it must be admitted that the most severe of the    laws against witchcraft originated with a Scottish King of England, and that    the only extensive persecution following that statute occurred during the time    of the Civil Wars, when the Calvinists obtained for a short period a predominating    influence in the councils of Parliament. 
 </p><p>      James succeeded to Elizabeth amidst the highest    expectations on the part of his new people, who, besides their general satisfaction    at coming once more under the rule of a king, were also proud of his supposed    abilities and real knowledge of books and languages, and were naturally, though    imprudently, disposed to gratify him by deferring to his judgment in matters    wherein his studies were supposed to have rendered him a special proficient.    Unfortunately,  besides the more harmless freak of becoming a    prentice in the art of poetry, by which words and numbers were the only sufferers,    the monarch had composed a deep work upon Demonology, embracing in their fullest    extent the most absurd and gross of the popular errors on this subject. He considered    his crown and life as habitually aimed at by the sworn slaves of Satan. Several    had been executed for an attempt to poison him by magical arts; and the turbulent    Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, whese repeated attempts on his person had    long been James's terror, had begun his Course of rebellion by a consultation    with the weird sisters and soothsayers. Thus the king, who had proved with his    pert the supposed sorcerers to be the direct enemies of the Deity, and who conceived    he knew them from experience to be his own -- who, moreover, had upon much lighter    occasions (as in the case of Vorstius) showed no hesitation at throwing his    royal authority into the scale to aid his arguments -- very naturally used his    influence, when it was at the highest, to extend and enforce the laws against    a crime which he both hated and feared. 
 </p><p>      The English statute against witchcraft, passed    in the very first year of that reign, is therefore of a most special nature,    describing witchcraft by all the various modes and ceremonies in which, according    to King James's fancy, that crime could be perpetrated; each of which was declared    felony, without benefit of clergy. 
 </p><p>      This gave much wider scope I o prosecution on    the statute than had existed under the milder acts of Elizabeth. Men might now    be punished for the practice of witchcraft, as itself a crime, without necessary    reference to the ulterior objects of the perpetrator. It is remarkable that    in the same year, when the legislature rather adopted the passions and fears    of the king than expressed their own by this fatal enactment, the Convocation    of the Church evinced a very different spirit; for, seeing the ridicule brought    on their sacred profession by forward and presumptuous men, in the  attempt to relieve demoniacs from a disease which    was commonly occasioned by natural causes, if not the mere creature of imposture,    they passed a canon, establishing that no minister or ministers should in future    attempt to expel any devil or, devils, without the license of his bishop ; thereby    virtually putting a stop to a fertile source of knavery among the people, and    disgraceful folly among the inferior church-men. 
 </p><p>      The new statute of James does not, however,    appear to have led at first to many prosecutions. One of the most remarkable    was (<i>proh pudor!</i>) instigated by a gentleman, a scholar of classical taste,    and a beautiful poet, being no other than Edward Fairfax of Fayston, in Knaresborough    Forest, the translator of Tasso's "Jerusalem Delivered." In allusion to his    credulity on such subjects, Collins has introduced the following elegant lines:    --  <br> <br> "How have I sate while piped the pensive wind, <br> To hear thy harp, by British Fairfax strung; <br> Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind <br> Believed the magic wonders which he sung!" <br> 
 </p><p>     Like Mr. Throgmorton in the Warbois case, Mr.    Fairfax accused six of his neighbours of tormenting his children by fits of    an extraordinary kind, by imps, and by appearing before the afflicted in their    own shape during the crisis of these operations. The admitting this last circumstance    to be a legitimate mode of proof, gave a most cruel advantage against the accused,    for it could not, according to the ideas of the demonologists, be confuted even    by the most distinct <i>alibi</i>. To a defence of that sort it was replied    that the afflicted person did not see the actual witch, whose corporeal presence    must indeed have been obvious to every one in the room as well as to the afflicted,    but that the evidence of the sufferers related to the appearance of their <i>spectre</i>,    or apparition; and this was accounted a sure sign of guilt in those whose forms    were so manifested during the fits of the afflicted, and who were complained    of and cried  out upon by the victim. The obvious tendency    of this doctrine, as to visionary or spectral evidence, as it was called, was    to place the life and fame of the accused in the power of any hypochondriac    patient or malignant impostor, who might either seem to see, or aver she saw,    the spectrum of the accused old man or old woman, as if enjoying and urging    on the afflictions which she complained of; and, strange to tell, the fatal    sentence was to rest, not upon the truth of the witnesses' eyes, but that of    their imagination. It happened fortunately for Fairfax's memory, that the objects    of his prosecution were persons of good character, and that the judge was a    man of sense, and made so wise and skilful a charge to the jury, that they brought    in a verdict of not guilty. 
 </p><p>      The celebrated case of " the Lancashire witches"    (whose name was and will be long remembered, partly from Shadwell's play, but    more from the ingenious and well-merited compliment to the beauty of the females    of that province which it was held to contain), followed soon after. Whether    the first notice of this sorcery sprung from the idle head of a mischievous    boy, is uncertain; but there is no doubt that it was speedily caught up and    fostered for the purpose of gain. The original story ran thus: --  
 </p><p>      These Lancaster trials were at two periods,    the one in 1613, before Sir James Altham and Sir Edward Bromley, Barons of Exchequer,    when nineteen witches were tried at once at Lancaster, and another of the name    of Preston at York. The report against these people is drawn up by Thomas Potts.    An obliging correspondent sent me a sight of a copy of this curious and rare    book. The chief person age in the drama is Elizabeth Southam, a witch redoubted    under the name of Dembdike, an account of whom may be seen in Mr. Roby's " Antiquities    of Lancaster," as well as a description of Manikins' Tower, the witches' place    of meeting. It appears that this remote county was full of Popish recusants,    travelling priests, and so forth; and some  of their spells are given in which the holy names    and things alluded to form a strange contrast with the purpose to which they    were applied, as to secure a good brewing of ale or the like. The public imputed    to the accused parties a long train of murders, conspiracies, charms, mis-chances,    hellish and damnable practices, " apparent," says the editor, " on their own    examinations and confessions," and, to speak the truth, visible nowhere else.    Mother Dembdike had the good luck to die before conviction. Among other tales,    we have one of two <i>female</i> devils, called Fancy and Tib. It is remarkable    that some of the unfortunate women endeavoured to transfer the guilt from themselves    to others with whom they had old quarrels, which confessions were held good    evidence against those who made them, and against the alleged accomplice also.    Several of the unhappy women were found not guilty, to the great displeasure    of the ignorant people of the county. Such was the first edition of the Lancashire    witches. In that which follows the accusation can be more clearly traced to    the most villanous conspiracy. 
 </p><p>     About 1634 a boy called Edmund Robinson, whose    father, a very poor man, dwelt in Pendle Forest, the scene of the alleged witching,    declared that while gathering <i>bullees</i> (wild plums, perhaps) in one of    the glades of the forest, he saw two greyhounds, which he imagined to belong    to gentlemen in that neighbourhood. The boy reported that, seeing nobody following    them, he proposed to have a course; but though a hare was started, the dogs    refused to run. On this, young Robinson was about to punish them with a switch,    when one Dame Dickenson, a neighbour's wife, started up instead of the one greyhound;    a little boy instead of the other. The witness averred that Mother Dickenson    offered him money to conceal what he had seen, which he refused, saying " Nay,    thou art a witch." Apparently she was determined he should have full evidence    of the truth of what he said, for, like the Magician Queen in the Arabian Tales,  she pulled out of her pocket a bridle and shook    it over the head of the boy who had so lately represented the other greyhound.    He was directly changed into a horse; Mother Dickenson mounted, and took Robinson    before her. They then rode to a large house or barn called Hourstoun, into which    Edmund Robinson entered with others. He there saw six or seven persons pulling    at halters, from which, as they pulled them, meat ready dressed came flying    in quantities, together with lumps of butter, porringers of milk, and whatever    else might, in the boy's fancy, complete a rustic feast. He declared that while    engaged in the charm they made such ugly faces and looked so fiendish that he    was frightened. There was more to the same purpose -- as the boy's having seen    one of these haps sitting half-way up his father's chimney, and some such goodly    matter. But it ended in near a score of persons being committed to prison; and    the consequence was that young Robinson was carried from church to church in    the neighbourhood, that he might recognise the faces of any persons he had seen    at the rendezvous of witches. Old Robinson, who had been an evidence against    the former witches in 1613, went along with his son, and knew, doubtless, how    to make his journey profitable; and his son probably took care to recognise    none who might make a handsome consideration. " This boy," says Webster, " was    brought into the church at Kildwick, a parish church, where I, being then curate    there, was preaching at the time, to look about him, which made some little    disturbance for the time." After prayers Mr. Webster sought and found the boy,    and two very unlikely persons, who, says he, " did conduct him and manage the    business: I did desire some discourse with the boy in private, but that they    utterly denied. In the presence of a great many many people I took the boy near    me and said, ' Good boy, tell me truly and in earnest, didst thou hear and see    such strange things of the motions of the witches as many do report that thou    didst relate, or did not some person teach thee  to say such things of thyself?' But the two men    did pluck the boy from me, and said be had been examined by two able justices    of peace, and they never asked him such a question. To whom I replied, ' The    persons accused had the more wrong.'" The boy afterwards acknowledged, in his    more advanced years, that he was instructed and suborned to swear these things    against the accused persons by his father and others, and was heard often to    confess that on the day which be pretended to see the said witches at the house    or barn, he was gathering plums in a neighbour's orchard. <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">56</font></a> 
 </p><p>      There was now approaching a time when the law    against witchcraft, sufficiently bloody in itself, was to be pushed to more    violent extremities than the quiet scepticism of the Church of England clergy    gave way to. The great Civil War had been preceded and anticipated by the fierce    disputes of the ecclesiastical parties. The rash and ill-judged attempt to enforce    upon the Scottish a compliance with the government and ceremonies of the High    Church divines, and the severe prosecutions in the Star Chamber and Prerogative    Courts, had given the Presbyterian system, for a season a great degree of popularity    in England; and as the King's party declined during the Civil War, and the state    of church-government was altered, the influence of the Calvinistic divines increased.    With much strict morality and pure practice of religion, it is to be regretted    these were still marked by unhesitating belief in the existence of sorcery,    and a keen desire to extend and enforce the legal penalties against it. Wier    has considered the clergy of every sect as being too eager in this species of    persecution: <i>Ad gravem hanc impietatem, connivent theologi plerique omnes</i>.    But it is not to be denied that the Presbyterian ecclesiastics who, in Scotland,    were often appointed by the Privy Council Commissioners for the trial of witchcraft,    evinced a very extraordinary degree of credulity in such cases, and that the    temporary superiority of the same sect in England was  marked by enormous cruelties of this kind. To    this general error must impute the misfortune that good men, such as Calamy    and Baxter, should have countenanced or defended such proceedings as those of    the impudent and cruel wretch called Matthew Hopkins, who, in those unsettled    times, when men did what seemed good in their own eyes, assumed the title of    Witchfinder General, and, travelling through the counties of Essex, Sussex,    Norfolk, and Huntingdon, pretended to discover witches, superintending their    examination by the most unheard-of tortures, and compelling forlorn and miserable    wretches to admit and confess matters equally absurd and impossible; the issue    of which was the forfeiture of their lives. Before examining these cases more    minutely, I will quote Baxter's own words; for no one can have less desire to    wrong a devout and conscientious man, such as that divine most unquestionably    was, though borne aside on this occasion by prejudice and credulity. 
 </p><p>      The hanging of a great number of witches in    1645 and 1646 is famously known. Mr. Calamy went along with the judges on the    circuit to hear their confessions, and see there was no fraud or wrong done    them. I spoke with many understanding, pious, learned, and credible persons    that lived in the counties, and some that went to them in the prisons, and heard    their sad confessions. Among the rest an old <i>reading.parson</i>, named Lowis,    not far from Framlingham, was one that was hanged, who confessed that he had    two imps, and that one of them was always putting him upon doing mischief; and    he, being near the sea, as he saw a ship under sail, it moved him to send it    to sink the ship; and be consented, and saw the ship sink before them." Mr.    Baxter passes on to another story of a mother who gave her child an imp like    a mole, and told her to keep it in a can near the fire, and she would never    want; and more such stuff as nursery-maids tell froward children to keep them    quiet. 
 </p><p>     It is remarkable that in this passage Baxter    names the  Witchfinder General rather slightly as " one    Hopkins," and without doing him the justice due to one who had discovered more    than one hundred witches, and brought them to confessions, which that good man    received as indubitable. Perhaps the learned divine was one of those who believed    that the Witchfinder General had cheated the devil out of a certain memorandum-book,    in which Satan, for the benefit of his memory certainly, had entered all the    witches' names in England, and that Hopkins availed himself of this record." <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">57</font></a> 
 </p><p>      It may be noticed that times of misrule and    violence seem to create individuals fatted to take advantage from them, and    having a character suited to the seasons which raise them into notice and action;    just as a blight on any tree or vegetable calls to life a peculiar insect to    feed upon and enjoy the decay which it has produced. A monster like Hopkins    could only have existed during the confusion of civil dissension. He was perhaps    a native of Manningtree, in Essex; at any rate, he resided there in the year    1644, when an epidemic outcry of witchcraft arose in that town. Upon this occasion    he had made himself busy, and, affecting more zeal and knowledge than other    men, learned his trade of a witchfinder, as he pretends, from experiment. He    was afterwards permitted to perform it as a legal profession, and moved from    one place to another, with an assistant named Sterne, and a female. In his defence    against an accusation of fleecing the country, he declares his regular charge    was twenty shillings a town, including charges of living and journeying thither    and back again with his assistants. He also affirms that he went nowhere unless    called and invited. His principal mode of discovery was  to strip the accused persons naked, and thrust    pins into various parts of their body, to discover the witch's mark, which was    supposed to be inflicted by the devil as a sign of his sovereignty, and at which    she was also said to suckle her imps. He also practised and stoutly defended    the trial by swimming, when the suspected person was wrapped in a sheet, having    the great toes and thumbs tied together, and so dragged through a pond or river.    If she sank, it was received in favour of the accused; but if the body floated    (which must have occurred ten times for once, if it was placed with care on    the surface of the water), the accused was condemned, on the principle of King    James, who, in treating of this mode of trial, lays down that, as witches have    renounced their baptism, so it is just that the element through which the holy    rite is enforced should reject them, which is a figure of speech, and no argument.    It was Hopkins's custom to keep the poor wretches waking, in order to prevent    them from having encouragement from the devil, and, doubtless, to put infirm,    terrified, overwatched persons in the next state to absolute madness; and for    the same purpose they were dragged about by their keepers till extreme weariness    and the pain of blistered feet might form additional inducements to confession.    Hopkins confesses these last practices of keeping the accused persons waking    and forcing them to walk for the same purpose had been originally used by him.    But as his tract is a professed answer to charges of cruelty and oppression,    he affirms that both practices were then disused, and that they had not of    late been resorted to. 
 </p><p>      The boast of the English nation is a manly independence    and common-sense, which will not long permit the license of tyranny or oppression    on the meanest and most obscure sufferers. Many clergymen and gentlemen made    head against the practices of this cruel oppressor of the defence-less, and    it required courage to do so when such an unscrupulous villain had so much interest.   Mr. Gaul, a clergyman, of Houghton, in Huntingdonshire,    had the courage to appear in print on the weaker side; and Hopkins, in consequence,    assumed the assurance to write to some functionaries of the place the following    letter, which is an admirable medley of impudence, bullying, and cowardice:-- 
 </p><p>      " My service to your worship presented.--I have    this day received a letter to come to a town called Great Houghton to search    for evil-disposed person's called witches (though I hear your minister is far    against us, through ignorance). I intend to come, God willing, the sooner to    hear his singular judgment in the behalf of such parties. I have known a minister    in Suffolk as much against this discovery in a pulpit, and forced to recant    it by the Committee <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">58</font></a> in the same place. I much marvel such    evil men should have any (much more any of the clergy, who should daily speak    terror to convince such offenders) stand up to take their parts against such    as are complainants for the king, and sufferers themselves, with their families    and estates. I intend to give your town a visit suddenly. I will come to Kimbolton    this week, and it will be ten to one but I will come to your town first; but    I would certainly know before whether your town affords many sticklers for such    cattle, or is willing to give and allow us good welcome and entertainment, as    others where I have been, else I shall waive your shire (not as yet beginning    in any part of it myself), and betake me to such places where I do and may punish    (not only) without control, but with thanks and recompense. So I humbly take    my leave, and rest your servant to be commanded, 
 </p><p>     " Matthew Hopkins." 
 </p><p>      The sensible and courageous Mr. Gaul describes    the tortures employed by this fellow as equal to any practised in the Inquisition.    " Having taken the suspected witch, she is placed in the middle of a room, upon    a stool or table,  cross-legged, or in some other uneasy posture,    to which, if she submits not, she is then bound with cords; there she is watched    and kept without meat or sleep for four-and-twenty hours, for, they say, they    shall within that time see her imp come and suck. A little hole is likewise    made in the door for the imps to come in at; and lest they should come in some    less discernible shape, they that watch are taught to be ever and anon sweeping    the room, and if they see any spiders or flies, to kill them; and if they cannot    kill them, they may be sure they are their imps." 
 </p><p>      If torture of this kind was applied to the Reverend    Mr. Lewis, whose death is too slightly announced by Mr. Baxter, we can conceive    him, or any man, to have indeed become so weary of his life as to acknowledge    that, by means of his imps, he sunk a vessel, without any purpose of gratification    to be procured to himself by such iniquity. But in another cause a judge would    have demanded some proof of the <i>corpus delecti,</i> some evidence of a vessel    being lost at the period, whence coming and whither bound; in short, something    to establish that the whole story was not the idle imagination of a man who    might have been entirely deranged, and certainly was so at the time he made    the admission. John Lewis was presented to the vicarage of Brandiston, near    Framlington in Suffolk, 6th May, 1596, where he lived about fifty years, till    executed as a wizard on such evidence as we have seen. Notwithstanding the story    of his alleged confession, be defended himself courageously at his trial, and    was probably condemned rather as a royalist and malignant than for any other    cause. He showed at the execution considerable energy, and to secure that the    funeral service of the church should be said over his body, he read it aloud    for himself while on the road to the gibbet. 
 </p><p>      We have seen that in 1647 Hopkins's tone became    lowered, and he began to disavow some of the cruelties he had formerly practised.    About the same time a miserable old woman had fallen into the cruel hands of    this miscreant  near Hoxne, a village in Suffolk, and had confessed    all the usual enormities, after being without food or rest a sufficient time.    " Her imp," she said, " was called Nan." A gentleman in the neighbourhood, whose    widow survived to authenticate the story, was so indignant that he went to the    house, took the woman out of such inhuman bands, dismissed the witchfinders,    and after due food and rest the poor old woman could recollect nothing of the    confession, but that she gave a favourite pullet the name of Nan. For this Dr.    Hutchison may be referred to, who quotes a letter from the relict of the humane    gentleman. 
 </p><p>      In the year 1645 a Commission of Parliament    was sent down, comprehending two clergymen in esteem with the leading party,    one of whom, Mr. Fairclough of Kellar, preached before the rest on the subject    of witchcraft; and after this appearance of enquiry the inquisitions and executions    went on as before. But the popular indignation was so strongly excited against    Hopkins, that some gentlemen seized on him, and put him to his own favourite    experiment of swimming, on which, as he happened to float, he stood convicted    of witchcraft and so the country was rid of him. Whether he was drowned outright    or not does not exactly appear, but he has had the honour to be commemorated    by the author of Hudibras: --  <br> <br> "Hath not this present Parliament <br> A leiger to the devil sent, <br> Fully empower'd to treat about <br> Finding revolted witches out? <br> And has he not within a year <br> Hang'd threescore of them in one shire? <br> Some only for not being drown'd, <br> And some for sitting above ground <br> Whole days and nights upon their breeches, <br> And feeling pain, were hang'd for witches. <br> And some for putting knavish tricks <br> Upon green geese or turkey chicks; <br> Or pigs that suddenly deceased <br> Of griefs unnatural, as he guess'd,  Who proved himself at length a witch, <br> And made a rod for his own breech."  <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">59</font></a> <br> 
 </p><p>      The understanding reader will easily conceive    that this alteration of the current in favour of those who disapproved of witch-prosecutions,    must have received encouragement from some quarter of weight and influence yet    it may sound strangely enough that this spirit of lenity should have been the    result of the peculiar principles of those sectarians of all denominations,    classed in general as Independents, who, though they had originally courted    the Presbyterians as the more numerous and prevailing party, had at length shaken    themselves loose of that connexion, and finally combated with and overcome them.    The Independents were distinguished by the wildest license in their religious    tenets, mixed with much that was nonsensical and mystical. They disowned even    the title of a regular clergy, and allowed the preaching of any one who could    draw together a congregation that would support him, or who was willing, without    recompense, to minister to the spiritual necessities of his bearers. Although    such laxity of discipline afforded scope to the wildest enthusiasm, and room    for all possible varieties of doctrine, it had, on the other hand, this inestimable    recommendation, that it contributed to a degree of general toleration which    was at that time unknown to any other Christian establishment. The very genius    of a religion which admitted of the subdivision of sects <i>ad infinitum</i>,    excluded a legal prosecution of any one of these for heresy or apostasy. If    there had even existed a sect of Manichæans, who made it their practice    to adore the Evil Principle, it may be doubted whether the other sectaries would    have accounted them absolute outcasts from the pale of the church; and, fortunately,    the same sentiment induced them to regard with horror the prosecutions against    witchcraft. Thus the Independents, when, under Cromwell, they attained a supremacy    over the Presbyterians, who to a certain point  had been their allies, were disposed to counteract    the violence of such proceedings under pretence of witchcraft, as had been driven    forward by the wretched Hopkins, in Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, for three or    four years previous to 1647. 
 </p><p>      The return of Charles II. to his crown and kingdom,    served in some measure to restrain the general and wholesale manner in which    the laws against witchcraft had been administered during the warmth of the Civil    War. The statute of the 1st of King James, nevertheless, yet subsisted; nor    is it in the least likely, considering the character of the prince, that he,    to save the lives of a few old men or women, would have ran the risk of incurring    the odium of encouraging or sparing a crime still held in horror by a great    part of his subjects. The statute, however, was generally administered by wise    and skilful judges, and the accused had such a chance of escape as the rigour    of the absurd law permitted. 
 </p><p>      Nonsense, it is too obvious, remained in some    cases predominant. In the year 1663 an old dame, named Julian Coxe, was convicted    chiefly on the evidence of a huntsman, who declared on his oath, that he laid    his greyhounds on a hare, and coming up to the spot where he saw them mouth    her, there he found, on the other side of a bush, Julian Coxe lying panting    and breathless, in such a manner as to convince him that she had been the creature    which afforded him the course. The unhappy woman was executed on this evidence. 
 </p><p>      Two years afterwards (1664), it is with regret    we must quote the venerable and devout Sir Matthew Hales, as presiding at a    trial, in consequence of which Amy Dunny and Rose Callender were hanged at Saint    Edmondsbury. But no man, unless very peculiarly circumstanced, can extricate    himself from the prejudices of his nation and age. The evidence against the    accused was laid, 1st, on the effect of spells used by ignorant persons to counteract    the supposed  witchcraft; the use of which was, under the statute    of James I., as criminal as the act of sorcery which such counter-charms were    meant to neutralize. 2ndly, The two old women, refused even the privilege of    purchasing some herrings, having expressed themselves with angry impatience,    a child of the herring-merchant fell ill in conseqence. 3rdly, A cart was driven    against the miserable cottage of Amy Dunny. She scolded, of course; and shortly    after the cart -- (what a good driver will scarce comprehend) -- stuck fast    in a gate, where its wheels touched neither of the posts, and yet was moved    easily forward on one of the posts (by which it was not impeded) being cut down.    4thly, One of the afflicted girls being closely muffled, went suddenly into    a fit upon being touched by one of the supposed witches. But upon another trial    it was found that the person so blindfolded fell into the same rage at the touch    of an unsuspected person. What perhaps sealed the fate of the accused was the    evidence of the celebrated Sir Thomas Browne, " that the fits were natural,    but heightened by the power of the devil co-operating with the malice of witches;"    -- a strange opinion, certainly, from the author of a treatise on " Vulgar Errors    !" <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">60</font></a> 
 </p><p>      But the torch of science was now fairly lighted,    and gleamed in more than one kingdom of the world, shooting its rays on every    side, and catching at all means which were calculated to increase the illumination.    The Royal Society, which had taken its rise at Oxford from a private association    who met in Dr. Wilkin's chambers about the year 1652, was, the year after the    Restoration, incorporated by royal charter, and began to publish their Transactions,    and give a new and more rational character to the pursuits of philosophy. 
 </p><p>      In France, where the mere will of the government    could accomplish greater changes, the consequence of an enlarged  spirit of scientific discovery was, that a decisive    stop was put to the witch-prosecutions which had heretofore been as common in    that kingdom as in England. About the year 1672 there was a general arrest of    very many shepherds and others in Normandy, and the Parliament of Rouen prepared    to proceed in the investigation with the usual severity. But an order, or <i>arret</i>,    from the king (Louis XIV.), with advice of his council, commanding all these    unfortunate persons to be set at liberty and protected, had the most salutary    effects all over the kingdom. The French Academy of Sciences was also founded;    and, in imitation, a society of learned Germans established a similar institution    at Leipsic. Prejudices, however old, were overawed and controlled -- much was    accounted for on natural principles that had hitherto been imputed to spiritual    agency -- everything seemed to promise that farther access to the secrets of    nature might be opened to those who should prosecute their studies experimentally    and by analysis -- and the mass of ancient opinions which overwhelmed the dark    subject of which we treat began to be derided and rejected by men of sense and    education. 
 </p><p>      In many cases the prey was now snatched from    the spoiler. A pragmatical justice of peace in Somersetshire commenced a course    of enquiry after offenders against the statute of James I., and had he been    allowed to proceed, Mr. Hunt might have gained a name as renowned for witch-finding    as that of Mr. Hopkins; but his researches were stopped from higher authority    -- the lives of the poor people arrested (twelve in number) were saved, and    the country remained at quiet, though the supposed witches were suffered to    live. The examinations attest some curious particulars, which may be found in    <i>Sadducismus Triumphalus</i>: for among the usual string of froward, fanciful,    or, as they were called, afflicted children, brought forward to club their startings,    starings, and screamings, there appeared also certain remarkable confessions    of the accused, from which  we learn that the Somerset Satan enlisted his    witches, like a wily recruiting sergeant, with one shilling in hand and twelve    in promises ; that when the party of weird-sisters passed to the witch-meeting    they used the magic words, <i>Thout, tout, throughout, and about</i>; and that    when they departed they exclaimed, <i>Rentum, Tormentum !</i> We are further    informed that his Infernal Highness, on his departure, leaves a smell and that    (in nursery-maid's phrase) not a pretty one, behind him. Concerning this fact    we have a curious exposition by Mr. Glanville. " This," -- according to that    respectable authority, " seems to imply the reality of the business, those ascititious    particles which he held together in his sensible shape being loosened at the    vanishing, and so offending the nostrils by their floating and diffusing themselves    in the open air." <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">61</font></a> How much are we bound to regret that Mr.    Justice Hunt's discovery " of this hellish kind of witches," in itself so clear    and plain, and containing such valuable information, should have been smothered    by meeting with opposition and discouragement from some then in authority ! 
 </p><p>      Lord Keeper Guildford was also a stifler of    the proceedings against witches. Indeed, we may generally remark, during the    latter part of the seventeenth century, that where the judges were men of education    and courage, sharing in the information of the times, they were careful to check    the precipitate ignorance and prejudice of the juries, by giving them a more    precise idea of the indifferent value of confessions by the accused themselves,    and of testimony derived from the pretended visions of those supposed to be    bewitched. Where, on the contrary, judges shared with the vulgar in their ideas    of such fascination, or were contented to leave the evidence with the jury,    fearful to withstand the general cry too common on such occasions, a verdict    of guilty often followed. 
 </p><p>      We are informed by Roger North that a case of    this kind happened at the assizes in Exeter, where his brother,  the Lord Chief justice, did not interfere with    the crown trials, and the other. judge left for execution a poor old woman,    condemned, as usual, on her own confession, and on the testimony of a neighbour,    who deponed that he saw a cat jump into the accused person's cottage window    at twilight, one evening, and that he verily believed the said cat to be the    devil; on which precious testimony the poor wretch was accordingly hanged. On    another occasion, about the same time, the passions of the great and little    vulgar were so much excited by the aquittal of an aged village dame, whom the    judge had taken some pains to rescue, that Sir John Long, a man of rank and    fortune, came to the judge in the greatest perplexity, requesting that the hag    might not be permitted to return to her miserable cottage on his estates, since    all his tenants had in that case threatened to leave him. In compassion to a    gentleman who apprehended ruin from a cause so whimsical, the dangerous old    woman was appointed to be kept by the town where she was acquitted, at the rate    of half-a-crown a week, paid by the parish to which she belonged. But behold!    in the period betwixt the two assizes Sir John Long and his farmers had mustered    courage enough to petition that this witch should be sent back to them in all    her terrors, because they could support her among them at a shilling a week    cheaper than they were obliged to pay to the town for her maintenance. In a    subsequent trial before Lord Chief justice North himself, that judge detected    one of those practices which, it is to be feared, were too common at the time,    when witnesses found their advantage in feigning themselves bewitched. A woman,    supposed to be the victim of the male sorcerer at the bar, vomited pins in quantities,    and those straight, differing from the crooked pins usually produced at such    times, and less easily concealed in the mouth. The judge, however, discovered,    by cross-examining a candid witness, that in counterfeiting her fits of convulsion    the woman sunk her head on her  breast, so as to take up with her lips the pins    which she had placed ready in her stomacher. The man was acquitted, of course.    A frightful old hag, who was present, distinguished herself so much by her benedictions    on the judge, that he asked the cause of the peculiar interest which she took    in the acquittal. " Twenty years ago," said the poor woman, " they would have    hanged me for a witch, but could not; and now, but for your lordship, they would    have murdered my innocent son." <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="lodw09.htm#fn_61"><font size="1">62</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Such scenes happened frequently on the assizes,    while country gentlemen, like the excellent Sir Roger de Coverley, retained    a private share in the terror with which their tenants, servants, and retainers    regarded some old Moll White, who put the hounds at fault and ravaged the fields    with hail and hurricanes. Sir John Reresby, after an account of a poor woman    tried for a witch at York in 1686 and acquitted, as he thought, very properly,    proceeds to tell us that, notwithstanding, the sentinel upon the jail where    she was confined avowed " that he saw a scroll of paper creep from under the    prison-door, and then change itself first into a monkey and then into a turkey,    which the under-keeper confirmed. This," says Sir John, "I have heard from the    mouth of both, and now leave it to be believed or disbelieved as the reader    may be inclined. <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="lodw09.htm#fn_62"><font size="1">63</font></a> We    may see that Reresby, a statesman and a soldier, had not as yet " plucked the    old woman out of his heart." Even Addison himself ventured no farther in his    incredulity respecting this crime than to contend that although witchcraft might    and did exist, there was no such thing as a modern instance competently proved. 
 </p><p>     As late as 1682 three unhappy women named Susan    Edwards, Mary Trembles, and Temperance Lloyd were hanged at Exeter for witchcraft,    and, as usual, on their own confession. This is believed to be the last execution    of  the kind in England under form of judicial sentence.    But the ancient superstition, so interesting to vulgar credulity, like sediment    clearing itself from water, sunk down in a deeper shade upon the ignorant and    lowest classes of society in proportion as the higher regions were purified    from its influence. The populace, including the ignorant of every class, were    more enraged against witches when their passions were once excited in proportion    to the lenity exercised towards the objects of their indignation by those who    administered the laws. Several cases occurred in which the mob, impressed with    a conviction of the guilt of some destitute old creatures, took the law into    their own hands, and proceeding upon such evidence as Hopkins would have had    recourse to, at once, in their own apprehension, ascertained their criminality    and administered the deserved punishment. 
 </p><p>      The following instance of such illegal and inhuman    proceedings occurred at Oakly, near Bedford, on 12th July, 1707. There was one    woman, upwards of sixty years of age, who, being under an imputation of witchcraft,    was desirous to escape from so foul a suspicion, and to conciliate the good-will    of her neighbours, by allowing them to duck her. The parish officers so far    consented to their humane experiment as to promise the poor woman a guinea if    she should clear herself by sinking. The unfortunate object was tied up in a    wet sheet, her thumbs and great toes were bound together, her cap torn off,    and all her apparel searched for pins; for there is an idea that a single pin    spoils the operation of the charm. She was then dragged through the river Ouse    by a rope tied round her middle. Unhappily for the poor woman, her body floated,    though her head remained under water. The experiment was made three times with    the same effect. The cry to hang or drown the witch then became general, and    as she lay half-dead on the bank they loaded the wretch with reproaches, and    hardly forbore blows. A single humane bystander took her part, and exposed himself  to rough usage for doing so. Luckily one of the    mob themselves at length suggested the additional experiment of weighing the    witch against the church Bible. The friend of humanity caught at this means    of escape, supporting the proposal by the staggering argument that the Scripture,    being the work of God himself, must outweigh necessarily all the operations    or vassals of the devil. The reasoning was received as conclusive, the more    readily as it promised a new species of amusement. The woman was then weighed    against a church Bible of twelve pounds jockey weight, and as she was considerably    preponderant, was dismissed with honour. But many of the mob counted her acquittal    irregular, and would have had the poor dame drowned or hanged on the result    of her ducking, as the more authentic species of trial. 
 </p><p>      At length a similar piece of inhumanity, which    had a very different conclusion, led to the final abolition of the statute of    James I. as affording countenance for such brutal proceedings. An aged pauper,    named Osborne, and his wife, who resided near Tring, in Staffordshire, fell    under the suspicion of the mob on account of supposed witchcraft. The overseers    of the poor, understanding that the rabble entertained a purpose of swimming    these infirm creatures, which indeed they had expressed in a sort of proclamation,    endeavoured to oppose their purpose by securing the unhappy couple in the vestry-room,    which they barricaded. They were unable, however, to protect them in the manner    they intended. The mob forced the door, seized the accused, and, with ineffable    brutality, continued dragging the wretches through a pool of water till the    woman lost her life. A brute in human form, who had superintended the murder,    went among the spectators, and requested money for the sport he had shown them    ! The life of the other victim was with great difficulty saved. Three men were    tried for their share in this inhuman action. Only one of them, named Colley,    was condemned and hanged. When he came to execution, the rabble, instead of    crowding round the gallows as usual,  stood at a distance, and abused those who were    putting. to death, they said, an honest fellow for ridding the parish of an    accursed witch. This abominable murder was committed July 30, 1751 
 </p><p>      The repetitition of such horrors, the proneness    of the people to so cruel and heart-searing a superstition, was traced by the    legislature to its source, namely, the yet un-abolished statute of James I Accordingly,    by the 9th George II. cap. 5, that odious law, so long the object of horror    to all ancient and poverty-stricken females in the kingdom, was abrogated, and    all criminal procedure on the subject of sorcery or witchcraft discharged in    future through-out Great Britain; reserving for such as should pretend to the    skill of fortune-tellers, discoverers of stolen goods, or the like, the punishment    of the correction-house, as due to rogues and vagabonds. Since that period witchcraft    has been little heard of in England, and although the belief in its existence    has in remote places survived the law that recognised the evidence of the crime,    and assigned its punishment -- yet such faith is gradually becoming forgotten    since the rabble have been deprived of all pretext to awaken it by their own    riotous proceedings. Some rare instances have occurred of attempts similar to    that for which Colley suffered; and I observe one is preserved in that curious    register of knowledge, Mr. Hone's " Popular Amusements," from which it appears    that as late as the end of last century this brutality was practised, though    happily without loss of life. 
 </p><p>      The Irish statute against witchcraft still exists,    as it would seem. Nothing occurred in that kingdom which recommended its being    formally annulled; but it is considered as obsolete, and should so wild a thing    be attempted in the present day, no procedure, it is certain, would now be permitted    to lie upon it. 
 </p><p>      If anything were wanted to confirm the general    proposition that the epidemic terror of witchcraft increases and becomes  general in proportion to the increase of prosecutions    against witches, it would be sufficient to quote certain extraordinary occurrences    in New England. Only a brief account can be here given of the dreadful hallucination    under wich colonists of that province were for a time deluded and oppressed    by a strange contagious terror, and how suddenly and singularly it was cured,    even by its own excess; but is too strong evidence of the imaginary character    of this hideous disorder to be altogether suppressed. 
 </p><p>      New England, as is well known, was peopled mainly    by emigrants who had been disgusted with the government of Charles I. in church    and state, previous to the great Civil War. Many of the more wealthy settlers    were Presbyterians and Calvinists; others, fewer in number and less influential    from their fortune, were Quakers, Anabaptists, or members of the other sects    who were included under the general name of Independents. The Calvinists brought    with them the same zeal for religion and strict morality which everywhere distinguished    them. Unfortunately, they were not wise according to their zeal, but entertained    a proneness to believe in supernatural and direct personal intercourse between    the devil and his vassals, an error to which, as we have endeavoured to show,    their brethren in Europe had from the beginning been peculiarly subject. In    a country imperfectly cultivated, and where the partially improved spots were    embosomed in inaccessible forests, inhabited by numerous tribes of savages,    it was natural that a disposition to superstition should rather gain than lose    ground, and that to other dangers and horrors with which they were surrounded,    the colonists should have added fears of the devil, not merely as the Evil Principle    tempting human nature to sin, and thus endangering our salvation, but as combined    with sorcerers and witches to inflict death and torture upon children and others. 
 </p><p>      The first case which I observe was that of four    children of a person called John Goodwin, a mason. The eldest, a  girl, had quarrelled with the laundress of the    family about some linen which was amissing. The mother of the laundress, an    ignorant, testy, and choleric old Irishwoman, scolded the accuser; and shortly    after, the elder Goodwin, her sister and two brothers, were seized with such    strange diseases that all their neighbours concluded they were bewitched. They    conducted themselves as those supposed to suffer under maladies created by such    influence were accustomed to do. They stiffened their necks so hard at one time    that the joints could not be moved; at another time their necks were so flexible    and supple that it seemed the bone was dissolved. They had violent convulsions,    in which their jaws snapped with the force of a spring-trap set for vermin.    Their limbs were curiously contorted, and to those who had a taste for the marvellous,    seemed entirely dislocated and displaced. Amid these distortions, they cried    out against the poor old woman, whose name was Glover, alleging that she was    in presence with them adding to their torments. The miserable Irishwoman, who    hardly could speak the English language, repeated her Pater Noster and Ave Maria    like a good Catholic; but there were some words which she had forgotten. She    was therefore supposed to be unable to pronounce the whole consistently and    correctly, and condemned and executed accordingly. 
 </p><p>      But the children of Goodwin found the trade    they were engaged in to be too profitable to be laid aside, and the eldest in    particular continued all the external signs of witchcraft and possession. Some    of these were excellently calculated to flatter the self-opinion and prejudices    of the Calvinist ministers by whom she was attended, and accordingly bear in    their very front the character of studied and voluntary imposture. The young    woman, acting, as was supposed, under the influence of the devil, read a Quaker    treatise with ease and apparent satisfaction; but a book written against the    poor inoffensive Friends the devil would not allow his victim to touch. She    could look on a Church of England  Prayer-book, and read the portions of Scripture    which it contains without difficulty or impediment; but the which possessed    her threw her into fits if she attempted to read the same Scriptures from the    Bible, as if the awe which it is supposed the fiends entertain for Holy Writ    depended, not on the meaning of the words, but the arrangement of the page,    and the type in which they were printed. This singular species of flattery was    designed to captivate the clergyman through his professional opinions; others    were more strictly personal. The afflicted damsel seems to have been somewhat    of the humour of the Inamorata of Messrs. Smack, Pluck, Catch, and Company,    and had, like her, merry as well as melancholy fits. She often imagined that    her attendant spirits brought her a handsome pony to ride off with them to their    rendezvous. On such occasions she made a spring upwards, as if to mount her    horse, and then, still seated on her chair, mimicked with dexterity and agility    the motions of the animal pacing, trotting, and galloping, like a child on the    nurse's knee; but when she cantered in this manner upstairs, she affected inability    to enter the clergyman's study, and when she was pulled into it by force, used    to become quite well, and stand up as a rational being. " Reasons were given    for this," says the simple minister, " that seem more kind than true." Shortly    after this, she appears to have treated the poor divine with a species of sweetness    and attention, which gave him greater embarrassment than her former violence.    She used to break in upon him at his studies to importune him to come downstairs,    and thus advantaged doubtless the kingdom of Satan by the interruption of his    pursuits. At length the Goodwins were, or appeared to be, cured. But the example    bad been given and caught, and the blood of poor Dame Glover, which had been    the introduction to this tale of a hobby-horse, was to be the forerunner of    new atrocities and fearfully more general follies. 
 </p><p>     This scene opened by the illness of two girls,    a daughter  and niece of Mr. Parvis, the minister of Salem,    who fell under an affliction similar to that of the Goodwins. Their mouths were    stopped, their throats choked, their limbs racked, thorns were stuck into their    flesh, and pins were ejected from their stomachs. An Indian and his wife, servants    of the family, endeavouring, by some spell of their own, to discover by whom    the fatal charm had been imposed on their master's children, drew themselves    under suspicion, and were hanged. The judges and juries persevered, encouraged    by the discovery of these poor Indians' guilt, and hoping they might thus expel    from the colony the authors of such practices. They acted, says Mather, the    historian, under a conscientious wish to do justly; but the cases of witchcraft    and possession increased as if they were transmitted by contagion, and the same    sort of spectral evidence being received which had occasioned the condemnation    of the Indian woman Titu, became generally fatal. The afflicted persons failed    not to see the spectres, as they were termed, of the persons by whom they were    tormented. Against this species of evidence no <i>alibi</i> could be offered,    because it was admitted, as we have said elsewhere, that the real persons of    the accused were not there present; and everything rested upon the assumption    that the afflicted persons were telling the truth, since their evidence could    not be redargued. These spectres were generally represented as offering their    victims a book, on signing which they would be freed from their torments. Sometimes    the devil appeared in person, and added his own eloquence to move the afflicted    persons to consent. 
 </p><p>      At first, as seems natural enough, the poor    and miserable alone were involved; but presently, when such evidence was admitted    as incontrovertible, the afflicted began to see the spectral appearances of    persons of higher condition and of irreproachable lives, some of whom were arrested,    some made their escape, while several were executed. The more that suffered    the greater became the number of afflicted  persons, and the wider and the more numerous    were the denunciations against supposed witches. The accused were of all ages.    A child of five years old was indicted by some of tile afflicted, who imagined    they saw this juvenile wizard active in tormenting them, and appealed to the    mark of little teeth on their bodies, where they stated it had bitten them.    A poor dog was also hanged as having been alleged to be busy in this infernal    persecution. These gross insults on common reason occasioned a revulsion in    public feeling, but not till many lives had been sacrificed. By this means nineteen    men and women were executed, besides a stout-hearted man named Cory, who refused    to plead, and was accordingly pressed to death according to the old law. On    this horrible occasion a circumstance took place disgusting to humanity, which    must yet be told, to show how superstition can steel the heart of a man against    the misery of his fellow-creature. The dying man, in the mortal agony, thrust    out his tongue, which the sheriff crammed with his cane back again into his    mouth. Eight persons were condemned besides those who had actually suffered,    and no less than two hundred were in prison and under examination. 
 </p><p>      Men began then to ask whether the devil might    not artfully deceive the afflicted into the accusation of good and innocent    persons by presenting witches and fiends in the resemblance of blameless persons,    as engaged in the tormenting of their diseased country-folk. This argument was    by no means inconsistent with the belief in witchcraft, and was the more readily    listened to on that account. Besides, men found that no rank or condition could    save them from the danger of this horrible accusation if they continued to encourage    the witnesses in such an unlimited course as had hitherto been granted to them.    Influenced by these reflections, the settlers awoke as from a dream, and the    voice of the public, which had so lately demanded vengeance on all who were    suspected of sorcery, began now, on the other hand, to lament the effusion of    blood, under the strong suspicion  that part of it at least had been innocently    and unjustly sacrificed. In Mather's own language, which we use as that of a    man deeply convinced of the reality of the crime, " experience showed that the    more were apprehended the more were still afflicted by Satan, and the number    of confessions increasing did but increase the number of the accused, and the    execution of some made way to the apprehension of others. For still the afflicted    complained of being tormented by new objects as the former were removed, so    that some of those that were concerned grew amazed at the number and condition    of those that were accused, and feared that Satan, by his wiles, had enwrapped    innocent persons under the imputation of that crime; and at last, as was evidently    seen, there must be a stop put, or the generation of the kingdom of God would    fall under condemnation." <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="lodw09.htm#fn_63"><font size="1">64</font></a> 
 </p><p>      The prosecutions were therefore suddenly stopped,    the prisoners dismissed, the condemned pardoned, and even those who had confessed,    the number of whom was very extraordinary, were pardoned amongst others; and    the author we have just quoted thus records the result:-- " When this prosecution    ceased, the Lord so chained up Satan that the afflicted grew presently well.    The accused were generally quiet, and for five years there was no such molestation    among us." 
 </p><p>     To this it must be added that the congregation    of Salem compelled Mr. Parvis, in whose family the disturbance had began and    who, they alleged, was the person by whom it was most fiercely driven on in    the commencement, to leave his settlement amongst them. Such of the accused    as had  confessed the acts of witchcraft imputed to them    generally denied and retracted their confessions, asserting them to have been    made under fear of torture, influence of persuasion, or other circumstances    exclusive of their free will. Several of the judges and jurors concerned in    the sentence of those who were executed published their penitence for their    rashness in convicting these unfortunate persons; and one of the judges, a man    of the most importance in the colony, observed, during the rest of his life,    the anniversary of the first execution as a day of solemn fast and humiliation    for his own share in the transaction. Even the barbarous Indians were struck    with wonder at the infatuation of the English colonists on this occasion, and    drew disadvantageous comparisons between them and the French, among whom, as    they remarked, " the Great Spirit sends no witches." 
 </p><p>     The system of witchcraft, as believed in Scotland,    must next claim our attention, as it is different in some respects from that    of England, and subsisted to a later period, and was prosecuted with much more    severity. <br> <br>
