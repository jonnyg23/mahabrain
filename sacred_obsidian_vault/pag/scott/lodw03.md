 <p>     THE creed of Zoroaster, which naturally occurs    to unassisted reason as a mode of accounting for the mingled existence of good    and evil in the visible world -- that belief which, in one modification or another,    supposes the co-existence of a benevolent and malevolent principle, which contend    together without either being able decisively to prevail over his antagonist,    leads the fear and awe deeply impressed on the human mind to the worship as    well of the author of evil, so tremendous in all the effects of which credulity    accounts him the primary cause, as to that of his great opponent, who is loved    and adored as the father of all that is good and bountiful. Nay, such is the    timid servility of human nature that the worshippers will neglect the altars    of the Author of good rather than that of Arimanes, trusting with indifference    to the well-known mercy of the one, while they shrink from the idea of irritating    the vengeful jealousy of the awful father of evil,   The Celtic tribes, by whom, under various denominations,    Europe seems to have been originally peopled, possessed, in common with other    savages, a natural tendency to the worship of the evil principle. They did not,    perhaps, adore Arimanes under one sole name, or consider the malignant divinities    as sufficiently powerful to undertake a direct struggle with the more benevolent    gods; yet they thought it worth while to propitiate them by various expiatory    rites and prayers, that they, and the elementary tempests which they conceived    to be under their direct command, might be merciful to suppliants who had acknowledged    their power, and deprecated their vengeance. 
 </p><p>      Remains of these superstitions might be traced    till past the middle of the last century, though fast becoming obsolete, or    passing into mere popular customs of the country, which the peasantry observe    without thinking of their origin. About 1769, when Mr. Pennant made his tour,    the ceremony of the Baaltein, Beltane, or First of May, though varying in different    districts of the Highlands, was yet in strict observance, and the cake, which    was then baken with scrupulous attention to certain rites and forms, was divided    into fragments, which were formally dedicated to birds or beasts of prey that    they, or rather the being whose agents they were, might spare the flocks and    herds. <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">9</font></a> 
 </p><p>     Another custom of similar origin lingered late    among us. In many parishes of Scotland there was suffered to exist a certain    portion of land, called <i>the gudeman' croft, </i>which was never ploughed    or cultivated, but suffered to remain waste, like the TEMENOS of a pagan temple.    Though it was not expressly avowed, no one doubted that " the goodman's croft"    was set apart for some evil being; in fact, that it was the portion of the arch-fiend    himself, whom our ancestors distinguished by a name which, while it was generally    understood,  could not, it was supposed, be offensive to the    stern inhabitant of the regions of despair. This was so general a custom that    the Church published an ordinance against it as an impious and blasphemous usage. 
 </p><p>      This singular custom sunk before the efforts    of the clergy in the seventeenth century; but there must still be many alive    who, in childhood, have been taught to look with wonder on knolls and patches    of ground left uncultivated, because, whenever a, ploughshare entered the soil,    the elementary spirits were supposed to testify their displeasure by storm and    thunder. Within our own memory, many such places, sanctified to barrenness by    some favourite popular superstition, existed, both in Wales and Ireland, as    well as in Scotland; but the high price of agricultural produce during the late    war renders it doubtful if a veneration for greybearded superstition has suffered    any one of them to remain undesecrated. For the same reason the mounts called    Sith Bhruaith were respected, and it was deemed unlawful and dangerous to cut    wood, dig earth and stones, or otherwise disturb them. <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">10</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Now, it may at first sight seem strange that    the Christian religion should have permitted the existence of such gross and    impious relics of heathenism, in a, land where its doctrines had obtained universal    credence. But this will not appear so wonderful when it is recollected that    the original Christians under the heathen emperors were called to conversion    by the voice of apostles and saints, invested for the purpose with miraculous    powers, as well of language, for communicating their doctrine to the Gentiles,    as of cures, for the purpose of authenticating their mission. These converts    must have been in general such elect persons as were effectually called to make    part of the infant church; and when hypocrites ventured, like Ananias and Sapphira,    to intrude themselves into so select an association, they  were liable, at the Divine pleasure, to be detected    and punished. On the contrary, the nations who were converted after Christianity    had become the religion of the empire were not brought within the pale upon    such a principle of selection, as when the church consisted of a few individuals,    who had, upon conviction, exchanged the errors of the pagan religion for the    dangers and duties incurred by those who embraced a faith inferring the self-denial    of its votaries, and at the same time exposing them to persecution. When the    cross became triumphant, and its cause no longer required the direction of inspired    men, or the evidence of miracles, to compel reluctant belief, it is evident    that the converts who thronged into the fold must have, many of them, entered    because Christianity was the, prevailing faith -- many because it was the church,    the members of which rose most readily to promotion -- many, finally, who, though    content to resign the worship of pagan divinities, could not at once clear their    minds of heathen ritual and heathen observances, which they inconsistently laboured    to unite with the more simple and majestic faith that disdained such impure    union. If this was the case, even in the Roman empire, where the converts to    the Christian faith must have found, among the earlier members of the church,    the readiest and the soundest instruction, bow much more imperfectly could those    foreign and barbarous tribes receive the necessary religious information from    some zealous and enthusiastic preacher, who christened them by hundreds in one    day? Still less could we imagine them to have acquired a knowledge of Christianity,    in the genuine and perfect sense of the word, when, as was frequently the case,    they only assumed the profession of the religion that had become the choice    of some favoured chief, whose example they followed in mere love and loyalty,    without, perhaps, attaching more consequence to a change of religion than to    a change of garments. Such hasty converts, professing themselves Christians,    but neither weaned from their old belief, nor   instructed in their new one, entered the sanctuary    without' laying aside the superstitions with which their young minds had been    imbued; and accustomed to a plurality of deities, some of them who bestowed    unusual thought on the matter, might be of opinion that, in adopting the God    of the Christians, they had not renounced the service of every inferior power. 
 </p><p>      If, indeed, the laws of the empire could have    been supposed to have had any influence over those fierce barbarians, who conceived    that the empire itself lay before them as a spoil, they might have been told    that Constantine, taking the offence of alleged magicians and sorcerers in the    same light in which it was viewed in the law of Moses, had denounced death against    any who used these unlawful enquiries into futurity. " Let the unlawful curiosity    of prying into futurity," says the law, " be silent in every one henceforth    and for ever. <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">11</font></a> For, subjected to the avenging sword of the    law, he shall be punished capitally who disobeys our commands in this matter." 
 </p><p>      If, however, we look more closely into this    enactment, we shall be led to conclude that the civil law does not found upon    the prohibitions and penalties in Scripture; although it condemns the <i>ars</i>    <i>mathematica </i>(for the most mystic and uncertain of all sciences, real    or pretended, at that time held the title which now distinguishes the most exact)    as a damnable art, and utterly interdicted, and declares that the practitioners    therein should die by fire, as enemies of the human race -- yet the reason of    this severe treatment seems to be different from that acted upon in the Mosaical    institutions. The weight of the crime among the Jews was placed on the blasphemy    of the diviners, and their treason against the theocracy instituted by Jehovah.    The Roman legislators were, on the other hand, moved chiefly by the danger arising    to the person of the prince and the quiet of the state, so apt to be unsettled    by every pretence or  encouragement to innovation. The reigning emperors,    therefore, were desirous to place a check upon the mathematics (as they termed    the art of divination), much more for a political than a religious cause, since    we observe, in the history of the empire, how often the dethronement or death    of the sovereign was produced by conspiracies or mutinies which took their rise    from pretended prophecies. In this mode of viewing the crime, the lawyers of    the lower empire acted upon the example of those who had compiled the laws of    the twelve tables. <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">12</font></a> The mistaken and misplaced devotion which    Horace recommends to the rural nymph, Phidyle, would have been a crime of a    deep dye in a Christian convert, and must have subjected him to excommunication,    as one relapsed to the rites of paganism; but he might indulge his superstition    by supposing that though he must not worship Pan or Ceres as gods, he was at    liberty to fear them in their new capacity of fiends. Some compromise between    the fear and the conscience of the new converts, at a time when the church no    longer consisted exclusively of saints, martyrs, and confessors, the disciples    of inspired Apostles, led them, and even their priestly guides, subject like    themselves to human passions and errors, to resort as a charm, if not as an    act of worship, to those sacrifices, words, and ritual, by which the heathen,    whom they had succeeded, pretended to arrest evil or procure benefits. 
 </p><p>      When such belief in a hostile principle and    its imaginations  was become general in the Roman empire, the ignorance    of its conquerors, those wild nations, Franks, Goths, Vandals, Huns, and similar    classes of unrefined humanity, made them prone to an error which there were    few judicious preachers to warn them against; and we ought rather to wonder    and admire the Divine clemency, which imparted to so rude nations the light    of the Gospel, and disposed them to receive a religion so repugnant to their    warlike habits, than that they should, at the same time, have adopted many gross    superstitions, borrowed from the pagans, or retained numbers of those which    had made part of their own national forms of heathenism. 
 </p><p>      Thus, though the thrones of Jupiter and the    superior deities of the heathen Pantheon were totally overthrown and broken    to pieces, fragments of their worship and many of their rites survived the conversion    to Christianity -- nay, are in existence even at this late and enlightened period,    although those by whom they are practised have not preserved the least memory    of their original purpose. We may hastily mention one or two customs of classical    origin, in addition to the Beltane and those already noticed, which remain as    examples that the manners of the Romans once gave the tone to the greater part    of the island of Britain, and at least to the whole which was to the south of    the wall of Severus. 
 </p><p>      The following customs still linger in the south    of Scotland, and belong to this class: The bride, when she enters the house    of her husband, is lifted over the threshold, and to step on it or over it voluntarily    is reckoned a bad omen. This custom was universal in Rome, where it was observed    as keeping in memory the rape of the Sabines, and that it was by a show of violence    towards the females that the object of peopling the city was attained. On the    same occasion a sweet cake, baked for the purpose, is broken above the head    of the bride; which is also a rite of classic antiquity.   In like manner, the Scottish, even of the better    rank, avoid contracting marriage in the month of May, which genial season of    flowers and breezes might, in other respects, appear so peculiarly favourable    for that purpose. It was specially objected to the marriage of Mary with the    profligate Earl of Bothwell, that the union was formed within this interdicted    month. This prejudice was so looted among the Scots that, in 1684, a set of    enthusiasts, called Gibbites, proposed to renounce it, among a long list of    stated festivals, fast-days, popish relics, not forgetting, the profane names    of the days of the week, names of the months, and all sorts of idle and silly    practices which their tender consciences took an exception to. This objection    to solemnize marriage in the merry month of May, however fit a season for courtship,    is also borrowed from the Roman pagans, which, had these fanatics been aware    of it, would have been an additional reason for their anathema against the practice.    The ancients have given us as a maxim, that it is only had women who marry in    that month. <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">13</font></a> 
 </p><p>      The custom of saying God bless you, when a person    in company sneezes, is, in like manner, derived from sternutation being considered    as a crisis of the plague at Athens, and the hope that, when it was attained    the patient had a chance of recovery. 
 </p><p>      But besides these, and many other customs which    the various nations of Europe received from the classical times, and which it    is not our object to investigate, they derived from thence a shoal of superstitious    beliefs, which, blended and mingled with those which they brought with them    out of their own country, fostered and formed the materials of a demonological    creed which has descended down almost to our own times. Nixas, or Nicksa, a    river or ocean god, worshipped on the shores of the Baltic, seems to have taken    uncontested possession of the attributes of Neptune. Amid the twilight winters    and overpowering tempests of these gloomy  regions, he had been not unnaturally chosen as    the power most adverse to man, and the supernatural character with which he    was invested has descended to our time under two different aspects. The Nixa    of the Germans is one of those fascinating and lovely fays whom the ancients    termed Naiads; and unless her pride is insulted or her jealousy awakened by    an inconstant lover, her temper is generally mild and her actions beneficent.    The Old Nick known in England is an equally genuine descendant of the northern    sea-god, and possesses a larger portion of his powers and terrors The British    sailor, who fears nothing else, confesses his terror for this terrible being,    and believes him the author of almost all the various calamities to which the    precarious life of a seaman is so continually exposed. 
 </p><p>      The Bhar-guest, or Bhar-geist, by which name    it is generally acknowledged through various country parts of England, and particularly    in Yorkshire, also called a Dobie -- a local spectre which haunts a particular    spot under various forms -- is a deity, as his name implies, of Teutonic descent;    and if it be true, as the author has been informed, that some families bearing    the name of Dobie carry a phantom or spectre, passant, in their armorial bearings, <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">14</font></a>    it plainly implies that, however the word may have been selected for a proper    name, its original derivation had not then been forgotten. 
 </p><p>      The classic mythology presented numerous points    in which it readily coalesced with that of the Germans, Danes, and Northmen    of a later period. They recognized the power of Erictho, Canidia, and other    sorceresses, whose spells could perplex the course of the elements, intercept    the influence of the sun, and prevent his beneficial operation  upon the fruits of the earth, call down the moon    from her appointed sphere, and disturb the original and destined course of Nature    by their words and charms and the power of the evil spirits whom they invoked.    They were also professionally implicated in all such mystic and secret rites    and ceremonies as were used to conciliate the favour of the infernal powers,    whose dispositions were supposed as dark and wayward as their realms were gloomy    and dismal. Such hags were frequent agents in the violation of unburied bodies,    and it was believed, by the vulgar at least, that it was dangerous to leave    corpses unguarded lest they should be mangled by the witches, who took from    them the most choice ingredients composing their charms. Above all, it must    not be forgotten that these frightful sorceresses possessed the power of transforming    themselves and others into animals, which are used in their degree of quadrupeds,    or in whatever other laborious occupation belongs to the transformed state.    The poets of the heathens, with authors of fiction, such as Lucian and Apuleius,    ascribe all these powers to the witches of the pagan world, combining them with    the art of poisoning and of making magical philtres to seduce the affections    of the young and beautiful; and such were the characteristics which, in greater    or less extent, the people of the Middle Ages ascribed to the witches of their    day. 
 </p><p>      But in thus adopting the superstitions of the    ancients, the conquerors of the Roman Empire combined them with similar articles    of belief which they had brought with them from their original settlements in    the North, where the existence of hags of the same character formed a great    feature in their Sagas and their Chronicles. It requires but a slight acquaintance    with these compositions to enable the reader to recognize in the Galdrakinna    of the Scalds the <i>Stryga</i> or witch-woman of more classical climates. In    the northern ideas of witches there was no irreligion concerned with their lore.    On the contrary, the possession of magical  knowledge was an especial attribute of Odin himself;    and to intrude themselves upon a deity, and compel him to instruct them in what    they desired to know, was accounted not an act of impiety, but of gallantry    and high courage, among those sons of the sword and the spear. Their matrons    possessed a high reputation for magic, for prophetic powers, for creating illusions;    and, if not capable of transformations of the human body, they were at least    able to impose such fascination on the sight of their enemies as to conceal    for a period the objects of which they were in search. 
 </p><p>      There is a remarkable story in the Eyrbiggia    Saga (" Historia Eyranorum"), giving the result of such a controversy between    two of these gifted women, one of whom was determined on discovering and putting    to death the son of the other, named Katla, who in a brawl had cut off the hand    of the daughter-in-law of Geirada. A party detached to avenge this wrong, by    putting Oddo to death, returned deceived by the skill of his-mother. They had    found only Katla, they said, spinning flax from a large distaff. " Fools," said    Geirada, " that distaff was the man you sought." They returned, seized the distaff.    and burn it. But this second time, the witch disguised her son under the appearance    of a tame kid. A third time he was a hog, which grovelled among the ashes. The    party returned yet again; augmented as one of Katla's maidens, who kept watch,    informed her mistress, by one in a blue mantle. " Alas !" said Katla, " it is    the sorceress Geirada, against whom spells avail not." Accordingly, the hostile    party, entering for the fourth time, seized on the object of their animosity,    and put him to death. <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">15</font></a> This species of witchcraft is well known    in Scotland as the <i>glamour</i>, or <i>deceptio visus</i>, and was supposed    to be a special attribute of the race of Gipsies. 
 </p><p>      Neither are those prophetesses to be forgotten,    so much honoured among the German tribes, that, as we are assured   by Tacitus, they rose to the highest rank in    their councils by their supposed supernatural knowledge, and even obtained a    share in the direction of their armies. This peculiarity in the habits of the    North was so general, that it was no unusual thing to see females, from respect    to their supposed views into futurity, and the degree of divine inspiration    which was vouchsafed to them, arise to the degree of HAXA, or chief priestess,    from which comes the word <i>Hexe, </i>now universally used for a witch; a circumstance    which plainly shows that the mythological system of the ancient natives of the    North had given to the modern language an appropriate word for distinguishing    those females who had intercourse with the spiritual world. <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">16</font></a> 
 </p><p>      It is undeniable that these Pythonesses were    held in high respect while the pagan religion lasted; but for that very reason    they became odious so soon as the tribe was converted to Christianity. They    were, of course, if they pretended to retain their influence, either despised    as impostors or feared as sorceresses; and the more that, in particular instances,    they became dreaded for their power, the more they were detested, under the    conviction that they derived it from the enemy of man. The deities of the northern    heathens underwent a similar metamorphosis, resembling that proposed by Drawcansir    in the " Rehearsal," who threatens " to make a god subscribe himself a devil." 
 </p><p>     The warriors of the North received this new impression  concerning the influence of their deities, and    the source from which it was derived, with the more indifference, as their worship,    when their mythology was most generally established, was never of a very reverential    or devotional character. Their idea of their own merely human prowess was so    high, that the champions made it their boast, as we have already hinted, they    would not give way in fight even to the immortal gods themselves. Such, we learn    from Cæsar, was the idea of tbe Germans concerning the Suevi, or Swabians,    a tribe to whom the others yielded the palm of valour; and many individual stories    are told in the Sagas concerning bold champions, who had fought, not only with    the sorcerers, but with the demigods of the system, and come off unharmed, if    not victorious, in the contest. Hother, for example, encountered the god Thor    in battle, as Diomede, in the Iliad, engages with Mars, and with like success.    Bartholsine <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">17</font></a> gives us repeated examples of the same kind. "    Know this," said Kiartan to Olaus Trigguasen, " that I believe neither in idols    nor demons. I have travelled through various strange countries, and have encountered    many giants and monsters, and have never been conquered by them; I therefore    put my sole trust in my own strength of body and courage of soul." Another yet    more broad answer was made to St. Olaus, King of Norway, by Gaukater. " I am    neither Pagan nor Christian. My comrades and I profess no other religion than    a perfect confidence in our own strength and invincibility in battle." Such    chieftains were of the sect of Mezentius --  
 </p><p>      " Dextra: mihi Deus, et telum, quod missile    libro, 
 </p><p>      Nunc adsint!" <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">18</font></a>   
 </p><p>     And we cannot wonder that champions of such a    character, careless oftheir gods while yet acknowledged as such, readily regarded    them asdemons after their conversion to Christianity.  To incur the highest extremity of danger became    accounted a proof ofthat insuperable valour for which every Northman desired    to be famed,and their annals afford numerous instances of encounters with ghosts,witches,    furies, and fiends, whom the Kiempé, or champions,compelled to submit    to their mere mortal strength, and yield to theirservice the weapons or other    treasures which they guarded in theirtombs. 
 </p><p>      The Norsemen were the more prone to these superstitions,    because itwas a favourite fancy of theirs that, in many instances, the change    fromlife to death altered the temper of the human spirit from benignant tomalevolent;    or perhaps, that when the soul left the body, its departurewas occasionally    supplied by a wicked demon, who took the opportunity toenter and occupy its    late habitation. 
 </p><p>      Upon such a supposition the wild fiction that    follows is probablygrounded; which, extravagant as it is, possesses something    striking tothe imagination. Saxo Grammaticus tells us of the fame of two Norseprinces    or chiefs, who had formed what was called a brotherhood in arms,implying not    only the firmest friendship and constant support during allthe adventures which    they should undertake in life, but binding them bya solemn compact, that after    the death of either, the survivor shoulddescend alive into the sepulchre of    his brother-in-arms, and consent tobe buried alongst with him. The task of fulfilling    this dreadful compactfell upon Asmund, his companion, Assueit, having been slain    in battle.The tomb was formed after the ancient northern custom in what was    calledthe age of hills, that is, when it was usual to bury persons ofdistinguished    merit or rank on some conspicuous spot, which was crownedwith a mound. With    this purpose a deep narrow vault was constructed, tobe the apartment of the    future tomb over which the sepulchral heap wasto be piled. Here they deposited    arms, trophies, poured forth, perhaps,the blood of victims, introduced into    the tomb the war-horses of thechampions,  and when these rites had been duly paid, the    body of Assueit wasplaced in the dark and narrow house, while his faithful.    brother-in-armsentered and sat down by the corpse, without a word or look whichtestified    regret or unwillingness to fulfil his fearful engagement. Thesoldiers who had    witnessed this singular interment of the dead andliving, rolled a huge stone    to the mouth of the tomb, and piled so muchearth and stones above the spot as    made a mound visible from a greatdistance, and then, with loud lamentation for    the loss of such undauntedleaders, they dispersed themselves like a flock which    has lost itsshepherd. 
 </p><p>      Years passed away after years, and a century    had elapsed ere a nobleSwedish rover, bound upon some high adventure and supported    by a gallantband of followers, arrived in the valley which took its name from    thetomb of the brethren-in-arms. The story was told to the strangers, whoseleader    determined on opening the sepulchre, partly because, as alreadyhinted, it was    reckoned a heroic action to brave the anger of departedheroes by violating their    tombs; partly to attain the arms and swords ofproof with which the deceased    had done their great actions. He set hissoldiers to work, and soon removed the    earth and stones from one side ofthe mound, and laid bare the entrance. But    the stoutest of the roversstarted back when, instead of the silence of a tomb,    they heard withinhorrid cries, the clash of swords, the clang of armour, and    all thenoise of a mortal combat between two furious champions. A young warriorwas    let down into the profound tomb by a cord, which was drawn upshortly after,    in hopes of news from beneath. But when the adventurerdescended, some one threw    him from the cord, and took his place in thenoose. When the rope was pulled    up, the soldiers, instead of theircompanion, beheld Asmund, the survivor of    the brethren-in-arms. Herushed into the open air, his sword drawn in his hand,    his armour halftorn from his body, the left side of his face almost scratched    off, asby the talons of some wild beast. He had no sooner appeared  in the light of day, than, with the improvisatory    poetic talent,which these champions often united with heroic strength and bravery,    bepoured forth. a string of verses containing the history of his hundredyears'    conflict within the tomb. It seems that no sooner was thesepulchre closed than    the corpse of the slain Assueit arose from theground, inspired by some ravenous    goule, and having first torn to piecesand devoured the horses which had been    entombed with them, threw himselfupon the companion who had just given him such    a sign of devotedfriendship, in order to treat him in the same manner. The hero,    no waydiscountenanced by the horrors of his situation, took to his arms, anddefended    himself manfully against Assueit, or rather against the evildemon who tenanted    that champion's body. In this manner the livingbrother waged a preternatural    combat, which had endured during a wholecentury, when Asmund, at last obtaining    the victory, prostrated hisenemy, and by driving, as he boasted, a stake through    his body, hadfinally reduced him to the state of quiet becoming a tenant of    the tomb.Having chanted the triumphant account of his contest and victory, thismangled    conqueror fell dead before them. The body of Assueit was takenout of the tomb,    burnt, and the ashes dispersed to heaven; whilst thatof the victor, now lifeless    and without a companion, was depositedthere, so that it was hoped his slumbers    might remain undisturbed.  <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">19</font></a> The precautions taken against Assueit's    reviving asecond time, remind us of those adopted in the Greek islands and in    theTurkish provinces against the vampire. It affords also a derivation ofthe    ancient English law in case of suicide, when a stake was driventhrough the body,    originally to keep it secure in the tomb. 
 </p><p>     The Northern people also acknowledged a kind    of ghosts, who, whenthey had obtained possession of a building, or the right    of haunting if,did not defend themselves against mortals on the knightly principle    ofduel, like Assueit, nor  were amenable to the prayers of the priest or    the spells of the sorcerer, but became tractable when properly convened in a    legal process. The Eyrbiggia, Saga acquaints us, that the mansion of a respectable    landholder in Iceland was, soon after the settlement of that island, exposed    to a persecution of this kind. The molestation was produced by the concurrence    of certain mystical and spectral phenomena, calculated to introduce such persecution.    About the commencement of winter, with that slight exchange of darkness and    twilight which constitutes night and day in these latitudes, a contagious disease    arose in a family of consequence and in the neighbourhood, which, sweeping off    several members of the family at different times, seemed to threaten them all    with death. But the death of these persons was attended with the singular consequence    that their spectres were seen to wander in the neighbourhood of the mansion-house,    terrifying, and even assaulting, those of the living family who ventured abroad.    As the number of the dead members of the devoted household seemed to increase    in proportion to that of the survivors, the ghosts took it upon them to enter    the house, and produce their aërial forms and wasted physiognomy, even    in the stove where the fire was maintained for the general use of the inhabitants,    and which, in an Iceland winter, is the only comfortable place of assembling    the family. But the remaining inhabitants of the place, terrified by the intrusion    of these spectres, chose rather to withdraw to the other extremity of the house,    and abandon their warm seats, than to endure the neighbourhood of the phantoms.    Complaints were at length made to a pontiff of the god Thor, named Snorro, who    exercised considerable influence in the island. By his counsel, the young proprietor    of the haunted mansion assembled a jury, or inquest, of his neighbours, constituted    in the usual judicial form, as if to judge an ordinary civil matter, and proceeded,    in their presence, to cite individually the various phantoms and resemblances    of the deceased members of the family, to show by what  warrant they disputed with him and his servants    the quiet possession of his property, and what defence they could plead for    thus interfering with and incommoding the living. The spectres of the dead,    by name, and in order as summoned, appeared on their being called, and muttering    some regrets at being obliged to abandon their dwelling, departed, or vanished,    from the astonished inquest. Judgment then went against the ghosts by default;    and the trial by jury, of which we here can trace the origin, obtained a triumph    unknown to any of the great writers who have made it the subject of eulogy. <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">20</font></a> 
 </p><p>      It was not only with the spirits of the dead    that the warlike people of the North made war without timidity, and successfully    entered into suits of ejectment. These daring champions often braved the indignation    even of the superior deities of their mythology, rather than allow that there    existed any being before whom their boldness could quail. Such is the singular    story how a young man of high courage, in crossing a desolate ridge of mountains,    met with a huge waggon, in which the goddess Freya (<i>i.c.</i>, a gigantic    idol formed to represent her), together with her shrine, and the wealthy offerings    attached to it, was travelling from one district of the country to another.    The shrine, or sanctuary of the idol, was, like a modern caravan travelling    with a show, screened by boards and curtains from the public gaze, and the equipage    was under the immediate guidance of the priestess of Freya, a young, good-looking,    and attractive woman. The traveller naturally associated himself with the priestess,    who, as she walked on foot, apparently was in no degree displeased with the    company of a powerful and handsome young man, as a guide and companion on the    journey. It chanced, however, that the presence of the champion, and his discourse    with the priestess, was less satisfactory to the goddess than to the parties    principally concerned. By a  certain signal the divinity summoned the priestess    to the sanctuary, who presently returned, with tears in her eyes and terror    in her countenance, to inform her companion that it was the will of Freya that    he should depart, and no longer travel in their company. " You must have mistaken    the meaning of the goddess," said the champion; " Freya cannot have formed a    wish so unreasonable as to desire I should abandon the straight and good road,    which leads me directly on my journey, to choose precipitous paths and by-roads,    where I may break my neck." " Nevertheless," said the priestess, " the goddess    will be highly offended if you disobey her commands, nor can I conceal from    you that she may personally assault you." " It will be at her own peril if she    should be so audacious," said the champion, " for I will try the power of this    axe against the strength of beams and boards." The priestess chid him for his    impiety; but being unable to compel him to obey the goddess's mandate, they    again relapsed into familiarity, which advanced to such a point that a clattering    noise within the tabernacle, as of machinery put in motion, intimated to the    travellers that Freya, who perhaps had some qualities in common with the classical    Vesta, thought a personal interruption of this tête-à-tête    ought to be deferred no longer. The curtains flew open, and the massive and    awkward idol, who, we may suppose, resembled in form the giant created by Frankenstein,    leapt lumbering from the carriage, and, rushing on the in trusive traveller,    dealt him, with its wooden hands and arms, such tremendous blows, as were equally    difficult to parry or to endure. But the champion was armed with a double edged    Danish axe, with which he bestirred himself with so much strength and activity,    that at length he split the head of the image, and with a severe blow hewed    off its left leg. The image of Freya then fell motionless to the ground, and    the demon which had animated it fled yelling from the battered tenement. The    champion was now victor; and, according to the law of arms, took possession    of the female  and the baggage. The priestess, the divinity    of whose patroness had been by the event of the combat sorely lessened in her    eyes, was now easily induced to become the associate and concubine of the conqueror.    She accompanied him to the district whither he was travelling, and there displayed    the shrine of Freya, taking care to hide the injuries which the goddess had    received in the brawl. The champion came in for a share of a gainful trade driven    by the priestess, besides appropriating to himself most of the treasures which    the sanctuary had formerly contained. Neither does it appear that Freya, having,    perhaps, a sensible recollection of the power of the axe, ever again ventured    to appear in person for the purpose of calling her false stewards to account. 
 </p><p>      The national estimation of deities, concerning    whom such stories could be told and believed, was, of course, of no deep or    respectful character. The Icelanders abandoned Odin, Freya, Thor, and their    whole pagan mythology, in consideration of a single disputation between the    heathen priests and the Christian missionaries. The priests threatened the island    with a desolating eruption of the volcano called Hecla, as the necessary consequence    of the vengeance of their deities. Snorro, the same who advised the inquest    against the ghosts, had become a convert to the Christian religion, and was    present on the occasion, and as the conference was held on the surface of what    had been a stream of lava, now covered with vegetable substances, he answered    the priests with much readiness, " To what was the indignation of the gods owing    when the substance on which we stand was fluid and scorching? Believe me, men    of Iceland, the eruption of the volcano depends on natural circumstances now    as it did then, and is not the engine of vengeance intrusted to Thor and Odin."    It is evident that men who reasoned with so much accuracy concerning the imbecility    of Odin and Thor were well prepared, on abandoning their worship, to consider    their former deities, of  whom they believed so much that was impious,    in the light of evil demons. 
 </p><p>      But there were some particulars of the Northern    creed in which it corresponded so exactly with that of the classics as leaves    room to doubt whether the original Asæ, or Asiatics, the founders of the    Scandinavian system, had, before their migration from Asia, derived them from    some common Source with those of the Greeks and Romans; or whether, on the other    hand, the same proneness of the human mind to superstition has caused that similar    ideas are adopted in different regions, as the same plants are found in distant    countries without the one, as far as can be discovered, having obtained the    seed from the others. 
 </p><p>      The classical fiction, for example, of the satyrs    and other subordinate deities of wood and wild, whose power is rather delusive    than formidable, and whose supernatural pranks intimate rather a wish to inflict    terror than to do hurt, was received among the Northern people, and perhaps    transferred by them to the Celtic tribes. It is an idea which seems common to    many nations. The existence of a satyr, in the silvan form, is even pretended    to be proved by the evidence of Saint Anthony, to whom one is said to have appeared    in the desert. The Scottish Gael have an idea of the same kind, respecting a    goblin called <i>Ourisk</i>, whose form is like that of Pan, and his attendants    something between a man and a goat, the nether extremities being in the latter    form. A species of cavern, or rather hole, in the rock, affords to the wildest    retreat in the romantic neighbourhood of Loch Katrine a name taken from classical    superstition. It is not the least curious circumstance that from this silvan    deity the modern nations of Europe have borrowed the degrading and unsuitable    emblems of the goat's visage and form, the horns, hoofs, and tail, with which    they have depicted the author of evil when it pleased him to show himself on    earth. So that the alteration of a single word would render Pope's well-known    line more  truly adapted to the fact, should we venture    to read --  <br> <br> "And Pan to <i>Satan</i> lends his heathen born." <br> 
 </p><p>     We cannot attribute the transferrence of the    attributes of the Northern satyr, or Celtic ourisk, to the arch-fiend, to any    particular resemblance between the character of these deities and that of Satan.    On the contrary, the ourisk of the Celts was a creature by no means peculiarly    malevolent or formidably powerful, but rather a melancholy spirit, which dwelt    in wildernesses far removed from men. If we are to identify him with the Brown    Dwarf of the Border moors, the ourisk has a mortal term of life and a hope of    salvation, as indeed the same high claim was made by the satyr who appeared    to St. Anthony. Moreover, the High land ourisk was a species of lubber fiend,    and capable of being over-reached by those who understood philology. It is related    of one of these goblins which frequented a mill near the foot of Loch Lomond,    that the miller, desiring to get rid of this meddling spirit, who injured the    machinery by setting the water on the wheel when there was no grain to be grinded,    contrived to have a meeting with the goblin by watching in his mill till night.    The ourisk then entered, and demanded the Miller's name, and was informed that    he was called <i>Myself</i>; on which is founded a story almost exactly like    that of OUTIS in the "Odyssey," a tale which, though classic, is by no means,    an elegant or ingenious fiction, but which we are astonished to find in an obscure    district, and in the Celtic tongue, seeming to argue some connexion or communication    between these remote Highlands of Scotland and the readers of Homer in former    days, which we cannot account for. After all, perhaps, some Churchman more learned    than his brethren may have transferred the legend from Sicily to Duncrune, from    the shores of the Mediterranean to those of Loch Lomond. I have heard it also    told that the celebrated freebooter, Rob Roy, once gained a victory by disguising    a part of his men  with goat-skins, so as to resemble the <i>ourisk</i>,    or Highland satyr. 
 </p><p>      There was an individual satyr called, I think,    Meming belonging to the Scandinavian mythology, of a character different from    the ourisk, though similar in shape, whom it was the boast of the highest champions    to seek out in the solitudes which he inhabited. He was an armourer of extreme    dexterity, and the weapons which he forged were of the highest value. But as    club-law pervaded the ancient system of Scandinavia, Meming had the humour of    refusing to work for any customer save such as compelled him to it with force    of arms. He may be, perhaps, identified with the recusant smith who fled before    Fingal from Ireland to the Orkneys, and being there overtaken, was compelled    to forge the sword which Fingal afterwards wore in all his battles, and which    was called the Son of the dark brown Luno, from the name of the armourer who    forged it. <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">21</font></a> 
 </p><p>      From this it will appear that there were originals    enough in the mythology of the Goths, as well as Celts, to furnish the modern    attributes ascribed to Satan in later times, when the object of painter or poet    was to display him in his true form and with all his terrors. Even the genius    of Guido and of Tasso have been unable to surmount this prejudice, the more    rooted, perhaps, that the wicked are described as goats in Scripture, and that    the devil is called the old dragon. In Raffael's famous painting of the archangel    Michael binding Satan, the dignity, power, and angelic character expressed by    the seraph form an extraordinary contrast to the poor conception of a being    who ought not, even in that lowest degradation, to have seemed so unworthy an    antagonist. Neither has Tasso been more happy, where he represents the divan    of darkness in the enchanted forest as presided over by a monarch having a  huge tail, hoofs, and all the usual accompaniments    of popular diablerie. The genius of Milton alone could discard all these vulgar    puerilities, and assign to the author of evil the terrible dignity of one who    should seem not "less than archangel ruined." This species of degradation is    yet grosser when we take into consideration the changes which popular opinions    have wrought respecting the taste, habits, powers, modes of tempting, and habits    of tormenting, which are such as might rather be ascribed to some stupid superannuated    and doting ogre of a fairy tale, than to the powerful-minded demon who fell    through pride and rebellion, not through folly or incapacity. 
 </p><p>      Having, however, adopted our present ideas of    the devil as they are expressed by his nearest acquaintances, the witches, from    the accounts of satyrs, which seem to have been articles of faith both among    the Celtic and Gothic tribes, we must next notice another fruitful fountain    of demonological fancies. But as this source of the mythology of the Middle    Ages must necessarily comprehend some account of the fairy folk, to whom much    of it must be referred, it is necessary to make a pause before we enter upon    the mystic and marvellous connexion supposed to exist between the impenitent    kingdom of Satan and those merry dancers by moonlight. <br> <br>

There is a species of small  intrenchment on the western descent of the Eildon hills, which Mr. Milne, in his  account of the parish of Melrose, drawn up about eighty years ago, says, was denominated  <i>Bourjo</i>, a word of unknown derivation, by which the place is still known.  Here an universal and subsisting tradition bore that human sacrifices were of  yore offered, while the people assisting could be hold the ceremony from the elevation  of the glacis which slopes inward. With this place of sacrifice communicated a  path, still discernible, called the <i>Haxell-gate; </i>leading to a small glen  or narrow valley called the <i>HaxelleIeuch</i>-both which words are probably  derived from the Haxa or chief priestess of the pagans.</p>
