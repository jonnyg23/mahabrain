 <p>     WE may premise by observing, that the classics    had not forgotten to enrol in their mythology a certain species of subordinate    deities, resembling the modern elves in their habits. Good old Mr. Gibb, of    the Advocates' Library (whom all lawyers whose youth he assisted in their studies,    by his knowledge of that noble collection, are bound to name with gratitude),    used to point out, amongst the ancient altars under his charge, one which is    consecrated, <i>Diis</i> <i>campestribus, </i>and usually added, with a wink,    "The fairies, ye ken." <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">22</font></a> This relic of antiquity was discovered    near Roxburgh Castle, and a vicinity more delightfully appropriate to the abode    of the silvan deities can hardly be found.  Two rivers of considerable size, made yet more    remarkable by the fame which has rendered them in some sort classical, unite    their streams beneath the vestiges of an extensive castle, renowned in the wars    with England, and for the valiant, noble, and even royal blood, which has been    shed around and before it -- a landscape ornamented with the distant village    and huge abbey tower of Kelso, arising out of groves of aged trees -- the modern    mansion of Fleurs, with its terrace, its woods, and its extensive lawn -- form    altogether a kingdom for Oberon and Titania to reign in, or any spirit who,    before their time, might love scenery, of which the majesty, and even the beauty,    impress the mind with a sense of awe mingled with pleasure. These silvans, satyrs,    and fauns with whom superstition peopled the lofty banks and tangled copses    of this romantic country, were obliged to give place to deities very nearly    resembling themselves in character, who probably derive some of their attributes    from their classic predecessors, although more immediately allied to the barbarian    conquerors. We allude to the fairies, which, as received into the popular creed,    and as described by the poets who have made use of them as machinery, are certainly    among the most pleasing legacies of fancy. 
 </p><p>      Dr. Leyden, who exhausted on this subject, as    upon most others, a profusion of learning, found the first idea of the elfin    people in the Northern opinions concerning the duergar, or dwarfs. <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">23</font></a>    These were, however, it must be owned, spirits of a coarser sort, more laborious    vocation, and more malignant temper, and in all respects less propitious to    humanity, than the fairies (properly so called), which were the invention of    the Celtic people, and displayed that superiority of taste and fancy which,    with the love of music and poetry, has been generally ascribed to their race,    through its various classes and modifications.   In fact, there seems reason to conclude that    these duergar were originally nothing else than the diminutive natives of the    Lappish, Lettish, and Finnish nations, who, flying before the conquering weapons    of the Asæ, sought the most retired regions of the North, and there endeavoured    to hide themselves from their Eastern invaders, They were a little, diminutive    race, but possessed of some skill probably in mining or smelting minerals, with    which the country abounds. Perhaps also they might, from their acquaintance    with the changes of the clouds, or meteorological phenomena, be judges of weather,    and so enjoy another title to supernatural skill. At any rate, it has been plausibly    supposed that these poor people, who sought caverns and hiding-places from the    persecution of the Asæ, were in some respects compensated for inferiority    in strength and stature by the art and power with which the superstition of    the enemy invested them. These oppressed yet dreaded fugitives obtained, naturally    enough, the character of the German spirits called Kobold, from which the English    goblin and the Scottish bogle, by some inversion and alteration of pronunciation,    are evidently derived. 
 </p><p>      The Kobolds were a species of gnomes, who haunted    the dark and solitary places, and were often seen in the mines, where they seemed    to imitate the labours of the miners, and sometimes took pleasure in frustrating    their objects and rendering their toil unfruitful. Sometimes they were malignant,    especially if neglected or insulted; but sometimes also they were indulgent    to individuals whom they took under their protection. When a miner, therefore,    hit upon a rich vein of ore, the inference commonly was, not that he possessed    more skill, industry, or even luck, than his fellow-workmen, but that the spirits    of the mine had directed him to the treasure. The employment and apparent occupation    of these subterranean gnomes or fiends, led very naturally to identify the Fin,    or Laplander, with the Kobold; but it was a bolder stretch of the imagination    which confounded  this reserved and sullen race with the livelier    and gayer spirit which bears correspondence with the British fairy. Neither    can we be surprised that the duergar, ascribed by many persons to this source,    should exhibit a darker and more malignant character than the elves that revel    by moonlight in more southern climates. 
 </p><p>      According to the old Norse belief, these dwarfs    form the current machinery of the Northern Sagas, and their inferiority in size    is represented as compensated by skill and wisdom superior to those of ordinary    mortals. In the "Niebelungen-Lied," one of the oldest romances of Germany, and    compiled, it would seem, not long after the time of Attila, Theodorick of Bern,    or of Verona, figures among a cycle of champions over whom he presides, like    the Charlemagne of France or Arthur of England. Among others vanquished by him    is the Elf King, or Dwarf Laurin, whose dwelling was in an enchanted garden    of roses, and who had a body-guard of giants, a sort of persons seldom supposed    to be themselves conjurers. He becomes a formidable opponent to Theodorick and    his chivalry; but as he attempted by treachery to attain the victory, he is,    when overcome, condemned to fill the dishonourable yet appropriate office of    buffoon and juggler at the Court of Verona. <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">24</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Such possession of supernatural wisdom is still    imputed by the natives of the Orkney and Zetland Islands to the people called    <i>Drows</i>, being a corruption of duergar or <i>dwarfs</i>, and who may, in    most other respects, be identified with the Caledonian fairies. Lucas Jacobson    Debes, who dates his description of Ferro from his Pathos, in Thorshaven, March    12, 1670, dedicates a long chapter to the spectres who disturbed his congregation,    and sometimes carried off his hearers. The actors in these disturbances he states    to be the <i>Skow</i>, or <i>Biergen-Trold -- i.e., </i>the spirits  of the woods and mountains, sometimes called    subterranean people, and adds, they appeared in deep caverns and among horrid    rocks; as also, that they haunted the places where murders or other deeds of    mortal sin had been acted. They appear to have been the genuine northern dwarfs,    or Trows, another pronunciation of Trollds, and are considered by the reverend    author as something very little better than actual fiends. 
 </p><p>      But it is not only, or even chiefly, to the    Gothic race that we must trace the opinions concerning the elves of the middle    ages; these, as already hinted, were deeply blended with the attributes which    the Celtic tribes had, from the remotest ages, ascribed to their deities of    rocks, valleys, and forests. We have already observed, what indeed makes a great    feature of their national character, that the power of the imagination is peculiarly    active among the Celts, and leads to an, enthusiasm concerning national music    and dancing, national poetry and song, the departments in which fancy most readily    indulges herself. The Irish, the Welsh, the Gael, or Scottish Highlander, all    tribes of Celtic descent, assigned to the Men of Peace, Good Neighbours, or    by whatever other names they called these sylvan pigmies, more social habits,    and a course of existence far more gay, than the sullen and heavy toils of the    more saturnine Duergar. Their elves did not avoid the society of men, though    they behaved to those who associated with them with caprice, which rendered    it dangerous to displease them; and although their gifts were sometimes valuable,    they were usually wantonly given and unexpectedly resumed. 
 </p><p>      The employment, the benefits, the amusements    of the Fairy court, resembled the aerial people themselves. Their government    was always represented as monarchical. A King, more frequently a Queen of Fairies,    was acknowledged; and sometimes both held their court together. Their pageants    and court entertainments comprehended all that the imagination could conceive    of what was, by that   age, accounted gallant and splendid. At their    processions they paraded more beautiful steeds than those of mere earthly parentage    -- the hawks and hounds which they employed in their chase were of the first    race. At their daily banquets, the board was set forth with a splendour which    the proudest kings of the earth dared not aspire to; and the hall of their dancers    echoed to the most exquisite music. But when viewed by the eye of a seer the    illusion vanished. The young knights and beautiful ladies showed themselves    as wrinkled carles and odious hags-their wealth turned into slate-stones --    their splendid plate into pieces of clay fantastically twisted -- and their    victuals, unsavoured by salt (prohibited to them, we are told, because an emblem    of eternity), became tasteless and insipid -- the stately halls were turned    into miserable damp caverns -- all the delights of the Elfin Elysium vanished    at once. In a word, their pleasures were showy, but totally unsubstantial --    their activity unceasing, but fruitless and unavailing -- and their condemnation    appears to have consisted in the necessity of maintaining the appearance of    constant industry or enjoyment, though their toil was fruitless <i>and their    </i>pleasures shadowy and unsubstantial. Hence poets have designed them as "<i>the</i>    <i>crew that never rest." </i>Besides the unceasing and useless bustle in which    these spirits seemed to live, they had propensities unfavourable and distressing    to mortals. 
 </p><p>      One injury of a very serious nature was supposed    to be constantly practised by the fairies against "the human mortals," that    of carrying off their children, and breeding them as beings of their race. Unchristened    infants were chiefly exposed to this calamity; but adults were also liable to    be abstracted from earthly commerce, notwithstanding it was their natural sphere.    With respect to the first, it may be easily conceived that the want of the sacred    ceremony of introduction into the Christian church rendered them the more obnoxious    to the power of those creatures, who, if not  to be in all respects considered as fiends, had    nevertheless, considering their constant round of idle occupation, little right.    to rank themselves among good spirits, and were accounted by most divines as    belonging to a very different class. An adult, on the other hand, must have    been engaged in some action which exposed him to the power of the spirits, and    so, as the legal phrase went, "taken in the manner." Sleeping on a fairy mount,    within which the Fairy court happened to be held for the time, was a very ready    mode of obtaining a pass for Elfland. It was well for the individual if the    irate elves were contented, on such occasions, with transporting him through    the air to a city at some forty miles' distance, and leaving, perhaps, his hat    or bonnet on some steeple between, to mark the direct line of his course. Others,    when engaged in some unlawful action, or in the act of giving way to some headlong    and sinful passion, exposed themselves also to become inmates of Fairyland. 
 </p><p>      The same belief on these points obtained in    Ireland. Glanville, in his "Eighteenth Relation," tells us of the butler of    a gentleman, a neighbour of the Earl of Orrery, who was sent to purchase cards.    In crossing the fields, he saw a table surrounded by people apparently feasting    and making merry. They rose to salute him, and invited him to join in their    revel; but a friendly voice from the party whispered in his ear, "Do nothing    which this company invite you to." Accordingly, when he refused to join in feasting,    the table vanished, and the company began to dance and play on musical instruments;    but the butler would not take part in these recreations. They then left off    dancing, and betook themselves to work; but neither in this would the mortal    join them. He was then left alone for the present; but in spite of the exertions    of my Lord Ornery, in spite of two bishops who were his guests at the time,    in spite of the celebrated Mr. Greatrix, it was all they could do to prevent    the butler from being carried off bodily from  amongst them by the fairies, who considered him    as their lawful prey. They raised him in the air above the heads of the mortals,    who could only run beneath, to break his fall when they pleased to let him go.    The spectre which formerly advised the poor man continued to haunt him, and    at length discovered himself to be the ghost of an acquaintance who had been    dead for seven years. "You know," added he, "I lived a loose life, and ever    since have I been hurried up and down in a restless condition, with the company    you saw, and shall be till the day of judgment." He added, "that if the butler    had acknowledged God in all his ways, be had not suffered so much by their means;    he reminded him that he had not prayed to God in the morning before be met with    this company in the field, and, moreover, that he was then going on an unlawful    business. 
 </p><p>      It is pretended that Lord Orrery confirmed the    whole of this story, even to having seen the butler raised into the air by the    invisible beings who strove to carry him off. Only he did not bear witness to    the passage which seems to call the purchase of cards an unlawful errand. <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">25</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Individuals, whose lives had been engaged in    intrigues of politics or stratagems of war, were sometimes surreptitiously carried    off to Fairyland; as Alison Pearson, the sorceress who cured Archbishop Adamson,    averred that she had recognised in the Fairy court the celebrated Secretary    Lethington and the old Knight of Buccleuch, the one of whom had been the most    busy politician, the other one of the most unwearied partisans of Queen Mary,    during the reign of that unfortunate queen. Upon the whole, persons carried    off by sudden death were usually suspected of having fallen into the hands of    the fairies, and unless redeemed from their power, which it was not always safe    to attempt, were doomed to conclude their lives with them. We must not omit    to state that those who had an intimate  communication with these spirits, while they    were yet inhabitants of middle earth, were most apt to be seized upon and carried    off to Elfland before their death. 
 </p><p>      The reason assigned for this kidnapping of the    human race, so peculiar to the elfin people, is said to be that they were under    a necessity of paying to the infernal regions a yearly tribute out of their    population, which they were willing to defray by delivering up to the prince    of these regions the children of the human race, rather than their own. From    this it must be inferred, that they have off-spring among themselves, as it    is said by some authorities, and particularly by Mr. Kirke, the minister of    Aberfoyle. He indeed adds that, after a certain length of life, these spirits    are subject to the universal lot of mortality -- a position, however, which    has been controverted, and is scarcely reconcilable to that which holds them    amenable to pay a tax to hell, which infers existence as eternal as the fire    which is not quenched. The opinions on the subject of the fairy people here    expressed, are such as are entertained in the Highlands and some remote quarters    of the Lowlands of Scotland. We know, from the lively and entertaining legends    published by Mr. Crofton Croker -- which, though in most cases told with the    wit of the editor and the humour of his country, contain points of curious antiquarian    information -- that the opinions of the Irish are conformable to the account    we have given of the general creed of the Celtic nations respecting elves. If    the Irish elves are anywise distinguished from those of Britain, it seems to    be by their disposition to divide into factions and fight among themselves --    a pugnacity characteristic of the Green Isle. The Welsh fairies, according to    John Lewis, barrister-at-law, agree in the same general attributes with those    of Ireland and Britain. We must not omit the creed of the Manxmen, since we    find, from the ingenious researches of Mr. Waldron, that the Isle of Man, beyond    other places in Britain, was a peculiar depository of the fairy traditions,  which, on the island being conquered by the Norse,    became, in all probability, chequered with those of Scandinavia from a source    peculiar and more direct than that by which they reached Scotland or Ireland. 
 </p><p>      Such as it was, the popular system of the Celts    easily received the northern admixture of Drows and Duergar, which gave the    belief, perhaps, a darker colouring than originally belonged to the British    fairyland. It was from the same source also, in all probability, that additional    legends were obtained of a gigantic and malignant female, the Hecate of this    mythology, who rode on the storm and marshalled the rambling host of wanderers    under her grim banner. This bag (in all respects the reverse of the Mab or Titania    of the Celtic creed) was called Nicneven in that later system which blended    the faith of the Celts and of the Goths on this subject. The great Scottish    poet Dunbar has made a spirited description of this Hecate riding at the head    of witches and good neighbours (fairies, namely), sorceresses and elves, indifferently,    upon the ghostly eve of All-Hallow Mass. <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">26</font></a> In Italy we hear    of the hags arraying themselves under the orders of Diana (in her triple character    of Hecate, doubtless) and Herodias, who were the joint leaders of their choir,    But we return to the more simple fairy belief, as entertained by the Celts before    they were conquered by the Saxons. 
 </p><p>      Of these early times we can know little; but    it is singular to remark what light the traditions of Scotland throw upon the    poetry of the Britons of Cumberland, then called Reged. Merlin Wyllt, or the    wild, is mentioned by both; and that renowned wizard, the son of an elf or fairy,    with King Arthur, the dubious champion of Britain at that early period, were    both said by tradition to have been abstracted by the fairies, and to have vanished    without having suffered death, just at the time when it was supposed that the    magic of the wizard and the celebrated sword of the monarch, which had   done so much to preserve British independence,    could no longer avert the impending ruin. It may be conjectured that there was    a desire on the part of Arthur or his surviving champions to conceal his having    received a mortal wound in the fatal battle of Camlan; and to that we owe the    wild and beautiful incident so finely versified by Bishop Percy, in which, in    token of his renouncing in future the use of arms, the monarch sends his attendant,    sole survivor of the field, to throw his sword Excalibar into the lake hard    by. Twice eluding the request, the esquire at last complied, and threw the far-famed    weapon into the lonely mere. A hand and arm arose from the water and caught    Excalibar by the hilt, flourished it thrice, and then sank into the lake. <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">27</font></a>    The astonished messenger returned to his master to tell him the marvels he had    seen, but he only saw a boat at a distance push from the land, and heard shrieks    of females in agony: --  <br> <br> "And whether the king was there or not <br> He never knew, he never colde <br> For never since that doleful day <br> Was British Arthur seen on molde." <br> 
 </p><p>      The circumstances attending the disappearance    of Merlin would probably be found as imaginative as those of Arthur's removal,    but they cannot be recovered; and what is singular enough, circumstances which    originally belonged to the history of this famous bard, said to be the son of    the Demon himself, have been transferred to a later poet, and surely one of    scarce inferior name, Thomas of Erceldoune. The legend was supposed to be only    preserved among the inhabitants of his native valleys, but a copy as old as    the reign of Henry VII, has been recovered. The story is interesting and beautifully    told, and, as one of the oldest fairy legends, may well be quoted in this place. 
 </p><p>      Thomas of Erceldoune, in Lauderdale, called    the Rhymer, on account of his producing a poetical romance on the  subject of Tristrem and Yseult, which is curious    as the earliest specimen of English verse known to exist, flourished in the    reign of Alexander III. of Scotland. Like other men of talent of the period,    Thomas was suspected of magic. He was said also to have the gift of prophecy,    which was accounted for in the following peculiar manner, referring entirely    to the elfin superstition: -- As True Thomas (we give him the epithet by anticipation)    lay on Huntly Bank, a place on the descent of the Eildon Hills, which raise    their triple crest above the celebrated Monastery of Melrose, he saw a lady    so extremely beautiful that he imagined it must be the Virgin Mary herself.    Her appointments, however, were rather those of an Amazon or goddess of the    woods. Her steed was of the highest beauty and spirit, and at his mane hung    thirty silver bells and nine, which made music to the wind as she paced along.    Her saddle was of <i>royal</i> <i>bone </i>(ivory), laid over with <i>orfeverie    -- i.e., </i>goldsmith's work. Her stirrups, her dress, all corresponded with    her extreme beauty and the magnificence of her array. The fair huntress had    her bow in her hand, and her arrows at her belt. She led three greyhounds in    a leash, and three raches, or hounds of scent, followed her closely. She rejected    and disclaimed the homage which Thomas desired to pay to her; so that, passing    from one extremity to the other, Thomas became as bold as he had at first been    humble. The lady warns him that he must become her slave if he should prosecute    his suit towards her in the manner he proposes. Before their interview terminates,    the appearance of the beautiful lady is changed into that of the most hideous    hag in existence. One side is blighted and wasted, as if by palsy; one eye drops    from her head; her colour, as clear as the virgin silver, is now of a dun leaden    hue. A witch from the spital or almshouse would have been a goddess in comparison    to the late beautiful huntress. Hideous as she was, Thomas's irregular desires    had placed him under the control of this hag, and when she  bade him take leave of sun, and of the leaf that    grew on tree, he felt himself under the necessity of obeying her. A cavern received    them, in which, following his frightful guide, he for three days travelled in    darkness, sometimes hearing the booming of a distant ocean, sometimes walking    through rivers of blood, which crossed their subterranean path. At length they    emerged into daylight, in a most beautiful orchard. Thomas, almost fainting    for want of food, stretches out his hand towards the goodly fruit which hangs    around him, but is forbidden by his conductress, who informs him these are the    fatal apples which were the cause of the fall of man. He perceives also that    his guide had no sooner entered this mysterious ground, and breathed its magic    air, than she was revived in beauty, equipage, and splendour, as fair, or fairer,    than he had first seen her on the mountain. She then commands him to lay his    head upon her knee, and proceeds to explain to him the character of the country.    "Yonder right-hand path," she says, "conveys the spirits of the blessed to Paradise;    yon downward and well-worn way leads sinful souls to the place of everlasting    punishment; the third road, by yonder dark brake, conducts to the milder place    of pain from which prayer and mass may release offenders. But see you yet a    fourth road, sweeping along the plain to yonder splendid castle ? Yonder is    the road to Elfland, to which we are now bound. The lord of the castle is king    of the country, and I am his queen. But, Thomas, I would rather be drawn with    wild horses, than he should know what hath passed between you and me. Therefore,    when we enter yonder castle, observe strict silence, and answer no question    that is asked at you, and I will account for your silence by saying I took your    speech when I brought you from middle earth." 
 </p><p>      Having thus instructed her lover, they journeyed    on to the castle, and entering by the kitchen, found themselves in the midst    of such a festive scene as might become the mansion of a great feudal lord or    prince. Thirty carcases   of deer were lying on the massive kitchen board,    under the hands of numerous cooks, who tolled to cut them up and dress them,    while the gigantic greyhounds which had taken the spoil lay lapping the blood,    and enjoying the sight of the slain game. They came next to the royal hall,    where the king received his loving consort without censure or suspicion. Knights    and ladies, dancing by threes (reels perhaps), occupied the floor of the hall,    and Thomas, the fatigues of his journey from the Eildon hills forgotten, went    forward and joined in the revelry. After a period, however, which seemed to    him a very short one, the queen spoke with him apart, and bade him prepare to    return to his own country. "Now," said the queen, "how long think you that you    have been here ? "Certes, fair lady," answered Thomas, "not above these seven    days." "You are deceived," answered the queen, "you have been seven <i>years</i>    in this castle; and it is full time you were gone. Know, Thomas, that the fiend    of hell will come to this castle to-morrow to demand his tribute, and so handsome    a man as you will attract his eye. For all the world would I not suffer you    to be betrayed to such a fate; therefore up, and let us be going." These terrible    news reconciled Thomas to his departure from Elfin land, and the queen was not    long in placing him upon Huntly bank, where the birds were singing. She took    a tender leave of him, and to ensure his reputation, bestowed on him the tongue    which <i>could not lie</i>. Thomas in vain objected to this inconvenient and    involuntary adhesion to veracity, which would make him, as he thought, unfit    for church or for market, for kings court or for lady's bower. But all his remonstrances    were disregarded by the lady, and Thomas the Rhymer, whenever the discourse    turned on the future, gained the credit of a prophet whether he would or not;    for be could say nothing but what was sure to come to pass. It is plain that    had Thomas been a legislator instead or a poet, we have here the story of Numa    and Egeria.   Thomas remained several years in his own tower    near Erceldoune, and enjoyed the fame of his predictions, several of which are    current among the country people to this day. At length, as the prophet was    entertaining the Earl of March in his dwelling, a cry of astonishment arose    in the village, on the appearance of a hart and hind, <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">28</font></a> which    left the forest and, contrary to their shy nature, came quietly onward, traversing    the village towards the dwelling of Thomas. The prophet instantly rose from    the board; and, acknowledging the prodigy as the summons of his fate, he accompanied    the hart and hind into the forest, and though occasionally seen by individuals    to whom he has chosen to show himself, has never again mixed familiarly with    mankind. 
 </p><p>      Thomas of Erceldoune, during his retirement,    has been supposed, from time to time, to be levying forces to take the field    in some crisis of his country's fate. The story has often been told of a daring    horse-jockey having sold a black horse to a man of venerable and antique appearance,    who appointed the remarkable hillock upon Eildon hills, called the Lucken-hare,    as the place where, at twelve o'clock at night, he should receive the price.    He came, his money was paid in ancient coin, and he was invited by his customer    to view his residence. The trader in horses followed his guide in the deepest    astonishment through several long ranges of stalls, in each of which a horse    stood motionless, while an armed warrior lay equally still at the charger's    feet. "All these men," said the wizard in a whisper, "will awaken at the battle    of Sheriffmoor." At the extremity of this extraordinary depôt hung a sword    and a born, which the prophet pointed out to the horse-dealer as containing    the means of dissolving the spell. The man in confusion took the horn, and attempted    to wind it. The horses  instantly started in their stalls, stamped, and    shook their bridles, the men arose and clashed their armour, and the mortal,    terrified at the tumult he had excited, dropped the horn from his hand. A voice    like that of a giant, louder even than the tumult around, pronounced these words:    --  <br> <br> "Woe to the coward that ever he was born, <br> That did not draw the sword before he blew the horn !" <br> 
 </p><p>     A whirlwind expelled the horse-dealer from the    cavern, the entrance to which he could never again find. A moral might be perhaps    extracted from the legend -- namely, that it is best to be armed against danger    before bidding it defiance. But it is a circumstance worth notice, that although    this edition of the tale is limited to the year 1715, by the very mention of    the Sheriffmoor, yet a similar story appears to have been current during the    reign of Queen Elizabeth, which is given by Reginald Scot. The narrative is    edifying as peculiarly illustrative of the mode of marring a curious tale in    telling it, which was one of the virtues professed by Caius when he hired himself    to King Lear. Reginald Scot, incredulous on the subject of witchcraft, seems    to have given some weight to the belief of those who thought that the spirits    of famous men do, after death, take up some particular habitations near cities,    towns, and countries, and act as tutelary and guardian spirits to the places    which they loved while in the flesh. 
 </p><p>      "But more particularly to illustrate this conjecture,"    says he, "I could name a person who hath lately appeared thrice since his decease,    at least some ghostly being or other that calls itself by the name of such a    person who was dead above a hundred years ago, and was in his lifetime accounted    as a prophet or predicter by the assistance of sublunary spirits; and now, at    his appearance, did also give strange predictions respecting famine and plenty,    war and bloodshed, and the end of the world. By the information of the person    that had communication with him, the last of his appearances was in the following    manner: -- "I  had been," said he, "to sell a horse at the next    market own, but not attaining my price, as I returned home by the I met this    man, who began to be familiar with me, asking what news, and how affairs moved    through the country. I answered as I thought fit; withal, I told him of my horse,    whom he began to cheapen, and proceeded with me so far that the price was agreed    upon. So he turned back with me, and told me that if I would go along with him    I should receive my money. On our way we went, I upon my horse, and he on another    milk-white east. After much travel I asked him where he dwelt and what his name    was. He told me that his dwelling was a mile off, at a place called <i>Farran</i>,    of which place I had never heard, though I knew all the country round about.     <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">29</font></a> He also told me that he himself was that person of the family    of Learmonths <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>    so much spoken of as a prophet. At which I began to be somewhat fearful, perceiving    we were on a road which I never had been on before, which increased my fear    and amazement more. Well, on we went till he brought me under ground, I knew    not how, into the presence of a beautiful woman, who paid the money without    a word speaking. He conducted me out again through a large and long entry, where    I saw above six hundred men in armour laid prostrate on the ground as if asleep.    At last I found myself in the open field by the help of the moonlight, in the    very place where I first met him, and made a shift to get home by three in the    morning. But the money I had received was just double of what I esteemed it    when the woman paid me, of which at this instant I have several pieces to show,    consisting of ninepennies, thirteen pence-halfpennies," &amp;c. <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>   It is a great pity that this horse-dealer, having    specimens of the fairy coin, of a quality more permanent than usual had not    favoured us with an account of an impress s valuable to medalists. It is not    the less edifying, as we are deprived of the more picturesque parts of the story,    to learn that Thomas's payment was as faithful as his prophecies. The beautiful    lady who bore the purse must have been undoubtedly the Fairy Queen, whose affection,    though, like that of his own heroine Yseult, we cannot term it altogether laudable,    seems yet to have borne a faithful and firm character. 
 </p><p>      I have dwelt at some length on the story of    Thomas the Rhymer, as the oldest tradition of the kind which has reached us    in detail, and as pretending to show the fate of the first Scottish poet, whose    existence, and its date, are established both by history and records; and who,    if we consider him as writing in the Anglo-Norman language, was certainly one    among the earliest of its versifiers. But the legend is still more curious,    from its being the first and most distinguished instance of a man alleged to    have obtained supernatural knowledge by means of the fairies. 
 </p><p>      Whence or how this singular community derived    their more common popular name, we may say has not as yet been very clearly    established. It is the opinion of the learned that the Persian word Peri, expressing    an unearthly being, of a species very similar, will afford the best derivation,    if we suppose it to have reached Europe through the medium of the Arabians,    in whose alphabet the letter P does not exist, so that they pronounce the word    Feri instead of Peri. Still there is something uncertain in this etymology.    We hesitate to ascribe either to the Persians or the Arabians the distinguishing    name of an ideal commonwealth, the notion of which they certainly did not contribute    to us. Some are, therefore, tempted to suppose that the elves may have obtained    their most frequent name from their being <i>par excellence </i>a <i>fair</i>    or <i>comely</i> people, a quality which they  affected on all occasions; while the superstition    of the Scottish was likely enough to give them a name which might propitiate    the vanity for which they deemed the race remarkable; just as, in other instances,    they called the fays "men of peace," "good neighbours," and by other titles    of the like import. It must be owned, at the same time, that the words <i>fay</i>    and <i>fairy </i>may have been mere adoptions of the French <i>fee</i> and <i>feerie,</i>    though these terms, on the other side of the Channel, have reference to a class    of spirits corresponding, not to our fairies, but with the far different Fata    of the Italians. But this is a question which we willingly leave for the decision    of better etymologists than ourselves. <br> <br>
