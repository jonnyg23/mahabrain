 <p>     WHILE the vulgar endeavoured to obtain a glance    into the darkness of futurity by consulting the witch or fortune-teller, the    great were supposed to have a royal path of their own, commanding a view from    a loftier quarter of the same <i>terra incognita</i>. This was represented as    accessible by several routes. Physiognomy, chiromancy, and other fantastic arts    of prediction afforded each its mystical assistance and guidance. But the road    most flattering to human vanity, while it was at the same time most seductive    to human credulity, was that of astrology, the queen of mystic sciences, who  flattered those who confided in her that the    planets and stars in their spheres figure forth and influence the fate of the    creatures of mortality, and that a sage acquainted with her lore could predict,    with some approach to certainty, the events of any man's career, his chance    of success in life or in marriage, his advance in favour of the great, or answer    any other horary questions, as they were termed, which he might be anxious to    propound, provided always he could supply the exact moment of his birth. This,    in the sixteenth and greater part of the seventeenth centuries, was all that    was necessary to enable the astrologer to erect a scheme of the position of    the heavenly bodies, which should disclose the life of the interrogator, or    Native, as he was called, with all its changes, past, present, and to come. 
 </p><p>      Imagination was dazzled by a prospect so splendid;    and we find that in the sixteenth century the cultivation of this fantastic    science was the serious object of men whose understandings and acquirements    admit of no question. Bacon himself allowed the truth which might be found in    a wellregulated astrology, making thus a distinction betwixt the art as commonly    practised and the manner in which it might, as he conceived, be made a proper    use of. But a grave or sober use of this science, if even Bacon could have taught    such moderation, would not have suited the temper of those who, inflamed by    hopes of temporal aggrandizement, pretended to understand and explain to others    the language of the stars. Almost all the other paths of mystic knowledge led    to poverty; even the alchemist, though talking loud and high of the endless    treasures his art was to produce, lived from day to day and from year to year    upon hopes as unsubstantial as the smoke of his furnace. But the pursuits of    the astrologer were such as called for instant remuneration. He became rich    by the eager hopes and fond credulity of those who consulted him, and that artist    lived by duping others, instead of starving, like others, by duping himself.    The wisest men have been cheated by the idea that some  supernatural influence upheld and guided them;    and from the time of Wallenstein to that of Buonaparte, ambition and success    have placed confidence in the species of fatalism inspired by a belief of the    influence of their own star. Such being the case, the science was little pursued    by those who, faithful in their remarks and reports, must soon have discovered    its delusive vanity through the splendour of its professions; and the place    of such calm and disinterested pursuers of truth was occupied by a set of men    sometimes ingenious, always forward and assuming, whose knowledge was imposition,    whose responses were, like the oracles of yore, grounded on the desire of deceit,    and who, if sometimes they were elevated into rank and fortune, were more frequently    found classed with rogues and vagabonds. This was the more apt to be the case    that a sufficient stock of impudence, and some knowledge by rote of the terms    of art, were all the store of information necessary for establishing a conjurer.    The natural consequence of the degraded character of the professors was the    degradation of the art itself. Lilly, who wrote the history of his own life    and times, notices in that curious volume the most distinguished persons of    his day, who made pretensions to astrology, and almost without exception describes    them as profligate, worthless, sharking cheats, abandoned to vice, and imposing,    by the grossest frauds, upon the silly fools who consulted them. From what we    learn of his own history, Lilly himself, a low-born ignorant man, with some    gloomy shades of fanaticism in his temperament, was sufficiently fitted to dupe    others, and perhaps cheated himself merely by perusing, at an advanced period    of life, some of the astrological tracts devised by men of less cunning, though    perhaps more pretence to science, than he himself might boast. Yet the public    still continue to swallow these gross impositions, though coming from such unworthy    authority. The astrologers embraced different sides of the Civil War, and the    king on one side, with the Parliamentary  leaders on the other, were both equally curious    to know, and eager to believe, what Lilly, Wharton, or Gadbury had discovered    from the heavens touching the fortune of the strife. Lilly was a prudent person,    contriving with some address to shift the sails of his prophetic bark so as    to suit the current of the time, and the gale of fortune. No person could better    discover from various omens the course of Charles's misfortunes, so soon as    they had come to pass. In the time of the Commonwealth he foresaw the perpetual    destruction of the monarchy, and in 1660 this did not prevent his foreseeing    the restoration of Charles II. He maintained some credit even among the better    classes, for Aubrey and Ashmole both called themselves his friends, being persons    extremely credulous, doubtless, respecting the mystic arts. Once a year, too,    the astrologers had a public dinner or feast, where the knaves were patronised    by the company of such fools as claimed the title of Philomaths -- that is,    lovers of the mathematics, by which name were still distinguished those who    encouraged the pursuit of mystical prescience, the most opposite possible to    exact science. Elias Ashmole, the " most honourable Esquire," to whom Lilly's    life is dedicated, seldom failed to attend; nay, several men of sense and knowledge    honoured this rendezvous. Congreve's picture of a man like Foresight, the dupe    of astrology and its sister arts, was then common in society. But the astrologers    of the 17th century did not confine themselves to the stars. There was no province    of fraud which they did not practise; they were scandalous as panders, and as    quacks sold potions for the most unworthy purposes. For such reasons the common    people detested the astrologers of the great as cordially as they did the more    vulgar witches of their own sphere. 
 </p><p>      Dr. Lamb, patronised by the Duke of Buckingham,    who, like other overgrown favourites, was inclined to cherish astrology, was    in 1640 pulled to pieces in the city of London by the enraged populace, and    his maid-servant, thirteen  years afterwards, hanged as a witch at Salisbury.    In the villanous transaction of the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury, in King    James's time, much mention was made of the art and skill of Dr. Forman, another    professor of the same sort with Lamb, who was consulted by the Countess of Essex    on the best mode of conducting her guilty intrigue with the Earl of Somerset.    He was dead before the affair broke out, which might otherwise have cost him    the gibbet, as it did all others concerned, with the exception only of the principal    parties, the atrocious authors of the crime. When the cause was tried, some    little puppets were produced in court, which were viewed by one party with horror,    as representing the most horrid spells. It was even said that the devil was    about to pull down the court-house on their being discovered. Others of the    audience only saw in them the baby figures on which the dressmakers then, as    now, were accustomed to expose new fashions. 
 </p><p>      The erection of the Royal Society, dedicated    to far different purposes than the pursuits of astrology, had a natural operation    in bringing the latter into discredit; and although the credulity of the ignorant    and uninformed continued to support some pretenders to that science, the name    of Philomath, assumed by these persons and their clients, began to sink under    ridicule and contempt. When Sir Richard Steele set up the paper called the Guardian,    he chose, under the title of Nestor Ironside, to assume the character of an    astrologer, and issued predictions accordingly, one of which, announcing the    death of a person called Partridge, once a shoemaker, but at the time the conductor    of an Astrological Almanack, led to a controversy, which was supported with    great humour by Swift and other wags. I believe you will find that this, with    Swift's Elegy on the same person, is one of the last occasions in which astrology    has afforded even a jest to the good people of England. 
 </p><p>     This dishonoured science has some right to be    mentioned in a " Treatise on Demonology," because the earlier astrologers,  though denying the use of all necromancy -- that    is unlawful or black magic -- pretended always to a correspond, ence with the    various spirits of the elements, on the principles of the Rosicrucian philosophy.    They affirmed they could bind to their service, and imprison in a ring, a mirror,    or a stone, some fairy, sylph, or salamander, and compel it to appear when called,    and render answers to such questions as the viewer should propose. It is remarkable    that the sage himself did not pretend to see the spirit; but the task of viewer,    or reader, was entrusted to a third party, a boy or girl usually under the years    of puberty. Dr. Dee, an excellent mathematician, had a stone of this kind, and    is said to have been imposed upon concerning the spirits attached to it, their    actions and answers, by the report of one Kelly who acted as his viewer. The    unfortunate Dee was ruined by his associates both in fortune and reputation.    His show-stone or mirror is still preserved among other curiosities in the British    Museum. Some superstition of the same kind was introduced by the celebrated    Count Cagliostro, during the course of the intrigue respecting the diamond necklace    in which the late Marie Antoinette was so unfortunately implicated. 
 </p><p>      Dismissing this general class of impostors,    who are now seldom heard of, we come now briefly to mention some leading superstitions    once, perhaps, common to all the countries of Europe, but now restricted to    those which continue to be inhabited by an undisturbed and native race. Of these,    one of the most beautiful is the Irish fiction which assigns to certain families    of ancient descent and distinguished rank the privilege of a Banshie, as she    is called, or household fairy, whose office it is to appear, seemingly mourning,    while she announces the approaching death of some one of the destined race.    The subject has been so lately and beautifully investigated and illustrated    by Mr. Crofton Croker and others, that I may dispense with being very particular    regarding it. If I am rightly informed, the  distinction of a banshie is only allowed to families    of the pure Milesian stock, and is never ascribed to any descendant of the proudest    Norman or boldest Saxon who followed the banner of Earl Strongbow, much less    to adventurers of later date who have obtained settlements in the Green Isle. 
 </p><p>      Several families of the Highlands of Scotland    anciently laid claim to the distinction of an attendant spirit who performed    the office of the Irish banshie. Amongst them, however, the functions of this    attendant genius, whose form and appearance differed in different cases, were    not limited to announcing the dissolution of those whose days were numbered.    The Highlanders contrived to exact from them other points of service, sometimes    as warding off dangers of battle; at others, as guarding and protecting the    infant heir through the dangers of childhood; and sometimes as condescending    to interfere even in the sports of the chieftain, and point out the fittest    move to be made at chess, or the best card to be played at any other game. Among    those spirits who have deigned to vouch their existence by appearance of late    years, is that of an ancestor of the family of MacLean of Lochbuy. Before the    death of any of his race the phantom-chief gallops along the sea-beach near    to the castle, announcing the event by cries and lamentations. The spectre is    said to have rode his rounds and uttered his death-cries within these few years,    in consequence of which the family and clan, though much shocked, were in no    way surprised to hear by next accounts that their gallant chief was dead at    Lisbon, where he served under Lord Wellington. 
 </p><p>      Of a meaner origin and occupation was the Scottish    Brownie, already mentioned as somewhat resembling Robin Goodfellow in the frolicsome    days of Old England. This spirit was easily banished, or, as it was styled,    hired away, by the offer of clothes or food; but many of the simple inhabitants    could little see the prudence of parting with  such a useful domestic drudge, who served faithfully,    without fee and reward, food or raiment. Neither was it all times safe to reject    Brownie's assistance. Thus, we are informed by Brand, that a young man in the    Orkneys " used to brew, and sometimes read upon his Bible; to whom an old woman    in the house said, that Brownie was displeased with that book he read upon,    which, if he continued to do, they would get no more service of Brownie; but    he, being better instructed from that book, which was Brownie's eyesore and    the object of his wrath, when he brewed, would not suffer any sacrifice to be    given to Brownie; whereupon the first and second brewings were spoilt, and for    no use; for though the wort wrought well, yet in a little time it left off working,    and grew cold; but of the third broust, or brewing, he had ale very good, though    he would not give any sacrifice to Brownie, with whom afterwards they were no    more troubled." Another story of the same kind is told of a lady in Uist, who    refused, on religious grounds, the usual sacrifice to this domestic spirit.    The first and second brewings failed, but the third succeeded, and thus, when    Brownie lost the perquisite to which he had been so long accustomed, he abandoned    the inhospitable house, where his services had so long been faithfully rendered.    The last place in the south of Scotland supposed to have been honoured, or benefited,    by the residence of a Brownie, was Bodsbeck in Moffatdale, which has been the    subject of an entertaining tale by Mr. James Hogg, the self-instructed genius    of Ettrick Forest. 
 </p><p>      These particular superstitions, however, are    too limited, and too much obliterated from recollection, to call for special    discussion. The general faith in fairies has already undergone our consideration;    but something remains to be said upon another species of superstition, so general    that it may be called proper to mankind in every climate; so deeply rooted also    in human belief, that it is found to survive in states of society during which    all other fictions of the same  order are entirely dismissed from influence.    Mr. Crabbe, with his usual felicity, has called the belief in ghosts " the last    lingering fiction of the brain." 
 </p><p>      Nothing appears more simple at the first view    of the subject, than that human memory should recall and bring back to the eye    of the imagination, in perfect similitude, even the very form and features of    a person with whom we have been long conversant, or which have been imprinted    in our minds with indelible strength by some striking circumstances touching    our meeting in life. The son does not easily forget the aspect of an affectionate    father; and, for reasons opposite but equally powerful, the countenance of a    murdered person is engraved upon the recollection of his slayer. A thousand    additional circumstances, far too obvious to require recapitulation, render    the supposed apparition of the dead the most ordinary spectral phenomenon which    is ever believed to occur among the living. All that we have formerly said respecting    supernatural appearances in general, applies with peculiar force to the belief    of ghosts; for whether the cause of delusion exists in an excited imagination    or a disordered organic system, it is in this way that it commonly exhibits    itself. Hence Lucretius himself, the most absolute of sceptics, considers the    existence of ghosts, and their frequent apparition, as facts so undeniable that    he endeavours to account for them at the expense of assenting to a class of    phenomena very irreconcilable to his general system. As he will not allow of    the existence of the human soul, and at the same time cannot venture to question    the phenomena supposed to haunt the repositories of the dead, he is obliged    to adopt the belief that the body consists of several coats like those of an    onion, and that the outmost and thinnest, being detached by death, continues    to wander near the place of sepulture, in the exact resemblance of the person    while alive. 
 </p><p>      We have said there are many ghost stories which    we do not feel at liberty to challenge as impostures, because we are  confident that those who relate them on their    own authority actually believe what they assert, and may have good reason for    doing so, though there is no real phantom after all. We are far, therefore,    from averring that such tales are necessarily false. It is easy to suppose the    visionary has been imposed upon by a lively dream, a waking reverie, the excitation    of a powerful imagination, or the misrepresentation of a diseased organ of sight;    and in one or other of these causes, to say nothing of a system of deception    which may in many instances be probable, we apprehend a solution will be found    for all cases of what are called real ghost stories. 
 </p><p>      In truth, the evidence with respect to such    apparitions is very seldom accurately or distinctly questioned. A supernatural    tale is in most cases received as an agreeable mode of amusing society, and    he would be rather accounted a sturdy moralist than an entertaining companion    who should employ himself in assailing its credibility. It would indeed be a    solecism in manners, something like that of impeaching the genuine value of    the antiquities exhibited by a good-natured collector for the gratification    of his guests. This difficulty will appear greater should a company have the    rare good fortune to meet the person who himself witnessed the wonders which    he tells; a well-bred or prudent man will, under such circumstances, abstain    from using the rules of cross-examination practised in a court of justice; and    if in any case he presumes to do so, he is in danger of receiving answers, even    from the most candid and honourable persons, which are rather fitted to support    the credit of the story which they stand committed to maintain, than to the    pure service of unadorned truth. The narrator is asked, for example, some unimportant    question with respect to the apparition; he answers it on the hasty suggestion    of his own imagination, tinged as it is with belief of the general fact, and    by doing so often gives a feature of minute evidence which was before wanting,    and this with perfect unconsciousness on his own part. It is a rare occurrence,    indeed, to find an opportunity  of dealing with an actual ghost-seer; such instances,    however, I have certainly myself met with, and that in the case of able, wise,    candid, and resolute persons, of whose veracity I had every reason to be confident.    But in such instances shades of mental aberration have afterwards occurred,    which sufficiently accounted for the supposed apparitions, and will incline    me always to feel alarmed in behalf of the continued health of a friend who    should conceive himself to have witnessed such a visitation. 
 </p><p>      The nearest approximation which can be generally    made to exact evidence in this case, is the word of some individual who has    had the story, it may be, from the person to whom it has happened, but most    likely from his family, or some friend of the family. Far more commonly the    narrator possesses no better means of knowledge than that of dwelling in the    country where the thing happened, or being well acquainted with the outside    of the mansion in the inside of which the ghost appeared. 
 </p><p>      In every point the evidence of such a second-hand    retailer of the mystic story must fall under the adjudged case in an English    court. The judge stopped a witness who was about to give an account of the murder    upon trial, as it was narrated to him by the ghost of the murdered person. "    Hold, sir," said his lordship; " the ghost is an excellent witness, and his    evidence the best possible; but he cannot be heard by proxy in this court. Summon    him hither, and I'll hear him in person; but your communication is mere hearsay,    which my office compels me to reject." Yet it is upon the credit of one man,    who pledges it upon that of three or four persons, who have told it successively    to each other, that we are often expected to believe an incident inconsistent    with the laws of Nature, however agreeable to our love of the wonderful and    the horrible. 
 </p><p>      In estimating the truth or falsehood of such    stories it is evident we can derive no proofs from that period of society when    men affirmed boldly and believed stoutly all  the wonders which could be coined or fancied.    That such stories are believed and told by grave historians, only shows that    the wisest men cannot rise in all things above the general ignorance of their    age. Upon the evidence of such historians we might as well believe the portents    of ancient or the miracles of modern Rome. For example, we read in Clarendon    of the apparition of the ghost of Sir George Villiers to an ancient dependant.    This is no doubt a story told by a grave author, at a time when such stories    were believed by all the world; but does it follow that our reason must acquiesce    in a statement so positively contradicted by the voice of Nature through all    her works ? The miracle of raising a dead man was positively refused by our    Saviour to the Jews, who demanded it as a proof of his mission, because they    had already sufficient grounds of conviction; and, as they believed them not,    it was irresistibly argued by the Divine Person whom they tempted, that neither    would they believe if one arose from the dead. Shall we suppose that a miracle    refused for the conversion of God's chosen people was sent on a vain errand    to save the life of a profligate spendthrift ? I lay aside, you observe, entirely    the not unreasonable supposition that Towers, or whatever was the ghost-seer's    name, desirous to make an impression upon Buckingham, as an old servant of his    house, might be tempted to give him his advice, of which we are not told the    import, in the character of his father's spirit, and authenticate the tale by    the mention of some token known to him as a former retainer of the family. The    Duke was superstitious, and the ready dupe of astrologers and soothsayers. The    manner in which he had provoked the fury of the people must have warned every    reflecting person of his approaching fate; and, the age considered, it was not    unnatural that a faithful friend should take this mode of calling his attention    to his perilous situation. Or, if we suppose that the incident was not a mere    pretext to obtain access to the Duke's car, the messenger may have been  impressed upon by an idle dream -- in a word,    numberless conjectures might be formed for accounting for the event in a natural    way, the most extravagant of which is more probable than that the laws of Nature    were broken through in order to give a vain and fruitless warning to an ambitious    minion. 
 </p><p>      It is the same with all those that are called    accredited ghost stories usually told at the fireside. They want evidence. It    is true that the general wish to believe, rather than power of believing, has    given some such stories a certain currency in society. I may mention, as one    of the class of tales I mean, that of the late Earl St. Vincent, who watched,    with a friend, it is said, a whole night, in order to detect the cause of certain    nocturnal disturbances which took place in a certain mansion. The house was    under lease to Mrs. Ricketts, his sister. The result of his lordship's vigil    is said to have been that he heard the noises without being able to detect the    causes, and insisted on his sister giving up the house. This is told as a real    story, with a thousand different circumstances. But who has heard or seen an    authentic account from Earl St. Vincent, or from his " companion of the watch,"    or from his lordship's sister? And as in any other case such sure species of    direct evidence would be necessary to prove the facts, it seems unreasonable    to believe such a story on slighter terms. When the particulars are precisely    fixed and known, it might be time to enquire whether Lord St. Vincent, amid    the other eminent qualities of a first-rate seaman, might not be in some degree    tinged with their tendency to superstition; and still farther, whether, having    ascertained the existence of disturbances not immediately or easily detected,    his lordship might not advise his sister rather to remove than to remain in    a house so haunted, though he might believe that poachers or smugglers were    the worst ghosts by whom it was disturbed. 
 </p><p>      The story of two highly respectable officers    in the British  army, who are supposed to have seen the spectre    of the brother of one of them in a hut, or barrack, in America, is also one    of those accredited ghost tales, which attain a sort of brevet rank as true,    from the mention of respectable names as the parties who witnessed the vision.    But we are left without a glimpse when, how, and in what terms, this story obtained    its currency; as also by whom, and in what manner, it was first circulated;    and among the numbers by whom it has been quoted, although all agree in the    general event, scarcely two, even of those who pretend to the best information,    tell the story in the same way. 
 </p><p>      Another such story, in which the name of a lady    of condition is made use of as having seen an apparition in a country-seat in    France, is so far better borne out than those I have mentioned, that I have    seen a narrative of the circumstances attested by the party principally concerned.    That the house was disturbed seems to be certain, but the circumstances (though    very remarkable) did not, in my mind, by any means exclude the probability that    the disturbance and appearances were occasioned by the dexterous management    of some mischievously-disposed persons. 
 </p><p>      The remarkable circumstance of Thomas, the second    Lord Lyttelton, prophesying his own death within a few minutes, upon the information    of an apparition, has been always quoted as a true story. But of late it has    been said and published, that the unfortunate nobleman had previously determined    to take poison, and of course had it in his own power to ascertain the execution    of the prediction. It was no doubt singular that a man, who meditated his exit    from the world, should have chosen to play such a trick on his friends. But    it is still more credible that a whimsical man should do so wild a thing, than    that a messenger should be sent from the dead to tell a libertine at what precise    hour he should expire. 
 </p><p>      To this list other stories of the same class    might be added. But it is sufficient to show that such stories as these, having    gained a certain degree of currency in the  world, and bearing creditable names on their    front, walk through society unchallenged, like bills through a bank when they    bear respectable indorsations, although, it maybe, the signatures are forged    after all. There is, indeed, an unwillingness very closely to examine such subjects,    for the secret fund of superstition in every man's bosom is gratified by believing    them to be true, or at least induces him to abstain from challenging them as    false. And no doubt it must happen that the transpiring of incidents, in which    men have actually seen, or conceived that they saw, apparitions which were invisible    to others, contributes to the increase of such stories -- which do accordingly    sometimes meet us in a shape of veracity difficult to question. 
 </p><p>      The following story was narrated to me by my    friend, Mr. William Clerk, chief clerk to the jury Court, Edinburgh, when he    first learned it, now nearly thirty years ago, from a passenger in the mail-coach.    With Mr. Clerk's consent, I gave the story at that time to poor Mat Lewis, who    published it with a ghost-ballad which he adjusted on the same theme. From the    minuteness of the original detail, however, the narrative is better calculated    for prose than verse; and more especially as the friend to whom it was originally    communicated is one of the most accurate, intelligent, and acute persons whom    I have known in the course of my life, I am willing to preserve the precise    story in this place. 
 </p><p>      It was about the eventful year 1800, when the    Emperor Paul laid his ill-judged embargo on British trade, that my friend Mr.    William Clerk, on a journey to London, found himself in company, in the mail-coach,    with a seafaring man of middle age and respectable appearance, who announced    himself as master of a vessel in the Baltic trade, and a sufferer by the embargo.    In the course of the desultory conversation which takes place on such occasions    the seaman observed, in compliance with a common superstition, " I wish we may    have good luck on our journey -- there is a magpie." " And why should that be    unlucky?" said my  friend. " I cannot tell you that," replied the    sailor; " but all the world agrees that one magpie bodes bad luck -- two are    not so bad, but three are the devil. I never saw three magpies but twice, and    once I had near lost my vessel, and the second I fell from a horse, and was    hurt." This conversation led Mr. Clerk to observe that he supposed he believed    also in ghosts, since he credited such auguries. " And if I do," said the sailor,    " I may have my own reasons for doing, so;" and he spoke this in a deep and    serious manner, implying that he felt deeply what he was saying. On being further    urged, he confessed that, if he could believe his own eyes, there was one ghost    at least which he had seen repeatedly. He then told his story as I now relate    it. 
 </p><p>      Our mariner had in his youth gone mate of a    slave vessel from Liverpool, of which town he seemed to be a native. The captain    of the vessel was a man of a variable temper, sometimes kind and courteous to    his men, but subject to fits of humour, dislike, and passion, during which he    was very violent, tyrannical, and cruel. He took a particular dislike at one    sailor aboard, an elderly man, called Bill Jones, or some such name. He seldom    spoke to this person without threats and abuse, which the old man, with the    license which sailors take on merchant vessels, was very apt to return. On one    occasion Bill Jones appeared slow in getting out on the yard to hand a sail.    The captain, according to custom, abused the seaman as a lubberly rascal, who    got fat by leaving his duty to other people. The man made a saucy answer, almost    amounting to mutiny, on which, in a towering passion, the captain ran down to    his cabin, and returned with a blunderbuss loaded with slugs, with which he    took deliberate aim at the supposed mutineer, fired, and mortally wounded him.    The man was handed down from the yard, and stretched on the deck, evidently    dying. He fixed his eyes on the captain, and said, " Sir, you have done for    me, but I will never leave you." The captain, in return, swore at him for a    fat lubber, and said he would have him  thrown into the slave-kettle, where they made    food for the negroes, and see how much fat he had got. The man died. His body    was actually thrown into the slave-kettle, and the narrator observed, with a    <i>naïveté</i>, which confirmed the extent of his own belief in    the truth of what he told, " There was not much fat about him after all." 
 </p><p>      The captain told the crew they must keep absolute    silence on the subject of what had passed; and as the mate was willing to give    an explicit and absolute promise, he ordered him to be confined below. After    a day or two he came to the mate, and demanded if he had an intention to deliver    him tip for trial when the vessel got home. The mate, who was tired of close    confinement in that sultry climate, spoke his commander fair, and obtained his    liberty. When he mingled among the crew once more he found them impressed with    the idea, not unnatural in their situation, that the ghost of the dead man appeared    among them when they a had a spell of duty, especially if a sail was to be handed,    on which occasion the spectre was sure to be out upon the yard before any of    the crew. The narrator had seen this apparition himself repeatedly -- he believed    the captain saw it also, but he took no notice of it for some time, and the    crew, terrified at the violent temper of the man, dared not call his attention    to it. Thus they held on their course homeward with great fear and anxiety. 
 </p><p>      At length the captain invited the mate, who    was now in a sort of favour, to go down to the cabin and take a glass of grog    with him. In this interview he assumed a very grave and anxious aspect. " I    need not tell you, Jack," he said, " what sort of hand we have got on board    with us. He told me he would never leave me, and he has kept his word. You only    see him now and then, but he is always by my side, and never out of my sight.    At this very moment I see him -- I am determined to bear it no longer, and I    have resolved to leave you." 
 </p><p>     The mate replied that his leaving the vessel    while out of  the sight of any land was impossible. He advised,    that if the captain apprehended any bad consequences from what had happened,    he should run for the west of France or Ireland, and there go ashore, and leave    him, the mate, to carry the vessel into Liverpool. The captain only shook his    head gloomily, and reiterated his determination to leave the ship. At this moment    the mate was called to the deck for some purpose or other, and the instant he    got up the companion-ladder he heard a splash in the water, and looking over    the ship's side, saw that the captain had thrown himself into the sea from the    quarter-gallery, and was running astern at the rate of six knots an hour. When    just about to sink he seemed to make a last exertion, sprung half out of the    water, and clasped his hands towards the mate, calling, " By -- , Bill is with    me now !" and then sunk, to be seen no more. 
 </p><p>      After hearing this singular story Mr. Clerk    asked some questions about the captain, and whether his companion considered    him as at all times rational. The sailor seemed struck with the question, and    answered, after a moment's delay, that in general <i>he conversationed well    enough.</i> 
 </p><p>      It would have been desirable to have been able    to ascertain how far this extraordinary tale was founded on fact; but want of    time and other circumstances prevented Mr. Clerk from learning the names and    dates, that might to a certain degree have verified the events. Granting the    murder to have taken place, and the tale to have been truly told, there was    nothing more likely to arise among the ship's company than the belief in the    apparition; as the captain was a man of a passionate and irritable disposition,    it was nowise improbable that he, the victim of remorse, should participate    in the horrible visions of those less concerned, especially as he was compelled    to avoid communicating his sentiments with any one else; and the catastrophe    would in such a case be but the natural consequence of that superstitious remorse    which has conducted so many criminals to suicide or the  gallows. If the fellow-traveller of Mr. Clerk    be not allowed this degree of credit, he must at least be admitted to have displayed    a singular talent for the composition of the horrible in fiction. The tale,    properly detailed, might have made the fortune of a romancer. 
 </p><p>      I cannot forbear giving you, as congenial to    this story, another instance of a guilt-formed phantom, which made considerable    noise about twenty years ago or more. I am, I think, tolerably correct in the    details, though I have lost the account of the trial. Jarvis Matcham -- such,    if I am not mistaken, was the name of my hero -- was pay-sergeant in a regiment,    where he was so highly esteemed as a steady and accurate man that he was permitted    opportunity to embezzle a considerable part of the money lodged in his hands    for pay of soldiers, bounty of recruits (then a large sum), and other charges    which fell within his duty. He was summoned to join his regiment from a town    where he had been on the recruiting service, and this perhaps under some shade    of suspicion. Matcham perceived discovery was at hand, and would have deserted    had it not been for the presence of a little drummer lad, who was the only one    of his party appointed to attend him. In the desperation of his crime he resolved    to murder the poor boy, and avail himself of some balance of money to make his    escape. He meditated this wickedness the more readily that the drummer, he thought,    had been put as a spy on him. He perpetrated his crime, and changing his dress    after the deed was done, made a long walk across the country to an inn on the    Portsmouth road, where he halted and went to bed, desiring to be called when    the first Portsmouth coach came. The waiter summoned him accordingly, but long    after remembered that, when he shook the guest by the shoulder, his first words    as he awoke were: " My God ! I did not kill him." 
 </p><p>      Matcham went to the seaport by file coach, and    instantly entered as an able-bodied landsman or marine, I know not which. His    sobriety and attention to duty gained him the  same good opinion of the officers in his new    service which he had enjoyed in the army. He was afloat for several years, and    behaved remarkably well in some actions. At length the vessel came into Plymouth,    was paid off, and some of the crew, amongst whom was Jarvis Matcham, were dismissed    as too old for service. He and another seaman resolved to walk to town, and    took the route by Salisbury. It was when within two or three miles of this celebrated    city that they were overtaken by a tempest so sudden, and accompanied with such    vivid lightning and thunder so dreadfully loud, that the obdurate conscience    of the old sinner began to be awakened. He expressed more terror than seemed    natural for one who was familiar with the war of elements, and began to look    and talk so wildly that his companion became aware that something more than    usual was the matter. At length Matcham complained to his companion that the    stones rose from the road and flew after him. He desired the man to walk on    the other side of the highway to see if they would follow him when he was alone.    The sailor complied, and Jarvis Matcham complained that the stones still flew    after him and did not pursue the other. " But what is worse," he added, coming    up to his companion, and whispering, with a tone of mystery and fear, " who    is that little drummer-boy, and what business has he to follow us so closely    ?" " I can see no one," answered the seaman, infected by the superstition of    his associate. " What! not see that little boy with the bloody pantaloons !"    exclaimed the secret murderer, so much to the terror of his comrade that he    conjured him, if he had anything on his mind, to make a clear conscience as    far as confession could do it. The criminal fetched a deep groan, and declared    that he was unable longer to endure the life which he had led for years. He    then confessed the murder of the drummer, and added that, as a considerable    reward had been offered, he wished his comrade to deliver him up to the magistrates    of Salisbury, as he would desire a shipmate to profit by his fate, which he    was now convinced was  inevitable. Having overcome his friend's objections    to this mode of proceeding, Jarvis Matcham was surrendered to justice accordingly,    and made a full confession of his guilt. But before the trial the love of life    returned. The prisoner denied his confession, and pleaded Not Guilty. By this    time, however, full evidence had been procured from other quarters. Witnesses    appeared from his former regiment to prove his identity with the murderer and    deserter, and the waiter remembered the ominous words which he had spoken when    he awoke him to join the Portsmouth coach. Jarvis Matcham was found guilty and    executed. When his last chance of life was over he returned to his confession,    and with his dying breath averred and truly, as he thought, the truth of the    vision on Salisbury Plain. Similar stories might be produced, showing plainly    that, under the direction of Heaven, the influence of superstitious fear may    be the appointed means of bringing the criminal to repentance for his own sake,    and to punishment for the advantage of society. 
 </p><p>      Cases of this kind are numerous and easily imagined,    so I shall dwell on them no further; but rather advert to at least an equally    abundant class of ghost stories, in which the apparition is pleased not to torment    the actual murderer, but proceeds in a very circuitous manner, acquainting some    stranger or ignorant old woman with the particulars of his fate, who, though    perhaps unacquainted with all the parties, is directed by a phantom to lay the    facts before a magistrate. In this respect we must certainly allow that ghosts    have, as we are informed by the facetious Captain Grose, forms and customs peculiar    to themselves. 
 </p><p>      There would be no edification and little amusement    in treating of clumsy deceptions of this kind, where the grossness of the imposture    detects itself. But occasionally cases occur like the following, with respect    to which it is more difficult, to use James Boswell's phrase, " to know what    to think." 
 </p><p>      Upon the 10th of June, 1754, Duncan Terig, <i>alias</i>    Clark,  and Alexander Bain MacDonald, two Highlanders,    were tried before the Court of justiciary, Edinburgh, for the murder of Arthur    Davis, sergeant in Guise's regiment, on the 28th September, 1749. The accident    happened not long after the civil war, the embers of which were still reeking,    so there existed too many reasons on account of which an English soldier, straggling    far from assistance, might be privately cut off by the inhabitants of these    wilds. It appears that Sergeant Davis was missing for years, without any certainty    as to his fate. At length, an account of the murder appeared from the evidence    of one Alexander MacPherson (a Highlander, speaking no language but Gaelic,    and sworn by an interpreter), who gave the following extraordinary account of    his cause of knowledge: -- He was, he said, in bed in his cottage, when an apparition    came to his bedside and commanded him, to rise and follow him out of doors.    Believing his visitor to be one Farquharson, a neighbour and friend, the witness    did as he was bid; and when they were without the cottage, the appearance told    the witness he was the ghost of Sergeant Davis, and requested him to go and    bury his mortal remains, which lay concealed in a place he pointed out in a    moorland tract called the Hill of Christie. He desired him to take Farquharson    with him as an assistant. Next day the witness went to the place specified,    and there found the bones of a human body much decayed. The witness did not    at that time bury the bones so found, in consequence of which negligence the    sergeant's ghost again appeared to him, upbraiding him with his breach of promise.    On this occasion the witness asked the ghost who were the murderers, and received    for answer that he had been slain by the prisoners at the bar. The witness,    after this second visitation, called the assistance of Farquharson, and buried    the body. 
 </p><p>      Farquharson was brought in evidence to prove    that the preceding witness, MacPherson, had called him to the burial of the    bones, and told him the same story which he repeated in court. Isabel MacHardie,    a person who slept  in one of the beds which run along the wall in    an ordinary Highland hut, declared that upon the night when MacPherson said    he saw the ghost, she saw a naked man enter the house and go towards MacPherson's    bed. 
 </p><p>     Yet though the supernatural incident was thus    fortified, and although there were other strong presumptions against the prisoners,    the story of the apparition threw an air of ridicule on the whole evidence for    the prosecution. It was followed up by the counsel for the prisoners asking,    in the cross-examination of MacPherson, " What language did the ghost speak    in ?" The witness, who was himself ignorant 
 </p><p>     of English, replied, " As good Gaelic as I ever    heard in Lochaber." " Pretty well for the ghost of an English sergeant," answered    the counsel. The inference was rather smart and plausible than sound, for, the    apparition of the ghost being admitted, we know too little of the other world    to judge whether all languages may not be alike familiar to those who belonged    to it. It imposed, however, on the jury, who found the accused parties not guilty,    although their counsel and solicitor and most of the court were satisfied of    their having committed the murder. In this case the interference of the ghost    seems to have rather impeded the vengeance which it was doubtless the murdered    sergeant's desire to obtain. Yet there may be various modes of explaining this    mysterious story, of which the following conjecture may pass for one. 
 </p><p>      The reader may suppose that MacPherson was privy    to the fact of the murder, perhaps as an accomplice or otherwise, and may also    suppose that, from motives of remorse for the action, or of enmity to those    who had committed it, he entertained a wish to bring them to justice. But through    the whole Highlands there is no character more detestable than that of an informer,    or one who takes what is called Tascal-money, or reward for discovery of crimes.    To have informed against Terig and MacDonald might have cost MacPherson his    life; and it is far from being impossible that he had recourse to the story    of  the ghost, knowing well that his superstitious    countrymen would pardon his communicating the commission entrusted to him by    a being from the other world, although he might probably have been murdered    if his delation of the crime had been supposed voluntary. This explanation,    in exact conformity with the sentiments of the Highlanders on such subjects,    would reduce the whole story to a stroke of address on the part of the witness. 
 </p><p>      It is therefore of the last consequence, in    considering the truth of stories of ghosts and apparitions, to consider the    possibility of wilful deception, whether on the part of those who are agents    in the supposed disturbances, or the author of the legend. We shall separately    notice an instance or two of either kind. 
 </p><p>      The most celebrated instance in which human    agency was used to copy the disturbances imputed to supernatural beings refers    to the ancient palace of Woodstock, when the Commissioners of the Long Parliament    came down to dispark what had been lately a royal residence. The Commissioners    arrived at Woodstock, 13th October, 1649, determined to wipe away the memory    of all that connected itself with the recollection of monarchy in England. But    in the course of their progress they were encountered by obstacles which apparently    came from the next world. Their bed-chambers were infested with visits of a    thing resembling a dog, but which carne and passed as mere earthly dogs cannot    do. Logs of wood, the remains of a very large tree called the King's Oak, which    they had splintered into billets for burning, were tossed through the house,    and the chairs displaced and shuffled about. While they were in bed the feet    of their couches were lifted higher than their heads, and then dropped with    violence. Trenchers " without a wish" flew at their heads of free will. Thunder    and lightning came next, which were set down to the same cause. Spectres made    their appearance, as they thought, in different shapes, and one of the party    saw the apparition of a hoof, which kicked a candlestick and  lighted candle into the middle of the room, and    then politely scratched on the red snuff to extinguish it. Other and worse tricks    were practised on the astonished Commissioners who, considering that all the    fiends of hell were let loose upon them, retreated from Woodstock without completing    an errand which was, in their opinion, impeded by infernal powers, though the    opposition offered was rather of a playful and malicious than of a dangerous    cast. 
 </p><p>      The whole matter was, after the Restoration,    discovered to be the trick of one of their own party, who had attended the Commissioners    as a clerk, under the name of Giles Sharp. This man, whose real name was Joseph    Collins of Oxford, called <i>Funny Joe</i>, was a concealed loyalist, and well    acquainted with the old mansion of Woodstock, where he had been brought up before    the Civil War. Being a bold, active spirited man, Joe availed himself of his    local knowledge of trap-doors and private passages so as to favour the tricks    which he played off upon his masters by aid of his fellow-domestics. The Commissioners'    personal reliance on him made his task the more easy, and it was all along remarked    that trusty Giles Sharp saw the most extraordinary sights and visions among    the whole party. The unearthly terrors experienced by the Commissioners are    detailed with due gravity by Sinclair, and also, I think, by Dr. Plott. But    although the detection or explanation of the real history of the Woodstock demons    has also been published, and I have myself seen it, I have at this time forgotten    whether it exists in a separate collection, or where it is to be looked for. 
 </p><p>      Similar disturbances have been often experienced    while it was the custom to believe in and dread such frolics of the invisible    world, and under circumstances which induce us to wonder, both at the extreme    trouble taken by the agents in these impostures, and the slight motives from    which they have been induced to do much wanton mischief. Still greater is our    modern surprise at the apparently simple means by which terror has been excited    to so general an  extent, that even the wisest and most prudent    have not escaped its contagious influence. 
 </p><p>      On the first point I am afraid there can be    no better reason assigned than the conscious pride of superiority, which induces    the human being in all cases to enjoy and practise every means of employing    an influence over his fellow-mortals; to which we may safely add that general    love of tormenting, as common to our race as to that noble mimick of humanity,    the monkey. To this is owing the delight with which every school-boy anticipates    the effects of throwing a stone into a glass shop; and to this we must also    ascribe the otherwise unaccountable pleasure which individuals have taken in    practising the tricksy pranks of a goblin, and filling a household or neighbourhood    with anxiety and dismay, with little gratification to themselves besides the    consciousness of dexterity if they remain undiscovered, and with the risk of    loss of character and punishment should the imposture be found out. 
 </p><p>     In the year 1772, a train of transactions, commencing    upon Twelfth Day, threw the utmost consternation into the village of Stockwell,    near London, and impressed upon some of its inhabitants the inevitable belief    that they were produced by invisible agents. The plates, dishes, china, and    glass-ware and small movables of every kind, contained in the house of Mrs.    Golding, an elderly lady, seemed suddenly to become animated, shifted their    places, flew through the room, and were broken to pieces. The particulars of    this commotion were as curious as the loss and damage occasioned in this extraordinary    manner were alarming and intolerable. Amidst this combustion, a young woman,    Mrs. Golding's maid, named Anne Robinson, was walking backwards and forwards,    nor could she be prevailed on to sit down for a moment excepting while the family    were at prayers, during which time no disturbance happened. This Anne Robinson    had been but a few days in the old lady's service, and it was remarkable that    she endured with great composure the extraordinary display which others beheld  with terror, and coolly advised her mistress    not to be alarmed or uneasy, as these things could not be helped. This excited    an idea that she had some reason for being so composed, not inconsistent with    a degree of connexion with what was going forward. The afflicted Mrs. Golding    as she might be well termed, considering such a commotion and demolition among    her goods and chattels, invited neighbours to stay in her house, but they soon    became unable to bear the sight of these supernatural proceedings, which went    so far that not above two cups and saucers remained out of a valuable set of    china. She next abandoned her dwelling, and took refuge with a neighbour, but,    finding his movables were seized with the same sort of St. Vitus's dance, her    landlord reluctantly refused to shelter any longer a woman who seemed to be    persecuted by so strange a subject of vexation. Mrs. Golding's suspicions against    Anne Robinson now gaining ground, she dismissed her maid, and the hubbub among    her movables ceased at once and for ever. 
 </p><p>      This circumstance of itself indicates that Anne    Robinson was the cause of these extraordinary disturbances, as has been since    more completely ascertained by a Mr. Brayfield, who persuaded Anne, long after    the events had happened, to make him her confidant. There was a love story connected    with the case, in which the only magic was the dexterity of Anne Robinson and    the simplicity of the spectators. She had fixed long horse hairs to some of    the crockery, and placed wires under others, by which she could throw them down    without touching them. Other things she dexterously threw about, which the spectators,    who did not watch her motions, imputed to invisible agency. At times, when the    family were absent, she loosened the hold of the strings by which the hams,    bacon, and similar articles were suspended, so that they fell on the slightest    motion. She employed some simple chemical secrets, and, delighted with the success    of her pranks, pushed them farther than she at first intended. Such was the    solution of  the whole mystery, which, known by the name of    the Stockwell ghost, terrified many well-meaning persons, and had been nearly    as famous as that of Cock Lane, which may be hinted at as another imposture    of the same kind. So many and wonderful are the appearances described, that    when I first met with the original publication I was strongly impressed with    the belief that the narrative was like some of Swift's advertisements, a jocular    experiment upon the credulity of the public. But it was certainly published    <i>bona fide</i>, and Mr. Hone, on the authority of Mr. Brayfield, has since    fully explained the wonder. <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">85</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Many such impositions have been detected, and    many others have been successfully concealed; but to know what has been discovered    in many instances gives us the assurance of the ruling cause in all. I remember    a scene of the kind attempted to be got up near Edinburgh, but detected at once    by a sheriff's officer, a sort of persons whose habits of incredulity and suspicious    observation render them very dangerous spectators on such occasions. The late    excellent Mr. Walker, minister at Dunottar, in the Mearns, gave me a curious    account of an imposture of this kind, practised by a young country girl, who    was surprisingly quick at throwing stones, turf, and other missiles, with such    dexterity that it was for a long time impossible to ascertain her agency in    the disturbances of which she was the sole cause. 
 </p><p>      The belief of the spectators that such scenes    of disturbance arise from invisible beings will appear less surprising if we    consider the common feats of jugglers, or professors of legerdemain, and recollect    that it is only the frequent exhibition of such powers which reconciles us to    them as matters of course, although they are wonders at which in our fathers'    time men would have cried out either sorcery or miracles. The spectator also,    who has been himself duped, makes no very respectable appearance when convicted    of his error; and thence, if too candid to add to the evidence of supernatural    agency, is yet unwilling to stand convicted by  cross examination, of having been imposed on,    and unconsciously becomes disposed rather to colour more highly than the truth,    than acquiesce in an explanation resting on his having been too hasty a believer.    Very often, too, the detection depends upon the combination of certain circumstances,    which, apprehended, necessarily explain the whole story. 
 </p><p>      For example, I once heard a sensible and intelligent    friend in company express himself convinced of the truth of a wonderful story,    told him by an intelligent and bold man, about an apparition. The scene lay    in an ancient castle on the coast of Morven or the Isle of Mull, where the ghost    seer chanced to be resident. He was given to understand by the family, when    betaking himself to rest, that the chamber in which he slept was occasionally    disquieted by supernatural appearances. Being at that time no believer in such    stories, he attended little to this hint, until the witching hour of night,    when he was awakened from a dead sleep by the pressure of a human hand on his    body. He looked tip at the figure of a tall Highlander, in the antique and picturesque    dress of his country, only that his brows were bound with a bloody bandage.    Struck with sudden and extreme fear, he was willing, to have sprung from bed,    but the spectre stood before him in the bright moonlight, its one arm extended    so as to master him if he attempted to rise; the other hand held up in a warning    and grave posture, as menacing the Lowlander if he should attempt to quit his    recumbent position. Thus he lay in mortal agony for more than an hour, after    which it pleased the spectre of ancient days to leave him to more sound repose.    So singular a story had on its side the usual number of votes from the company,    till, upon cross-examination, it was explained that the principal person concerned    was an exciseman. After which <i>eclaireissment</i> the same explanation struck    all present, viz., the Highlanders of the mansion had chosen to detain the exciseman    by the apparition of an ancient heroic ghost, in order to disguise from his    vigilance the removal of certain  modern enough spirits, which his duty might have    called upon him to seize. Here a single circumstance explained the whole ghost    story. 
 </p><p>      At other times it happens that the meanness    and trifling nature of a cause not very obvious to observation has occasioned    it to be entirely overlooked, even on account of that very meanness, since no    one is willing to acknowledge that he has been alarmed by a cause of little    consequence, and which he would be ashamed of mentioning. An incident of this    sort happened to a gentleman of birth and distinction, who is well known in    the political world, and was detected by the precision of his observation. Shortly    after he succeeded to his estate and title, there was a rumour among his servants    concerning a strange noise heard in the family mansion at night, the cause of    which they had found it impossible to trace. The gentleman resolved to watch    himself, with a domestic who had grown old in the family, and who had begun    to murmur strange things concerning the knocking having followed so close upon    the death of his old master. They watched until the noise was heard, which they    listened to with that strange uncertainty attending midnight sounds which prevents    the hearers from immediately tracing them to the spot where they arise, while    the silence of the night generally occasions the imputing to them more than    the due importance which they would receive if mingled with the usual noises    of daylight. At length the gentleman and his servant traced the sounds which    they had repeatedly heard to a small store-room used as a place for keeping    provisions of various kinds for the family, of which the old butler had the    key. They entered this place, and remained there for some time without hearing    the noises which they had traced thither; at length the sound was heard, but    much lower than it had formerly seemed to be, while acted upon at a distance    by the imagination of the hearers. The cause was immediately discovered. A rat    caught in an old-fashioned trap had occasioned this tumult by its efforts to    escape, in which it was able to raise the trap-door of its prison to a certain  height, but was then obliged to drop it. The    noise of the fall, resounding through the house, had occasioned the disturbance    which, but for the cool investigation of the proprietor, might easily have established    an accredited ghost story. The circumstance was told me by the gentleman to    whom it happened. 
 </p><p>      There are other occasions in which the ghost    story is rendered credible by some remarkable combination of circumstances very    unlikely to have happened, and which no one could have supposed unless some    particular fortune occasioned a discovery. 
 </p><p>      An apparition which took place at Plymouth is    well known, but it has been differently related; and having some reason to think    the following edition correct, it is an incident so much to my purpose that    you must pardon its insertion. 
 </p><p>      A club of persons connected with science and    literature was formed at the great sea-town I have named. During the summer    months the society met in a cave by the seashore; during those of autumn and    winter they convened within the premises of a tavern, but, for the sake of privacy,    had their meeting in a summer-house situated in the garden, at a distance from    the main building. Some of the members to whom the position of their own dwellings    rendered this convenient, had a pass-key to the garden-door, by which they could    enter the garden and reach the summer-house without the publicity or trouble    of passing through the open tavern. It was the rule of this club that its members    presided alternately. On one occasion, in the winter, the president of the evening    chanced to be very ill; indeed, was reported to be on his death-bed. The club    met as usual, and, from a sentiment of respect, left vacant the chair which    ought to have been occupied by him if in his usual health; for the same reason,    the conversation turned upon the absent gentleman's talents, and the loss expected    to the society by his death. While they were upon this melancholy theme, the    door suddenly opened, and the appearance of the president entered the room.    He wore a  white wrapper, a nightcap round his brow, the    appearance of which was that of death itself. He stalked into the room with    unusual gravity, took the vacant place of ceremony, lifted the empty glass which    stood before him, bowed around, and put it to his lips; then replaced it on    the table, and stalked out of the room as silent as he had entered it. The company    remained deeply appalled; at length, after many observations on the strangeness    of what they had seen, they resolved to dispatch two of their number as ambassadors,    to see how it fared with the president, who had thus strangely appeared among    them. They went, and returned with the frightful intelligence that the friend    after whom they had enquired was that evening deceased. 
 </p><p>      The astonished party then resolved that they    would remain absolutely silent respecting the wonderful sight which they had    seen. Their habits were too philosophical to permit them to believe that they    had actually seen the ghost of their deceased brother, and at the same time    they were too wise men to wish to confirm the superstition of the vulgar by    what might seem indubitable evidence of a ghost. The affair was therefore kept    a strict secret, although, as usual, some dubious rumours of the tale found    their way to the public. Several years afterwards, an old woman who had long    filled the place of a sick-nurse, was taken very ill, and on her death-bed was    attended by a medical member of the philosophical club. To him, with many expressions    of regret, she acknowledged that she had long before attended Mr. -- -- , naming    the president whose appearance had surprised the club so strangely, and that    she felt distress of conscience on account of the manner in which he died. She    said that as his malady was attended by light-headedness, she had been directed    to keep a dose watch upon him during his illness. Unhappily she slept, and during    her sleep the patient had awaked and left the apartment. When, on her own awaking,    she found the bed empty and the patient gone, she forth-with hurried out of    the house to seek him, and met him in the act of returning. She got him, she    said,  replaced in bed, but it was only to die there.    She added, to convince her hearer of the truth of what she said, that immediately    after the poor gentleman expired, a deputation of two members from the club    came to enquire after their president's health, and received for answer that    he was already dead. This confession explained the whole matter. The delirious    patient had very naturally taken the road to the club, from some recollections    of his duty of the night. In approaching and retiring from the apartment he    had used one of the pass-keys already mentioned, which made his way shorter.    On the other hand, the gentlemen sent to enquire after his health had reached    his lodging by a more circuitous road; and thus there had been time for him    to return to what proved his death-bed, long before they reached his chamber.    The philosophical witnesses of this strange scene were now as anxious to spread    the story as they had formerly been to conceal it, since it showed in what a    remarkable manner men's eyes might turn traitors to them, and impress them with    ideas far different from the truth. 
 </p><p>      Another occurrence of the same kind, although    scarcely so striking in its circumstances, was yet one which, had it remained    unexplained, might have passed as an indubitable instance of a supernatural    apparition. 
 </p><p>      A Teviotdale farmer was riding from a fair,    at which he had indulged himself with John Barleycorn, but not to that extent    of defying goblins which it inspired into the gallant Tam o'Shanter. He was    pondering with some anxiety upon the dangers of travelling alone on a solitary    road which passed the corner of a churchyard, now near at hand, when he saw    before him in the moonlight a pale female form standing upon the very wall which    surrounded the cemetery. The road was very narrow, with no opportunity of giving    the apparent phantom what seamen call a wide berth. It was, however, the only    path which led to the rider's home, who therefore resolved, at all risks, to    pass the apparition. He accordingly approached, as slowly as possible, the  spot where the spectre stood, while the figure    remained, now perfectly still and silent, now brandishing its arms and gibbering    to the moon. When the farmer came close to the spot he dashed in the spurs and    set the horse off upon a gallop; but the spectre did not miss its opportunity.    As he passed the corner where she was perched, she contrived to drop behind    the horseman and seize him round the waist, a manoeuvre which greatly increased    the speed of the horse and the terror of the rider; for the hand of her who    sat behind him, when pressed upon his, felt as cold as that of a corpse. At    his own house at length he arrived, and bid the servants who came to attend    him, " Tak aff the ghaist !" They took off accordingly a female in white, and    the poor farmer himself was conveyed to bed, where he lay struggling for weeks    with a strong nervous fever. The female was found to be a maniac, who had been    left a widow very suddenly by an affectionate husband, and the nature and cause    of her malady induced her, when she could make her escape, to wander to the    churchyard, where she sometimes wildly wept over his grave, and sometimes, standing    on the corner of the churchyard wall, looked out, and mistook every stranger    on horseback for the husband she had lost. If this woman, which was very possible,    had dropt from the horse unobserved by him whom she had made her involuntary    companion, it would have been very hard to have convinced the honest farmer    that he had not actually performed part of his journey with a ghost behind him. 
 </p><p>      There is also a large class of stories of this    sort, where various secrets of chemistry, of acoustics, ventriloquism, or other    arts, have been either employed to dupe the spectators, or have tended to do    so through mere accident and coincidence. Of these it is scarce necessary to    quote instances; but the following may be told as a tale recounted by a foreign    nobleman known to me nearly thirty years ago, whose life, lost in the service    of his sovereign, proved too short for his friends and his native land.  At a certain old castle on the confines of Hungary,    the lord to whom it belonged had determined upon giving an entertainment worthy    of his own rank and of the magnificence of the antique mansion which he inhabited.    The guests of course were numerous, and among them was a veteran officer of    hussars, remarkable for his bravery. When the arrangements for the night were    made this officer was informed that there would be difficulty in accommodating    the company in the castle, large as was, unless some one would take the risk    of sleeping in a room supposed to be haunted, and that, as he was known to be    above such prejudices, the apartment was in the first place proposed for his    occupation, as the person least likely to suffer a bad night's rest from such    a cause. The major thankfully accepted the preference, and having shared the    festivity of the evening, retired after midnight, having denounced vengeance    against any one who should presume by any trick to disturb his repose; a threat    which his habits would, it was supposed, render him sufficiently ready to execute.    Somewhat contrary to the custom in these cases, the major went to bed, having    left his candle burning and laid his trusty pistols, carefully loaded, on the    table by his bedside. 
 </p><p>      He had not slept an hour when he was awakened    by a solemn strain of music. He looked out. Three ladies, fantastically dressed    in green, were seen in the lower end of the apartment, who sung a solemn requiem.    The major listened for some time with delight; at length he tired. " Ladies,"    he said, " this is very well, but somewhat monotonous -- will you be so kind    as to change the tune ?" The ladies continued singing; he expostulated, but    the music was not interrupted. The major began to grow angry: " Ladies," he    said, " I must consider this as a trick for the purpose of terrifying me, and    as I regard it as an impertinence, I shall take a rough mode of stopping it."    With that he began to handle his pistols. The ladies sung on. He then got seriously    angry: " I will but wait five minutes," he said, " and then fire without hesitation."    The song was  uninterrupted -- the five minutes were expired.    " I still give you law, ladies," he said, " while I count twenty." This produced    as little effect as his former threats. He counted one, two, three accordingly;    but on approaching the end of the number, and repeating more than once his determination    to fire, the last numbers, seventeen -- eighteen -- nineteen, were pronounced    with considerable pauses between, and an assurance that the pistols were cocked.    The ladies sung on. As he pronounced the word twenty he fired both pistols against    the musical damsels -- but the ladies sung on ! The major was overcome by the    unexpected inefficacy of his violence, and had an illness which lasted more    than three weeks. The trick put upon him may be shortly described by the fact    that the female choristers were placed in an adjoining room, and that he only    fired at their reflection thrown forward into that in which he slept by the    effect of a concave mirror. 
 </p><p>      Other stories of the same kind are numerous    and well known. The apparition of the Brocken mountain, after having occasioned    great admiration and some fear, is now ascertained by philosophers to be a gigantic    reflection, which makes the traveller's shadow, represented upon the misty clouds,    appear a colossal figure of almost immeasurable size. By a similar deception    men have been induced, in Westmoreland and other mountainous countries, to imagine    they saw troops of horse and armies marching and countermarching, which were    in fact only the reflection of horses pasturing upon an opposite height, or    of the forms of peaceful travellers. 
 </p><p>      A very curious case of this kind was communicated    to me by the son of the lady principally concerned, and tends to show out of    what mean materials a venerable apparition may be sometimes formed. In youth    this lady resided with her father, a man of sense and resolution. Their house    was situated in the principal street of a town of some size. The back part of    the house ran at right angles to an Anabaptist chapel, divided from it by a    small cabbage-garden. The  young lady used sometimes to indulge the romantic    love of solitude by sitting in her own apartment in the evening till twilight,    and even darkness, was approaching. One evening while she was thus placed, she    was surprised to see a gleamy figure, as of some aerial being, hovering, as    it were, against the arched window in the end of the Anabaptist chapel. Its    head was surrounded by that halo which painters give to the Catholic saints;    and while the young lady's attention was fixed on an object so extraordinary,    the figure bent gracefully towards her more than once, as if intimating a sense    of her presence, and then disappeared. The seer of this striking vision descended    to her family, so much discomposed as to call her father's attention. He obtained    an account of the cause of her disturbance, and expressed his intention to watch    in the apartment next night. He sat accordingly in his daughter's chamber, where    she also attended him. Twilight came, and nothing appeared; but as the gray    light faded into darkness, the same female figure was seen hovering on the window;    the same shadowy form, the same pale light around the head, the same inclinations,    as the evening before. " What do you think of this ?" said the daughter to the    astonished father. " Anything, my dear," said the father, " rather than allow    that we look upon what is supernatural." A strict research established a natural    cause for the appearance on the window. It was the custom of an old woman, to    whom the garden beneath was rented, to go out at night to gather cabbages. The    lantern she carried in her hand threw up the refracted reflection of her form    on the chapel window. As she stooped to gather her cabbages the reflection appeared    to bend forward; and that was the whole matter. 
 </p><p>      Another species of deception, affecting the    credit of such supernatural communications, arises from the dexterity and skill    of the authors who have made it their business to present such stories in the    shape most likely to attract belief. Defoe -- whose power in rendering credible    that  which was in itself very much the reverse was    so peculiarly distinguished -- has not failed to show his superiority in this    species of composition. A bookseller of his acquaintance had, in the trade phrase,    rather overprinted an edition of " Drelincourt on Death," and complained to    Defoe of the loss which was likely to ensue. The experienced bookmaker, with    the purpose of recommending the edition, advised his friend to prefix the celebrated    narrative of Mrs. Veal's ghost, which he wrote for the occasion, with such an    air of truth, that although in fact it does not afford a single tittle of evidence    properly so called, it nevertheless was swallowed so eagerly by the people that    Drelincourt's work on death, which the supposed spirit recommended to the perusal    of her friend Mrs. Bargrave, instead of sleeping on the editor's shelf, moved    off by thousands at once; the story, incredible in itself, and unsupported as    it was by evidence or enquiry, was received as true, merely from the cunning    of the narrator, and the addition of a number of adventitious circumstances,    which no man alive could have conceived as having occurred to the mind of a    person composing a fiction. 
 </p><p>      It did not require the talents of Defoe, though    in that species of composition he must stand unrivalled, to fix the public attention    on a ghost story. John Dunton, a man of scribbling celebrity at the time, succeeded    to a great degree in imposing upon the public a tale which he calls the Apparition    Evidence. The beginning of it, at least (for it is of great length), has something    in it a little new. At Mynehead, in Somersetshire, lived an ancient gentlewoman    named Mrs. Leckie, whose only son and daughter resided in family with her. The    son traded to Ireland, and was supposed to be worth eight or ten thousand pounds.    They had a child about five or six years old. This family was generally respected    in Mynehead; and especially Mrs. Leckie, the old lady, was so pleasant in society,    that her friends used to say to her, and to each other, that it was a thousand    pities such an excellent, good-humoured gentlewoman must, from her  age, be soon lost to her friends. To which Mrs.    Leckie often made the somewhat startling reply: " Forasmuch as you now seem    to like me, I am afraid you will but little care to see or speak with me after    my death, though I believe you may have that satisfaction." Die, however, she    did, and after her funeral was repeatedly seen in her personal likeness, at    home and abroad, by night and by noonday. 
 </p><p>      One story is told of a doctor of physic walking    into the fields, who in his return met with this spectre, whom he at first accosted    civilly, and paid her the courtesy of handing her over a stile. Observing, however,    that she did not move her lips in speaking, or her eyes in looking round, he    became suspicious of the condition of his companion, and showed some desire    to be rid of her society. Offended at this, the hag at next stile planted herself    upon it, and obstructed his passage. He got through at length with some difficulty,    and not without a sound kick, and an admonition to pay more attention to the    next aged gentlewoman whom he met. " But this," says John Dunton, " was a petty    and inconsiderable prank to what she played in her son's house and elsewhere.    She would at noonday appear upon the quay of Mynehead, and cry, ' A boat, a    boat, ho ! a boat, a boat, ho !' If any boatmen or seamen were in sight, and    did not come, they were sure to be cast away and if they did come, 'twas all    one, they were cast away. It was equally dangerous to please and displease her.    Her son had several ships sailing between Ireland and England; no sooner did    they make land, and come in sight of England, but this ghost would appear in    the same garb and likeness as when she was alive, and, standing at the mainmast,    would blow with a whistle, and though it were never so great a calm, yet immediately    there would arise a most dreadful storm, that would break, wreck, and drown    the ship and goods; only the seamen would escape with their lives -- the devil    had no permission from God to take them away. Yet at this rate, by her frequent    apparitions and disturbances, she had made a poor merchant  of her son, for his fair estate was all buried    in the sea, and he that was once worth thousands was reduced to a very poor    and low condition in the world; for whether the ship were his own or hired,    or he had but goods on board it to the value of twenty shillings, this troublesome    ghost would come as before, whistle in a calm at the mainmast at noonday, when    they had descried land, and then ship and goods went all out of hand to wreck;    insomuch that he could at last get no ships wherein to stow his goods, nor any    mariner to sail in them; for knowing what an uncomfortable, fatal, and losing    voyage they should make of it, they did all decline his service. In her son's    house she hath her constant haunts by day and night; but whether he did not,    or would not own if he did, see her, he always professed he never saw her. Sometimes    when in bed with his wife, she would cry out, ' Husband, look, there's your    mother !' And when he would turn to the right side, then was she gone to the    left; and when to the left side of the bed, then was she gone to the right;    only one evening their only child, a girl of about five or six years old, lying    in a ruckle-bed under them, cries out, ' Oh, help me, father ! help me, mother    ! for grandmother will choke me !' and before they could get to their child's    assistance she had murdered it they finding the poor girl dead, her throat having    been pinched by two fingers, which stopped her breath and strangled her. This    was the sorest of all their afflictions; their estate is gone, and now their    child is gone also; you may guess at their grief and great sorrow. One morning    after the child's funeral, her husband being abroad, about eleven in the forenoon,    Mrs. Leckie the younger goes up into her chamber to dress her head, and as she    was looking into the glass she spies her mother-in-law, the old beldam, looking    over her shoulder. This cast her into a great horror; but recollecting her affrighted    spirits, and recovering the exercise of her reason, faith, and hope, having    cast up a short and silent prayer to God, she turns about, and bespeaks her:    ' In the name of God,  mother, why do you trouble me ?' ' Peace,' say's    the spectrum; ' I will do thee no hurt.' ' What will you have of me ?' says    the daughter."&amp;c.  <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">86</font></a> Dunton, the narrator an probably the    contriver of the story, proceeds to inform us a length of a commission which    the wife of Mr. Leckie receives from the ghost to deliver to Atherton, Bishop    of Waterford, a guilty and unfortunate man, who afterwards died by the hands    of the executioner; but that part of the subject is too disagreeable and tedious    to enter upon. 
 </p><p>      So deep was the impression made by the story    on the inhabitants of Mynehead, that it is said the tradition of Mrs. Leckie    still remains in that port, and that mariners belonging to it often, amid tempestuous    weather, conceive they hear the whistle-call of the implacable hag who was the    source of so much mischief to her own family. However, already too desultory    and too long, it would become intolerably tedious were I to insist farther on    the peculiar sort of genius by which stories of this kind may be embodied and    prolonged. 
 </p><p>      I may, however, add, that the charm of the tale    depends much upon the age of the person to whom it is addressed; and that the    vivacity of fancy which engages us in youth to pass over much that is absurd,    in order to enjoy some single trait of imagination, dies within us when we obtain    the age of manhood, and the sadder and graver regions which lie beyond it. I    am the more conscious of this, because I have been myself at two periods of    my life, distant from each other, engaged in scenes favourable to that degree    of superstitious awe which my countrymen expressively call being <i>eerie.</i> 
 </p><p>      On the first of these occasions I was only nineteen    or twenty years old, when I happened to pass a night in the magnificent old    baronial castle of Glammis, the hereditary seat of the Earls of Strathmore.    The hoary pile contains much in its appearance, and in the traditions connected    with it, impressive to the imagination. It was the scene of  the murder of a Scottish king of great antiquity;    not indeed the gracious Duncan, with whom the name naturally associates itself,    but Malcolm the Second. It contains also a curious monument of the peril of    feudal times, being a secret chamber, the entrance of which, by the law or custom    of the family, must only be known to three persons at once, viz., the Earl of    Strathmore, his heir apparent, and any third person whom they may take into    their confidence. The extreme antiquity of the building is vouched by the immense    thickness of the walls, and the wild and straggling arrangement of the accommodation    within doors. As the late Earl of Strathmore seldom resided in that ancient    mansion, it was, when I was there, but half-furnished, and that with movables    of great antiquity, which, with the pieces of chivalric armour hanging upon    the walls, greatly contributed to the general effect of the whole. After a very    hospitable reception from the late Peter Proctor, Esq., then seneschal of the    castle, in Lord Strathmore's absence, I was conducted to my apartment in a distant    corner of the building. I must own, that as I heard door after door shut, after    my conductor had retired, I began to consider myself too far from the living    and somewhat too near the dead. We had passed through what is called " The King's    Room," a vaulted apartment, garnished with stags' antlers and similar trophies    of the chase, and said by tradition to be the spot of Malcolm's murder, and    I had an idea of the vicinity of the castle chapel. 
 </p><p>      In spite of the truth of history, the whole    night-scene in Macbeth's castle rushed at once upon my mind, and struck my imagination    more forcibly than even when I have seen its terrors represented by the late    John Kemble and his inimitable sister. In a word, I experienced sensations which,    though not remarkable either for timidity or superstition, did not fail to affect    me to the point of being disagreeable, while they were mingled at the same time    with a strange and indescribable kind of pleasure, the recollection of which    affords me gratification at this moment.   In the year 1814 accident placed me, then past    middle life, in a situation somewhat similar to that which I have described. 
 </p><p>      I had been on a pleasure voyage with some friends    around the north coast of Scotland, and in that course had arrived in the salt-water    lake under the castle of Dunvegan, whose turrets, situated upon a frowning rock,    rise immediately above the waves of the loch. As most of the party, and I myself    in particular, chanced to be well known to the Laird of Macleod, we were welcomed    to the castle with Highland hospitality, and glad to find ourselves in polished    society, after a cruise of some duration. The most modern part of the castle    was founded in the days of James VI.; the more ancient is referred to a period    " whose birth tradition notes not." Until the present Macleod connected by a    drawbridge the site of the castle with the mainland of Skye, the access must    have been extremely difficult. Indeed, so much greater was the regard paid to    security than to convenience, that in former times the only access to the mansion    arose through a vaulted cavern in a rock, up which a staircase ascended from    the sea-shore, like the buildings we read of in the romances of Mrs. Radcliffe. 
 </p><p>      Such a castle, in the extremity of the Highlands,    was of course furnished with many a tale of tradition, and many a superstitious    legend, to fill occasional intervals in the music and song, as proper to the    halls of Dunvegan as when Johnson commemorated them. We reviewed the arms and    ancient valuables of this distinguished family -- saw the dirk and broadsword    of Rorie Mhor, and his horn, which would drench three chiefs of these degenerate    days. The solemn drinking-cup of the Kings of Alan must not be forgotten, nor    the fairy banner given to Macleod by the Queen of Fairies; that magic flag which    has been victorious in two pitched fields, and will still float in the third,    the bloodiest and the last, when the Elfin Sovereign shall, after the fight    is ended, recall her banner, and carry off the standard-bearer. 
 </p><p>      Amid such tales of ancient tradition I had from    Macleod  and his lady the courteous offer of the haunted    apartment castle, about which, as a stranger, I might be supposed interested.    Accordingly, I took possession of it about the witching hour. Except perhaps    some tapestry hangings, and the extreme thickness of the walls, which argued    great antiquity, nothing could have been more comfortable than th interior of    the apartment; but if you looked from the windows the view was such as to correspond    with the highest tone of superstition. An autumnal blast, sometimes driving    mist before it, swept along the troubled billows of the lake, which it occasionally    concealed, and by fits disclosed. The waves rushed in wild disorder on the shore,    an covered with foam the steep piles of rock, which, rising from the sea in    forms something resembling the human figure, have obtained the name of Macleod's    Maidens, and in such a night seemed no bad representatives of the Norwegian    goddesses called Choosers of the Slain, or Riders of the Storm. There was something    of the dignity of danger in the scene; for on a platform beneath the windows    lay an ancient battery of cannon, which had sometimes been used against privateers    even of late years. The distant scene was a view of that part of the Quillan    mountains which are called, from their form, Macleod's Dining-Tables. The voice    of an angry cascade, termed the Nurse of Rorie Mhor, because that chief slept    best in its vicinity, was heard from time mingling its notes with those of wind    and wave. Such was the haunted room at Dunvegan, and as such it well deserved    a less sleepy inhabitant. In the language of Dr Johnson, who has stamped his    memory on this remote placed, " I looked around me, and wondered that I was    not more affected; but the mind is not at all times equally ready to be moved."    In a word, it is necessary to confess that, of all I heard or saw, the most    engaging spectacle was the comfortable bed, in which I hoped to make amends    for some nights on ship-board, and where I slept accordingly thinking of ghost    or goblin till I was called by my servant in the morning.  From this I am taught to infer that tales of    ghosts and demonology are out of date at forty years and upwards; that it is    only in the morning of life that this feeling of superstition " comes o'er us    like a summer cloud," affecting us with fear which is solemn and awful rather    than painful; and I am tempted to think that, if I were to write on the subject    at all, it should have been during a period of life when I could have treated    it with more interesting vivacity, and might have been at least amusing if I    could not be instructive. Even the present fashion of the world seems to be    ill suited for studies of this fantastic nature; and the most ordinary mechanic    has learning sufficient to laugh at the figments which in former times were    believed by far advanced in the deepest knowledge of the age. 
 </p><p>     I cannot, however, in conscience carry my opinion    of my countrymen's good sense so far as to exculpate them entirely from the    charge of credulity. Those who are disposed to look for them may, without much    trouble, see such manifest signs, both of superstition and the disposition to    believe in its doctrines, as may, render it no useless occupation to compare    the follies of our fathers with our own. The sailors have a proverb that every    man in his lifetime must eat a peck of impurity; and it seems yet more clear    that every generation of the human race must swallow a certain measure of nonsense.    There remains hope, however, that the grosser faults of our ancestors are now    out of date; and that whatever follies the present race may be guilty of, the    sense of humanity is too universally spread to permit them to think of tormenting    wretches till they confess what is impossible, and then burning them for their    pains. <br> <br>
