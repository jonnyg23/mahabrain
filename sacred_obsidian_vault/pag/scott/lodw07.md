 <p>     Penal Laws unpopular when rigidly exercised      -- Prosecution of Witches placed in the hand of Special Commissioners, <i>ad      inquirendum -- </i>Prosecution for Witchcraft not frequent in the Elder Period      of the Roman Empire -- Nor in the Middle Ages -- Some Cases took place, however      -- The Maid of Orleans -- The Duchess of Gloucester -- Richard the Third's      Charge against the Relations of the Queen Dowager -- But Prosecutions against      Sorcerers became more common in the end of the Fourteenth Century -- Usually      united with the Charge of Heresy -- Monstrelet's Account of the Persecution      against the Waldenses, under pretext of Witchcraft -- -Florimond's Testimony      concerning the Increase of Witches in his own Time -- Bull of Pope Innocent      VIII. -- Various Prosecutions in Foreign Countries under this severe Law --      Prosecutions in Labourt by the Inquisitor De Lancre and his Colleague -- Lycanthropy      -- Witches in Spain -- In Sweden -- and particularly those Apprehended at      Mohra. </p></blockquote> 
 <p>     PENAL laws, like those of the Middle Ages, denounced    against witchcraft, may be at first bailed with unanimous acquiescence and approbation,    but are uniformly found to disgust and offend at least the more sensible part    of the public when the punishments become frequent and are relentlessly inflicted.    Those against treason are no exception. Each reflecting government will do well    to shorten that melancholy reign of terror which perhaps must necessarily follow    on the discovery of a plot or the defeat of an insurrection. They ought not,    either in humanity or policy, to wait till the voice of the nation calls to    them, as Mecænas to Augustus, "<i>Surge tandem canrnifex</i>!" 
 </p><p>      It is accordingly remarkable, in different countries,    how often at some particular period of their history there occurred an epidemic    of terror of witches, which, as fear is always cruel and credulous, glutted    the public with seas of innocent blood; and how uniformly men loathed the gore    after having swallowed it, and by a reaction natural to the  human mind desired, in prudence, to take away    or restrict those laws which had been the source of carnage, in order that their    posterity might neither have the will nor the mean to enter into similar excesses. 
 </p><p>      A short review of foreign countries, before    we come to notice the British Islands and their Colonies, will prove the truth    of this statement. In Catholic countries on the continent, the various kingdoms    adopted readily that part of the civil law, already mentioned, which denounces    sorcerers and witches as rebels to God, and authors of sedition in the empire.    But being considered as obnoxious equally to the canon and civil law, Commissions    of Inquisition were especially empowered to weed out of the land the witches    and those who had intercourse with familiar spirits, or in any other respect    fell under the ban of the Church, as well as the heretics who promulgated or    adhered to false doctrine. Special warrants were thus granted from time to time    in behalf of such inquisitors, authorizing them to visit those provinces of    Germany, France, or Italy where any report concerning witches or sorcery had    alarmed the public mind ; and those Commissioners, proud of the trust reposed    in them, thought it becoming to use the utmost exertions on their part, that    the subtlety of the examinations, and the severity of the tortures they inflicted,    might wring the truth out of all suspected persons, until they rendered the    province in which they exercised their jurisdiction a desert from which the    inhabitants fled. It would be impossible to give credit to the extent of this    delusion, had not some of the inquisitors themselves been reporters of their    own judicial exploits: the same hand which subscribed the sentence has recorded    the execution. 
 </p><p>      In the earlier period of the Church of Rome    witchcraft is frequently alluded to, and a capital punishment assigned to those    who were supposed to have accomplished by sorcery the death of others, or to    have attempted, by false prophecies or otherwise, under pretext of consulting    with  the spiritual world, to make innovation in the    state. But no general denunciation against witchcraft itself, as a league with    the Enemy of Man, or desertion of the Deity, and a me <i>sui</i> <i>generis,    </i>appears to have been so acted upon, until the later period of the sixteenth    century, when the Papal system had attained its highest pitch of power and of    corruption. The influence of the Churchmen was in early times secure, and they    rather endeavoured, by the fabrication of false miracles, to prolong the blind    veneration of the people, than to vex others and weary themselves by secret    investigations into dubious and mystical trespasses, in which probably the higher    and better instructed members of the clerical order put as little faith at that    time as they do now. Did there remain a mineral fountain, respected for the    cures which it had wrought, a huge oak-tree, or venerated mount, which beauty    of situation had recommended to traditional respect, the fathers of the Roman    Church were in policy reluctant to abandon such impressive spots, or to represent    them as exclusively the rendezvous of witches or of evil spirits. On the contrary,    by assigning the virtues of the spring or the beauty of the tree to the guardianship    of some saint, they acquired, as it were, for the defence of their own doctrine,    a frontier fortress which they wrested from the enemy, and which it was at least    needless to dismantle, if it could be conveniently garrisoned and defended.    Thus the Church secured possession of many beautiful pieces of scenery, as Mr.    Whitfield is said to have grudged to the devil the monopoly of all the fine    tunes. 
 </p><p>      It is true that this policy was not uniformly    observed. The story of the celebrated Jeanne d'Arc, called the Maid of Orleans,    preserves the memory of such a custom, which was in that case turned to the    prejudice of the poor woman who observed it. 
 </p><p>      It is well known that this unfortunate female    fell into the hands of the English, after having, by her courage and  enthusiasm manifested on many important occasions,    revived the drooping courage of the French, and inspired them with the hope    of once more freeing their country. The English vulgar regarded her as a sorceress    -- the French as an inspired heroine; while the wise on both sides considered    her as neither the one nor the other, but a tool used by the celebrated Dunois    to play the part which he assigned her. The Duke of Bedford, when the ill-starred    Jeanne fell into his hands, took away her life in order to stigmatize her memory    with sorcery and to destroy the reputation she had acquired among the French.    The mean recurrence to such a charge against such a person had no more success    than it deserved, although Jeanne was condemned both by the Parliament of Bordeaux    and the University of Paris. Her indictment accused her of having frequented    an ancient oak-tree, and a fountain arising under it, called the Fated or Fairy    Oak of Bourlemont. Here she was stated to have repaired during the hours of    divine service, dancing, skipping, and making gestures, around the tree and    fountain, and hanging on the branches chaplets and garlands of flowers, gathered    for the purpose, reviving, doubtless, the obsolete idolatry which in ancient    times had been rendered on the same spot to the <i>Genius Loci</i>. The charmed    sword and blessed banner, which she had represented as signs of her celestial    mission, were in this hostile charge against her described as enchanted implements,    designed by the fiends and fairies whom she worshipped to accomplish her temporary    success. The death of the innocent, high-minded, and perhaps amiable enthusiast,    was not, we are sorry to say, a sacrifice to a superstitious fear of witchcraft,    but a cruel instance of wicked policy mingled with national jealousy and hatred. 
 </p><p>      To the same cause, about the same period, we    may impute the trial of the Duchess of Gloucester, wife of the good Duke Humphrey,    accused of consulting witches concerning the mode of compassing the death of    her husband's  nephew, Henry VI. The Duchess was condemned to    do penance, and thereafter banished to the Isle of Man, while several of her    accomplices died in prison or were executed. But in this instance also the alleged    witchcraft was only the ostensible cause of a procedure which had its real source    in the deep hatred between the Duke of Gloucester and Cardinal Beaufort, his    half-brother. The same pretext was used by Richard III. when he brought the    charge of sorcery against the Queen Dowager, Jane Shore, and the queen's kinsmen    ; and yet again was by that unscrupulous prince directed against Morton, afterwards    Archbishop of Canterbury, and other adherents of the Earl of Richmond. The accusation    in both cases was only chosen as a charge easily made and difficult to be eluded    or repelled. 
 </p><p>      But in the meanwhile, as the accusation of witchcraft    thus afforded to tyranny or policy the ready means of assailing persons whom    it might not have been possible to convict of any other crime, the aspersion    itself was gradually considered with increase of terror as spreading wider and    becoming more contagious. So early as the year 1398 the University of Paris,    in laying down rules for the judicial prosecuting of witches, express their    regret that the crime was growing more frequent than in any former age. The    more severe enquiries and frequent punishments by which the judges endeavoured    to check the progress of this impious practice seem to have increased the disease,    as indeed it has been always remarked that those morbid affections of mind which    depend on the imagination are sure to become More common in proportion as public    attention is fastened on stories connected with their display. 
 </p><p>      In the same century schisms arising from different    causes greatly alarmed the Church of Rome. The universal spirit of enquiry which    was now afloat, taking a different direction in different countries, had in    almost all of them stirred up a sceptical dissatisfaction with the dogmas of    the Church -- such views being rendered more credible to the poorer  classes through the corruption of manners among    the clergy too many of whom wealth and ease had caused to neglect that course    of morality which best recommends religious doctrine. In almost every nation    in Europe there lurked in the crowded cities, or the wild solitude of the country,    sects who agreed chiefly in their animosity to the supremacy of Rome and their    desire to cast off her domination. The Waldenses and Albigenses were parties    existing in great numbers through the south of France. The Romanists became    extremely desirous to combine the doctrine of the heretics with witchcraft,    which, according to their account, abounded especially where the Protestants    were most numerous; and, the bitterness increasing, the scrupled not to throw    the charge of sorcery, as a matter of course, upon those who dissented from    the Catholic standard of faith. The Jesuit Delrio alleges several reasons for    the affinity which he considers as existing between the Protestant and the sorcerer;    he accuses the former of embracing the opinion of Wierus and other defenders    of the devil (as he calls all who oppose his own opinions concerning witchcraft),    thus fortifying the kingdom of Satan against that of the Church. <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">47</font></a> 
 </p><p>      A remarkable passage in Monstrelet puts in a    clear view the point aimed, at by the Catholics in thus confusing and blending    the doctrines of heresy and the practice of witchcraft, and how a meeting of    inoffensive Protestants could be cunningly identified with a Sabbath of hags    and fiends. 
 </p><p>      "In this year (1459), in the town of Arras and    county of Artois, arose, through a terrible and melancholy chance, an opinion    called, I know not why, the Religion of Vaudoisie. This sect consisted, it is    said, of certain persons, both men and women, who, under cloud of night, by    the power of the devil, repaired to some solitary spot, amid woods and deserts,    where the devil appeared before them in a human  form -- save that his visage is never perfectly    visible to them -- read to the assembly a book of his ordinances, informing    in how he would be obeyed; distributed a very little money and a plentiful meal,    which was concluded by a scene of general profligacy; after which each one of    the party was conveyed home to her or his own habitation. 
 </p><p>      "On accusations of access to such acts of madness,"    continues Monstrelet, "several creditable persons of the town of Arras were    seized and imprisoned along with some foolish men and persons of little consequence.    These were so horribly tortured that some of them admitted the truth of the    whole accusations, and said, besides, that they had seen and recognised in their    nocturnal assembly many persons rank, prelates, seigneurs, and governors of    bailliages and ties, being such names as the examinators had suggested to the    persons examined, while they constrained them by torture to impeach the persons    to whom they belonged. Several of those who had been thus informed against were    arrested, thrown into prison, and tortured for so long a time that they also    were obliged to confess what was charged against them. After this those of mean    condition were executed and inhumanly burnt, while the richer and more powerful    of the accused ransomed themselves by sums of money, to avoid the punishment    and the shame attending it. Many even of those also confessed being persuaded    to take that course by the interrogators, who promised them indemnity for life    and fortune. Some there were, of a truth, who suffered with marvellous patience    and constancy the torments inflicted on them, and would confess nothing imputed    to their charge ; but they, too, had to give large sums to the judges, who exacted    that such of them as, notwithstanding their mishandling, were still able to    move, should banish themselves from that part of the country." Monstrelet winds    up this shocking narrative by informing us "that it ought not to be concealed    that the whole accusation was a stratagem of wicked men for their own covetous    purposes,  and in order, by these false accusations and    forced confessions, to destroy the life, fame, and fortune of wealth persons." 
 </p><p>      Delrio himself confesses that Franciscus Balduinus    give an account of the pretended punishment, but real persecution, of these    Waldenses, in similar terms with Monstrelet, whose suspicions are distinctly    spoken out, and adds that the Parliament of Paris, having heard the affair by    appeal, had declared the sentence illegal and the judges iniquitous, by an arret    dated 20th May, 1491, The Jesuit Delrio quote the passage, but adheres with    lingering reluctance to the of whom the truth of the accusation. "The Waldenses    (of whom the<i> </i>Albigenses are a species) were," he says, "never free from    the most wretched excess of fascination ;" and finally, though he allows the    conduct of the judges to have been most odious, he cannot prevail on himself    to acquit the parties charged by such interested accusers with horrors which    should hardly have been found proved even upon the most distinct evidence. He    appeals on this occasion to Florimond's work on Antichrist. The introduction    of that work deserves to be quoted, as strongly illustrative of the condition    to which the country was reduced, and calculated to make an impression the very    reverse probably of that which the writer would have desired:- 
 </p><p>      "All those who have afforded us some signs of    the approach of Antichrist agree that the increase of sorcery and witchcraft    is to distinguish the melancholy period of his advent; and was ever age so afflicted    with them as ours? The seats destined for criminals before our judicatories    are blackened with persons accused of this guilt. There are not judges enough    to try them. Our dungeons are gorged with them. No day passes that we do not    render our tribunals bloody by the dooms which we pronounce, or in which we    do not return to our homes discountenanced and terrified at the horrible contents    of the confessions which it has been our duty to hear. And the devil is accounted    so good a  master that we cannot commit so great a number    of his laves to the flames but what there shall arise from their ashes a number    sufficient to supply their place." <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">48</font></a> 
 </p><p>      This last statement, by which it appears that    the most active and unsparing inquisition was taking place, corresponds with    the historical notices of repeated persecutions upon this dreadful charge of    sorcery. A bull of Pope Innocent VIII. rang the tocsin against this formidable    crime, and set forth in the most dismal colours the guilt, while it stimulated    the inquisitors to the unsparing discharge of their duty in searching out and    punishing the guilty. "It is come to our ears," says the bull, " that numbers    of both sexes do not avoid to have intercourse with the infernal fiends, and    that by their sorceries they afflict both man and beast; that they blight the    marriage-bed, destroy the births of women, and the increase of cattle ; they    blast the corn on the ground, the grapes of the vineyard, the fruits of the    trees, the grass and herbs of the field." For which reasons the inquisitors    were armed with the apostolic power, and called upon to "convict, imprison,    and punish," and so forth. 
 </p><p>      Dreadful were the consequences of this bull    all over the Continent, especially in Italy, Germany, and France <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">49</font></a>.    About 1485 Cumanus burnt as witches forty-one poor women in one year in, the    county of Burlia. In the ensuing years he continued the prosecution with such    unremitting zeal that many fled from the country. 
 </p><p>      Alciatus states that an inquisitor, about the    same period, burnt an hundred sorcerers in Piedmont, and persevered in his inquiries    till human patience was exhausted, and the people arose and drove him out of    the country, after which jurisdiction was deferred to the archbishop. That prelate    consulted Alciatus himself, who had just then obtained his doctor's degree in    civil law, to which he was afterwards an  honour. A number of unfortunate wretches were    brought for judgment, fitter, according to the civilian's opinion, for a course    of hellebore than for the stake. Some were accuse of having dishonoured the    crucifix and denied their salvation others of having absconded to keep the Devil's    Sabbath, in spite of bolts and bars; others of having merely joined the choral    dances around the witches' tree of rendezvous Several of their husbands and    relatives swore that they we in bed and asleep during these pretended excursions    Alciatus recommended gentle and temperate measures; an the minds of the country    became at length composed. <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">50</font></a> 
 </p><p>      In 1488, the country four leagues around Constance    was laid waste by lightning and tempest, and two women being, by fair means    or foul, made to confess themselves guilty as the cause of the devastation,    suffered death. 
 </p><p>      About 1515, 500 persons were executed at Geneva,    under the character of "Protestant witches," from which we may suppose many    suffered for heresy. Forty-eight witches were burnt at Ravensburgh within four    years, as Hutchison reports, on the authority of Mengho, the author of the "Malleus    Malleficarum." In Lorraine the learned inquisitor, Remigius, boasts that he    put to death 900 people in fifteen years. As many were banished from that country,    so that whole towns were on the point of becoming desolate. In 1524, 1,000 persons    were put to death in one year at Como, in Italy, and about 100 every year after    for several years. <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">51</font></a> 
 </p><p>      In the beginning of the next century the persecution    of witches broke out in France with a fury which was hardly conceivable, and    multitudes were burnt amid that gay and lively people. Some notion of the extreme    prejudice of their judges may be drawn from the words of one of the inquisitors    themselves. Pierre de Lancre, royal councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux,    with whom the President  Espaignel was joined in a commission to enquire    into certain acts of sorcery, reported to have been committed in Labourt and    its neighbourhood, at the foot of the Pyrenees, out the month of May, 1619<i>.    </i>A few extracts from the preface will best evince the state of mind in which    he proceeded to the discharge of his commission. 
 </p><p>      His story assumes the form of a narrative of    a direct war between Satan on the one side and the Royal Commissioners on the    other, "because," says Councillor de Lancre, with self-complaisance, "nothing    is so calculated to strike terror into the fiend and his dominions as a commission    with such plenary powers." 
 </p><p>      At first, Satan endeavoured to supply his vassals    who were brought before the judges with strength to support the examinations,    so that if, by intermission of the torture, the wretches should fall into a    doze, they declared, when they were recalled from it to the question, that the    profound stupor "had something of Paradise in it, being gilded," said the judge,    "with the immediate presence of the devil;" though, in all probability, it rather    derived its charms from the natural comparison between the insensibility of    exhaustion and the previous agony of acute torture. The judges took care that    the fiend seldom obtained any advantage in the matter by refusing their victims,    in most cases, any interval of rest or sleep. Satan then proceeded, in the way    of direct defiance, to stop the mouth of the accused openly, and by mere force,    with something like a visible obstruction in their throat. Notwithstanding this,    to put the devil to shame, some of the accused found means, in spite of him,    to confess and be hanged, or rather burnt. The fiend lost much credit by his    failure on this occasion. Before the formidable Commissioners arrived, he had    held his <i>cour plénière</i> before the gates of Bourdeaux, and    in the square of the palace of Galienne, whereas he was now insulted publicly    by his own vassals, and in the midst of his festival of the Sabbath the children    and relations of the  witches who had suffered not sticking to say    to him, "Out upon you ! Your promise was that our mothers who were prisoners    should not die; and look how you have kept your word with us! They have been    burnt, and are a heap of ashes." To appease this mutiny Satan had two evasions    He produced illusory fires, and encouraged the mutinous o walk through them,    assuring them that the judicial pile was as frigid and inoffensive as those    which he exhibited to them. Again, taking his refuge in lies, of which he is    well known to be the father, he stoutly affirmed that their parents, who seemed    to have suffered, were safe in a foreign country, and that if their children    would call on them they would receive an answer. They made the invocation accordingly,    and Satan answered each of them in a tone which resembled the voice of the lamented    parent almost as successfully as Monsieur Alexandre could have done. 
 </p><p>      Proceeding to a yet more close attack, the Commissioners,    on the eve of one of the Fiend's Sabbaths, placed the gibbet on which they executed    their victims just on the spot where Satan's gilded chair was usually stationed.    The devil was much offended at such an affront, and yet had so little power    in the matter that he could only express his resentment by threats that he    would hang Messieurs D'Amon and D'Urtubbe, gentlemen who had solicited and promoted    the issuing of the Commission, and would also burn the Commissioners themselves    in their own fire. We regret to say that Satan was unable to execute either    of these laudable resolutions. Ashamed of his excuses, he abandoned for three    or four sittings his attendance on the Sabbaths, sending as his representative    an imp of subordinate account, and in whom no one reposed confidence. When he    took courage again to face his parliament, the Arch-fiend covered his defection    by assuring them that he had been engaged in a lawsuit with the Deity, which    he had gained with costs, and that six score of infant children were to be delivered    up to him in name of damages, and the witches were directed to  procure such victims accordingly. After this    grand fiction he confined himself to the petty vengeance of impeding the access    of confessors to the condemned, which was the more easy as few of them could    speak the Basque language. I have no time to detail the ingenious method by    which the learned Councillor de Lancre explains why the district of Labourt    should be particularly exposed to the pest of sorcery. The chief reason seems    to be that it is a mountainous, a sterile, and a border country, where the men    are all fishers and the women smoke tobacco and wear short petticoats. 
 </p><p>      To a person who, in this presumptuous, trifling,    and conceited spirit, has composed a quarto volume full of the greatest absurdities    and grossest obscenities ever impressed on paper, it was the pleasure of the    most Christian Monarch to consign the most absolute power which could be exercised    on these poor people; and he might with as much prudence have turned a ravenous    wolf upon an undefended flock, of whom the animal was the natural enemy, as    they were his natural prey. The priest, as well as the ignorant peasant, fell    under the suspicion of this fell Commission; and De Lancre writes, with much    complacency, that the accused were brought to trial to the number of forty in    one day -- with what chance of escape, when the judges were blinded with prejudice,    and could only hear the evidence and the defence through the medium of an interpreter,    the understanding of the reader may easily anticipate. 
 </p><p>      Among other gross transgressions of the most    ordinary rules, it may be remarked that the accused, in what their judges called    confessions, contradicted each other at every turn respecting the description    of the Domdaniel in which they pretended to have been assembled, and the fiend    who presided there. All spoke to a sort of gilded throne; but some saw a hideous    wild he-goat seated there; some a man disfigured and twisted, as suffering torture;    some, with better taste, beheld a huge indistinct form, resembling one of those    mutilated trunks of trees found in ancient forests.  But De Lancre was no "Daniel come to judgment,"    and the discrepancy of evidence, which saved the life and fame of Susannah,    made no impression in favour of the sorcerers of Labourt. 
 </p><p>      Instances occur in De Lancre's book of the trial    and condemnation of persons accused of the crime of <i>1ycanthropy, a </i>superstition    which was chiefly current in France, but was known in other countries, and is    the subject of great debate between Wier, Naudé, Scot, on the one hand,    and their demonological adversaries on the other. The idea, said the one party,    was that a human being had the power, by sorcery, of transforming himself into    the shape of a wolf, and in that capacity, being seized with a species of fury,    he rushed out and made havoc among the flocks, slaying and wasting, like the    animal whom he represented, far more than he could devour. The more incredulous    reasoners would not allow of a real transformation, whether with or without    the enchanted hide of a wolf, which in some cases was supposed to aid the metamorphosis,    and contended that lycanthropy only subsisted as a woful species of disease,    a melancholy state of mind, broken with occasional fits of insanity, in which    the patient imagined that he committed the ravages of which he was accused.    Such a person, a mere youth, was tried at Besançon, who gave himself    out for a servant, or yeoman pricker, of the Lord of the Forest -- so he called    his superior -- who was judged to be the devil. He was, by his master's power,    transformed into the likeness and performed the usual functions of a wolf, and    was attended in his course by one larger, which he supposed the Lord of the    Forest himself. These wolves, he said, ravaged the flocks, and throttled the    dogs which stood in their defence. If either had not seen the other, he howled,    after the manner of the animal, to call his comrade to his share of the prey;    if be did not come upon this signal, he proceeded to bury it the best way he    could. 
 </p><p>      Such was the general persecution under Messieurs    Espiagnel and De Lancre. Many similar scenes occurred in France,  till the edict of Louis XIV. discharging all    future prosecutions for witchcraft, after which the crime itself was heard of    no more. <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">52</font></a> 
 </p><p>      While the spirit of superstition was working    such horrors in France, it was not, we may believe, more idle in other countries    of Europe. In Spain, particularly, long the residence of the Moors, a people    putting deep faith in all the day-dreams of witchcraft, good and evil genii,    spells and talismans, the ardent and devotional temper of the old Christians    dictated a severe research after sorcerers as well as heretics, and relapsed    Jews or Mahommedans. In former times, during the subsistence of the Moorish    kingdoms in Spain, a school was supposed to be kept open in Toboso 'for the    study, it is said, of magic, but more likely of chemistry, algebra, and other    sciences, which, altogether mistaken by the ignorant and vulgar, and imperfectly    understood even by those who studied them, were supposed to be allied to necromancy,    or at least to natural magic. It was, of course, the business of the Inquisition    to purify whatever such pursuits had left of suspicious Catholicism, and their    labours cost as much blood on accusations of witchcraft and magic as for heresy    and relapse. 
 </p><p>      Even the colder nations of Europe were subject    to the same epidemic terror for witchcraft, and a specimen of it was exhibited    in the sober and rational country of Sweden about the middle of last century,    an account of which, being translated into English by a respectable clergyman,    Doctor Horneck, excited general surprise how a whole people could be imposed    upon to the degree of shedding much blood, and committing great cruelty and    injustice, on account of the idle falsehoods propagated by a crew of lying children,    who in this case were both actors and witnesses. 
 </p><p>      The melancholy truth that "the human heart is    deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked," is by nothing proved so    strongly as by the imperfect sense displayed by children of the sanctity of    moral truth. Both the gentlemen  and the mass of the people, as they advance in    years, learn to despise and avoid falsehood ; the former out of pride, and from    a remaining feeling, derived from the days o chivalry, that the character of    a liar is a deadly stain on their honour; the other, from some general reflection    upon the necessity of preserving a character for integrity in the course of    life, and a sense of the truth of the common adage, that "honesty is the best    policy." But these are acquired habits of thinking. The child has no natural    love of truth, as is experienced by all who have the least acquaintance with    early youth. If they are charged with fault while they can hardly speak, the    first words they stammer forth are a falsehood to excuse it. Nor is this all:    the temptation of attracting attention, the pleasure of enjoying importance,    the desire to escape from an unpleasing task, or accomplish a holiday, will    at any time overcome the sentiment of truth, so weak is it within them. Hence    thieves and housebreakers, from a surprisingly early period, find means of rendering    children useful in their mystery ; nor are such acolytes found to evade justice    with less dexterity than the more advanced rogues. Where a number of them are    concerned in the same mischief, there is something resembling virtue in the    fidelity with which the common secret is preserved. Children, under the usual    age of their being admitted to give evidence, were necessarily often examined    in witch trials ; and it is terrible to see how often the little impostors,    from spite or in mere. gaiety of spirit, have by their art and perseverance    made shipwreck of men's lives. But it would be hard to discover a case which,    supported exclusively by the evidence of children (the confessions under torture    excepted), and obviously existing only in the young witnesses' own imagination,    has been attended with such serious consequences, or given cause to so extensive    and fatal a delusion, as that which occurred in Sweden. 
 </p><p>      The scene was the Swedish village of Mohra,    in the province of Elfland, which district had probably its name from  some remnant of ancient superstition. The delusion    had come to a great height ere it reached the ears of government, when, as was    the general procedure, Royal Commissioners were sent down, men well fitted for    the duty entrusted to them ; that is, with ears open to receive the incredibilities    with which they were to be crammed, and hearts hardened against every degree    of compassion to the accused. The complaints of the common people, backed by    some persons of better condition, were that a number of persons, renowned as    witches, had drawn several hundred children of all classes under the devil's    authority. They demanded, therefore, the punishment of these agents of hell,    reminding the judges that the province had been clear of witches since the burning    of some on a former occasion. The accused were numerous, so many as threescore    and ten witches and sorcerers being seized in the village of Mohra; three-and-twenty    confessed their crimes, and were sent to Faluna, where most of them were executed.    Fifteen of the children were also led to death. Six-and-thirty of those who    were young were forced to run the gauntlet, as it is called, and were, besides,    lashed weekly at the church doors for a whole year. Twenty of the youngest were    condemned to the same discipline for three days only. 
 </p><p>      The process seems to have consisted in confronting    the children with the witches, and hearing the extraordinary story which the    former insisted upon maintaining. The children, to, the number of three hundred,    were found more or less perfect in a tale as full of impossible absurdities    as ever was told around a nursery fire. Their confession ran thus: --  
 </p><p>      They were taught by the witches to go to a cross    way, and with certain ceremonies to invoke the devil by the name of Antecessor,    begging him to carry them off to Blockula, meaning, perhaps, the Brockenberg,    in the Hartz forest, a mountain infamous for being the common scene of witches'    meetings, and to which Goethe represents the spirit Mephistopheles as conducting    his pupil Faustus. The devil courteously appeared at the call of the children    in  various forms, but chiefly as a mad Merry-Andrew,    with a grey coat, red and blue stockings, a red beard, a high-crowned hat, with    linen of various colours wrapt round it, and garters of peculiar length. He    set each child on some beast of his providing, and anointed them with a certain    unguent composed of the scrapings of altars and the filings of church clocks.    There is here a discrepancy of evidence which in another court would have cast    the whole. Most of the children considered their journey to be corporeal and    actual. Some supposed, however, that their strength or spirit only travelled    with the fiend, and that their body remained behind. Very few adopted this last    hypothesis, though the parents unanimously bore witness that the bodies of the    children remained in bed, and could not be awakened out of a deep sleep, though    they shook them for the purpose of awakening them. So strong was, nevertheless,    the belief of nurses and mothers in their actual transportation, that a sensible    clergyman, mentioned in the preface, who had resolved he would watch his son    the whole night and see what hag or fiend would take him from his arms, had    the utmost difficulty, notwithstanding, in convincing his mother that the child    had not been transported to Blockula during the very night he held him in his    embrace. 
 </p><p>      The learned translator candidly allows, "out    of so great a multitude as were accused, condemned, and executed, there might    be some who suffered unjustly, and owed their death more to the malice of their    enemies than to their skill in the black art, I will readily admit. Nor will    I deny," he continues, "but that when the news of these transactions and accounts,    how the children bewitched fel into fits and strange unusual postures, spread    abroad in the kingdom, some fearful and credulous people, if they saw their    children any way disordered, might think they were bewitched or ready to be    carried away by imps." <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">53</font></a> The learned gentleman here stops short    in a train of reasoning,  which, followed out, would have deprived the    world of the benefit of his translation. For if it was possible that some of    these unfortunate persons fell a sacrifice to the malice of their neighbours    or the prejudices of witnesses, as he seems ready to grant, is it not more reasonable    to believe that the whole of the accused were convicted on similar grounds,    than to allow, as truth, the slightest part of the gross and vulgar impossibilities    upon which alone their execution can be justified? 
 </p><p>      The Blockula, which was the object of their    journey, was a house having a fine gate painted with divers colours, with a    paddock, in which they turned the beasts to graze which had brought them to    such scenes of revelry. If human beings had been employed they were left slumbering    against the wall of the house. The plan of the devil's palace consisted of one    large banqueting apartment and several withdrawing-rooms. Their food was homely    enough, being broth made of coleworts and bacon, with bread and butter, and    milk and cheese. The same acts of wickedness and profligacy were committed at    Blockula which are usually supposed to take place upon the devil's Sabbath elsewhere;    but there was this particular, that the witches had sons and daughters by the    fiends, who were married together, and produced an offspring of toads and serpents. 
 </p><p>      These confessions being delivered before the    accused witches, they at first stoutly denied them. At last some of them burst    into tears, and acquiesced in the horrors imputed to them. They said the practice    of carrying off children had been enlarged very lately (which shows the whole    rumours to have arisen recently); and the despairing wretches confirmed what    the children said, with many other extravagant circumstances, as the mode of    elongating a goat's back by means of a spit, on which we cafe not to be particular.    It is worth mentioning that the devil, desirous of enjoying his own reputation    among his subjects, pretended at one time to be dead, and was much lamented    at Blockula -- but he soon revived again.   Some attempts these witches had made to harm    individuals on middle earth, but with little success. One old sorceress, indeed,    attempted to strike a nail, given her by the devil for that purpose, into the    head of the minister of Elfland ; but as the skull was of unusual solidity,    the reverend gentleman only felt a headache from her efforts. They could not    be persuaded to exhibit any of their tricks before the Commissioners, excusing    themselves by alleging that their witchcraft had left them, and that the devil    had amused them with the vision of a burning pit, having a hand thrust out of    it. 
 </p><p>      The total number who lost their lives on this    singular occasion was fourscore and four persons, including fifteen children    ; and at this expense of blood was extinguished a flame that arose as suddenly,    burned as fiercely, and decayed as rapidly, as any portent of the kind within    the annals of superstition. The Commissioners returned to Court with the high    approbation of all concerned; prayers were ordered through the churches weekly,    that Heaven would be pleased to restrain the powers of the devil, and deliver    the poor creatures who hitherto had groaned under it, as well as the innocent    children, who were carried off by hundreds at once. 
 </p><p>      If we could ever learn the true explanation    of this story, we should probably find that the cry was led by some clever mischievous    boy, who wished to apologise to his parents for lying an hour longer in the    morning by alleging he had been at Blockula on the preceding night; and that    the desire to be as much distinguished as their comrade had stimulated the bolder    and more acute of his companions to the like falsehoods; whilst those of weaker    minds assented, either from fear of punishment or the force of dreaming over    at night the horrors which were dinned into their ears all day. Those who were    ingenuous, as it was termed, in their confessions, received praise and encouragement;    and those who denied or were silent, and, as it was considered, impenitent,  were sure to bear the harder share of the punishment    which was addressed to all. It is worth while also to observe, that the smarter    children began to improve their evidence and add touches to the general picture    of Blockula. " Some of the children talked much of a white angel, which used    to forbid them what the devil bid them do, and told them that these doings should    not last long. And (they added) this better being would place himself sometimes    at the door betwixt the witches and the children, and when they came to Blockula    he pulled the children back, but the witches went in." 
 </p><p>      This additional evidence speaks for itself,    and shows the whole tale to be the fiction of the children's imagination, which    some of them wished to improve upon. The reader may consult "An Account of what    happened in the Kingdom of Sweden in the years 1669 and 1670, and afterwards    translated out of High Dutch into English by Dr. Antony Horneck," attached to    Glanville's "Sadducismus Triumphatus." The translator refers to the evidence    of Baron Sparr, Ambassador from the Court of Sweden to the Court of England    in 1672; and that of Baron Lyonberg, Envoy Extraordinary of the same power,    both of whom attest the confession and execution of the witches. The King of    Sweden himself answered the express inquiries of the Duke of Holstein with marked    reserve. "His judges and commissioners," he said, "had caused divers men, women,    and children, to be burnt and executed on such pregnant evidence as was brought    before them. But whether the actions confessed and proved against them were    real, or only the effects of strong imagination, he was not as yet able to determine"    -- a sufficient reason, perhaps, why punishment should have been at least deferred    by the interposition of the royal authority. 
 </p><p>      We must now turn our eyes to Britain, in which    our knowledge as to such events is necessarily more extensive, and where it    is in a high degree more interesting to our present purpose. <br> <br>
