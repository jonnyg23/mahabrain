 BOOK I.  HSIO R.
 
 【第一章】
 【一節】子曰、 學而時習之、不亦說乎。【二節】有朋自遠方來、不亦樂
 乎。【三節】人不知而不慍、不亦君子乎。
 	CHAPTER I. 1. The Master said, 'Is it not pleasant to learn 
 with a constant perseverance and application?
 	2. 'Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant 
 quarters?'
 	3. 'Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no 
 discomposure though men may take no note of him?'
 
 【第二章】【一節】有子曰、其為人也孝弟、而好犯上者鮮矣、不好犯上、
 而好作亂者、未之有也。【二節】君子務本、本立、而道生、孝
 	CHAP. II. 1. The philosopher Yu said, 'They are few who, 
 being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their 
 superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend 
 against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.
 	2. 'The superior man bends his attention to what is 
 radical.
 
 弟也者、其為仁之本與。
 【第三章】子曰、巧言令色、鮮矣仁。
 【第四章】曾子曰、吾日三省吾身、為人謀、而不忠乎、與朋友交、而不信
 乎、傳不習乎。
 That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. 
 Filial piety and fraternal submission!-- are they not the root of 
 all benevolent actions?'
 	CHAP. III. The Master said, 'Fine words and an 
 insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.'
 	CHAP. IV. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I daily examine 
 myself on three points:-- whether, in transacting business for 
 others, I may have been not faithful;-- whether, in intercourse 
 with friends, I may have been not sincere;-- whether I may 
 have not mastered and practised the instructions of my 
 teacher.'
 
 【第五章】子曰、道千乘之國、敬事而信、節用而愛人、使民以時。

 	CHAP. V. The Master said, To rule a country of a thousand 
 chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and 
 sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the 
 employment of the people at the proper seasons.'
 	CHAP. VI. The Master said, 'A youth, when at home, 
 should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should 
 be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and 
 cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and 
 opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should 
 employ them in polite studies.'
 	CHAP. VII. Tsze-hsia said, 'If a man withdraws his mind 
 from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love 
 of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his 
 utmost strength;
 
 與朋友交、言而有信、雖曰未學、吾必謂之學矣。
 【第八章】【一節】子曰、君子不重、則不威、學則不固。【二節】主忠信。
 【三節】無友不如己者。【四節】過則勿憚改。
 【第九章】曾子曰、慎終追遠、民德歸厚矣。
 if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his 
 intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-- although 
 men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he 
 has.'
 	CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'If the scholar be not 
 grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning 
 will not be solid.

 	4. 'When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.'
 	CHAP. IX. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Let there be a 
 careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let 
 them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of 
 sacrifice;-- then the virtue of the people will resume its proper 
 excellence.' 
 
 【第十章】【一節】子禽問於子貢曰、夫子至於是邦也、必聞其政、求之與、
 抑與之與。【二節】子貢曰、夫子溫､良､恭､儉､讓、以得之、夫子之求
 之也、其諸異乎人之求之與。
 【十一章】子曰、父在、觀其志、父沒、觀其行、三年無改於父之道、可謂
 孝矣。
 CHAP. X. 1. Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'When our 
 master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about 
 its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to 
 him?'
 	2. Tsze-kung said, 'Our master is benign, upright, 
 courteous, temperate, and complaisant, and thus he gets his 
 information. The master's mode of asking information!-- is it 
 not different from that of other men?'
 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'While a man's father is alive, 
 look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his 
 conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of 
 his father, he may be called filial.'
 
 【十二章】【一節】有子曰、禮之用、和為貴、先王之道、斯為美；小大由
 之。【二節】有所不行、知和而和、不以禮節之、亦不可行也。

 親、亦可宗也。
 【十四章】子曰、君子食無求
 CHAP. XII. 1. The philosopher Yu said, 'In practising the rules of 
 propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed 
 by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things 
 small and great we follow them.
 	2. 'Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing 
 how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without 
 regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be 
 done.'
 	CHAP. XIII. The philosopher Yu said, 'When agreements 
 are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be 
 made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, 
 one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon 
 whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he 
 can make them his guides and masters.'
 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'He who aims to be a man of 
 complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his 
 appetite, nor
 
 飽、居無求安、敏於事、而慎於言、就有道、而正焉、可謂好學也已。
 【十五章】【一節】子貢曰貧、而無諂、富而無驕、何如。子曰、可也、未
 若貧而樂、富而好禮者也。【二節】子貢曰、詩云、如切如磋、如琢如磨、
 其斯之謂與。【三節】子曰、賜也、始可與言詩
 in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is 
 earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he 
 frequents the company of men of principle that he may be 
 rectified:-- such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.'
 	CHAP. XV. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'What do you pronounce 
 concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich 
 man who is not proud?' The Master replied, 'They will do; but 
 they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, 
 and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.'
 	2. Tsze-kung replied, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "As 
 you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish."-- The 
 meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just 
 expressed.'
 	3. The Master said, 'With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to 
 talk
 
 已矣、告諸往而知來者。
 【十六章】子曰、不患人之不己知、患不知人也。
 about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper 
 sequence.'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'I will not be afflicted at 
 men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know 
 men.'

 	CHAP. II. The Master said, 'In the Book of Poetry are 
 three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be 
 embraced in one sentence-- "Having no depraved thoughts."'
 	CHAP. III. 1. The Master said, 'If the people be led by 
 laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, 
 they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of 
 shame.
 	2. 'If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be 
 given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense 
 of shame, and moreover will become good.'
 	CHAP. IV. 1. The Master said, 'At fifteen, I had my mind 
 bent on learning.
 	2. 'At thirty, I stood firm.
 	3. 'At forty, I had no doubts.
 	4. 'At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.
 
 十而知天命。【五節】六十而耳順。【五節】七十而從心所欲、不踰矩。
 【第五章】【一節】孟懿子問孝、子曰、無違。【二節】樊遲御、子告之曰、

 禮、死葬之以禮、祭之以禮。

 reception of truth.
 	6. 'At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, 
 without transgressing what was right.'

 Master said, 'It is not being disobedient.'

 told him, saying, 'Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and 
 I answered him,-- "not being disobedient."'
 	3. Fan Ch'ih said, 'What did you mean?' The Master 
 replied, 'That parents, when alive, be served according to 
 propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to 
 propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to 
 propriety.'

 	CHAP. VI. Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The 
 Master said, 'Parents are anxious lest their children should be 
 sick.'
 	CHAP. VII. Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The 
 Master said, 'The filial piety of now-a-days means the support 
 of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do 
 something in the way of support;-- without reverence, what is 
 there to distinguish the one support given from the other?'
 	CHAP. VIII. Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The 
 Master said, 'The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when 
 their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the 
 toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they 
 set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial 
 piety?'
 
 【第九章】子曰、吾與回言終日、不違、如愚。退兒省其私、亦足以發、回

 	CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'I have talked with Hui for a 
 whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I 
 said;-- as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have 
 examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able 
 to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-- He is not stupid.'
 	CHAP. X. 1. The Master said, 'See what a man does.
 	2. 'Mark his motives.
 	3. 'Examine in what things he rests.
 	4. 'How can a man conceal his character?
 	5. How can a man conceal his character?'
 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'If a man keeps cherishing his 
 old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may 
 be a teacher of others.'

 superior man. The Master said, 'He acts before he speaks, and 
 afterwards speaks according to his actions.'

 寡尤、多見闕殆、慎行其餘、則寡悔、言寡尤、行寡悔、祿在其中矣。
 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Yu, shall I teach you what 
 knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know 
 it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not 
 know it;-- this is knowledge.'
 	CHAP. XVII. 1. Tsze-chang was learning with a view to 
 official emolument.
 	2. The Master said, 'Hear much and put aside the points 
 of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the 
 same time of the others:-- then you will afford few occasions 
 for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem 
 perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying 
 the others into practice:-- then you will have few occasions for 
 repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his 
 words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in 
 the way to get emolument.'

 set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.'
 	CHAP. XX. Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to 
 reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to 
 nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, 'Let him preside 
 over them with gravity;-- then they will reverence him. Let 
 him be filial and kind to all;-- then they will be faithful to him. 
 Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-- then 
 they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.'
 	CHAP. XXI. 1. Some one addressed Confucius, saying, 'Sir, 
 why are you not engaged in the government?'
 
 不為政。【二節】子曰、書云孝乎、惟孝友于兄弟、施於有政、是亦為政、
 奚其為為政。
 【廿二章】子曰、人而無信、不知其可也、大車無輗、小車無軏、其何以行
 之哉。
 【廿三章】【一節】子張問十世、可知也。【二節】子曰、殷因於夏禮、
 	2. The Master said, 'What does the Shu-ching say of filial 
 piety?-- "You are filial, you discharge your brotherly duties. 
 These qualities are displayed in government." This then also 
 constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be 
 THAT-- making one be in the government?'
 	CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'I do not know how a man 
 without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be 
 made to go without the cross-bar for yoking the oxen to, or a 
 small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?'
 	CHAP. XXIII. 1. Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of 
 ten ages after could be known.
 	2. Confucius said, 'The Yin dynasty followed the 
 regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them 
 may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations 
 of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. 
 Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the 
 distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.'

 知也。

 也。

 had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, 'If he can bear to do

 【第三章】子曰、人而不仁、如禮何、人而不仁、如樂何。
 【第四章】【一節】林放問禮之本。【二節】子曰、大哉問。【三節】禮、
 與其奢也、寧
 	CHAP. II. The three families used the YUNG ode, while the 
 vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice.

 looks profound and grave:"-- what application can these words 
 have in the hall of the three families?'
 	CHAP. III. The Master said, 'If a man be without the 
 virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of 
 propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, 
 what has he to do with music?'

 attended to in ceremonies.

 【第五章】子曰、夷狄之有君、不如諸夏之亡也。
 【第六章】季氏旅於泰山。子謂冉有曰、女弗能救與。對曰、不能。子曰、
 嗚呼、曾謂泰山、不如林放乎。
 In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep 
 sorrow than a minute attention to observances.'

 north have their princes, and are not like the States of our 
 great land which are without them.'
 	CHAP. VI. The chief of the Chi family was about to 
 sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, 'Can 
 you not save him from this?' He answered, 'I cannot.' Confucius

 discerning as Lin Fang?'

 矣。
 	CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'The student of virtue has no 
 contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in 
 archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he 
 ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In 
 his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.'
 	CHAP. VIII. 1. Tsze-hsia asked, saying, 'What is the 
 meaning of the passage-- "The pretty dimples of her artful 
 smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain 
 ground for the colours?"'
 	2. The Master said, 'The business of laying on the colours 
 follows (the preparation of) the plain ground.'
 	3. 'Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?' The Master 
 said, 'It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can 
 begin to talk about the odes with him.'
 
 【第九章】子曰、夏禮吾能言之、杞不足徵也、殷禮吾能言之、宋不足徵也、
 文獻不足故也、足、則吾能徵之矣。
 【第十章】子曰、禘、自既灌而往者、吾不欲觀之矣。
 【十一章】或問禘之說。子曰、不知也、知其說者、之於天下也、其如示諸
 	CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'I could describe the 
 ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently 
 attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin 
 dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. (They 
 cannot do so) because of the insufficiency of their records and 
 wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in 
 support of my words.'
 	CHAP. X. The Master said, 'At the great sacrifice, after the 
 pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.'
 	CHAP. XI. Some one asked the meaning of the great 
 sacrifice. The Master said, 'I do not know. He who knew its 
 meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look 
 on this;-- pointing to his palm.

 meaning of the saying, "It is better to pay court to the furnace 
 than to the south-west corner?"'

 Heaven has none to whom he can pray.'
 
 【十四章】子曰、周監於二代、郁郁乎文哉、吾從周。
 【十五章】子入大廟、每事問。或曰、孰謂鄹人之子知禮乎、入大廟、每事
 問。子聞之曰、是禮也。
 【十六章】子曰、射不主皮、為力不同科、古之道也。
 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'Chau had the advantage of 
 viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are 
 its regulations! I follow Chau.'
 	CHAP. XV. The Master, when he entered the grand 
 temple, asked about everything. Some one said, 'Who will say 
 that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! 
 He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.' 
 The Master heard the remark, and said, 'This is a rule of 
 propriety.'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'In archery it is not going 
 through the leather which is the principal thing;-- because

 offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first 
 day of each month.
 	2. The Master said, 'Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the 
 ceremony.'
 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'The full observance of the 
 rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by 
 people to be flattery.'
 	CHAP. XIX. The Duke Ting asked how a prince should 
 employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their 
 prince. Confucius replied, 'A prince should employ his minister 
 according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers 
 should serve their prince with faithfulness.'

 enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being 
 hurtfully excessive.'

 節】曰、管氏有三歸、
 	CHAP. XXI. 1. The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars 
 of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, 'The Hsia sovereign 
 planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted 
 the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, 
 meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.'
 	2. When the Master heard it, he said, 'Things that are 
 done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their 
 course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, 
 it is needless to blame.'
 	CHAP. XXII. 1. The Master said, 'Small indeed was the 
 capacity of Kwan Chung!'
 	2. Some one said, 'Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?' 
 'Kwan,' was the reply, 'had the San Kwei, and his officers 
 performed no double duties; how can he be considered 
 parsimonious?'
 	3. 'Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?' 
 The
 
 官事不攝、焉得儉。【四節】然則管仲知禮乎。【五節】曰、邦君樹塞門、
 管氏亦樹塞門、邦君為兩君之好、有反坫、管氏亦有反坫、管氏而知禮、孰
 不知禮。
 【廿三章】子語魯大師樂曰、樂其可知也、始作、翕如也、從之、純如也、
 繳如也、繹如也、以成。
 Master said, 'The princes of States have a screen intercepting 
 the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. 
 The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of 
 them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan 
 had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety,

 have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of 
 seeing them.' The followers of the sage introduced him, and 
 when he came out from the interview, he said, 'My friends,

 kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and 
 right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its 
 wooden tongue.'
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said of the Shao that it was 
 perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu

 	2. 'If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil 
 the requirements of that name?
 	3. 'The superior man does not, even for the space of a

 his person.

 anything; what is right he will follow.'

 with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of 
 propriety?'
 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'A man should say, I am not

 man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean

 filial.'

 no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for 
 joy and for fear.'

 my reproving him?'

 hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now

 been styled Wan.'

 you say of him?' The Master replied. 'He was loyal.' 'Was he 
 perfectly virtuous?' 'I do not know. How can he be pronounced 
 perfectly virtuous?'

 horses, abandoned them and left the country. Coming to 
 another State, he said, "They are here like our great officer, 
 Ch'ui," and left it. He came to a second State, and with the same 
 observation left it also;-- what do you say of him?' The Master 
 replied, 'He was pure.' 'Was he perfectly virtuous?' 'I do not

 the Master was informed of it, he said, 'Twice may do.'

 begged it of a neighbor and gave it to the man.'
 	CHAP. XXIV. The Master said, 'Fine words, an insinuating 
 appearance, and excessive respect;-- Tso Ch'iu-ming was 
 ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal

 man should have such a sickness! That such a man should have 
 such a sickness!'
 		CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'Admirable indeed was 
 the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single 
 gourd dish of drink, and living in his mean narrow lane, while 
 others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his 
 joy to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of 
 Hui!'
 	CHAP. X. Yen Ch'iu said, 'It is not that I do not delight in 
 your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.' The Master 
 said, 'Those whose strength is insufficient give over in the 
 middle of the way but now you limit yourself.'

 the mean man.'

 answered, 'There is Tan-t'ai Mieh-ming, who never in walking 
 takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on 
 public business.'
 	CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'Mang Chih-fan does not 
 boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, 
 when they were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his 
 horse, saying, "It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would 
 not advance."'

 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'Without the specious speech 
 of the litanist T'o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it 
 is difficult to escape in the present age.'
 	CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Who can go out but by the 
 door? How is it that men will not walk according to these 
 ways?'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'Where the solid qualities are 
 in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the 
 accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have 
 the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid 
 qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.'
 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Man is born for 
 uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his 
 escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.'

 are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not 
 equal to those who delight in it.'

 above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To 
 those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not 
 be announced.'
 	CHAP. XX. Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The 
 Master said, 'To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to 
 men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from 
 them, may be called wisdom.' He asked about perfect virtue. 
 The Master said, 'The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be 
 overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent 
 consideration;-- this may be called perfect virtue.'

 corners.-- A strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered 
 vessel!'

 extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under 
 the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not 
 overstep what is right.'
 	CHAP. XXVI. The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu 
 was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, 'Wherein I 
 have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven 
 reject me!'
 	CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'Perfect is the virtue which 
 is

 according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been 
 its practise among the people.'
 	CHAP. XXVIII. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Suppose the case of a 
 man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to 
 assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called 
 perfectly virtuous?' The Master said, 'Why speak only of virtue 
 in connexion with him? Must he not have the qualities of a 
 sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.
 	2. 'Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be 
 established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to 
 be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.
 	3. 'To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in 
 ourselves;-- this may be called the art of virtue.'

 knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others 
 without being wearied:-- which one of these things belongs to 
 me?'
 	CHAP. III. The Master said, 'The leaving virtue without 
 proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is 
 learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which 
 a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not 
 good:-- these are the things which occasion me solicitude.'

 	CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'From the man bringing his 
 bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never 
 refused instruction to any one.'
 	CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'I do not open up the truth 
 to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one 
 who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented 
 one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn 
 the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.'
 	CHAP. IX. 1. When the Master was eating by the side of a 
 mourner, he never ate to the full.

 weeping.

 	2. Tsze-lu said, 'If you had the conduct of the armies of a 
 great State, whom would you have to act with you?'
 	3. The Master said, 'I would not have him to act with me, 
 who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a 
 boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man 
 who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of 
 adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.'
 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'If the search for riches is sure 
 to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in 
 hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be 
 successful, I will follow after that which I love.'

 	CHAP. XIII. When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the 
 Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. 'I

 excellent as this.'
 	CHAP. XIV. 1. Yen Yu said, 'Is our Master for the ruler of 
 Wei?' Tsze-kung said, 'Oh! I will ask him.'
 	2. He went in accordingly, and said, 'What sort of men 
 were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?' 'They were ancient worthies,' said the 
 Master. 'Did they have any repinings because of their course?' 
 The Master again replied, 'They sought to act virtuously, and 
 they did so; what was there for them to repine about?' On this, 
 Tsze-kung went out and said, 'Our Master is not for him.'

 	CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'With coarse rice to eat, with 
 water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-- I have still 
 joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honours acquired 
 by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'If some years were added to 
 my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I 
 might come to be without great faults.'

 were-- the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules

 	CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about 
 Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.
 	2. The Master said, 'Why did you not say to him,-- He is 
 simply a man, who in his eager pursuit (of knowledge) forgets 
 his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, 
 and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?'
 	CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'I am not one who was born 
 in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of 
 antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.'
 	CHAP. XX. The subjects on which the Master did not talk,

 spiritual beings.

 others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their 
 good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid 
 them.'

 that is in me. Hwan T'ui-- what can he do to me?'

 that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. 
 There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my 
 disciples;-- that is my way.'

 taught,-- letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.

 see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would 
 satisfy me.'
 	2. The Master said, 'A good man it is not mine to see; 
 could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy 
 me.
 	3. 'Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet 
 affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-- 
 it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.'
 	CHAP. XXVI. The Master angled,-- but did not use a net. 
 He shot,-- but not at birds perching.
 	CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'There may be those who 
 act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and 
 selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and 
 keeping it in memory:-- this is the second style of knowledge.'

 	CHAP. XXVIII. 1. It was difficult to talk (profitably and 
 reputably) with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place 
 having had an interview with the Master, the disciples 
 doubted.
 	2. The Master said, 'I admit people's approach to me 
 without committing myself as to what they may do when they 
 have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify 
 himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without 
 guaranteeing his past conduct.'
 	CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'Is virtue a thing remote? I 
 wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.'
 	CHAP. XXX. 1. The minister of crime of Ch'an asked 
 whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, 'He 
 knew propriety.'

 ma Ch'i

 【卅二章】子曰、文、莫吾猶人
 to come forward, and said, 'I have heard that the superior man 
 is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The 
 prince married a daughter of the house of Wu, of the same 
 surname with himself, and called her,-- "The elder Tsze of Wu." 
 If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?'
 	3. Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master 
 said, 'I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to 
 know them.'
 	CHAP. XXXI. When the Master was in company with a 
 person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him 
 repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.
 	CHAP. XXXII. The Master said, 'In letters I am perhaps 
 equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, 
 carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have 
 not yet attained to.'

 	CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'The sage and the man of 
 perfect virtue;-- how dare I rank myself with them? It may 
 simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without 
 satiety, and teach others without weariness.' Kung-hsi Hwa 
 said, 'This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.'
 	CHAP. XXXIV. The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked 
 leave to pray for him. He said, 'May such a thing be done?' 
 Tsze-lu replied, 'It may. In the Eulogies it is said, "Prayer has 
 been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower 
 worlds."' The Master said, 'My praying has been for a long 
 time.'

 【卅六章】子曰、君子坦蕩蕩、小人長戚戚。
 【卅七章】子溫而厲、威而不猛、恭而安。
 	CHAP. XXXV. The Master said, 'Extravagance leads to 
 insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be 
 mean than to be insubordinate.'
 	CHAP. XXXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man is 
 satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of 
 distress.'
 	CHAP. XXXVII. The Master was mild, and yet dignified; 
 majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.
 
 泰伯第八
 BOOK VIII. T'AI-PO.
 
 【第一章】子曰、太伯其可謂至德也已矣、三以天下讓、民無得而稱焉。
 	CHAP. I. The Master said, 'T'ai-po may be said to have 
 reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined 
 the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could 
 not express their approbation of his conduct.'
 
 【第二章】【一節】子曰、恭而無禮則勞、慎而無禮則葸、勇而無禮則亂、

 【第三章】曾子有疾、召門弟子曰、啟予
 	CHAP. II. 1. The Master said, 'Respectfulness, without the 
 rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, 
 without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, 
 without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; 
 straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes 
 rudeness.
 	2. 'When those who are in high stations perform well all 
 their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. 
 When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are 
 preserved from meanness.'
 	CHAP. III. The philosopher Tsang being ill, he called to 
 him the disciples of his school, and said, 'Uncover my feet, 
 uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, "We should 
 be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, 
 as if treading on thin ice," and so have I been. Now and 
 hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person, O ye, 
 my little children.'

 	CHAP. IV. 1. The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang 
 went to ask how he was.
 	2. Tsang said to him, 'When a bird is about to die, its 
 notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are 
 good.
 	3. 'There are three principles of conduct which the man of 
 high rank should consider specially important:-- that in his 
 deportment and manner he keep from violence and 
 heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near 
 to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from 
 lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to 
 the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.'

 【第七章】【一節】曾子曰、士、不可以不弘毅、任重而道遠。【二節】仁

 	CHAP. V. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Gifted with ability, 
 and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed 
 of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; 
 having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as 
 empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; 
 formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.'
 	CHAP. VI. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Suppose that there 
 is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a 
 young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority 
 over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however 
 great can drive from his principles:-- is such a man a superior 
 man? He is a superior man indeed.'
 	CHAP. VII. 1. The philosopher Tsang said, 'The officer 
 may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. 
 His burden is heavy and his course is long.

 	2. 'Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is 
 his to sustain;-- is it not heavy? Only with death does his 
 course stop;-- is it not long?
 	CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'It is by the Odes that the 
 mind is aroused.
 	2. 'It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is 
 established.
 	3. 'It is from Music that the finish is received.'
 	CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'The people may be made to 
 follow a path of action, but they may not be made to 
 understand it.'
 	CHAP. X. The Master said, 'The man who is fond of daring 
 and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to 
 insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you 
 carry your dislike of him to an extreme.'

 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'Though a man have abilities 
 as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud 
 and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being 
 looked at.'
 	CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'It is not easy to find a man 
 who has learned for three years without coming to be good.'
 	CHAP. XIII. 1. The Master said, 'With sincere faith he 
 unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is 
 perfecting the excellence of his course.
 	2. 'Such an one will not enter a tottering State, nor dwell 
 in a disorganized one. When right principles of government 
 prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are 
 prostrated, he will keep concealed.
 	3. 'When a country is well-governed, poverty and a mean 
 condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill-
 governed, riches and honour are things to be ashamed of.'

 particular office, has nothing to do with plans for the 
 administration of its duties.'

 first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was 
 magnificent;-- how it filled the ears!'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'Ardent and yet not upright; 
 stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-- such 
 persons I do not understand.'
 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Learn as if you could not 
 reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should 
 lose it.'
 	CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'How majestic was the 
 manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as 
 if it were nothing to them!'

 	CHAP. XIX. 1. The Master said, 'Great indeed was Yao as a 
 sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is 
 grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his 
 virtue! The people could find no name for it.
 	2. 'How majestic was he in the works which he 
 accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he 
 instituted!'
 	CHAP. XX. 1. Shun had five ministers, and the empire was 
 well-governed.
 	2. King Wu said, 'I have ten able ministers.'
 	3. Confucius said, 'Is not the saying that talents are 
 difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu 
 met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there 
 was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more 
 than nine men.
 
 有婦人焉、九人而已【四節】三分天下有其二、以服事殷、周之德、其可謂

 【廿一章】子曰、禹吾無間然矣、菲飲食、而致孝乎鬼神、惡衣服、而致美

 	4. 'King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the 
 empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The 
 virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the 
 highest point indeed.'
 	CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'I can find no flaw in the 
 character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but 
 displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His 
 ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost 
 elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low mean 
 house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water-
 channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.'

 聞之、謂門弟子曰、吾何執、執御乎、執射乎、吾執御矣。
 	CHAP. I. The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke 
 were-- profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, 
 and perfect virtue.
 	CHAP. II. 1. A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, 'Great 
 indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and 
 yet he does not render his name famous by any particular 
 thing.'
 	2. The Master heard the observation, and said to his 
 disciples, 'What shall I practise? Shall I practise charioteering, 
 or shall I practise archery? I will practise charioteering.'

 	CHAP. III. 1. The Master said, 'The linen cap is that 
 prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is 
 worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.
 	2. 'The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the 
 hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That 
 is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose 
 the common practice.'
 	CHAP. IV. There were four things from which the Master 
 was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary 
 predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.
 	CHAP. V. 1. The Master was put in fear in K'wang.
 	2. He said, 'After the death of King Wan, was not the 
 cause of truth lodged here in me?
 
 天之未喪斯文也、匡人其如予何。

 故藝。
 	3. 'If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, 
 then I, a future mortal, should not have got such a relation to 
 that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, 
 what can the people of K'wang do to me?'
 	CHAP. VI. 1. A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'May 
 we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his 
 ability!'
 	2. Tsze-kung said, 'Certainly Heaven has endowed him 
 unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is 
 various.'
 	3. The Master heard of the conversation and said, 'Does 
 the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition 
 was low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, 
 but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such 
 variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability.'
 	4. Lao said, 'The Master said, "Having no official 
 employment, I acquired many arts."'

 【第九章】子見齊衰者、冕衣裳者、與瞽者、見之、雖少必作、過之必趨。
 	CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'Am I indeed possessed of 
 knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who 
 appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth 
 from one end to the other, and exhaust it.'
 	CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'The FANG bird does not 
 come; the river sends forth no map:-- it is all over with me!'
 	CHAP. IX. When the Master saw a person in a mourning 
 dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments 
 of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, 
 though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and 
 if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily.

 	CHAP. X. 1. Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's 
 doctrines, sighed and said, 'I looked up to them, and they 
 seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and 
 they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, 
 and suddenly they seemed to be behind.
 	2. 'The Master, by orderly method, skilfully leads men on. 
 He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the 
 restraints of propriety.
 	3. 'When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I 
 cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems 
 something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to 
 follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.'
 	CHAP. XI. 1. The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the 
 disciples to act as ministers to him.
 	2. During a remission of his illness, he said, 'Long has the 
 conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers 
 when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I 
 impose upon Heaven?

 	3. 'Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of 
 ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, 
 my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I 
 die upon the road?'
 	CHAP. XII. Tsze-kung said, 'There is a beautiful gem here. 
 Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a 
 good price and sell it?' The Master said, 'Sell it! Sell it! But I 
 would wait for one to offer the price.'
 	CHAP. XIII. 1. The Master was wishing to go and live 
 among the nine wild tribes of the east.
 	2. Some one said, 'They are rude. How can you do such a 
 thing?' The Master said, 'If a superior man dwelt among them, 
 what rudeness would there be?'
 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'I returned from Wei to Lu, 
 and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal 
 songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.'

 	CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Abroad, to serve the high 
 ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder 
 brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's 
 self; and not to be overcome of wine:-- which one of these 
 things do I attain to?'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master standing by a stream, said, 'It 
 passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!'
 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'I have not seen one who 
 loves virtue as he loves beauty.'
 	CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'The prosecution of 
 learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a 
 mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the 
 work, and I stop, the

 【廿二章】子曰、後生可畏、焉知來者之不如今也、四十五十而無聞焉、斯

 stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing 
 down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful 
 is thrown at a time, the advancing with it is my own going 
 forward.'
 	CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'Never flagging when I set 
 forth anything to him;-- ah! that is Hui.'
 	CHAP. XX. The Master said of Yen Yuan, 'Alas! I saw his 
 constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.'
 	CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'There are cases in which the 
 blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are 
 cases where it flowers, but no fruit is subsequently produced!'
 	CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'A youth is to be regarded 
 with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal 
 to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not 
 made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being 
 regarded with respect.'
 
 【廿三章】子曰、法語之言、能無從乎、改之為貴、巽與之言、能無說乎、

 【廿四章】子曰、主忠信、毋友不如己者、過則勿憚改。
 【廿五章】子曰、三軍可奪師也、匹夫不可奪志也。
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Can men refuse to assent to 
 the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct 
 because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be 
 pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their 
 aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, 
 but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does 
 not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.'
 	CHAP. XXIV. The Master said, 'Hold faithfulness and 
 sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to 
 yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.'
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'The commander of the 
 forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a 
 common man cannot be taken from him.'

 	CHAP. XXVI. 1. The Master said, 'Dressed himself in a 
 tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of 
 men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-- ah! it is Yu who is 
 equal to this!
 	2. '"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-- what can he do 
 but what is good!"'
 	3. Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the 
 ode, when the Master said, 'Those things are by no means 
 sufficient to constitute (perfect) excellence.'
 	CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'When the year becomes 
 cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last 
 to lose their leaves.'
 	CHAP. XXVIII. The Master said, 'The wise are free from 
 perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.'
 	CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'There are some with whom 
 we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go 
 along
 
 適道、可與適道、未可與立、可與立、未可與權。

 principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in 
 those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with 
 them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events 
 along with us.'
 	CHAP. XXX. 1. How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter 
 and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.
 	2. The Master said, 'It is the want of thought about it. 
 How is it distant?'

 respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.

 required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind

 bird.
 	4. When the guest had retired, he would report to the

 the gate-way; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon 
 the threshold.

 his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under 
 him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter 
 them.
 	4. He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe 
 with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath 
 also, as if he dared not breathe.
 	5. When he came out from the audience, as soon as he 
 had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and 
 had a satisfied look. When he had got to the bottom of the 
 steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like 
 wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful 
 uneasiness.
 	CHAP. V. 1. When he was carrying the scepter of his 
 ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to 
 bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of

 	5. On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he 
 would change countenance.
 	CHAP. XVII. 1. When he was about to mount his carriage, 
 he would stand straight, holding the cord.
 	2. When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head 
 quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his 
 hands.
 	CHAP. XVIII. 1. Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. 
 It flies round, and by and by settles.
 	2. The Master said, 'There is the hen-pheasant on the hill 
 bridge. At its season! At its season!' Tsze-lu made a motion to 
 it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.

 the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said,

 of former times.'

 There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.'
 	CHAP. IV. The Master said, 'Filial indeed is Min Tsze-
 ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the 
 report of his parents and brothers.'

 	CHAP. VI. Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to 
 learn. Confucius replied to him, 'There was Yen Hui; he loved to 
 learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. 
 Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.'
 	CHAP. VII. 1. When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the 
 carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's 
 coffin.
 	2. The Master said, 'Every one calls his son his son, 
 whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when 
 he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on 
 foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear 
 of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on 
 foot.'
 	CHAP. VIII. When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, 'Alas! 
 Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!'

 	CHAP. IX. 1. When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed 
 him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, 
 'Master, your grief is excessive?'
 	2. 'Is it excessive?' said he.
 	3. 'If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom 
 should I mourn?'
 	CHAP. X. 1. When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to 
 give him a great funeral, and the Master said, 'You may not do 
 so.'
 	2. The disciples did bury him in great style.
 	3. The Master said, 'Hui behaved towards me as his 
 father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is 
 not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.'
 	CHAP. XI. Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the 
 dead. The Master said, 'While you are not able to serve men, 
 how can you serve their spirits?' Chi Lu added, 'I venture to 
 ask about

 death?' He was answered, 'While you do not know life, how can 
 you know about death?'
 	CHAP. XII. 1. The disciple Min was standing by his side, 
 looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; 
 Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. 
 The Master was pleased.
 	2. He said, 'Yu, there!-- he will not die a natural death.'
 	CHAP. XIII. 1. Some parties in Lu were going to take 
 down and rebuild the Long Treasury.
 	2. Min Tsze-ch'ien said, 'Suppose it were to be repaired

 	3. The Master said, 'This man seldom speaks; when he 
 does, he is sure to hit the point.'

 	CHAP. XIV. 1. The Master said, 'What has the lute of Yu to 
 do in my door?'
 	2. The other disciples began not to respect Tsze-lu. The 
 Master said, 'Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet 
 passed into the inner apartments.'
 	CHAP. XV. 1. Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or 
 Shang, was the superior. The Master said, 'Shih goes beyond the 
 due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.'
 	2. 'Then,' said Tsze-kung, 'the superiority is with Shih, I 
 suppose.'
 	3. The Master said, 'To go beyond is as wrong as to fall 
 short.'
 	CHAP. XVI. 1. The head of the Chi family was richer than 
 the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts 
 for him, and increased his wealth.

 	2. The Master said, 'He is no disciple of mine. My little 
 children, beat the drum and assail him.'
 	CHAP. XVII. 1. Ch'ai is simple.
 	2. Shan is dull.
 	3. Shih is specious.
 	4. Yu is coarse.
 	CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Master said, 'There is Hui! He has 
 nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.
 	2. 'Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of 
 Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments 
 are often correct.'

 the GOOD man. The Master said, 'He does not tread in the 
 footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the 
 chamber of the sage.'
 	CHAP. XX. The Master said, 'If, because a man's discourse 
 appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he 
 really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?'
 	CHAP. XXI. Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately 
 carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, 'There are 
 your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-- why should 
 you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice 
 what you hear?' Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should 
 immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master 
 answered, 'Immediately carry into practice what you hear.' 
 Kung-hsi Hwa said, 'Yu asked whether he should carry 
 immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, "There 
 are your father and elder brothers to be consulted." Ch'iu asked 
 whether he should immediately carry into practice what he 
 heard, and you said, "Carry it immediately into practice." I, 
 Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.' 
 The Master said, 'Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore,

 I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of 
 energy; therefore I kept him back.'
 	CHAP. XXII. The Master was put in fear in K'wang and 
 Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, 'I 
 thought you had died.' Hui replied, 'While you were alive, how 
 should I presume to die?'
 	CHAP. XXIII. 1. Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and 
 Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.
 	2. The Master said, 'I thought you would ask about some 
 extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!
 	3. 'What is called a great minister, is one who serves his 
 prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot 
 do so, retires.

 	4. 'Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary 
 ministers.'
 	5. Tsze-zan said, 'Then they will always follow their 
 chief;-- will they?'
 	6. The Master said, 'In an act of parricide or regicide, they 
 would not follow him.'
 	CHAP. XXIV. 1. Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor 
 of Pi.
 	2. The Master said, 'You are injuring a man's son.'
 	3. Tsze-lu said, 'There are (there) common people and 
 officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. 
 Why must one read books before he can be considered to have 
 learned?'
 	4. The Master said, 'It is on this account that I hate your 
 glib-tongued people.'
 	CHAP. XXV. 1. Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kung-hsi 
 Hwa were sitting by the Master.
 	2. He said to them, 'Though I am a day or so older than 
 you, do not think of that.

 樂、以
 	3. 'From day to day you are saying, "We are not known." 
 If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?'
 	4. Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, 'Suppose the case of 
 a State of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between 
 other large States; let it be suffering from invading armies; and 
 to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all 
 vegetables:-- if I were intrusted with the government of it, in 
 three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to 
 recognise the rules of righteous conduct.' The Master smiled at 
 him.
 	5. Turning to Yen Yu, he said, 'Ch'iu, what are your 
 wishes?' Ch'iu replied, 'Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li 
 square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government 
 of it;-- in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound 
 among the people. As to teaching them the principles of 
 propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man 
 to do that.'

 	6. 'What are your wishes, Ch'ih,' said the Master next to 
 Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, 'I do not say that my ability 
 extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the 
 services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the 
 princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark 
 square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small 
 assistant.'
 	7. Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, 'Tien, what are 
 your wishes?' Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while 
 it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and rose. 'My 
 wishes,' he said, 'are different from the cherished purposes of 
 these three gentlemen.' 'What harm is there in that?' said the 
 Master; 'do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.' 
 Tien then said, 'In this, the last month of spring, with the dress 
 of the season all complete, along with five or six young men 
 who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would 
 wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and 
 return home singing.' The Master heaved a sigh and said, 'I 
 give my approval to Tien.'

 	8. The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained 
 behind, and said, 'What do you think of the words of these 
 three friends?' The Master replied, 'They simply told each one 
 his wishes.'
 	9. Hsi pursued, 'Master, why did you smile at Yu?'
 	10. He was answered, 'The management of a State 
 demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; 
 therefore I smiled at him.'
 	11. Hsi again said, 'But was it not a State which Ch'iu 
 proposed for himself?' The reply was, 'Yes; did you ever see a 
 territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which 
 was not a State?'
 	12. Once more, Hsi inquired, 'And was it not a State which 
 Ch'ih proposed for himself?' The Master again replied, 'Yes; who 
 but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with 
 audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small 
 assistant in these services, who could be a great one?

 勿視、非禮勿聽、非禮勿言、非禮勿動。顏淵曰、回雖不敏、請事斯語矣。
 	CHAP. I. 1. Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The 
 Master said, 'To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is 
 perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and 
 return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue 
 to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or 
 is it from others?'
 	2. Yen Yuan said, 'I beg to ask the steps of that process.' 
 The Master replied, 'Look not at what is contrary to propriety; 
 listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is 
 contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to 
 propriety.' Yen Yuan then said, 'Though I am deficient in 
 intelligence and vigour, I will make it my business to practise 
 this lesson.'
 
 【第二章】仲弓問仁。子曰、出門如見大賓、使民如承大祭、己所不欲、勿

 【第三章】【一節】司馬牛問仁。【二節】子曰、仁者其言
 	CHAP. II. Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The 
 Master said, 'It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one 
 as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as 
 if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as 
 you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring 
 against you in the country, and none in the family.' Chung-kung 
 said, 'Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will 
 make it my business to practise this lesson.'
 	CHAP. III. 1. Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue.
 	2. The Master said, 'The man of perfect virtue is cautious 
 and slow in his speech.'

 	3. 'Cautious and slow in his speech!' said Niu;-- 'is this 
 what is meant by perfect virtue?' The Master said, 'When a 
 man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious 
 and slow in speaking?'
 	CHAP. IV. 1. Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. 
 The Master said, 'The superior man has neither anxiety nor 
 fear.'
 	2. 'Being without anxiety or fear!' said Nui;-- 'does this 
 constitute what we call the superior man?'
 	3. The Master said, 'When internal examination discovers 
 nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there 
 to fear?'
 	CHAP. V. 1. Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, 'Other men 
 all have their brothers, I only have not.'
 	2. Tsze-hsia said to him, 'There is the following saying 
 which I have heard:--
 
 曰、商聞之矣。【三節】死生有命、富貴在天。【四節】君子敬而無失、與
 人恭而有禮、四海之內、皆兄弟也、君子何患乎無兄弟也。
 【第六章】子張問明。子曰、浸潤之譖、膚受之愬、不行焉、可謂明也已矣、
 浸潤之譖、膚受之愬、不行焉、可謂遠也已矣。
 	3. '"Death and life have their determined appointment; 
 riches and honours depend upon Heaven."
 	4. 'Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order 
 his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and 
 observant of propriety:-- then all within the four seas will be 
 his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being 
 distressed because he has no brothers?'
 	CHAP. VI. Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. 
 The Master said, 'He with whom neither slander that gradually 
 soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in 
 the flesh, are successful, may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, 
 he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling 
 statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.'

 【第八章】【一節】棘子成曰、君子質而已矣、何以文為。【二節】子
 	CHAP. VII. 1. Tsze-kung asked about government. The 
 Master said, 'The requisites of government are that there be 
 sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the 
 confidence of the people in their ruler.'
 	2. Tsze-kung said, 'If it cannot be helped, and one of 
 these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be 
 foregone first?' 'The military equipment,' said the Master.
 	3. Tsze-kung again asked, 'If it cannot be helped, and one 
 of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them 
 should be foregone?' The Master answered, 'Part with the food. 
 From of old, death has been the lot of all men; but if the people 
 have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.'
 	CHAP. VIII. 1. Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, 'In a superior man it 
 is only the substantial qualities which are wanted;-- why 
 should we seek for ornamental accomplishments?'
 
 貢曰、惜乎夫子之說、君子也、駟不及舌。【三節】文猶質也、質猶文也、

 	2. Tsze-kung said, 'Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a 
 superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue.
 	3. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. 
 The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the 
 hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.'
 	CHAP. IX. 1. The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, 'The 
 year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not 
 sufficient;-- what is to be done?'
 	2. Yu Zo replied to him, 'Why not simply tithe the 
 people?'
 	3. 'With two tenths, said the duke, 'I find it not enough;-- 
 how could I do with that system of one tenth?'
 	4. Yu Zo answered, 'If the people have plenty, their prince 
 will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their 
 prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.'

 	CHAP. X. 1. Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to 
 be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, 
 'Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be 
 moving continually to what is right;-- this is the way to exalt 
 one's virtue.
 	2. 'You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and 
 wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him 
 to die. This is a case of delusion.
 	3. '"It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you 
 come to make a difference."'
 	CHAP. XI. 1. The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius 
 about government.
 	2. Confucius replied, 'There is government, when the 
 prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father 
 is father, and the son is son.'
 	3. 'Good!' said the duke; 'if, indeed; the prince be not 
 prince, the minister not minister, the father not father, and the 
 son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?'

 	CHAP. XII. 1. The Master said, 'Ah! it is Yu, who could 
 with half a word settle litigations!'
 	2. Tsze-lu never slept over a promise.
 	CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'In hearing litigations, I am 
 like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause 
 the people to have no litigations.'
 	CHAP. XIV. Tsze-chang asked about government. The 
 Master said, 'The art of governing is to keep its affairs before 
 the mind without weariness, and to practise them with 
 undeviating consistency.'
 	CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'By extensively studying all 
 learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules 
 of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.'

 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'The superior man seeks to 
 perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to 
 perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of 
 this.'
 	CHAP. XVII. Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. 
 Confucius replied, 'To govern means to rectify. If you lead on 
 the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?'
 	CHAP. XVIII. Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of 
 thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with 
 them. Confucius said, 'If you, sir, were not covetous, although 
 you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.'
 	CHAP. XIX. Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, 
 saying, 'What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the 
 good of the principled?' Confucius replied, 'Sir, in carrying on 
 your government, why should you use killing at all? Let your 
 evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be 
 good. The relation

 and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows

 	CHAP. XX. 1. Tsze-chang asked, 'What must the officer be, 
 who may be said to be distinguished?'
 	2. The Master said, 'What is it you call being 
 distinguished?'
 	3. Tsze-chang replied, 'It is to be heard of through the 
 State, to be heard of throughout his clan.'
 	4. The Master said, 'That is notoriety, not distinction.
 	5. 'Now the man of distinction is solid and 
 straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's 
 words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble 
 himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the 
 country; he will be distinguished in his clan.
 	6. 'As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance 
 of

 virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this 
 character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be 
 heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.'
 	CHAP. XXI. 1. Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under 
 the trees about the rain altars, said, 'I venture to ask how to 
 exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover 
 delusions.'
 	2. The Master said, 'Truly a good question!
 	3. 'If doing what is to be done be made the first business, 
 and success a secondary consideration;-- is not this the way to 
 exalt virtue? To assail one's own wickedness and not assail that 
 of others;-- is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a 
 morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of 
 his parents;-- is not this a case of delusion?'
 	CHAP. XXII. 1. Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The 
 Master said, 'It is to love all men.' He asked about knowledge. 
 The Master said, 'It is to know all men.'

 	2. Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these 
 answers.
 	3. The Master said, 'Employ the upright and put aside all 
 the crooked;-- in this way the crooked can be made to be 
 upright.'
 	4. Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, 
 'A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and 
 asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and 
 put aside all the crooked;-- in this way, the crooked will be 
 made to be upright.' What did he mean?'
 	5. Tsze-hsia said, 'Truly rich is his saying!
 	6. 'Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected 
 from among all the people, and employed Kao-yao, on which all 
 who were devoid of virtue disappeared. T'ang, being in 
 possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, 
 and employed I Yin, and all who were devoid of virtue 
 disappeared.'
 	CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The 
 Master said, 'Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully 
 lead him on. If you find him impracticable, stop. Do not 
 disgrace yourself.'

 friendship helps his virtue.'

 	CHAP. I. 1. Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master 
 said, 'Go before the people with your example, and be laborious 
 in their affairs.'
 	2. He requested further instruction, and was answered, 
 'Be not weary (in these things).'
 	CHAP. II. 1. Chung-kung, being chief minister to the Head 
 of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, 
 'Employ

 first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, 
 and raise to office men of virtue and talents.'
 	2. Chung-kung said, 'How shall I know the men of virtue 
 and talent, so that I may raise them to office?' He was 
 answered, 'Raise to office those whom you know. As to those 
 whom you do not know, will others neglect them?'
 	CHAP. III. 1. Tsze-lu said, 'The ruler of Wei has been 
 waiting for you, in order with you to administer the 
 government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?'
 	2. The Master replied, 'What is necessary is to rectify 
 names.'
 	3. 'So, indeed!' said Tsze-lu. 'You are wide of the mark! 
 Why must there be such rectification?'
 	4. The Master said, 'How uncultivated you are, Yu! A 
 superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a 
 cautious reserve.
 	5. 'If names be not correct, language is not in accordance 
 with

 【第四章】【一節】樊遲請學稼。子曰、吾不如老農。請學為圃。曰、
 the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the 
 truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.
 	6. 'When affairs cannot be carried on to success, 
 proprieties and music will not flourish. When proprieties and 
 music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly 
 awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the 
 people do not know how to move hand or foot.
 	7. 'Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that 
 the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that 
 what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the 
 superior man requires, is just that in his words there may be 
 nothing incorrect.'
 	CHAP. IV. 1. Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. 
 The Master said, 'I am not so good for that as an old 
 husbandman.' He

 requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, 'I am 
 not so good for that as an old gardener.'
 	2. Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, 'A small 
 man, indeed, is Fan Hsu!
 	3. If a superior love propriety, the people will not dare 
 not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not 
 dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the 
 people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things 
 obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing 
 their children on their backs;-- what need has he of a 
 knowledge of husbandry?'
 	CHAP. V. The Master said, 'Though a man may be able to 
 recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a 
 governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent 
 to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies 
 unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what 
 practical use is it?'

 	CHAP. VI. The Master said, 'When a prince's personal 
 conduct is correct, his government is effective without the 
 issuing of orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may 
 issue orders, but they will not be followed.'
 	CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'The governments of Lu and 
 Wei are brothers.'
 	CHAP. VIII. The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal 
 family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. 
 When he began to have means, he said, 'Ha! here is a 
 collection!' When they were a little increased, he said, 'Ha! this 
 is complete!' When he had become rich, he said, 'Ha! this is 
 admirable!'
 	CHAP. IX. 1. When the Master went to Wei, Zan Yu acted 
 as driver of his carriage.
 	2. The Master observed, 'How numerous are the people!'
 	3. Yu said, 'Since they are thus numerous, what more 
 shall be done for them?' 'Enrich them,' was the reply.

 	4. 'And when they have been enriched, what more shall 
 be done?' The Master said, 'Teach them.'
 	CHAP. X. The Master said, 'If there were (any of the 
 princes) who would employ me, in the course of twelve 
 months, I should have done something considerable. In three 
 years, the government would be perfected.'
 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, '"If good men were to govern a 
 country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able 
 to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital 
 punishments." True indeed is this saying!'
 	CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'If a truly royal ruler were to 
 arise, it would still require a generation, and then virtue would 
 prevail.'

 	CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'If a minister make his own 
 conduct correct, what difficulty will he have in assisting in 
 government? If he cannot rectify himself, what has he to do 
 with rectifying others?'
 	CHAP. XIV. The disciple Zan returning from the court, the 
 Master said to him, 'How are you so late?' He replied, 'We had 
 government business.' The Master said, 'It must have been 
 family affairs. If there had been government business, though I 
 am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.'
 	CHAP. XV. 1. The Duke Ting asked whether there was a 
 single sentence which could make a country prosperous. 
 Confucius replied, 'Such an effect cannot be expected from one 
 sentence.

 	2. 'There is a saying, however, which people have-- "To 
 be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy."
 	3. 'If a ruler knows this,-- the difficulty of being a 
 prince,-- may there not be expected from this one sentence the 
 prosperity of his country?'
 	4. The duke then said, 'Is there a single sentence which 
 can ruin a country?' Confucius replied, 'Such an effect as that 
 cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the 
 saying which people have-- "I have no pleasure in being a 
 prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what 
 I say!"
 	5. 'If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no 
 one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes 
 them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the 
 ruin of his country?'
 	CHAP. XVI. 1. The Duke of Sheh asked about government.
 	2. The Master said, 'Good government obtains, when those 
 who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are 
 attracted.'

 【二節】孔子曰、吾黨之直者異於是、父為子隱、子為父隱、直在其中矣。
 	CHAP. XVII. Tsze-hsia, being governor of Chu-fu, asked 
 about government. The Master said, 'Do not be desirous to have 
 things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to 
 have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. 
 Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being 
 accomplished.'
 	CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, 
 saying, 'Among us here there are those who may be styled 
 upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, 
 they will bear witness to the fact.'
 	2. Confucius said, 'Among us, in our part of the country, 
 those who are upright are different from this. The father 
 conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the 
 misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.'

 	CHAP. XIX. Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The 
 Master said, 'It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the 
 management of business, to be reverently attentive; in 
 intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere. Though a man go 
 among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be 
 neglected.'
 	CHAP. XX. 1. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'What qualities 
 must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The 
 Master said, 'He who in his conduct of himself maintains a 
 sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace 
 his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.'
 	3. Tsze-kung pursued, 'I venture to ask who may be 
 placed in the next lower rank?' And he was told, 'He whom the 
 circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow-
 villagers and neighbours pronounce to be fraternal.'
 	3. Again the disciple asked, 'I venture to ask about the 
 class still next in order.' The Master said, 'They are determined 
 to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. 
 They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the 
 next class.'

 【廿二章】【一節】子曰、南人有言曰、人而無恆、不可以作巫醫、善夫。
 【二節】不恆其德、或承之
 	4. Tsze-kung finally inquired, 'Of what sort are those of 
 the present day, who engage in government?' The Master said 
 'Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being 
 taken into account.'
 	CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'Since I cannot get men 
 pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my 
 instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. 
 The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-
 decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.'
 	CHAP. XXII. 1. The Master said, 'The people of the south 
 have a saying-- "A man without constancy cannot be either a 
 wizard or a doctor." Good!
 	2. 'Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with 
 disgrace.'

 	3. The Master said, 'This arises simply from not attending 
 to the prognostication.'
 	CHAP. XXIII. The Master said, 'The superior man is 
 affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not 
 affable.'
 	CHAP. XXIV. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'What do you say 
 of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?' 
 The Master replied, 'We may not for that accord our approval 
 of him.' 'And what do you say of him who is hated by all the 
 people of his neighborhood?' The Master said, 'We may not for 
 that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these 
 cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad 
 hate him.'
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'The superior man is easy to 
 serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any 
 way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. 
 But in his

 employment of men, he uses them according to their capacity. 
 The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you 
 try to please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant 
 with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, 
 he wishes them to be equal to everything.'
 	CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man has a 
 dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without 
 a dignified ease.'
 	CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'The firm, the enduring, 
 the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.'
 	CHAP. XXVIII. Tsze-lu asked, saying, 'What qualities must 
 a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?' The Master 
 said, 'He must be thus,-- earnest, urgent, and bland:-- among 
 his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren, bland.'

 	CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'Let a good man teach the 
 people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed 
 in war.'
 	CHAP. XXX. The Master said, 'To lead an uninstructed 
 people to war, is to throw them away.'

 【第一章】憲問恥。子曰、邦有道穀、邦無道穀、恥也。
 	CHAP. I. Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master 
 said, 'When good government prevails in a state, to be thinking 
 only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be 
 thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-- this is shameful.'

 	CHAP. II. 1. 'When the love of superiority, boasting, 
 resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be 
 deemed perfect virtue.'
 	2. The Master said, 'This may be regarded as the 
 achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to 
 be deemed perfect virtue.'
 	CHAP. III. The Master said, 'The scholar who cherishes 
 the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.'
 	CHAP. IV. The Master said, 'When good government 
 prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions 
 the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be 
 lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.'
 	CHAP. V. The Master said, 'The virtuous will be sure to 
 speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not 
 always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but 
 those who are bold may not always be men of principle.'

 	CHAP. VI. Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to 
 Confucius, said, 'I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a 
 boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural 
 death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, 
 and they became possessors of the kingdom.' The Master made 
 no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, 'A 
 superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is 
 this!'
 	CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'Superior men, and yet not 
 always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has 
 been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.'

 	CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'Can there be love which 
 does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty 
 which does not lead to the instruction of its object?'
 	CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'In preparing the 
 governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough 
 draught; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, 
 the manager of Foreign intercourse, then polished the style; 
 and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance 
 and finish.'
 	CHAP. X. 1. Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master 
 said, 'He was a kind man.'
 	2. He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, 'That man! 
 That man!'
 	3. He asked about Kwan Chung. 'For him,' said the Master, 
 'the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from 
 the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring 
 word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to 
 eat.'

 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'To be poor without 
 murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.'
 	CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'Mang Kung-ch'o is more than 
 fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is 
 not fit to be great officer to either of the States Tang or Hsieh.'
 	CHAP. XIII. 1. Tsze-lu asked what constituted a 
 COMPLETE man. The Master said, 'Suppose a man with the 
 knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness 
 of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied 
 talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the 
 rules of propriety and music:-- such a one might be reckoned a 
 COMPLETE man.'
 	2. He then added, 'But what is the necessity for a 
 complete man of the present day to have all these things? The 
 man, who in the

 	CHAP. XIV. 1. The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about 
 Kung-shu Wan, saying, 'Is it true that your master speaks not, 
 laughs not, and takes not?'
 	2. Kung-ming Chia replied, 'This has arisen from the 
 reporters going beyond the truth.-- My master speaks when it 
 is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his 
 speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so 
 men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is 
 consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get 
 tired of his taking.' The Master said, 'So! But is it so with him?'

 	CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Tsang Wu-chung, keeping 
 possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a 
 successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he 
 was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.'

 crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and 
 not crafty.'
 	CHAP. XVII. 1. Tsze-lu said, 'The Duke Hwan caused his 
 brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died with his master, 
 but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting 
 in virtue?'

 	2. The Master said, 'The Duke Hwan assembled all the 
 princes together, and that not with weapons of war and 
 chariots:-- it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. 
 Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like 
 his?'
 	CHAP. XVIII. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Kwan Chung, I 
 apprehend, was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan 
 caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able 
 to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.'
 	2. The Master said, 'Kwan Chung acted as prime minister 
 to the Duke Hwan, made him leader of all the princes, and 
 united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present 
 day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for 
 Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and 
 the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side.

 	CHAP. XIX. 1. The great officer, Hsien, who had been 
 family-minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's

 considered WAN (the accomplished).'
 	CHAP. XX. 1. The Master was speaking about the 
 unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Wei, when Ch'i K'ang 
 said, 'Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose 
 his State?'
 	2. Confucius said, 'The Chung-shu Yu has the 
 superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o,

 duke Ai, saying, 'Chan Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that

 of it.'
 	4. Confucius retired, and said, 'Following in the rear of the 
 great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter, 
 and my prince says, "Inform the chiefs of the three families of 
 it."'

 superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is 
 downwards.'
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'In ancient times, men

 inquiries to Confucius.

 messenger indeed!'

 men together. The Master said, 'Tsze must have reached a high 
 pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.'
 	CHAP. XXXII. The Master said, 'I will not be concerned at 
 men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of 
 ability.'
 	CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'He who does not 
 anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his 
 not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily 
 (when they occur);-- is he not a man of superior worth?'
 	CHAP. XXXIV. 1. Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, 'Ch'iu, 
 how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an 
 insinuating talker?'
 	2. Confucius said, 'I do not dare to play the part of such a 
 talker, but I hate obstinacy.'

 because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.'
 	CHAP. XXXVI. 1. Some one said, 'What do you say 
 concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed 
 with kindness?'
 	2. The Master said, 'With what then will you recompense 
 kindness?
 	3. 'Recompense injury with justice, and recompense 
 kindness with kindness.'
 	CHAP. XXXVII. 1. The Master said, 'Alas! there is no one 
 that knows me.'
 	2. Tsze-kung said, 'What do you mean by thus saying-- 
 that no one knows you?' The Master replied, 'I do not murmur 
 against

 	CHAP. XXXVIII. 1. The Kung-po Liao, having slandered 
 Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, 
 saying, 'Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po 
 Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and 
 expose his corpse in the market and in the court.'
 	2. The Master said, 'If my principles are to advance, it is 
 so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. 
 What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is 
 concerned?'

 other, 'who knows the impracticable nature of the times and 
 yet will be doing in them.'
 	CHAP. XLII. 1. The Master was playing, one day, on a 
 musical stone in Wei, when a man, carrying a straw basket, 
 passed the door

 of the house where Confucius was, and said, 'His heart is full 
 who so beats the musical stone.'
 	2. A little while after, he added, 'How contemptible is the 
 one-ideaed obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken 
 no notice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for 
 public employment. "Deep water must be crossed with the 
 clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held 
 up."'
 	3. The Master said, 'How determined is he in his purpose! 
 But this is not difficult!'
 	CHAP. XLIII. 1. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant when the 
 Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial 
 mourning, was for three years without speaking?'
 	2. The Master said, 'Why must Kao-tsung be referred to 
 as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the 
 sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, 
 taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.'

 	CHAP. XLIV. The Master said, 'When rulers love to 
 observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to 
 the calls on them for service.'
 	CHAP. XLV. Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior 
 man. The Master said, 'The cultivation of himself in reverential 
 carefulness.' 'And is this all?' said Tsze-lu. 'He cultivates 
 himself so as to give rest to others,' was the reply. 'And is this 
 all?' again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, 'He cultivates 
 himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself 
 so as to give rest to all the people:-- even Yao and Shun were 
 still solicitous about this.'
 	CHAP. XLVI. Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and

 so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, 'In 
 youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing 
 worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-- this is 
 to be a pest.' With this he hit him on the shank with his staff.
 	CHAP. XLVI. 1. A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was 
 employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and 
 his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, 'I suppose he 
 has made great progress.'
 	2. The Master said, 'I observe that he is fond of occupying 
 the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder 
 to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to 
 make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.'

 	CHAP. I. 1. The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about 
 tactics. Confucius replied, 'I have heard all about sacrificial 
 vessels, but I have not learned military matters.' On this, he 
 took his departure the next day.
 	2. When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, 
 and his followers became so ill that they were unable to rise.
 	3. Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, 'Has the 
 superior man likewise to endure in this way?' The Master said, 
 'The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the 
 mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.'

 	CHAP. II. 1. The Master said, 'Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, 
 that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in 
 memory?'
 	2. Tsze-kung replied, 'Yes,-- but perhaps it is not so?'
 	3. 'No,' was the answer; 'I seek a unity all-pervading.'
 	CHAP. III. The Master said, 'Yu, those who know virtue 
 are few.'
 	CHAP. IV. The Master said, 'May not Shun be instanced as 
 having governed efficiently without exertion? What did he do? 
 He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal 
 seat.'
 	CHAP. V. 1. Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct 
 himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated.
 	2. The Master said, 'Let his words be sincere and truthful, 
 and his actions honourable and careful;-- such conduct may be 
 practised among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If 
 his words be

 not sincere and truthful and his actions not honourable and 
 careful, will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his 
 neighborhood?
 	3. 'When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it 
 were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them 
 attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them 
 into practice.'
 	4. Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash.
 	CHAP. VI. 1. The Master said, 'Truly straightforward was 
 the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his 
 State, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, 
 he was like an arrow.
 	2. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good 
 government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. 
 When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, 
 and keep them in his breast.'

 	CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'When a man may be spoken 
 with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. 
 When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err 
 in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to 
 their man nor to their words.'
 	CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'The determined scholar and 
 the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of 
 injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to 
 preserve their virtue complete.'
 	CHAP. IX. Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. 
 The Master said, 'The mechanic, who wishes to do his work 
 well, must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any 
 state, take service with the most worthy among its great 
 officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its 
 scholars.'
 	CHAP. X. 1. Yen Yuan asked how the government of a 
 country should be administered.

 	5. 'Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes.
 	6. Banish the songs of Chang, and keep far from specious 
 talkers. The songs of Chang are licentious; specious talkers are 
 dangerous.'
 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'If a man take no thought 
 about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.'
 	CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'It is all over! I have not seen 
 one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.'

 of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand 
 with him in court.'
 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'He who requires much from 
 himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the 
 object of resentment.'
 	CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'When a man is not in the 
 habit of saying-- "What shall I think of this? What shall I think 
 of this?" I can indeed do nothing with him!'
 	CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'When a number of people 
 are together, for a whole day, without their conversation 
 turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying 
 out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-- theirs is indeed a 
 hard case.'
 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'The superior man in 
 everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs 
 it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in 
 humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a 
 superior man.'

 distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's 
 not knowing him.'
 	CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'The superior man dislikes 
 the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.'
 	CHAP. XX. The Master said, 'What the superior man seeks, 
 is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.'
 	CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'The superior man is 
 dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a 
 partizan.'
 	CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'The superior man does not 
 promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put 
 aside good words because of the man.'

 	CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'Is there one word 
 which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?' The 
 Master said, 'Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not 
 want done to yourself, do not do to others.'
 	CHAP. XXIV. 1. The Master said, 'In my dealings with 
 men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, 
 beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, 
 there must be ground for it in my examination of the 
 individual.
 	2. 'This people supplied the ground why the three 
 dynasties pursued the path of straightforwardness.'
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Even in my early days, a 
 historiographer would leave a blank in his text, and he who 
 had a horse would lend him to another to ride. Now, alas! there 
 are no such things.'

 	CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'Specious words confound 
 virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great 
 plans.'
 	CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'When the multitude hate 
 a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the 
 multitude like a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.'
 	CHAP. XXVIII. The Master said, 'A man can enlarge the 
 principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the 
 man.'
 	CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'To have faults and not to 
 reform them,-- this, indeed, should be pronounced having 
 faults.'
 	CHAP. XXX. The Master said, 'I have been the whole day
 
 不食、終夜不寢、以思、無益、不如學也。

 without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-- 
 occupied with thinking. It was of no use. The better plan is to 
 learn.'
 	CHAP. XXXI. The Master said, 'The object of the superior 
 man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-- even in 
 that there is sometimes want. So with learning;-- emolument 
 may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should 
 not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon 
 him.'
 	CHAP. XXXII. 1. The Master said, 'When a man's 
 knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient 
 to enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will 
 lose again.
 	2. 'When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has 
 virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the 
 people will not respect him.
 	3. 'When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has 
 virtue enough to hold fast; when he governs also with dignity, 
 yet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of 
 propriety:-- full excellence is not reached.'

 	CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'The superior man cannot 
 be known in little matters; but he may be intrusted with great 
 concerns. The small man may not be intrusted with great 
 concerns, but he may be known in little matters.'
 	CHAP. XXXIV. The Master said, 'Virtue is more to man 
 than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on 
 water and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading 
 the course of virtue.'
 	CHAP. XXXV. The Master said, 'Let every man consider 
 virtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the 
 performance of it even to his teacher.'

 	CHAP. XXXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man is 
 correctly firm, and not firm merely.'
 	CHAP. XXXVII. The Master said, 'A minister, in serving his 
 prince, reverently discharges his duties, and makes his 
 emolument a secondary consideration.'
 	CHAP. XXXVIII. The Master said, 'In teaching there 
 should be no distinction of classes.'
 	CHAP. XXXIX. The Master said, 'Those whose courses are 
 different cannot lay plans for one another.'
 	CHAP. XL. The Master said, 'In language it is simply 
 required that it convey the meaning.'
 	CHAP. XLI. 1. The Music-master, Mien, having called upon 
 him, when they came to the steps, the Master said, 'Here are 
 the steps.' When they came to the mat for the guest to sit upon, 
 he

 said, 'Here is the mat.' When all were seated, the Master 
 informed him, saying, 'So and so is here; so and so is here.'
 	2. The Music-master, Mien, having gone out, Tsze-chang 
 asked, saying. 'Is it the rule to tell those things to the Music-
 master?' 
 	3. The Master said, 'Yes. This is certainly the rule for 
 those who lead the blind.'
 
 李氏第十六
 BOOK XVI. KE SHE.
 
 【第一章】【一節】李氏將伐顓臾。【二節】冉有李路見於孔子曰、李氏將
 有事於顓臾。
 	CHAP. I. 1. The head of the Chi family was going to attack 
 Chwan-yu.
 	2. Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and 
 said, 'Our chief, Chi, is going to commence operations against 
 Chwan-yu.'
 
 【三節】孔子曰、求、無乃爾是過與。【四節】夫顓臾、昔者、先王以為東
 蒙主、且在邦域之中矣、是社稷之臣也、何以伐為。【五節】冉有曰、夫子
 欲之、吾二臣者、皆不欲也。【六節】孔子曰、求、周任有言曰、陳力就列、
 不能者止、危而不持、顛而不扶、則將焉用彼相矣。【七節】且爾言過矣、
 虎兕出於柙、龜玉毀於
 	3. Confucius said, 'Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault 
 here?
 	4. 'Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king 
 appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern 
 Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; 
 and its ruler is a minister in direct connexion with the 
 sovereign:-- What has your chief to do with attacking it?'
 	5. Zan Yu said, 'Our master wishes the thing; neither of us 
 two ministers wishes it.'
 	6. Confucius said, 'Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau 
 Zan,-- "When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in 
 the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he 
 retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, 
 who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up 
 when fallen?"
 	7. 'And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or 
 rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of 
 jade is injured in its repository:-- whose is the fault?'
 
 櫝中、是誰之過與。【八節】冉有曰、今夫顓臾、固而近於費、今不取、後
 世必為子孫憂。【九節】孔子曰、求、君子疾夫舍曰欲之、而必為之辭。【十
 節】丘也、聞有國有家者、不患寡、而患不均、不患貧、而患不安、蓋均無
 貧、和無寡、安無傾。【十一節】夫如
 	8. Zan Yu said, 'But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and 
 near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a 
 sorrow to his descendants.'
 	9. Confucius said. 'Ch'iu, the superior man hates that 
 declining to say-- "I want such and such a thing," and framing 
 explanations for the conduct.
 	10. 'I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of 
 families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but 
 are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that 
 they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled 
 with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in 
 their several places. For when the people keep their several 
 places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there 
 will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a 
 contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.
 	11. 'So it is.-- Therefore, if remoter people are not 
 submissive, all
 
 是、故遠人不服、則修文德以來之、既來之、則安之。【十二節】今由與求
 也、相夫子、遠人不服、而不能來也、邦分崩離析、而不能守也。【十三節】

 the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to 
 attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, 
 they must be made contented and tranquil.
 	12. 'Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. 
 Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he 
 cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are 
 divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with 
 your help, he cannot preserve it.
 	13. 'And yet he is planning these hostile movements 
 within the State.-- I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun 
 family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found 
 within the screen of their own court.'
 
 【第二章】【一節】孔子曰、天下有道、則禮樂征伐、自天子出、天下無道、
 則禮樂征伐、自諸侯出、自諸侯出、蓋十世希不失矣、自大夫出、五世希不
 失矣、陪臣執國命、三世希不失矣。【二節】天下有道、則政不在大夫。【三
 節】天下有道、則庶人不議。
 	CHAP. II. 1. Confucius said, 'When good government 
 prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive 
 military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When 
 bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and 
 punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When 
 these things proceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will 
 be few in which they do not lose their power in ten 
 generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the 
 princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not 
 lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary 
 ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of 
 the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not 
 lose their power in three generations.
 	2. 'When right principles prevail in the kingdom, 
 government will not be in the hands of the Great officers.
 	3. 'When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there 
 will be no discussions among the common people.'
 
 【第三章】孔子曰、祿之去公室、五世矣、政逮於大夫、四世矣、故夫三桓
 之子孫微矣。
 【第四章】孔子曰、益者三友、損者三友、友直、友諒、友多聞、益矣、友
 便辟、友善柔、友便佞、損矣。
 【第五章】孔子曰、益者三樂、損者三樂、樂節禮樂、
 	CHAP. III. Confucius said, 'The revenue of the state has 
 left the ducal House now for five generations. The government 
 has been in the hands of the Great officers for four generations. 
 On this account, the descendants of the three Hwan are much 
 reduced.'
 	CHAP. IV. Confucius said, 'There are three friendships 
 which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. 
 Friendship with the upright; friendship with the sincere; and 
 friendship with the man of much observation:-- these are 
 advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; 
 friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the 
 glib-tongued:-- these are injurious.'
 	CHAP. V. Confucius said, 'There are three things men find 
 enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they 
 find enjoyment in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the 
 discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find 
 enjoyment in
 
 樂道人之善、樂多賢友、益矣。樂驕樂、樂佚遊、樂宴樂、損矣。
 【第六章】孔子曰、侍於君子有三愆、言未及之而言、謂之躁、言及之而不
 言、謂之隱、未見顏色而言、謂之瞽。
 【第七章】孔子曰、君子有三戒、少之時、血氣未定、戒之
 speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having 
 many worthy friends:-- these are advantageous. To find 
 enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in 
 idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of 
 feasting:-- these are injurious.'
 	CHAP. VI. Confucius said, 'There are three errors to which 
 they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station 
 are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to 
 speak;-- this is called rashness. They may not speak when it 
 comes to them to speak;-- this is called concealment. They may 
 speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-- 
 this is called blindness.'
 	CHAP. VII. Confucius said, 'There are three things which 
 the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical 
 powers
 
 在色、及其壯也、血氣方剛、戒之在鬥、及其老也、血氣既衰、戒之在得。
 【第八章】【一節】孔子曰、君子有三畏、畏天命、畏大人、畏聖人之言。
 【二節】小人不知天命、而不畏也、狎大人、侮聖人之言。
 【第九章】孔子曰、生而知之者、上也、學而知之者、次也、
 are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong 
 and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against 
 quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are 
 decayed, he guards against covetousness.'
 	CHAP. VIII. 1. Confucius said, 'There are three things of 
 which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the 
 ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands 
 in awe of the words of sages.
 	2. 'The mean man does not know the ordinances of 
 Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is 
 disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of 
 sages.'
 	CHAP. IX. Confucius said, 'Those who are born with the 
 possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those 
 who learn, and so, readily, get possession of knowledge, are the 
 next.
 
 困而學之、又其次也、困而不學、民斯為下矣。
 【第十章】孔子曰、君子有九思、視思明、聽思聰、色思溫、貌思恭、言思
 忠、事思敬、疑思問、忿思難、見得思義。
 【十一章】【一節】孔子曰、見善如不及、見不善而探湯、吾見其人矣、吾
 聞其語矣。【二節】隱居
 Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the learning, 
 are another class next to these. As to those who are dull and 
 stupid and yet do not learn;-- they are the lowest of the 
 people.'
 	CHAP. X. Confucius said, 'The superior man has nine 
 things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. 
 In regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In 
 regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In 
 regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be 
 benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should 
 be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it 
 should be sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is 
 anxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what 
 he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is 
 angry, he thinks of the difficulties (his anger may involve him 
 in). When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness.'
 	CHAP. XI. 1. Confucius said, 'Contemplating good, and 
 pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil, 
 and shrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand 
 into boiling water:-- I have seen such men, as I have heard 
 such words.
 	2. 'Living in retirement to study their aims, and 
 practising

 righteousness to carry out their principles:-- I have heard 
 these words, but I have not seen such men.'
 	CHAP. XII. 1. The duke Ching of Ch'i had a thousand 
 teams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the 
 people did not praise him for a single virtue. Po-i and Shu-ch'i 
 died of hunger at the foot of the Shau-yang mountain, and the 
 people, down to the present time, praise them.
 	2. 'Is not that saying illustrated by this?'
 	CHAP. XIII. 1. Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, 'Have you 
 heard any lessons from your father different from what we 
 have all heard?'
 	2. Po-yu replied, 'No. He was standing alone once, when I 
 passed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, "Have 
 you learned the Odes?" On my replying "Not yet," he added, "If 
 you do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with." 
 I retired and studied the Odes.

 【十四章】邦君子之妻、君稱之曰夫人、夫人自稱小童、邦人稱之、曰君夫

 	3. 'Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, 
 when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and said to 
 me, 'Have you learned the rules of Propriety?' On my replying 
 'Not yet,' he added, 'If you do not learn the rules of Propriety, 
 your character cannot be established.' I then retired, and 
 learned the rules of Propriety.
 	4. 'I have heard only these two things from him.'
 	5. Ch'ang K'ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, 'I asked 
 one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the 
 Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also 
 heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve 
 towards his son.'
 	CHAP. XIV. The wife of the prince of a state is called by 
 him FU ZAN. She calls herself HSIAO T'UNG. The people of the 
 State call
 
 諸異邦、曰寡小君、異邦人稱之、亦曰君夫人。
 her CHUN FU ZAN, and, to the people of other States, they call 
 her K'WA HSIAO CHUN. The people of other states also call her 
 CHUN FU ZAN.

 	CHAP. I. 1. Yang Ho wished to see Confucius, but 
 Confucius would not go to see him. On this, he sent a present of 
 a pig to Confucius, who, having chosen a time when Ho was not 
 at home, went to pay his respects for the gift. He met him, 
 however, on the way.
 	2. Ho said to Confucius, 'Come, let me speak with you.' He 
 then asked, 'Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in 
 his

 bosom, and leaves his country to confusion?' Confucius replied, 
 'No.' 'Can he be called wise, who is anxious to be engaged in 
 public employment, and yet is constantly losing the 
 opportunity of being so?' Confucius again said, 'No.' 'The days 
 and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us.' 
 Confucius said, 'Right; I will go into office.'
 	CHAP. II. The Master said, 'By nature, men are nearly 
 alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.'
 	CHAP. III. The Master said, 'There are only the wise of 
 the highest class, and the stupid of the lowest class, who cannot 
 be changed.'

 	CHAP. IV. 1. The Master, having come to Wu-ch'ang, 
 heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing.
 	2. Well pleased and smiling, he said, 'Why use an ox knife 
 to kill a fowl?'
 	3. Tsze-yu replied, 'Formerly, Master, I heard you say,-- 
 "When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; 
 when the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily 
 ruled."'
 	4. The Master said, 'My disciples, Yen's words are right. 
 What I said was only in sport.'
 	CHAP. V. Kung-shan Fu-zao, when he was holding Pi, and 
 in an attitude of rebellion, invited the Master to visit him, who 
 was rather inclined to go.
 	2. Tsze-lu was displeased, and said, 'Indeed, you cannot 
 go! Why must you think of going to see Kung-shan?'

 	3. The Master said, 'Can it be without some reason that he 
 has invited ME? If any one employ me, may I not make an 
 eastern Chau?'
 	CHAP. VI. Tsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect 
 virtue. Confucius said, 'To be able to practise five things 
 everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue.' He 
 begged to ask what they were, and was told, 'Gravity, 
 generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you 
 are grave, you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are 
 generous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose 
 trust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish much. If 
 you are kind, this will enable you to employ the services of 
 others.

 	CHAP. VII. 1. Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master 
 was inclined to go.
 	2. Tsze-lu said, 'Master, formerly I have heard you say, 
 "When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a 
 superior man will not associate with him." Pi Hsi is in rebellion, 
 holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what shall 
 be said?'
 	3. The Master said, 'Yes, I did use these words. But is it 
 not said, that, if a thing be really hard, it may be ground 
 without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be really 
 white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made 
 black?
 	4. 'Am I a bitter gourd! How can I be hung up out of the 
 way of being eaten?'

 	CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'Yu, have you heard the 
 six words to which are attached six becloudings?' Yu replied, 'I 
 have not.'
 	2. 'Sit down, and I will tell them to you.
 	3. 'There is the love of being benevolent without the love 
 of learning;-- the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. 
 There is the love of knowing without the love of learning;-- the 
 beclouding here leads to dissipation of mind. There is the love 
 of being sincere without the love of learning;-- the beclouding 
 here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences. There is 
 the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;-- 
 the beclouding here leads to rudeness. There is the love of 
 boldness without the love of learning;-- the beclouding here 
 leads to insubordination. There is the love of firmness without 
 the love of learning;-- the beclouding here leads to extravagant 
 conduct.'

 	CHAP. IX. 1. The Master said, 'My children, why do you 
 not study the Book of Poetry?
 	2. 'The Odes serve to stimulate the mind.
 	3. 'They may be used for purposes of self-contemplation.
 	4. 'They teach the art of sociability.
 	5. 'They show how to regulate feelings of resentment.
 	6. 'From them you learn the more immediate duty of 
 serving one's father, and the remoter one of serving one's 
 prince.
 	7. 'From them we become largely acquainted with the 
 names of birds, beasts, and plants.'
 	CHAP. X. The Master said to Po-yu, 'Do you give yourself 
 to the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan. The man who has not 
 studied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan, is like one who stands 
 with his face right against a wall. Is he not so?'

 	CHAP. XI. The Master said, '"It is according to the rules of 
 propriety," they say.-- "It is according to the rules of 
 propriety," they say. Are gems and silk all that is meant by 
 propriety? "It is music," they say.-- "It is music," they say. Are 
 bells and drums all that is meant by music?'
 	CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'He who puts on an 
 appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like 
 one of the small, mean people;-- yea, is he not like the thief 
 who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?'
 	CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'Your good, careful people of 
 the villages are the thieves of virtue.'
 	CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'To tell, as we go along, what 
 we have heard on the way, is to cast away our virtue.'

 	CHAP. XV. 1. The Master said, 'There are those mean 
 creatures! How impossible it is along with them to serve one's 
 prince!
 	2. 'While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is 
 how to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest 
 they should lose them.
 	3. 'When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, 
 there is nothing to which they will not proceed.'
 	CHAP. XVI. 1. The Master said, 'Anciently, men had three 
 failings, which now perhaps are not to be found.
 	2. 'The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a 
 disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the present 
 day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity 
 showed itself in grave reserve; the stern dignity of the present 
 day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of 
 antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of 
 the present day shows itself in sheer deceit.'

 	CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Fine words and an 
 insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.'
 	CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'I hate the manner in 
 which purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the 
 way in which the songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. 
 I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms 
 and families.'
 	CHAP. XIX. 1. The Master said, 'I would prefer not 
 speaking.'
 	2. Tsze-kung said, 'If you, Master, do not speak, what 
 shall we, your disciples, have to record?'
 	3. The Master said, 'Does Heaven speak? The four seasons 
 pursue their courses, and all things are continually being 
 produced, but does Heaven say anything?'

 	CHAP. XX. Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius 
 declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the 
 bearer of this message went out at the door, (the Master) took 
 his lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him.
 	CHAP. XXI. 1. Tsai Wo asked about the three years' 
 mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough.
 	2. 'If the superior man,' said he, 'abstains for three years 
 from the observances of propriety, those observances will be 
 quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will 
 be ruined.
 	3. 'Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new 
 grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go 
 through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a 
 complete year, the mourning may stop.'
 	4. The Master said, 'If you were, after a year, to eat good 
 rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?' 'I 
 should,' replied Wo.

 予之不仁也、子生三年、然後免於父母之懷、夫三年之喪、天下之通喪也、
 予也、有三年之愛於其父母乎。
 	5. The Master said, 'If you can feel at ease, do it. But a 
 superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not 
 enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure 
 from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if 
 he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you 
 propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.'
 	6. Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, 'This 
 shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old 
 that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three 
 years' mourning is universally observed throughout the 
 empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his parents?'

 	CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'Hard is it to deal with him, 
 who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without 
 applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters 
 and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than 
 doing nothing at all.'
 	CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-lu said, 'Does the superior man esteem 
 valour?' The Master said, 'The superior man holds 
 righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior 
 situation, having valour without righteousness, will be guilty of 
 insubordination; one of the lower people having valour without 
 righteousness, will commit robbery.'
 	CHAP. XXIV. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Has the superior man his 
 hatreds also?' The Master said, 'He has his hatreds. He hates 
 those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who,

 being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those 
 who have valour merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He 
 hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same 
 time, of contracted understanding.'
 	2. The Master then inquired, 'Ts'ze, have you also your 
 hatreds?' Tsze-kung replied, 'I hate those who pry out matters, 
 and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who 
 are only not modest, and think that they are valourous. I hate 
 those who make known secrets, and think that they are 
 straightforward.'
 	CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Of all people, girls and 
 servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar 
 with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve 
 towards them, they are discontented.'
 	CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'When a man at forty is the 
 object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.'

 	CHAP. II. Hui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was

 necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?'
 	CHAP. III. The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the 
 manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, 'I cannot treat 
 him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a 
 manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chi, and that 
 given to the chief of the Mang family.' He also said, 'I am old; I 
 cannot use his doctrines.' Confucius took his departure.
 	CHAP. IV. The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of 
 female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days 
 no court was held. Confucius took his departure.
 	CHAP. V. 1. The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by 
 Confucius, singing and saying, 'O FANG! O FANG! How is your

 virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the 
 future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. 
 Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage 
 in affairs of government.'
 	2. Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, 
 but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with 
 him.
 	CHAP. VI. 1. Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the 
 field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-
 lu to inquire for the ford.
 	2. Ch'ang-tsu said, 'Who is he that holds the reins in the 
 carriage there?' Tsze-lu told him, 'It is K'ung Ch'iu.' 'Is it not 
 K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?' asked he. 'Yes,' was the reply, to which the 
 other rejoined, 'He knows the ford.'
 	3. Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, 
 'Who

 are you, sir?' He answered, 'I am Chung Yu.' 'Are you not the 
 disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?' asked the other. 'I am,' replied 
 he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, 'Disorder, like a swelling 
 flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will 
 change its state for you? Than follow one who merely 
 withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better 
 follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?' 
 With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with 
 his work, without stopping.
 	4. Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the 
 Master observed with a sigh, 'It is impossible to associate with 
 birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I 
 associate not with these people,-- with mankind,-- with whom 
 shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the 
 empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.'

 	CHAP. VII. 1. Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to 
 fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his 
 shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, 
 'Have you seen my master, sir!' The old man replied, 'Your four 
 limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five 
 kinds of grain:-- who is your master?' With this, he planted his 
 staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed.
 	2. Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood 
 before him.
 	3. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his 
 house, killed a fowl, prepared millet, and feasted him. He also 
 introduced to him his two sons.
 	4. Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his 
 adventure. The Master said, 'He is a recluse,' and sent Tsze-lu 
 back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old 
 man was gone.
 	5. Tsze-lu then said to the family, 'Not to take office is not

 righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be 
 neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be 
 observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to 
 maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to 
 come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs 
 the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right 
 principles to make progress, he is aware of that.'
 	CHAP. VIII. 1. The men who have retired to privacy from 
 the world have been Po-i, Shu-ch'i, Yu-chung, I-yi, Chu-chang, 
 Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien.
 	2. The Master said, 'Refusing to surrender their wills, or 
 to submit to any taint in their persons;-- such, I think, were 
 Po-i and Shu-ch'i.
 	3. 'It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia, and of Shao-lien, that 
 they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their 
 persons,

 but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions 
 were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be 
 remarked in them.
 	4. 'It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they 
 hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their 
 words; but, in their persons, they succeeded in preserving their 
 purity, and, in their retirement, they acted according to the 
 exigency of the times.
 	5. 'I am different from all these. I have no course for 
 which I am predetermined, and no course against which I am 
 predetermined.'
 	CHAP. IX. 1. The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i.
 	2. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went 
 to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. 
 Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.
 	3. Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of 
 the river.

 	4. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the 
 Han.
 	5. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of 
 the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea.
 	CHAP. X. The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of 
 Lu, saying, 'The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. 
 He does not cause the great ministers to repine at his not 
 employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss 
 from their offices the members of old families. He does not 
 seek in one man talents for every employment.'
 	CHAP. XI. To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, 
 Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu, Shu-ya, Shu-hsia, Chi-sui, and 
 Chi-kwa.

 【第一章】子張曰、士、見危致命、見得思義、祭思敬、喪思哀、其可已矣。
 【第二章】子張曰、執德不弘、信道不篤、焉能為有、焉能為亡。
 	CHAP. I. Tsze-chang said, 'The scholar, trained for public 
 duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. 
 When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of 
 righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In 
 mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should 
 feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed.'
 	CHAP. II. Tsze-chang said, 'When a man holds fast to 
 virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes right 
 principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be 
 made of his existence or non-existence?'
 
 【第三章】子夏之門人問交於子張。子張曰、子夏云何。對曰、子夏曰、可

 不能、我之大賢與、於人何所不容、我之不賢與、人將拒我、如之何其拒人
 也。
 【第四章】子夏曰、雖小道、必有
 	CHAP. III. The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang 
 about the principles that should characterize mutual 
 intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, 'What does Tsze-hsia say on the 
 subject?' They replied, 'Tsze-hsia says:-- "Associate with those 
 who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot 
 do so."' Tsze-chang observed, 'This is different from what I 
 have learned. The superior man honours the talented and 
 virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the 
 incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?-- 
 who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I 
 devoid of talents and virtue?-- men will put me away from 
 them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?'
 	CHAP. IV. Tsze-hsia said, 'Even in inferior studies and 
 employments there is something worth being looked at; but if 
 it be

 attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a 
 danger of their proving inapplicable. Therefore, the superior 
 man does not practise them.'
 	CHAP. V. Tsze-hsia said, 'He, who from day to day 
 recognises what he has not yet, and from month to month does 
 not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love 
 to learn.'
 	CHAP. VI. Tsze-hsia said, 'There are learning extensively, 
 and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, 
 and reflecting with self-application:-- virtue is in such a 
 course.'
 	CHAP. VII. Tsze-hsia said, 'Mechanics have their shops to 
 dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man 
 learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.'
 
 【第八章】子夏曰、小人之過也、必文。

 【十一章】子夏曰、大德不踰閑、
 	CHAP. VIII. Tsze-hsia said, 'The mean man is sure to gloss 
 his faults.'
 	CHAP. IX. Tsze-hsia said, 'The superior man undergoes 
 three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; 
 when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his 
 language is firm and decided.'
 	CHAP. X. Tsze-hsia said, 'The superior man, having 
 obtained their confidence, may then impose labours on his 
 people. If he have not gained their confidence, they will think 
 that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence of 
 his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not 
 gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying 
 him.'
 	CHAP. XI. Tsze-hsia said, 'When a person does not 
 transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass 
 and repass it in the small virtues.'
 
 小德出入可也。
 【十二章】【一節】子游曰、子夏之門人小子、當洒掃、應對、進退、則可

 子之道、孰先傳焉、孰後倦焉、譬諸草木、區以別矣、君子之道、焉可誣也、
 有始有卒者、其惟聖人乎。
 	CHAP. XII. 1. Tsze-yu said, 'The disciples and followers of 
 Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering 
 and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently 
 accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and 
 they are left ignorant of what is essential.-- How can they be 
 acknowledged as sufficiently taught?'
 	2. Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, 'Alas! Yen Yu 
 is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, 
 what departments are there which he considers of prime 
 importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of 
 secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But 
 as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their 
 classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a 
 superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not 
 the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the 
 consummation of learning?'

 【十七章】曾子曰、吾聞諸夫子、人未有自致者也、必也親喪乎。
 	CHAP. XIII. Tsze-hsia said, 'The officer, having discharged 
 all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, 
 having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an 
 officer.'
 	CHAP. XIV. Tsze-hsia said, 'Mourning, having been carried 
 to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.'
 	CHAP. XV. Tsze-hsia said, 'My friend Chang can do things 
 which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.'
 	CHAP. XVI. The philosopher Tsang said, 'How imposing is 
 the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practise 
 virtue.'
 	CHAP. XVII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I heard this 
 from our Master:-- "Men may not have shown what is in them 
 to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on 
 occasion of mourning for their parents."'

 【二十章】子貢曰、紂之不善、不如是之甚也、是以君子
 	CHAP. XVIII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I have heard 
 this from our Master:-- "The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in 
 other matters, was what other men are competent to, but, as 
 seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his 
 father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to."'
 	CHAP. XIX. The chief of the Mang family having 
 appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter 
 consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, 'The rulers have 
 failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been 
 disorganised, for a long time. When you have found out the 
 truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do 
 not feel joy at your own ability.'
 	CHAP. XX. Tsze-kung said, 'Chau's wickedness was not so 
 great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates 
 to dwell

 道焉、夫子焉不學、而亦何常師之有、
 in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will 
 flow in upon him.'
 	CHAP. XXI. Tsze-kung said, 'The faults of the superior 
 man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his 
 faults, and all men see them; he changes again, and all men 
 look up to him.'
 	CHAP. XXII. 1. Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tsze-kung, 
 saying, 'From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?'
 	2. Tsze-kung replied, 'The doctrines of Wan and Wu have 
 not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. 
 Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of 
 them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, 
 remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan 
 and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an 
 opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was 
 there for his having a regular master?'

 	CHAP. XXIII. 1. Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great 
 officers in the court, saying, 'Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.'
 	2. Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-
 kung, who said, 'Let me use the comparison of a house and its 
 encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One 
 may peep over it, and see whatever is valuable in the 
 apartments.
 	3. 'The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one 
 do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral 
 temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array.
 	4. 'But I may assume that they are few who find the door. 
 Was not the observation of the chief only what might have 
 been expected?'

 子貢曰、君子一言以為知、一言以為不知、言不可不慎也。【三節】夫子之
 	CHAP. XXIV. Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of 
 Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, 'It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni 
 cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are 
 hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is 
 the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although 
 a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm 
 can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not 
 know his own capacity.
 	CHAP. XXV. 1. Ch'an Tsze-ch'in, addressing Tsze-kung, 
 said, 'You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be 
 superior to you?'
 	2. Tsze-kung said to him, 'For one word a man is often 
 deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be 
 foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say.
 	3. 'Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way 
 as the heavens cannot be gone up to by the steps of a stair.
 
 不可及也、猶天之不可階而升也。【四節】夫子之得邦家者、所謂立之斯立、
 道之期行、綏之期來、動之斯和、其生也榮、其死也哀、如之何其可及也。
 	4. 'Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a State 
 or the chief of a Family, we should find verified the description 
 which has been given of a sage's rule:-- he would plant the 
 people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead 
 them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make 
 them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his 
 dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would 
 be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he 
 died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it possible for him 
 to be attained to?'

 	CHAP. I. 1. Yao said, 'Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-
 determined order of succession now rests in your person. 
 Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and 
 want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a 
 perpetual end.'
 	2. Shun also used the same language in giving charge to 
 Yu.
 	3. T'ang said, 'I the child Li, presume to use a dark-
 coloured victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most 
 great and sovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and 
 thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The 
 examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I 
 commit offences, they are not to be attributed to you, the 
 people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions 
 commit offences, these offences must rest on my person.'
 
 罪在朕躬。【四節】周有大賚、善人是富。【五節】雖有周親、不如仁人、
 百姓有過、在予一人。【六節】謹權量、審法度、修廢官、四方之政行焉。
 【七節】興滅國、繼絕世、舉逸民、天下之民歸心焉。【八節】所重民、食、
 喪、祭。【九節】寬則得眾、信、則民任焉、敏、則有功、公則說。
 	4. Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched.
 	5. 'Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal 
 to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, 
 the One man.'
 	6. He carefully attended to the weights and measures, 
 examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, 
 and the good government of the kingdom took its course.
 	7. He revived States that had been extinguished, restored 
 families whose line of succession had been broken, and called 
 to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that 
 throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned 
 towards him.
 	8. What he attached chief importance to, were the food of 
 the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices.
 	9. By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made 
 the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his 
 achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted.
 
 【第二章】【一節】子張問於孔子曰、何如、斯可以從政矣。子曰、尊五美、
 屏四惡、斯可以從政矣。子張曰、何謂五美。子曰、君子惠、而不費、勞、
 而不怨、欲、而不貪、泰、而不驕、威、而不猛。【二節】子張曰、何謂惠
 而不費。子曰、因民之所利而利之、
 	CHAP. II. 1. Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, 'In what 
 way should a person in authority act in order that he may 
 conduct government properly?' The Master replied, 'Let him 
 honour the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, 
 things;-- then may he conduct government properly.' Tsze-
 chang said, 'What are meant by the five excellent things?' The 
 Master said, 'When the person in authority is beneficent 
 without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people 
 without their repining; when he pursues what he desires 
 without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease 
 without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.'
 	2. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant by being beneficent 
 without great expenditure?' The Master replied, 'When the 
 person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the 
 things from which
 
 斯不亦惠而不費乎、擇可勞而勞之、又誰怨、欲仁而得仁、又焉貪、君子無
 眾寡、無小大、無敢慢、斯不亦泰而不驕乎、君子正其衣冠、尊其瞻視、儼
 然人望而畏之、斯不亦威而不猛乎。【三節】子張曰、何謂四惡。子曰、不
 教而殺、謂之虐、不戒視成、謂之暴、慢令致期、謂之賊、猶
 they naturally derive benefit;-- is not this being beneficent 
 without great expenditure? When he chooses the labours which 
 are proper, and makes them labour on them, who will repine? 
 When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he 
 secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he 
 has to do with many people or few, or with things great or 
 small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-- is not this 
 to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his 
 clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, 
 thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-- is not this to be 
 majestic without being fierce?'
 	3. Tsze-chang then asked, 'What are meant by the four 
 bad things?' The Master said, 'To put the people to death 
 without having instructed them;-- this is called cruelty. To 
 require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without 
 having given them warning;-- this is called oppression. To issue 
 orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time 
 comes, to insist on them with severity;-- this is called injury. 
 And, generally, in the giving pay
 
 之與人也、出納之吝、謂之有司。
 【第三章】【一節】子曰、不知命、無以為君子也。【二節】不知禮、無以
 立也。【三節】不知言、無以知人也。
 or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-- this is called 
 acting the part of a mere official.'
 	CHAP III. 1. The Master said, 'Without recognising the 
 ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.
 	2. 'Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it 
 is impossible for the character to be established.
 	3. 'Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to 
 know men.'</pre>
