 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">[1] THE GREAT SUMMONS</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>When Ch‘ü Yüan had been exiled from the Court for nine years, he became so despondent that he feared his soul would part from his body and he would die. It was then that he made the poem called "The Great Summons," calling upon his soul not to leave him.</i></p>  
 <p>    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Green</span> Spring receiveth<br>     The vacant earth;<br>     The white sun shineth;<br>     Spring wind provoketh<br>     To burst and burgeon<br>     Each sprout and flower.<br> In those dark caves where Winter lurketh<br>     Hide not, my Soul!<br> O Soul come back again! O, do not stray!</p>  
 <p>O Soul come back again and go not east or west, or north<br>     or south!<br> For to the East a mighty water drowneth Earth's other<br>     shore;<br> Tossed on its waves and heaving with its tides<br>     The hornless Dragon of the Ocean rideth:<br> Clouds gather low and fogs enfold the sea<br>     And gleaming ice drifts past.<br> O Soul go not to the East,<br> To the silent Valley of Sunrise!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>O Soul go not to the South<br> Where mile on mile the earth is burnt away<br> And poisonous serpents slither through the flames;<br> Where on precipitous paths or in deep woods<br> Tigers and leopards prowl,<br> And water-scorpions wait;<br> Where the king-python rears his giant head.<br> O Soul, go not to the South<br> Where the three-footed tortoise spits disease!</p>  
 <p>O Soul go not to the West<br> Where level wastes of sand stretch on and on;<br> And demons rage, swine-headed, hairy-skinned,<br> With bulging eyes;<br> Who in wild laughter gnash projecting fangs.<br> O Soul go not to the West <br> Where many perils wait!</p>  
 <p>O Soul go not to the North,<br> To the Lame Dragon's frozen peaks;<br> Where trees and grasses dare not grow;<br> Where a river runs too wide to cross<br> And too deep to plumb,<br> And the sky is white with snow<br> And the cold cuts and kills.<br> O Soul seek not to fill<br> The treacherous voids of the north!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>O Soul come back to idleness and peace.<br> In quietude enjoy<br> The lands of Ching and Ch‘u.<br> There work your will and follow your desire<br> Till sorrow is forgot,<br> And carelessness shall bring you length of days.<br> O Soul come back to joys beyond all telling!</p>  
 <p>Where thirty cubits high at harvest-time<br> The corn is stacked;<br> Where pies are cooked of millet and bearded-maize.<br> Guests watch the steaming bowls<br> And sniff the pungency of peppered herbs.<br> The cunning cook adds slices of bird-flesh,<br> Pigeon and yellow-heron and black-crane.<br> They taste the badger-stew.<br> O Soul come back to feed on foods you love!</p>  
 <p>Next are brought<br> Fresh turtle, and sweet chicken cooked in cheese<br> Pressed by the men of Ch‘u.<br> And pickled sucking-pig<br> And flesh of whelps floating in liver-sauce <br> With salad of minced radishes in brine;<br> All served with that hot spice of southernwood<br> The land of Wu supplies.<br> O Soul come back to choose the meats you love!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>Roasted daw, steamed widgeon and grilled quail—<br> On every fowl they fare.<br> Boiled perch and sparrow broth,—in each preserved<br> The separate flavour that is most its own.<br> O Soul come back to where such dainties wait!</p>  
 <p>The four strong liquors are warming at the fire<br> So that they grate not on the drinker's throat.<br> How fragrant rise their fumes, how cool their taste!<br> Such drink is not for louts or serving-men!<br> And wise distillers from the land of Wu<br> Blend unfermented spirit with white yeast<br> And brew the <i>li</i> of Ch‘u.<br> O Soul come back and let your yearnings cease!</p>  
 <p>Reed-organs from the lands of T‘ai and Ch‘in<br> And Wei and Chēng<br> Gladden the feasters, and old songs are sung:<br> The "Rider's Song" that once<br> Fu-hsi, the ancient monarch, made;<br> And the harp-songs of Ch‘u.<br> Then after prelude from the flutes of Chao<br> The ballad-singer's voice rises alone.<br> O Soul come back to the hollow mulberry-tree! <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Eight and eight the dancers sway, <br> Weaving their steps to the poet's voice</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>Who speaks his odes and rhapsodies;<br> They tap their bells and beat their chimes<br> Rigidly, lest harp and flute<br> Should mar the measure.<br> Then rival singers of the Four Domains<br> Compete in melody, till not a tune<br> Is left unsung that human voice could sing.<br> O Soul come back and listen to their songs!</p>  
 <p>Then women enter whose red lips and dazzling teeth<br> Seduce the eye;<br> But meek and virtuous, trained in every art;<br> Fit sharers of play-time,<br> So soft their flesh and delicate their bones.<br> O Soul come back and let them ease your woe!</p>  
 <p>Then enter other ladies with laughing lips<br> And sidelong glances under moth-eye brows;<br> Whose cheeks are fresh and red;<br> Ladies both great of heart and long of limb,<br> Whose beauty by sobriety is matched.<br> Well-padded cheeks and ears with curving rim,<br> High-arching eyebrows, as with compass drawn,<br> Great hearts and loving gestures—all are there;<br> Small waists and necks as slender as the clasp<br> Of courtiers' brooches.<br> O Soul come back to those whose tenderness<br> Drives angry thoughts away!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>Last enter those<br> Whose every action is contrived to please;<br> Black-painted eyebrows and white-powdered cheeks.<br> They reek with scent; with their long sleeves they brush<br> The faces of the feasters whom they pass,<br> Or pluck the coats of those who will not stay.<br> O Soul come back to pleasures of the night!</p>  
 <p>A summer-house with spacious rooms<br> And a high hall with beams stained red;<br> A little closet in the southern wing<br> Reached by a private stair.<br> And round the house a covered way should run<br> Where horses might be trained.<br> And sometimes riding, sometimes going afoot<br> You shall explore, O Soul, the parks of spring;<br> Your jewelled axles gleaming in the sun<br> And yoke inlaid with gold;<br> Or amid orchises and sandal-trees<br> Shall walk in the dark woods.<br> O Soul come back and live for these delights!</p>  
 <p>Peacocks shall fill your gardens; you shall rear<br> The roc and phoenix, and red jungle-fowl,<br> Whose cry at dawn assembles river storks<br> To join the play of cranes and ibises;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>Where the wild-swan all day<br> Pursues the glint of idle king-fishers.<br> O Soul come back to watch the birds in flight!</p>  
 <p>He who has found such manifold delights<br> Shall feel his cheeks aglow<br> And the blood-spirit dancing through his limbs.<br> Stay with me, Soul, and share<br> The span of days that happiness will bring;<br> See sons and grandsons serving at the Court<br> Ennobled and enriched.<br> O Soul come back and bring prosperity<br> To house and stock!</p>  
 <p>The roads that lead to Ch‘u<br> Shall teem with travellers as thick as clouds,<br> A thousand miles away.<br> For the Five Orders of Nobility<br> Shall summon sages to assist the King<br> And with godlike discrimination choose<br> The wise in council; by their aid to probe<br> The hidden discontents of humble men<br> And help the lonely poor.<br> O Soul come back and end what we began!</p>  
 <p>Fields, villages and lanes<br> Shall throng with happy men;<br> Good rule protect the people and make known</p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>The King's benevolence to all the land;<br> Stern discipline prepare<br> Their natures for the soft caress of Art.<br> O Soul come back to where the good are praised!</p>  
 <p>Like the sun shining over the four seas<br> Shall be the reputation of our King;<br> His deeds, matched only in Heaven, shall repair<br> The wrongs endured by every tribe of men,—<br> Northward to Yu and southward to Annam,<br> To the Sheep's Gut Mountain and the Eastern Seas.<br> O Soul come back to where the wise are sought!</p>  
 <p>Behold the glorious virtues of our King<br> Triumphant, terrible;<br> Behold with solemn faces in the Hall<br> The Three Grand Ministers walk up and down,—<br> None chosen for the post save landed-lords<br> Or, in default, Knights of the Nine Degrees.<br> At the first ray of dawn already is hung<br> The shooting-target, where with bow in hand<br> And arrows under arm,<br> Each archer does obeisance to each,<br> Willing to yield his rights of precedence.<br> O Soul come back to where men honour still<br> The name of the Three Kings. <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
