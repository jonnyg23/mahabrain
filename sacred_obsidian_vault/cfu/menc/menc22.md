 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 22</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'It is not to be wondered at that the king is not
 wise!</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Suppose the case of the most easily growing thing in the world;-- if
 you let it have one day's genial heat, and then expose it for ten days to
 cold, it will not be able to grow. It is but seldom that I have an audience
 of the king, and when I retire, there come all those who act upon him like
 the cold. Though I succeed in bringing out some buds of goodness, of what
 avail is it?</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Now chess-playing is but a small art, but without his whole mind
 being given, and his will bent, to it, a man cannot succeed at it. Chess
 Ch'iû is the best chess-player in all the kingdom. Suppose that he is
 teaching two men to play.-- The one gives to the subject his whole mind and
 bends to it all his will, doing nothing but listening to Chess Ch'iû.
 The other, although he seems to be listening to him, has his whole mind
 running on a swan which he thinks is approaching, and wishes to bend his
 bow, adjust the string to the arrow, and shoot it. Although he is learning
 along with the other, he does not come up to him. Why?-- because his
 intelligence is not equal? Not so.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'I like fish, and I also like bear's paws. If I cannot
 have the two together, I will let the fish go, and take the bear's paws.
 So, I like life, and I also like righteousness. If I cannot keep the two
 together, I will let life go, and choose righteousness.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'I like life indeed, but there is that which I like more than life,
 and therefore, I will not seek to possess it by any improper ways. I
 dislike death indeed, but there is that which I dislike more than death,
 and therefore there are occasions when I will not avoid danger.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If among the things which man likes there were nothing which he
 liked more than life, why should he not use every means by which he could
 preserve it? If among the things which man dislikes there were nothing
 which he disliked more than death, why should he not do everything by which
 he could avoid danger?</p>
 
 <p>4. 'There are cases when men by a certain course might preserve life,
 and they do not employ it; when by certain things they might avoid danger,
 and they will not do them.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Therefore, men have that which they like more than life, and that
 which they dislike more than death. They are not men of distinguished
 talents and virtue only who have this mental nature. All men have it; what
 belongs to such men is simply that they do not lose it.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Here are a small basket of rice and a platter of soup, and the case
 is one in which the getting them will preserve life, and the want of them
 will be death;-- if they are offered with an insulting voice, even a
 tramper will not receive them, or if you first tread upon them, even a
 beggar will not stoop to take them.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'And yet a man will accept of ten thousand chung, without any
 consideration of propriety or righteousness. What can the ten thousand
 chung add to him?  When he takes them, is it not that he may obtain
 beautiful mansions, that he may secure the services of wives and
 concubines, or that the poor and needy of his acquaintance may be helped
 by him?</p>
 
 <p>8. 'In the former case the offered bounty was not received, though it
 would have saved from death, and now the emolument is taken for the sake of
 beautiful mansions. The bounty that would have preserved from death was not
 received, and the emolument is taken to get the service of wives and
 concubines. The bounty that would have saved from death was not received,
 and the emolument is taken that one's poor and needy acquaintance may be
 helped by him. Was it then not possible likewise to decline this? This is a
 case of what is called-- "Losing the proper nature of one's mind."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Benevolence is man's mind, and righteousness is man's
 path.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'How lamentable is it to neglect the path and not pursue it, to lose
 this mind and not know to seek it again!</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When men's fowls and dogs are lost, they know to seek for them
 again, but they lose their mind, and do not know to seek for it.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'The great end of learning is nothing else but to seek for the lost
 mind.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Here is a man whose fourth finger is bent and cannot
 be stretched out straight. It is not painful, nor does it incommode his
 business, and yet if there be any one who can make it straight, he will not
 think the way from Ch'in to Ch'û far to go to him; because his finger
 is not like the finger of other people.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'When a man's finger is not like those of other people, he knows to
 feel dissatisfied, but if his mind be not like that of other people, he
 does not know to feel dissatisfaction. This is called-- "Ignorance of the
 relative importance of things."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'Anybody who wishes to cultivate the t'ung or the tsze,
 which may be grasped with both hands, perhaps with one, knows by what means
 to nourish them. In the case of their own persons, men do not know by what
 means to nourish them. Is it to be supposed that their regard of their own
 persons is inferior to their regard for a t'ung or tsze? Their want of
 reflection is extreme.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'There is no part of himself which a man does not love,
 and as he loves all, so he must nourish all. There is not an inch of skin
 which he does not love, and so there is not an inch of skin which he will
 not nourish. For examining whether his way of nourishing be good or not,
 what other rule is there but this, that he determine by reflecting on
 himself where it should be applied?</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Some parts of the body are noble, and some ignoble; some great, and
 some small. The great must not be injured for the small, nor the noble for
 the ignoble. He who nourishes the little belonging to him is a little man,
 and he who nourishes the great is a great man.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Here is a plantation-keeper, who neglects his wû and
 chiâ, and cultivates his sour jujube-trees;-- he is a poor
 plantation-keeper.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'He who nourishes one of his fingers, neglecting his shoulders or his
 back, without knowing that he is doing so, is a man who resembles a hurried
 wolf.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'A man who only eats and drinks is counted mean by others;-- because
 he nourishes what is little to the neglect of what is great.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'If a man, fond of his eating and drinking, were not to neglect what
 is of more importance, how should his mouth and belly be considered as no
 more than an inch of skin?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The disciple Kung-tû said, 'All are equally men, but some are
 great men, and some are little men;-- how is this?' Mencius replied, 'Those
 who follow that part of themselves which is great are great men; those who
 follow that part which is little are little men.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Kung-tû pursued, 'All are equally men, but some follow that
 part of themselves which is great, and some follow that part which is
 little;-- how is this?' Mencius answered, 'The senses of hearing and seeing
 do not think, and are obscured by external things. When one thing comes
 into contact with another, as a matter of course it leads it away. To the
 mind belongs the office of thinking. By thinking, it gets the right view of
 things; by neglecting to think, it fails to do this. These-- the senses and
 the mind-- are what Heaven has given to us. Let a man first stand fast in
 the supremacy of the nobler part of his constitution, and the inferior part
 will not be able to take it from him. It is simply this which makes the
 great man.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'There is a nobility of Heaven, and there is a nobility
 of man. Benevolence, righteousness, self-consecration, and fidelity, with
 unwearied joy in these virtues;-- these constitute the nobility of Heaven.
 To be a kung, a ch'ing, or a tâ-fû;-- this constitutes the
 nobility of man.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The men of antiquity cultivated their nobility of Heaven, and the
 nobility of man came to them in its train.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The men of the present day cultivate their nobility of Heaven in
 order to seek for the nobility of man, and when they have obtained that,
 they throw away the other:-- their delusion is extreme. The issue is simply
 this, that they must lose that nobility of man as well.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'The honour which men confer is not good honour. Those whom
 Châo the Great ennobles he can make mean again.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "He has filled us with his wine,<br>
 He has satiated us with his goodness."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">"Satiated us with his goodness," that is, satiated us
 with benevolence and righteousness, and he who is so satiated,
 consequently, does not wish for the fat meat and fine millet of men. A good
 reputation and far-reaching praise fall to him, and he does not desire the
 elegant embroidered garments of men.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Benevolence subdues its opposite just as water subdues
 fire. Those, however, who now-a-days practise benevolence do it as if with
 one cup of water they could save a whole waggon-load of fuel which was on
 fire, and when the flames were not extinguished, were to say that water
 cannot subdue fire. This conduct, moreover, greatly encourages those who
 are not benevolent.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The final issue will simply be this-- the loss of that small amount
 of benevolence.'</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'A master-workman, in teaching others, uses the compass and square,
 and his pupils do the same.'</p>
