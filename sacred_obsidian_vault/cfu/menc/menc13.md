 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 13</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'The power of vision of Lî Lâu, and skill
 of hand of Kung-shû, without the compass and square, could not form
 squares and circles. The acute ear of the music-master K'wang, without the
 pitch-tubes, could not determine correctly the five notes. The principles
 of Yâo and Shun, without a benevolent government, could not secure
 the tranquil order of the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'There are now princes who have benevolent hearts and a reputation for
 benevolence, while yet the people do not receive any benefits from them,
 nor will they leave any example to future ages;-- all because they do not
 put into practice the ways of the ancient kings.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Hence we have the saying:-- "Virtue alone is not sufficient for the
 exercise of government; laws alone cannot carry themselves into
 practice."</p>
 
 <p>4. It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "Without transgression, without forgetfulness,<br>
 Following the ancient statutes."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">Never has any one fallen into error, who followed the
 laws of the ancient kings.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'When the sages had used the vigour of their eyes, they called in to
 their aid the compass, the square, the level, and the line, to make things
 square, round, level, and straight:-- the use of the instruments is
 inexhaustible. When they had used their power of hearing to the utmost,
 they called in the pitch-tubes to their aid to determine the five
 notes:-- the use of those tubes is inexhaustible. When they had exerted to
 the utmost the thoughts of their hearts, they called in to their aid a
 government that could not endure to witness the sufferings of men:-- and
 their benevolence overspread the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Hence we have the saying:-- "To raise a thing high, we must begin
 from the top of a mound or a hill; to dig to a great depth, we must
 commence in the low ground of a stream or a marsh." Can he be pronounced
 wise, who, in the exercise of government, does not proceed according to the
 ways of the former kings?</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Therefore only the benevolent ought to be in high stations. When a
 man destitute of benevolence is in a high station, he thereby disseminates
 his wickedness among all below him.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'When the prince has no principles by which he examines his
 administration, and his ministers have no laws by which they keep
 themselves in the discharge of their duties, then in the court obedience is
 not paid to principle, and in the office obedience is not paid to rule.
 Superiors violate the laws of righteousness, and inferiors violate the
 penal laws. It is only by a fortunate chance that a State in such a case is
 preserved.</p>
 
 <p>9. 'Therefore it is said, "It is not the exterior and interior walls being
 incomplete, and the supply of weapons offensive and defensive not being
 large, which constitutes the calamity of a kingdom. It is not the
 cultivable area not being extended, and stores and wealth not being
 accumulated, which occasions the ruin of a State." When superiors do not
 observe the rules of propriety, and inferiors do not learn, then seditious
 people spring up, and that State will perish in no time.</p>
 
 <p>10. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "When such an overthrow of Châu is being produced by Heaven,<br>
 Be not ye so much at your ease!"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>11. '" At your ease;"-- that is, dilatory.</p>
 
 <p>12. 'And so dilatory may those officers be deemed, who serve their
 prince without righteousness, who take office and retire from it without
 regard to propriety, and who in their words disown the ways of the ancient
 kings.</p>
 
 <p>13. 'Therefore it is said, "To urge one's sovereign to difficult
 achievements may be called showing respect for him. To set before him what
 is good and repress his perversities may be called showing reverence for
 him. He who does not do these things, saying to himself,-- My sovereign is
 incompetent to this, may be said to play the thief with him."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'The compass and square produce perfect circles
 and squares. By the sages, the human relations are perfectly exhibited.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'He who as a sovereign would perfectly discharge the duties of a
 sovereign, and he who as a minister would perfectly discharge the duties of
 a minister, have only to imitate-- the one Yâo, and the other Shun.
 He who does not serve his sovereign as Shun served Yâo, does not
 respect his sovereign; and he who does not rule his people as Yâo
 ruled his, injures his people.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Confucius said, "There are but two courses, which can be pursued,
 that of virtue and its opposite."</p>
 
 <p>4. 'A ruler who carries the oppression of his people to the highest
 pitch, will himself be slain, and his kingdom will perish. If one stop
 short of the highest pitch, his life will notwithstanding be in danger, and
 his kingdom will be weakened. He will be styled "The Dark," or "The Cruel,"
 and though he may have filial sons and affectionate grandsons, they will
 not be able in a hundred generations to change the designation.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'This is what is intended in the words of the Book of Poetry, </p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The beacon of Yin is not remote,<br>
 It is in the time of the (last) sovereign of Hsiâ."'
 </blockquote>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'It was by benevolence that the three dynasties gained
 the throne, and by not being benevolent that they lost it.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'It is by the same means that the decaying and flourishing, the
 preservation and perishing, of States are determined.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If the sovereign be not benevolent, be cannot preserve the throne
 from passing from him. If the Head of a State be not benevolent, he cannot
 preserve his rule. If a high noble or great officer be not benevolent, he
 cannot preserve his ancestral temple. If a scholar or common man be not
 benevolent, be cannot preserve his four limbs.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Now they hate death and ruin, and yet delight in being not 
 benevolent;-- this is like hating to be drunk, and yet being strong to
 drink wine!</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'If a man love others, and no responsive attachment is
 shown to him, let him turn inwards and examine his own benevolence. If he
 is trying to rule others, and his government is unsuccessful, let him turn
 inwards and examine his wisdom. If he treats others politely, and they do
 not return his politeness, let him turn inwards and examine his own feeling
 of respect.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'When we do not, by what we do, realise what we desire, we must turn
 inwards, and examine ourselves in every point. When a man's person is
 correct, the whole kingdom will turn to him with recognition and
 submission.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "Be always studious to be in harmony with the ordinances of God,<br>
 And you will obtain much happiness."'
 </blockquote>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'People have this common saying,-- "The kingdom, the
 State, the family." The root of the kingdom is in the State. The root of
 the State is in the family. The root of the family is in the person of its
 Head.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'The administration of government is not difficult;-- it
 lies in not offending the great families. He whom the great families
 affect, will be affected by the whole State; and he whom any one State
 affects, will be affected by the whole kingdom. When this is the case, such
 an one's virtue and teachings will spread over all within the four seas
 like the rush of water.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'When right government prevails in the kingdom, princes
 of little virtue are submissive to those of great, and those of little
 worth to those of great. When bad government prevails in the kingdom,
 princes of small power are submissive to those of great, and the weak to
 the strong. Both these cases are the rule of Heaven. They who accord with
 Heaven are preserved, and they who rebel against Heaven perish.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The duke Ching of Ch'î said, "Not to be able to command
 others, and at the same time to refuse to receive their commands, is to cut
 one's self off from all intercourse with others." His tears flowed forth
 while he gave his daughter to be married to the prince of Wû.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Now the small States imitate the large, and yet are ashamed to
 receive their commands. This is like a scholar's being ashamed to receive
 the commands of his master.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'For a plince who is ashamed of this, the best plan is to imitate
 king Wan. Let one imitate king Wan, and in five years, if his State be
 large, or in seven years, if it be small, he will be sure to give laws to
 the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The descendants of the sovereigns of the Shang dynasty,<br>
 Are in number more than hundreds of thousands,<br>
 But, God having passed His decree,<br>
 They are all submissive to Châu.<br>
 They are submissive to Châu,<br>
 Because the decree of Heaven is not unchanging.<br>
 The officers of Yin, admirable and alert,<br>
 Pour out the libations, and assist in the capital of Châu."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">Confucius said, "As against so benevolent a sovereign,
 they could not be deemed a multitude." Thus, if the prince of a state love
 benevolence, he will have no opponent in all the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Now they wish to have no opponent in all the kingdom, but they do not
 seek to attain this by being benevolent. This is like a man laying hold of
 a heated substance, and not having first dipped it in water. It is said in
 the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "Who can take up a heated substance,<br>
 Without first dipping it (in water)?"'
 </blockquote>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'How is it possible to speak with those princes who are
 not benevolent ? Their perils they count safety, their calamities they
 count profitable, and they have pleasure in the things by which they
 perish. If it were possible to talk with them who so violate benevolence,
 how could we have such destruction of States and ruin of Families?</p>
 
 <p>2. 'There was a boy singing,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "When the water of the Ts'ang-lang is clear,<br>
 It does to wash the strings of my cap;<br>
 When the water of the Ts'ang-lang is muddy,<br>
 It does to wash my feet."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>3. 'Confucius said, "Hear what he sings, my children. When clear, then
 he will wash his cap-strings; and when muddy, he will wash his feet with
 it. This different application is brought by the water on itself."</p>
 
 <p>4. 'A man must first despise himself, and then others will despise him.
 A family must first destroy itself, and then others will destroy it. A
 State must first smite itself, and then others will smite it.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'This is illustrated in the passage of the T'âi Chiâ,
 "When Heaven sends down calamities, it is still possible to escape them.
 When we occasion the calamities ourselves, it is not possible any longer to
 live."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Chieh and Châu's losing the throne, arose from
 their losing the people, and to lose the people means to lose their hearts.
 There is a way to get the kingdom:-- get the people, and the kingdom is
 got. There is a way to get the people:-- get their hearts, and the people
 are got. There is a way to get their hearts:-- it is simply to collect for
 them what they like, and not to lay on them what they dislike.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The people turn to a benevolent rule as water flows downwards, and
 as wild beasts fly to the wilderness.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Accordingly, as the otter aids the deep waters, driving the fish
 into them, and the hawk aids the thickets, driving the little birds to
 them, so Chieh and Châu aided T'ang and Wû, driving the people
 to them.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'If among the present rulers of the kingdom, there were one who loved
 benevolence, all the other princes would aid him, by driving the people to
 him. Although he wished not to become sovereign, he could not avoid
 becoming so.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'The case of one of the present princes wishing to become sovereign
 is like the having to seek for mugwort three years old, to cure a seven
 years' sickness. If it have not been kept in store, the patient may all his
 life not get it. If the princes do not set their wills on benevolence, all
 their days will be in sorrow and disgrace, and they will be involved in
 death and ruin.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'This is illustrated by what is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "How otherwise can you improve the kingdom?<br>
 You will only with it go to ruin."'
 </blockquote>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'With those who do violence to themselves, it is
 impossible to speak. With those who throw themselves away, it is impossible
 to do anything. To disown in his conversation propriety and righteousness,
 is what we mean by doing violence to one's self. To say-- "I am not able to
 dwell in benevolence or pursue the path of righteousness," is what we mean
 by throwing one's self away.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Benevolence is the tranquil habitation of man, and righteousness is
 his straight path.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Alas for them, who leave the tranquil dwelling empty and do not
 reside in it, and who abandon the right path and do not pursue it?'</p>
