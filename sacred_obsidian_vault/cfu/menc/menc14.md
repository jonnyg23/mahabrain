 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 14</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'The path of duty lies in what is near, and men seek for
 it in what is remote. The work of duty lies in what is easy, and men seek
 for it in what is difficult. If each man would love his parents and show
 the due respect to his elders, the whole land would enjoy
 tranquillity.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'When those occupying inferior situations do not obtain
 the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the
 people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign:-- if one
 is not trusted by his friends, he will not obtain the confidence of his
 sovereign. There is a way of being trusted by one's friends:-- if one do
 not serve his parents so as to make them pleased, he will not be trusted by
 his friends. There is a way to make one's parents pleased:-- if one, on
 turning his thoughts inwards, finds a want of sincerity, he will not give
 pleasure to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in
 one's self:-- if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain
 sincerity in himself.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Therefore, sincerity is the way of Heaven. To think how to be
 sincere is the way of man.</p>
 
 <p>3. Never has there been one possessed of complete sincerity, who did not
 move others. Never has there been one who had not sincerity who was able to
 move others.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Po-Î, that he might avoid Châ'u, was
 dwelling on the coast of the northern sea. When he heard of the rise of
 king Wan, he roused himself, and said, "Why should I not go and follow him?
 I have heard that the chief of the West knows well how to nourish the old."
 T'âi-kung, that he might avoid Châu, was dwelling on the coast
 of the eastern sea. When he heard of the rise of king Wan, he roused
 himself, and said, "Why should I not go and follow him? I have heard that
 the chief of the West knows well how to nourish the old."</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Those two old men were the greatest old men of the kingdom. When
 they came to follow king Wan, it was the fathers of the kingdom coming to
 follow him. When the fathers of the kingdom joined him, how could the sons
 go to any other?</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Were any of the princes to practise the government of king Wan,
 within seven years he would be sure to be giving laws to the kingdom.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Ch'iû acted as chief officer to the head of the
 Chî family, whose evil ways he was unable to change, while he exacted
 from the people double the grain formerly paid. Confucius said, "He is no
 disciple of mine. Little children, beat the drum and assail him."</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Looking at the subject from this case, we perceive that when a
 prince was not practising benevolent government, all his ministers who
 enriched him were rejected by Confucius:-- how much more would he have
 rejected those who are vehement to fight for their prince! When contentions
 about territory are the ground on which they fight, they slaughter men till
 the fields are filled with them. When some struggle for a city is the
 ground on which they fight, they slaughter men till the city is filled with
 them. This is what is called "leading on the land to devour human flesh."
 Death is not enough for such a crime.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Therefore, those who are skilful to fight should suffer the highest
 punishment. Next to them should be punished those who unite some princes in
 leagues against others; and next to them, those who take in grassy commons,
 imposing the cultivation of the ground on the people.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'Listen to a man's words and look at the pupil of his eye. How can a
 man conceal his character?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'The respectful do not despise others. The economical do
 not plunder others. The prince who treats men with despite and plunders
 them, is only afraid that they may not prove obedient to him:-- how can he
 be regarded as respectful or economical? How can respectfulness and economy
 be made out of tones of the voice, and a smiling manner?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Shun-yü K'wan said, 'Is it the rule that males and females shall
 not allow their hands to touch in giving or receiving anything?' Mencius
 replied, 'It is the rule.' K'wan asked, 'If a man's sister-in-law be
 drowning, shall he rescue her with his hand?' Mencius said, 'He who would
 not so rescue the drowning woman is a wolf. For males and females not to
 allow their hands to touch in giving and receiving is the general rule;
 when a sister-in-law is drowning, to rescue her with the hand is a peculiar
 exigency.'</p>
 
 <p>2. K'wan said, 'The whole kingdom is drowning. How strange it is that you
 will not rescue it!'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius answered, 'A drowning kingdom must be rescued with right
 principles, as a drowning sister-in-law has to be rescued with the hand. Do
 you wish me to rescue the kingdom with my hand?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'The circumstances of the case forbid its being
 done. The teacher must inculcate what is correct. When he inculcates what
 is correct, and his lessons are not practised, he follows them up with
 being angry. When he follows them up with being angry, then, contrary to
 what should be, he is offended with his son. At the same time, the pupil
 says, 'My master inculcates on me what is correct, and he himself does not
 proceed in a correct path." The result of this is, that father and son are
 offended with each other. When father and son come to be offended with each
 other, the case is evil.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The ancients exchanged sons, and one taught the son of another.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Between father and son, there should be no reproving admonitions to
 what is good. Such reproofs lead to alienation, and than alienation there
 is nothing more inauspicious.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Of services, which is the greatest? The service of
 parents is the greatest. Of charges, which is the greatest ? The charge of
 one's self is the greatest. That those who do not fail to keep themselves
 are able to serve their parents is what I have heard. But I have never
 heard of any, who, having failed to keep themselves, were able
 notwithstanding to serve their parents.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'There are many services, but the service of parents is the root of
 all others. There are many charges, but the charge of one's self is the
 root of all others.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The philosopher Tsang, in nourishing Tsang Hsî, was always
 sure to have wine and flesh provided. And when they were being removed, he
 would ask respectfully to whom he should give what was left. If his father
 asked whether there was anything left, he was sure to say, "There is."
 After the death of Tsing Hsî, when Tsang Yüan came to nourish
 Tsing-tsze, he was always sure to have wine and flesh provided. But when
 the things were being removed, he did not ask to whom he should give what
 was left, and if his father asked whether there was anything left, he would
 answer "No;"-- intending to bring them in again. This was what is called--
 "nourishing the mouth and body." We may call Tsang-tsze's practice--
 "nourishing the will."</p>
 
 <p>4. 'To serve one's parents as Tsang-tsze served his, may be accepted as
 flial piety.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'It is not enough to remonstrate with a sovereign on
 account of the mal-employment of ministers, nor to blame errors of
 government. It is only the great man who can rectify what is wrong in the
 sovereign's mind. Let the prince be benevolent, and all his acts will be
 benevolent. Let the prince be righteous, and all his acts will be
 righteous. Let the prince be correct, and everything will be correct. Once
 rectify the ruler, and the kingdom will be firmly settled.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'There are cases of praise which could not be expected,
 and of reproach when the parties have been seeking to be perfect.'</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>1. The disciple Yo-chang went in the train of Tsze-âo to
 Ch'î.</p>
 
 <p>2. He came to see Mencius, who said to him, 'Are you also come to see
 me?' Yo-chang replied, 'Master, why do you speak such words?' 'How many
 days have you been here?' asked Mencius. 'I came yesterday.' 'Yesterday! Is
 it not with reason then that I thus speak?' 'My lodging-house was not
 arranged.' 'Have you heard that a scholar's lodging-house must be arranged
 before he visit his elder?'</p>
 
 <p>3. Yo-chang said, 'I have done wrong.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius, addressing the disciple Yo-chang, said to him, 'Your coming
 here in the train of Tsze-âo was only because of the food and the
 drink. I could not have thought that you, having learned the doctrine of
 the ancients, would have acted with a view to eating and drinking.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'There are three things which are unfilial, and to have
 no posterity is the greatest of them.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Shun married without informing his parents because of this,-- 
 lest he should have no posterity. Superior men consider that his doing so
 was the same as if he had informed them.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'The richest fruit of benevolence is this,-- the
 service of one's parents. The richest fruit of righteousness is this,-- the
 obeying one's elder brothers.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The richest fruit of wisdom is this,-- the knowing those two things,
 and not departing from them. The richest fruit of propriety is this,-- the
 ordering and adorning those two things. The richest fruit of music is
 this,-- the rejoicing in those two things. When they are rejoiced in, they
 grow. Growing, how can they be repressed?  When they come to this state
 that they cannot be repressed, then unconsciously the feet begin to dance
 and the hands to move.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'By Shun's completely fulfilling everything by which a parent could
 be served, Kû-sâu was brought to find delight in what was good.
 When Kû-sâu was brought to find that delight, the whole kingdom
 was transformed. When Kû-sâu was brought to find that delight,
 all fathers and sons in the kingdom were established in their respective
 duties. This is called great filial piety.'</p>
