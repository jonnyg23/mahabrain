 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 19</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Po-î would not allow his eyes to look on a bad
 sight, nor his ears to listen to a bad sound. He would not serve a prince
 whom he did not approve, nor command a people whom he did not esteem. In a
 time of good government he took office, and on the occurrence of confusion
 he retired. He could not bear to dwell either in a court from which a
 lawless government emanated, or among lawless people. He considered his
 being in the same place with a villager, as if he were to sit amid mud and
 coals with his court robes and court cap. In the time of Châu he
 dwelt on the shores of the North sea, waiting the purification of the
 kingdom. Therefore when men now hear the character of Po-î, the
 corrupt become pure, and the weak acquire determination.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Î Yin said, "Whom may I not serve? My serving him makes him my
 sovereign. What people may I not command? My commanding them makes them my
 people." In a time of good government he took office, and when confusion
 prevailed, he also took office. He said, "Heaven's plan in the production
 of mankind is this:-- that they who are first informed should instruct
 those who are later in being informed, and they who first apprehend
 principles should instruct those who are slower in doing so. I am the one
 of Heaven's people who has first apprehended;-- I will take these
 principles and instruct the people in them." He thought that among all the
 people of the kingdom, even the common men and women, if there were any who
 did not share in the enjoyment of such benefits as Yâo and Shun
 conferred, it was as if he himself pushed them into a ditch;-- for he took
 upon himself the heavy charge of the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Hûi of Liû-hsiâ was not ashamed to serve an impure
 prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to
 employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out
 his principles. When dismissed and left without office, he did not murmur.
 When straitened by poverty, he did not grieve. When thrown into the company
 of village people, he was quite at ease and could not bear to leave them.
 He had a saying, "You are you, and I am I. Although you stand by my side
 with breast and arms bare, or with your body naked, how can you defile me?"
 Therefore when men now hear the character of Hûi of
 Liü-hsiâ, the mean become generous, and the niggardly become
 liberal.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'When Confucius was leaving Ch'î, he strained off with his
 hand the water in which his rice was being rinsed, took the rice, and went
 away. When he left Lû, he said, "I will set out by-and-by:"-- it was
 right he should leave the country of his parents in this way. When it was
 proper to go away quickly, he did so; when it was proper to delay, he did
 so; when it was proper to keep in retirement, he did so; when it was proper
 to go into office, he did so:-- this was Confucius.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Mencius said,'Po-î among the sages was the pure one; Î
 Yin was the one most inclined to take office; Hûi of
 Liû-hsiâ was the accommodating one; and Confucius was the
 timeous one.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'In Confucius we have what is called a complete concert. A complete
 concert is when the large bell proclaims the commencement of the music, and
 the ringing stone proclaims its close. The metal sound commences the
 blended harmony of all the instruments, and the winding up with the stone
 terminates that blended harmony. The commencing that harmony is the work of
 wisdom. The terminating it is the work of sageness.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'As a comparison for wisdom, we may liken it to skill, and as a
 comparison for sageness, we may liken it to strength;-- as in the case of
 shooting at a mark a hundred paces distant. That you reach it is owing to
 your strength, but that you hit the mark is not owing to your
 strength.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Pêi-kung Î asked Mencius, saying, 'What was the
 arrangement of dignities and emoluments determined by the House of
 Châu?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'The particulars of that arrangement cannot be
 learned, for the princes, disliking them as injurious to themselves, have
 all made away with the records of them. Still I have learned the general
 outline of them.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The S<span class="small01">ON OF</span> H<span class="small01">EAVEN
 </span> constituted one dignity; the <span class="small01">KUNG</span>
 one; the <span class="small01">HÂU</span> one; the 
 <span class="small01">PÂI</span> one; and the 
 <span class="small01">TSZE</span> and the <span class="small01">NAN</span>
 each one of equal rank:-- altogether making five degrees of rank. The 
 <span class="small01">RULER</span> again constituted one dignity; the 
 <span class="small01">CHIEF MINISTER</span> one; the 
 <span class="small01">GREAT OFFICERS</span> one; the 
 <span class="small01">SCHOLARS OF THE FIRST CLASS</span> one; 
 <span class="small01">THOSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS</span> one; and 
 <span class="small01">THOSE OF THE LOWEST CLASS</span> one:-- altogether 
 making six degrees of dignity.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'To the Son of Heaven there was allotted a territory of a thousand
 lî square. A Kung and a Hâu had each a hundred lî square.
 A Pâi had seventy lî, and a Tsze and a Nan had each fifty
 lî. The assignments altogether were of four amounts. Where the
 territory did not amount to fiftylî, the chief could not have access
 himself to the Son of Heaven. His land was attached to some Hâu-ship,
 and was called a <span class="small01">FÛ-YUNG</span>.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'The Chief ministers of the Son of Heaven received an amount of
 territory equal to that of a Hâu; a Great officer received as much as
 a Pâi; and a scholar of the first class as much as a Tsze or a
 Nan.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'In a great State, where the territory was a hundred lî square,
 the ruler had ten times as much income as his Chief ministers; a Chief
 minister four times as much as a Great officer; a Great officer twice as
 much as a scholar of the first class; a scholar of the first class twice as
 much as one of the middle; a scholar of the middle class twice as much as
 one of the lowest; the scholars of the lowest class, and such of the common
 people as were employed about the government offices, had for their
 emolument as much as was equal to what they would have made by tilling the
 fields.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'In a State of the next order, where the territory was seventy
 lî square, the ruler had ten times as much revenue as his Chief
 minister; a Chief minister three times as much as a Great officer; a Great
 officer twice as much as a scholar of the first class; a scholar of the
 first class twice as much as one of the middle; a scholar of the middle
 class twice as much as one of the lowest; the scholars of the lowest class,
 and such of the common people as were employed about the government
 offices, had for their emolument as much as was equal to what they would
 have made by tilling the fields.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'In a small State, where the territory was fifty lî square, the
 ruler had ten times as much revenue as his Chief minister; a Chief minister
 had twice as much as a Great officer; a Great officer twice as much as a
 scholar of the highest class; a scholar of the highest class twice as much
 as one of the middle; a scholar of the middle class twice as much as one of
 the lowest; scholars of the lowest class, and such of the common people as
 were employed about the government offices, had the same emolument;-- as
 much, namely, as was equal to what they would have made by tilling the
 fields.</p>
 
 <p>9. 'As to those who tilled the fields, each husbandman received a
 hundred mâu. When those mâu were manured, the best husbandmen
 of the highest class supported nine individuals, and those ranking next to
 them supported eight. The best husbandmen of the second class supported
 seven individuals, and those ranking next to them supported six; while
 husbandmen of the lowest class only supported five. The salaries of the
 common people who were employed about the government offices were regulated
 according to these differences.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask the principles of
 friendship.' Mencius replied, 'Friendship should be maintained without any
 presumption on the ground of one's superior age, or station, or the
 circumstances of his relatives. Friendship with a man is friendship with
 his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'There was Mang Hsien, chief of a family of a hundred chariots. He
 had five friends, namely, Yo-chang Chiû, Mû Chung, and three
 others whose names I have forgotten. With those five men Hsien maintained a
 friendship, because they thought nothing about his family. If they had
 thought about his family, he would not have maintained his friendship with
 them.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Not only has the chief of a family of a hundred chariots acted thus.
 The same thing was exemplified by the sovereign of a small State. The duke
 Hûi of Pî said, "I treat Tsze-sze as my Teacher, and Yen Pan as
 my Friend. As to Wang Shun and Ch'ang Hsî, they serve me."</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Not only has the sovereign of a small State acted thus. The same
 thing has been exemplified by the sovereign of a large State. There was the
 duke P'ing of Tsin with Hâi T'ang:-- when T'ang told him to come into
 his house, he came; when he told him to be seated, he sat; when he told him
 to eat, he ate. There might only be coarse rice and soup of vegetables, but
 he always ate his fill, not daring to do otherwise. Here, however, he
 stopped, and went no farther. He did not call him to share any of Heaven's
 places, or to govern any of Heaven's offices, or to partake of any of
 Heaven's emoluments. His conduct was but a scholar's honouring virtue and
 talents, not the honouring them proper to a king or a duke.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Shun went up to court and saw the sovereign, who lodged him as his
 son-in-law in the second palace. The sovereign also enjoyed there Shun's
 hospitality. Alternately he was host and guest. Here was the sovereign
 maintaining friendship with a private man.</p>
 
 <p>6. Respect shown by inferiors to superiors is called giving to the noble
 the observance due to rank. Respect shown by superiors to inferiors is
 called giving honour to talents and virtue. The rightness in each case is
 the same.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask what
 feeling of the mind is expressed in the presents of friendship?' Mencius
 replied, 'The feeling of respect.'</p>
 
 <p>2. 'How is it,' pursued Chang, 'that the declining a present is
 accounted disrespectful?' The answer was, 'When one of honourable rank
 presents a gift, to say in the mind, "Was the way in which he got this
 righteous or not? I must know this before I can receive it;"-- this is
 deemed disrespectful, and therefore presents are not declined.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Wan Chang asked again, 'When one does not take on him in so many
 express words to refuse the gift, but having declined it in his heart,
 saying, "It was taken by him unrighteously from the people," and then
 assigns some other reason for not receiving it;-- is not this a proper
 course?' Mencius said, 'When the donor offers it on a ground of reason, and
 his manner of doing so is according to propriety;-- in such a case
 Confucius would have received it.'</p>
 
 <p>4. Wan Chang said, 'Here now is one who stops and robs people outside
 the gates of the city. He offers his gift on a ground of reason, and does
 so in a manner according to propriety;-- would the reception of it so
 acquired by robbery be proper?' Mencius replied, 'It would not be proper.
 in "The Announcement to Kang" it is said, "When men kill others, and roll
 over their bodies to take their property, being reckless and fearless of
 death, among all the people there are none but detest them:"-- thus, such
 characters are to be put to death, without waiting to give them warning.
 Yin received this rule from Hsiâ and Châu received it from Yin.
 It cannot be questioned, and to the present day is clearly acknowledged.
 How can the grift of a robber be received?'</p>
 
 <p>5. Chang said, 'The princes of the present day take from their people
 just as a robber despoils his victim. Yet if they put a good face of
 propriety on their gifts, then the superior man receives them. I venture to
 ask how you explain this.' Mencius answered, 'Do you think that, if there
 should arise a truly royal sovereign, he would collect the princes of the
 present day, and put them all to death? Or would he admonish them, and
 then, on their not changing their ways, put them to death? Indeed, to call
 every one who takes what does not properly belong to him a robber, is
 pushing a point of resemblance to the utmost, and insisting on the most
 refined idea of righteousness. When Confucius was in office in Lû,
 the people struggled together for the game taken in hunting, and he also
 did the same. If that struggling for the captured game was proper, how much
 more may the gifts of the princes be received!'</p>
 
 <p>6. Chang urged, 'Then are we to suppose that when Confucius held office, it
 was not with the view to carry his doctrines into practice?' 'It was with
 that view,' Mencius replied, and Chang rejoined, 'If the practice of his
 doctrines was his business, what had he to do with that struggling for the
 captured game?' Mencius said, 'Confucius first rectified his vessels of
 sacrifice according to the registers, and did not fill them so rectified
 with food gathered from every quarter.' 'But why did he not go away?' He
 wished to make a trial of carrying his doctrines into practice. When
 that trial was sufficient to show that they could be practised and
 they were still not practised, then he went away, and thus it was
 that he never completed in any State a residence of three years.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Confucius took office when he saw that the practice of his doctrines
 was likely; he took office when his reception was proper; he took office
 when he was supported by the State. In the case of his relation to
 Chî Hwan, he took office, seeing that the practice of his doctrines
 was likely. With the duke Ling of Wei he took office, because his reception
 was proper. With the duke Hsiâo of Wei he took office, because he was
 maintained by the State.'</p>
