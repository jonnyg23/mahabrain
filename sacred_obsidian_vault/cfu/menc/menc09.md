 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 9</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. When the prince, afterwards duke Wan of T'ang, had to go to
 Ch'û, he went by way of Sung, and visited Mencius.</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius discoursed to him how the nature of man is good, and when
 speaking, always made laudatory reference to Yâo and Shun.</p>
 
 <p>3. When the prince was returning from Ch'û, he again visited
 Mencius. Mencius said to him, 'Prince, do you doubt my words? The path is
 one, and only one.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Ch'ang Chi'en said to duke King of Ch'î, "They were men. I am
 a man. Why should I stand in awe of them?" Yen Yüan said, "What kind
 of man was Shun? What kind of man am I? He who exerts himself will also
 become such as he was." Kung-Ming Î said, "King Wan is my teacher.
 How should the duke of Châu deceive me by those words?"</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Now, T'ang, taking its length with its breadth, will amount, I
 suppose, to fifty lî. It is small, but still sufficient to make a
 good State. It is said in the Book of History, "If medicine do not raise a
 commotion in the patient, his disease will not be cured by it."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. When the duke Ting of T'ang died, the prince said to Yen Yû,
 'Formerly, Mencius spoke with me in Sung, and in my mind I have never
 forgotten his words. Now, alas! this great duty to my father devolves upon
 me; I wish to send you to ask the advice of Mencius, and then to proceed to
 its various services'</p>
 
 <p>2. Zan Yû accordingly proceeded to Tsâu, and consulted
 Mencius. Mencius said, 'Is this not good? In discharging the funeral duties
 to parents, men indeed feel constrained to do their utmost. The philosopher
 Tsang said, "When parents are alive, they should be served according to
 propriety; when they are dead, they should be buried according to
 propriety; and they should be sacrificed to according to propriety:-- this
 may be called filial piety." The ceremonies to be observed by the princes I
 have not learned, but I have heard these points:-- that the three years'
 mourning, the garment of coarse cloth with its lower edge even, and the
 eating of congee, were equally prescribed by the three dynasties, and
 binding on all, from the sovereign to the mass of the people.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Zan Yû reported the execution of his commission, and the prince
 determined that the three years' mourning should be observed. His aged
 relatives, and the body of the officers, did not wish that it should be so,
 and said, 'The former princes of Lû, that kingdom which we honour,
 have, none of them, observed this practice, neither have any of our own
 former princes observed it. For you to act contrary to their example is not
 proper. Moreover, the History says,-- "In the observances of mourning and
 sacrifice, ancestors are to be followed," meaning that they received those
 things from a proper source to hand them down.'</p>
 
 <p>4. The prince said again to Zan Yû, 'Hitherto, I have not given
 myself to the pursuit of learning, but have found my pleasure in
 horsemanship and sword-exercise, and now I don't come up to the wishes of
 my aged relatives and the officers. I am afraid I may not be able to
 discharge my duty in the great business that I have entered on; do you
 again consult Mencius for me.' On this, Zan Yû went again to
 Tsâu, and consulted Mencius. Mencius said, 'It is so, but he may not
 seek a remedy in others, but only in himself. Confucius said, "When a
 prince dies, his successor entrusts the administration to the prime
 minister. He sips the congee. His face is of a deep black. He approaches
 the place of mourning, and weeps. Of all the officers and inferior
 ministers there is not one who will presume not to join in the lamentation,
 he setting them this example. What the superior loves, his inferiors will
 be found to love exceedingly. The relation between superiors and inferiors
 is like that between the wind and grass. The grass must bend when the wind
 blows upon it." The business depends on the prince.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Zan Yû returned with this answer to his commission, and the
 prince said, 'It is so. The matter does indeed depend on me.' So for five
 months he dwelt in the shed, without issuing an order or a caution. All the
 officers and his relatives said, 'He may be said to understand the
 ceremonies.' When the time of interment arrived, they came from all
 quarters of the State to witness it. Those who had come from other States
 to condole with him, were greatly pleased with the deep dejection of his
 countenance and the mournfulness of his wailing and weeping.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius about the proper way of
 governing a kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius said, 'The business of the people may not be remissly attended
 to. It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "In the day-light go and gather the grass,<br>
 And at night twist your ropes;<br>
 Then get up quickly on the roofs;--<br>
 Soon must we begin sowing again the grain."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">3. 'The way of the people is this:-- If they have a
 certain livelihood, they will have a fixed heart; if they have not a
 certain livelihood, they have not a fixed heart. If they have not a fixed
 heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of
 self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license.
 When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish
 them:-- this is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping
 the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Therefore, a ruler who is endowed with talents and virtue will be
 gravely complaisant and economical, showing a respectful politeness to his
 ministers, and taking from the people only in accordance with regulated
 limits.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Yang Hû said, "He who seeks to be rich will not be benevolent.
 He who wishes to be benevolent will not be rich."</p>
 
 <p>6. 'The sovereign of the Hsiâ dynasty enacted the fifty mâu
 allotment, and the payment of a tax. The founder of the Yin enacted the
 seventy mâu allotment, and the system of mutual aid. The founder of
 the Châu enacted the hundred mâu allotment, and the share
 system. In reality, what was paid in all these was a tithe. The share
 system means mutual division. The aid system means mutual dependence.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Lung said, "For regulating the lands, there is no better system than
 that of mutual aid, and none which is not better than that of taxing. By
 the tax system, the regular amount was fixed by taking the average of
 several years. In good years, when the grain lies about in abundance, much
 might be taken without its being oppressive, and the actual exaction would
 be small. But in bad years, the produce being not sufficient to repay the
 manuring of the fields, this system still requires the taking of the full
 amount. When the parent of the people causes the people to wear looks of
 distress, and, after the whole year's toil, yet not to be able to nourish
 their parents, so that they proceed to borrowing to increase their means,
 till the old people and children are found lying in the ditches and
 water-channels:-- where, in such a case, is his parental relation to the
 people?"</p>
 
 <p>8. 'As to the system of hereditary salaries, that is already observed in
 T'ang.</p>
 
 <p>9. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "May the rain come down on our public field,
 And then upon our private fields!" 
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">It is only in the system of mutual aid that there is a
 public field, and from this passage we perceive that even in the Châu
 dynasty this system has been recognised.</p>
 
 <p>10. 'Establish hsiang, hsü, hsio, and hsiâo,-- all those
 educational institutions,-- for the instruction of the people. The name
 hsiang indicates nourishing as its object; hsiâo, indicates teaching;
 and hsü indicates archery. By the Hsiâ dynasty the name
 hsiâo was used; by the Yin, that of hsü; and by the Châu,
 that of hsiang. As to the hsio, they belonged to the three dynasties, and
 by that name. The object of them all is to illustrate the human relations.
 When those are thus illustrated by superiors, kindly feeling will prevail
 among the inferior people below.</p>
 
 <p>11. 'Should a real sovereign arise, he will certainly come and take an
 example from you; and thus you will be the teacher of the true
 sovereign.</p>
 
 <p>12. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 Although Châu. was an old country,<br>
 It received a new destiny."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">That is said with reference to king Wan. Do you
 practise those things with vigour, and you also will by them make new your
 kingdom.'</p>
 
 <p>13. The duke afterwards sent Pî Chan to consult Mencius about the
 nine-squares system of dividing the land. Mencius said to him, 'Since your
 prince, wishing to put in practice a benevolent government, has made choice
 of you and put you into this employment, you must exert yourself to the
 utmost. Now, the first thing towards a benevolent government must be to lay
 down the boundaries. If the boundaries be not defined correctly, the
 division of the land into squares will not be equal, and the produce
 available for salaries will not be evenly distributed. On this account,
 oppressive rulers and impure ministers are sure to neglect this defining of
 the boundaries. When the boundaries have been defined correctly, the
 division of the fields and the regulation of allowances may be determined
 by you, sitting at your ease.</p>
 
 <p>14. 'Although the territory of T'Ang is narrow and small, yet there must
 be in it men of a superior grade, and there must be in it country-men. If
 there were not men of a superior grade, there would be none to rule the
 country-men. If there were not country-men, there would be none to support
 the men of superior grade.</p>
 
 <p>15. 'I would ask you, in the remoter districts, observing the
 nine-squares division, to reserve one division to be cultivated on the
 system of mutual aid, and in the more central parts of the kingdom, to make
 the people pay for themselves a tenth part of their produce.</p>
 
 <p>16. 'From the highest officers down to the lowest, each one must have
 his holy field, consisting of fifty mâu.</p>
 
 <p>17. 'Let the supernumerary males have their twenty-five mâu.</p>
 
 <p>18. 'On occasions of death, or removal from one dwelling to another,
 there will be no quitting the district. In the fields of a district, those
 who belong to the same nine squares render all friendly offices to one
 another in their going out and coming in, aid one another in keeping watch
 and ward, and sustain one another in sickness. Thus the people are brought
 to live in affection and harmony.</p>
 
 <p>19. 'A square lî covers nine squares of land, which nine squares
 contain nine hundred mâu. The central square is the public field, and
 eight families, each having its private hundred mâu, cultivate in
 common the public field. And not till the public work is finished, may they
 presume to attend to their private affairs. This is the way by which the
 country-men are distinguished from those of a superior grade.</p>
 
 <p>20. 'Those are the great outlines of the system. Happily to modify and
 adapt it depends on the prince and you.'</p>
