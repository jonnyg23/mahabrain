 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 5</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Kung-sun Ch'âu asked Mencius, saying, 'Master, if you were to
 obtain the ordering of the government in Ch'î, could you promise
 yourself to accomplish anew such results as those realized by Kwan Chung
 and Yen?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius said, 'You are indeed a true man of Ch'î. You know
 about Kwan Chung and Yen, and nothing more,</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Some one asked Tsang Hsî, saying, "Sir, to which do you give
 the superiority,-- to yourself or to Tsze-lû?" Tsang Hsî looked
 uneasy, and said, "He was an object of veneration to my grandfather."
 "Then," pursued the other, "Do you give the superiority to yourself or to
 Kwan Chung?" Tsang Hsî, flushed with anger and displeased, said, "How
 dare you compare me with Kwan Chung? Considering how entirely Kwan Chung
 possessed the confidence of his prince, how long he enjoyed the direction
 of the government of the State, and how low, after all, was what he
 accomplished,-- how is it that you liken me to him?"</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Thus,' concluded Mencius, 'Tsang Hsî would not play Kwan Chung,
 and is it what you desire for me that I should do so?'</p>
 
 <p>5. Kung-sun Ch'âu said, 'Kwan Chung raised his prince to be the
 leader of all the other princes, and Yen made his prince illustrious, and
 do you still think it would not be enough for you to do what they did?'</p>
 
 <p>6. Mencius answered, 'To raise Ch'î to the royal dignity would be
 as easy as it is to turn round the hand.'</p>
 
 <p>7. 'So!' returned the other. 'The perplexity of your disciple is hereby
 very much increased. There was king Wan, moreover, with all the virtue
 which belonged to him; and who did not die till he had reached a hundred
 years:-- and still his influence had not penetrated throughout the kingdom.
 It required king Wû and the duke of Châu to continue his
 course, before that influence greatly prevailed. Now you say that the royal
 dignity might be so easily obtained:-- is king Wan then not a sufficient
 object for imitation?'</p>
 
 <p>8. Mencius said, 'How can king Wan be matched? From T'ang to
 Wû-ting there had appeared six or seven worthy and sage sovereigns.
 The kingdom had been attached to Yin for a long time, and this length of
 time made a change difficult.  Wû-ting had all the princes coming to
 his court, and possessed the kingdom as if it had been a thing which he
 moved round in his palm. Then, Châu was removed from Wû-ting by
 no great interval of time. There were still remaining some of the ancient
 families and of the old manners, of the influence also which had emanated
 from the earlier sovereigns, and of their good government. Moreover, there
 were the viscount of Wei and his second son, their Royal Highnesses
 Pî-kan and the viscount of Ch'î, and Kâo-ko, all men of
 ability and virtue, who gave their joint assistance to Châu in his
 government. In consequence of these things, it took a long time for him to
 lose the throne. There was not a foot of ground which he did not possess.
 There was not one of all the people who was not his subject. So it was on
 his side, and king Wan at his beginning had only a territory of one hundred
 square lî. On all these accounts, it was difficult for him
 immediately to attain to the royal dignity.</p>
 
 <p>9. 'The people of Ch'î have a saying-- "A man may have wisdom and
 discernment, but that is not like embracing the favourable opportunity. A
 man may have instruments of husbandry, but that is not like waiting for the
 farming seasons." The present time is one in which the royal dignity may be
 easily attained.</p>
 
 <p>10. 'In the flourishing periods of the Hsiâ, Yin, and Châu
 dynasties, the royal domain did not exceed a thousand lî, and
 Ch'î embraces so much territory. Cocks crow and dogs bark to one
 another, all the way to the four borders of the State:-- so Ch'î
 possesses the people. No change is needed for the enlarging of its
 territory: no change is needed for the collecting of a population. If its
 ruler will put in practice a benevolent government, no power will be able
 to prevent his becoming sovereign.</p>
 
 <p>11. 'Moreover, never was there a time farther removed than the present
 from the rise of a true sovereign: never was there a time when the
 sufferings of the people from tyrannical government were more intense than
 the present. The hungry readily partake of any food, and the thirsty of any
 drink.'</p>
 
 <p>12. 'Confucius said, "The flowing progress of virtue is more rapid than
 the transmission of royal orders by stages and couriers."</p>
 
 <p>13. 'At the present time, in a country of ten thousand chariots, let
 benevolent government be put in practice, and the people will be delighted
 with it, as if they were relieved from hanging by the heels. With half the
 merit of the ancients, double their achievements is sure to be realized. It
 is only at this time that such could be the case.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Kung-sun Ch'âu asked Mencius, saying, 'Master, if you were to be
 appointed a high noble and the prime minister of Ch'î, so as to be able
 to carry your principles into practice, though you should thereupon raise
 the ruler to the headship of all the other princes, or even to the royal
 dignity, it would not be to be wondered at.-- In such a position would your
 mind be perturbed or not?' Mencius replied, 'No. At forty, I attained to an
 unperturbed mind.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Ch'âu said, 'Since it is so with you, my Master, you are far
 beyond Mang Pan.' 'The mere attainment,' said Mencius, 'is not difficult.
 The scholar Kâo had attained to an unperturbed mind at an earlier
 period of life than I did.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Ch'âu asked, 'Is there any way to an unperturbed mind?' The
 answer was, 'Yes.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Pî-kung Yû had this way of nourishing his valour:-- He
 did not flinch from any strokes at his body. He did not turn his eyes aside
 from any thrusts at them. He considered that the slightest push from any
 one was the same as if he were beaten before the crowds in the
 market-place, and that what he would not receive from a common man in his
 loose large garments of hair, neither should he receive from a prince of
 ten thousand chariots. He viewed stabbing a prince of ten thousand chariots
 just as stabbing a fellow dressed in cloth of hair. He feared not any of
 all the princes. A bad word addressed to him be always returned.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Mang Shih-shê had this way of nourishing his valour:-- He
 said, "I look upon not conquering and conquering in the same way. To
 measure the enemy and then advance; to calculate the chances of victory and
 then engage:-- this is to stand in awe of the opposing force. How can I
 make certain of conquering? I can only rise superior to all fear."</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Mang Shih-shê resembled the philosopher Tsang. Pî-kung
 Yû resembled Tsze-hsiâ. I do not know to the valour of which of
 the two the superiority should be ascribed, but yet Mang Shih-shê
 attended to what was of the greater importance.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Formerly, the philosopher Tsang said to Tsze-hsiang, "Do you love
 valour? I heard an account of great valour from the Master. It speaks
 thus:-- 'If, on self-examination, I find that I am not upright, shall I not
 be in fear even of a poor man in his loose garments of hair-cloth? If, on
 self-examination, I find that I am upright, I will go forward against
 thousands and tens of thousands.'"</p>
 
 <p>8. Yet, what Mang Shih-shê maintained, being merely his physical
 energy, was after all inferior to what the philosopher Tsang maintained,
 which was indeed of the most importance.'</p>
 
 <p>9. Kung-sun Ch'âu said, 'May I venture to ask an explanation from
 you, Master, of how you maintain an unperturbed mind, and how the
 philosopher Kâo does the same?' Mencius answered,'Kâo says,--
 "What is not attained in words is not to be sought for in the mind; what
 produces dissatisfaction in the mind, is not to be helped by
 passion-effort." This last,-- when there is unrest in the mind, not to seek
 for relief from passion-effort, may be conceded. But not to seek in the
 mind for what is not attained in words cannot be conceded. The will is the
 leader of the passion-nature. The passion-nature pervades and animates the
 body. The will is first and chief, and the passion-nature is subordinate to
 it. Therefore I say,-- Maintain firm the will, and do no violence to the
 passion-nature.'</p>
 
 <p>10. Ch'âu observed, 'Since you say-- "The will is chief, and the
 passion-nature is subordinate," how do you also say, "Maintain firm the
 will, and do no violence to the passion-nature?"' Mencius replied, 'When
 it is the will alone which is active, it moves the passion-nature. When it
 is the passion-nature alone which is active, it moves the will. For
 instance now, in the case of a man falling or running, that is from the
 passion-nature, and yet it moves the mind.'</p>
 
 <p>11. 'I venture to ask,' said Ch'âu again, 'wherein you, Master,
 surpass Kâo.' Mencius told him, 'I understand words. I am skilful in
 nourishing my vast, flowing passion-nature.'</p>
 
 <p>12. Ch'âu pursued, 'I venture to ask what you mean by your vast,
 flowing passion-nature!' The reply was, 'It is difficult to describe
 it.</p>
 
 <p>13. 'This is the passion-nature:-- It is exceedingly great, and
 exceedingly strong. Being nourished by rectitude, and sustaining no injury,
 it fills up all between heaven and earth.</p>
 
 <p>14. 'This is the passion-nature:-- It is the mate and assistant of
 righteousness and reason. Without it, man is in a state of starvation.</p>
 
 <p>15. 'It is produced by the accumulation of righteous deeds; it is not to
 be obtained by incidental acts of righteousness. If the mind does not feel
 complacency in the conduct, the nature becomes starved. I therefore said,
 "Kâo has never understood righteousness, because he makes it
 something external."</p>
 
 <p>16. 'There must be the constant practice of this righteousness, but
 without the object of thereby nourishing the passion-nature. Let not the
 mind forget its work, but let there be no assisting the growth of that
 nature. Let us not be like the man of Sung. There was a man of Sung, who
 was grieved that his growing corn was not longer, and so he pulled it up.
 Having done this, he returned home, looking very stupid, and said to his
 people, "I am tired to-day. I have been helping the corn to grow long." His
 son ran to look at it, and found the corn all withered. There are few in
 the world, who do not deal with their passion-nature, as if they were
 assisting the corn to grow long. Some indeed consider it of no benefit to
 them, and let it alone:-- they do not weed their corn. They who assist it
 to grow long, pull out their corn. What they do is not only of no benefit
 to the nature, but it also injures it.'</p>
 
 <p>17. Kung-sun Ch'âu further asked, 'What do you mean by saying that
 you understand whatever words you hear?' Mencius replied, 'When words are
 one-sided, I know how the mind of the speaker is clouded over. When words
 are extravagant, I know how the mind is fallen and sunk. When words are
 all-depraved, I know how the mind has departed from principle. When words
 are evasive, I know how the mind is at its wit's end. These evils growing
 in the mind, do injury to government, and, displayed in th government, are
 hurtful to the conduct of affairs. When a Sage shall again arise, he will
 certainly follow my words.'</p>
 
 <p>18. On this Ch'âu observed, 'Tsâi Wo and Tsze-kung were
 skilful in speaking. Zan Niû, the disciple Min, and Yen Yüan,
 while their words were good, were distinguished for their virtuous conduct.
 Confucius united the qualities of the disciples in himself, but still he
 said, "In the matter of speeches, I am not competent."-- Then, Master, have
 you attained to be a Sage?'</p>
 
 <p>19. Mencius said, 'Oh! what words are these? Formerly Tsze-kung asked
 Confucius, saying, "Master, are you a Sage?" Confucius answered him, "A
 Sage is what I cannot rise to. I learn without satiety, and teach without
 being tired." Tsze-kung said, "You learn without satiety:-- that shows your
 wisdom. You teach without being tired:-- that shows your benevolence.
 Benevolent and wise:-- Master, you ARE a Sage." Now, since Confucius would
 not allow himself to be regarded as a Sage, what words were those?'</p>
 
 <p>20. Ch'âu said, 'Formerly, I once heard this:-- Tsze-hsiâ,
 Tsze-yû, and Tsze-chang had each one member of the Sage. Zan
 Niû, the disciple Min, and Yen Yüan had all the members, but in
 small proportions. I venture to ask,-- With which of these are you pleased
 to rank yourself?'</p>
 
 <p>21. Mencius replied, 'Let us drop speaking about these, if you
 please.'</p>
 
 <p>22. Ch'âu then asked, 'What do you say of Po-î and Î
 Yin?' 'Their ways were different from mine,' said Mencius. 'Not to serve a
 prince whom he did not esteem, nor command a people whom he did not
 approve; in a time of good government to take office, and on the occurrence
 of confusion to retire:-- this was the way of Po-î. To say-- "Whom
 may I not serve? My serving him makes him my ruler. What people may I not
 command? My commanding them makes them my people." In a time of good
 government to take office, and when disorder prevailed, also to take
 office:-- that was the way of Î Yin. When it was proper to go into
 office, then to go into it; when it was proper to keep retired from office,
 then to keep retired from it; when it was proper to continue in it long,
 then to continue in it long - when it was proper to withdraw from it
 quickly, then to withdraw quickly:-- that was the way of Confucius. These
 were all sages of antiquity, and I have not attained to do what they did.
 But what I wish to do is to learn to be like Confucius.'</p>
 
 <p>23. Ch'âu said, 'Comparing Po-î and Î Yin with
 Confucius, are they to be placed in the same rank?' Mencius replied, 'No.
 Since there were living men until now, there never was another
 Confucius.'</p>
 
 <p>24. Ch'âu said, 'Then, did they have any points of agreement with
 him?' The reply was,-- 'Yes. If they had been sovereigns over a hundred
 lî of territory, they would, all of them, have brought all the
 princes to attend in their court, and have obtained the throne. And none of
 them, in order to obtain the throne, would have committed one act of
 unrighteousness, or put to death one innocent person. In those things they
 agreed with him.'</p>
 
 <p>25. Ch'âu said, 'I venture to ask wherein he differed from them.'
 Mencius replied, 'Tsâi Wo, Tsze-kung, and Yû Zo had wisdom
 sufficient to know the sage. Even had they been ranking themselves low,
 they would not have demeaned themselves to flatter their favourite.</p>
 
 <p>26. 'Now, Tsâi Wo said, "According to my view of our Master, he
 was far superior to Yâo and Shun."</p>
 
 <p>27. 'Tsze-kung said, "By viewing the ceremonial ordinances of a prince,
 we know the character of his government. By hearing his music, we know the
 character of his virtue. After the lapse of a hundred ages I can arrange,
 according to their merits, the kings of a hundred ages;-- not one of them
 can escape me. From the birth of mankind till now, there has never been
 another like our Master."</p>
 
 <p>28. 'Yû Zo said, "Is it only among men that it is so? There is the
 Ch'î-lin among quadrupeds, the Fang-hwang among birds, the T'âi
 mountain among mounds and ant-hills, and rivers and seas among rain-pools.
 Though different in degree, they are the same in kind. So the sages among
 mankind are also the same in kind. But they stand out from their fellows,
 and rise above the level, and from the birth of mankind till now, there
 never has been one so complete as Confucius."'</p>
