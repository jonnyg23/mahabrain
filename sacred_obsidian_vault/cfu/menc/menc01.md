 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 1</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius went to see king Hûi of Liang.</p>
 
 <p>2. The king said, 'Venerable sir, since you have not counted it far to
 come here, a distance of a thousand lî, may I presume that you are
 provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius replied, 'Why must your Majesty use that word "profit?"  What
 I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and
 these are my only topics.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'If your Majesty say, "What is to be done to profit my kingdom?" the
 great officers will say, "What is to be done to profit our families?" and
 the inferior officers and the common people will say, "What is to be done
 to profit our persons?"  Superiors and inferiors will try to snatch this
 profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered.  In the
 kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his sovereign shall be
 the chief of a family of a thousand chariots.  In the kingdom of a thousand
 chariots, the murderer of his prince shall be the chief of a family of a
 hundred chariots.  To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a
 thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, but if righteousness
 be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without
 snatching all.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents.
 There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after
 consideration.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Let your Majesty also say, "Benevolence and righteousness, and let
 these be your only themes."  Why must you use that word -- "profit?".</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius, another day, saw King Hûi of Liang.  The king went and
 stood with him by a pond, and, looking round at the large geese and deer,
 said, 'Do wise and good princes also find pleasure in these things?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'Being wise and good, they have pleasure in these
 things.  If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they
 do not find pleasure.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 <blockquote>
 He measured out and commenced his marvellous tower;<br>
 He measured it out and planned it.<br>
 The people addressed themselves to it,<br>
 And in less than a day completed it.<br>
 When he measured and began it, he said to them --<br>
 <span class="tab">Be not so earnest:</span><br>
 But the multitudes came as if they had been his children.<br>
 The king was in his marvellous park;<br>
 The does reposed about,<br>
 The does so sleek and fat:<br>
 And the white birds came glistening.<br>
 The king was by his marvellous pond;<br>
 How full was it of fishes leaping about!"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>'King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and his
 pond, and yet the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower "the
 marvellous tower," calling the pond "the marvellous pond," and rejoicing
 that he had his large deer, his fishes, and turtles.  The ancients caused
 the people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could
 enjoy it.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, "O sun, when wilt thou
 expire?  We will die together with thee." The people wished for Chieh's
 death, though they should die with him.  Although he had towers, ponds,
 birds, and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. King Hûi of Liang said, 'Small as my virtue is, in the
 government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to the utmost.  If the
 year be bad on the inside of the river, I remove as many of the people as I
 can to the east of the river, and convey grain to the country in the
 inside.  When the year is bad on the east of the river, I act on the same
 plan.  On examining the government of the neighboring kingdoms, I do not
 find that there is any prince who exerts his mind as I do.  And yet the
 people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease, nor do my people
 increase.  How is this?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'Your majesty is fond of war; -- let me take an
 illustration from war. -- The soldiers move forward to the sound of the
 drums; and after their weapons have been crossed, on one side they throw
 away their coats of mail, trail their arms behind them, and run.  Some run
 a hundred paces and stop; some run fifty paces and stop.  What would you
 think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred
 paces?' The kind said, 'They should not do so.  Though they did not run a
 hundred paces, yet they also ran away.' 'Since your Majesty knows this,'
 replied Mencius, 'you need not hope that your people will become more
 numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will
 be more than can be eaten.  If close nets are not allowed to enter the
 pools and ponds, the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed.
 If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the proper time,
 the wood will be more than can be used.  When the grain and fish and
 turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be
 used, this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their
 dead, without any feeling against any.  This condition, in which the people
 nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any,
 is the first step of royal government.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five
 mâu, and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk.  In keeping
 fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected,
 and persons of seventy years may eat flesh.  Let there not be taken away
 the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred
 mâ, and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall
 not suffer from hunger.  Let careful attention be paid to education in
 schools, inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties, and
 grey-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their
 backs or on their heads.  It never has been that the ruler of a State,
 where such results were seen, -- persons of seventy wearing silk and eating
 flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunder nor cold,
 -- did not attain to the royal dignity.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not make any
 restrictive arrangements.  There are people dying from famine on the roads,
 and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them.  When people
 die, you say, "It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year." In what
 does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying --
 "It was not I; it was the weapon?"  Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame
 on the year, and instantly from all the nation the people will come to
 you.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. King Hûi of Liang said, 'I wish quietly to receive your
 instructions.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'Is there any difference between killing a man with a
 stick and with a sword ?'  The king said, 'There is no difference!</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with the
 style of government? 'There is no difference,' was the reply.</p>
 
 <p>4. Mencius then said, 'In your kitchen there is fat meat; in your
 stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of
 hunger, and on the wilds there are those who have died of famine.
 This is leading on beasts to devour men.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When a
 prince, being the parent of his people, administers his government so as
 to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is his
 parental relation to the people?'</p>
 
 <p>6. Chung-nî said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden
 images to bury with the dead? So he said, because that man made the
 semblances of men, and used them for that purpose:-- what shall be thought
 of him who causes his people to die of hunger?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. King Hûi of Liang said, 'There was not in the nation a stronger
 State than Tsin, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me,
 on the east we have been defeated by Ch'i, and then my eldest son perished;
 on the west we have lost seven hundred lî of territory to  Ch'in; and
 on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ch'û. I have
 brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to
 wipe it away, once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish
 this?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'With a territory which is only a hundred lî 
 square, it is possible to attain to the royal dignity.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the
 people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the
 taxes and levies light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep,
 and the weeding of them be carefully attended to, and that the
 strong-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial
 piety, fraternal respectfulness, sincerity, and truthfulness, serving
 thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their
 elders and superiors,-- you will then have a people who can be employed,
 with sticks which they have prepared, to oppose the strong mail and sharp
 weapons of the troops of Ch'in and Ch'û.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they
 cannot plough and weed their fields, in order to support their parents.
 Their parents suffer from cold and hunger. Brothers, wives, and children
 are separated and scattered abroad.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Those rulers, as it were, drive their people into pit-falls, or drown
 them.  Your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose
 your Majesty?</p>
 
 <p>6. 'In accordance with this is the saying,-- "The benevolent has
 no enemy."  I beg your Majesty not to doubt what I say.'</p>
