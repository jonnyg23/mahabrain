 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 3</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Chwang Pâ'o, seeing Mencius, said to him, 'I had an interview with
 the king. His Majesty told me that he loved music, and I was not prepared
 with anything to reply to him. What do you pronounce about that love of
 music?' Mencius replied, 'If the king's love of music were very great, the
 kingdom of Ch'î would be near to a state of good government!'</p>
 
 <p>2. Another day, Mencius, having an interview with the king, said, 'Your
 Majesty, I have heard, told the officer Chwang, that you love music;-- was
 it so?' The king changed colour, and said, 'I am unable to love the music
 of the ancient sovereigns; I only love the music that suits the manners of
 the present age.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius said, 'If your Majesty's love of music were very great,
 Ch'î would be near to a state of good government! The music of the
 present day is just like the music of antiquity, as regards effecting
 that.'</p>
 
 <p>4. The king said, 'May I hear from you the proof of that?'  Mencius asked,
 'Which is the more pleasant,-- to enjoy music by yourself alone, or to enjoy
 it with others?' 'To enjoy it with others,' was the reply. 'And which is
 the more pleasant,-- to enjoy music with a few, or to enjoy it with many?'
 'To enjoy it with many.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Mencius proceeded, 'Your servant begs to explain what I have said about
 music to your Majesty.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Now, your Majesty is having music here.-- The people hear the noise of
 your bells and drums, and the notes of your fifes and pipes, and they all,
 with aching heads, knit their brows, and say to one another, "That's how
 our king likes his music! But why does he reduce us to this extremity of
 distress?-- Fathers and sons cannot see one another. Elder brothers and
 younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad."
 Now, your Majesty is hunting here.-- The people hear the noise of your
 carriages and horses, and see the beauty of your plumes and streamers, and
 they all, with aching heads, knit their brows, and say to one another,
 "That's how our king likes his hunting! But why does he reduce us to this
 extremity of distress?-- Fathers and sons cannot see one another. Elder
 brothers and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and
 scattered abroad." Their feeling thus is from no other reason but that you
 do not allow the people to have pleasure as well as yourself.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Now, your Majesty is having music here. The people hear the noise of
 your bells and drums, and the notes of your fifes and pipes, and they all,
 delighted, and with joyful looks, say to one another, "That sounds as if
 our king were free from all sickness! If he were not, how could he enjoy
 this music?" Now, your Majesty is hunting here.-- The people hear the noise
 of your carriages and horses, and see the beauty of your plumes and
 streamers, and they all, delighted, and with joyful looks, say to one
 another, "That looks as if our king were free from all sickness! If he
 were not, how could he enjoy this hunting?" Their feeling thus is from no
 other reason but that you cause them to have their pleasure as you have
 yours.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'If your Majesty now will make pleasure a thing common to the people
 and yourself, the royal sway awaits you.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked, 'Was it so, that the park of 
 king Wan contained seventy square lî?' Mencius replied, 'It is so 
 in the records.'</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Was it so large as that?' exclaimed the king. 'The people,' said
 Mencius, 'still looked on it as small.' The king added, 'My park contains
 only forty square lî, and the people still look on it as large. How
 is this?' 'The park of king Wan,' was the reply, 'contained seventy square
 lî, but the grass-cutters and fuel-gatherers had the privilege of
 entrance into it; so also had the catchers of pheasants and hares. He
 shared it with the people, and was it not with reason that they looked on
 it as small?</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When I first arrived at the borders of your kingdom, I inquired about
 the great prohibitory regulations, before I would venture to enter it; and
 I heard, that inside the barrier-gates there was a park of forty square
 lî, and that he who killed a deer in it, was held guilty of the same
 crime as if he had killed a man.-- Thus those forty square lî are a
 pitfall in the middle of the kingdom. Is it not with reason that the people
 look upon them as large?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked, saying, 'Is there any way to
 regulate one's maintenance of intercourse with neighbouring kingdoms?'
 Mencius replied, 'There is. But it requires a perfectly virtuous prince to
 be able, with a great country, to serve a small one,-- as, for instance,
 T'ang served Ko, and king Wan served the Kwan barbarians.  And it requires
 a wise prince to be able, with a small country, to serve a large one,-- as
 the king T'âi served the Hsün-yü, and Kâu-ch'ien
 served Wû.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'He who with a areat State serves a small one, delights in Heaven. He
 who with a small State serves a large one, stands in awe of Heaven. He who
 delights in Heaven, will affect with his love and protection the whole
 kingdom. He who stands in awe of Heaven, will affect with his love and
 protection his own kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "I fear the Majesty of Heaven, and
 will thus preserve its favouring decree."'</p>
 
 <p>4. The king said,'A great saying! But I have an infirmity;-- I love
 valour.'</p>
 
 <p>5. I beg your Majesty,' was the reply, 'not to love small valour. 
 If a man brandishes his sword, looks fiercely, and says, "How dare
 he withstand me?"-- this is the valour of a common man, who can be the
 opponent only of a single individual. I beg your Majesty to greaten it.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The king blazed with anger,<br>
 And he marshalled his hosts,<br>
 To stop the march to Chü,<br>
 To consolidate the prosperity of Châu,<br>
 To meet the expectations of the nation."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">This was the valour of king Wan. King Wan, in one 
 burst of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'In the Book of History it is said, "Heaven having produced the
 inferior people, made for them rulers and teachers, with the purpose that
 they should be assisting to God, and therefore distinguished them
 throughout the four quarters of the land. Whoever are offenders, and
 whoever are innocent, here am I to deal with them. How dare any under
 heaven give indulgence to their refractory wills?" There was one man
 pursuing a violent and disorderly course in the kingdom, and king Wû
 was ashamed of it. This was the valour of king Wû. He also, by one
 display of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'Let now your Majesty also, in one burst of anger, give repose to all
 the people of the kingdom. The people are only afraid that your Majesty
 does not love valour.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The king Hsüan of Ch'î had an interview with Mencius in the
 Snow palace, and said to him, 'Do men of talents and worth likewise find
 pleasure in these things?' Mencius replied, 'They do; and if people
 generally are not able to enjoy themselves, they condemn their 
 superiors.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'For them, when they cannot enjoy themselves, to condemn their
 superiors is wrong, but when the superiors of the people do not make
 enjoyment a thing common to the people and themselves, they also do
 wrong.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When a ruler rejoices in the joy of his people, they also rejoice in
 his joy; when he grieves at the sorrow of his people, they also grieve at
 his sorrow. A sympathy of joy will pervade the kingdom ; a sympathy of
 sorrow will do the same:-- in such a state of things, it cannot be but that
 the ruler attain to the royal dignity.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'î asked the minister Yen,
 saying, "I wish to pay a visit of inspection to Chwan-fû, and
 Cbâo-wû, and then to bend my course southward along the shore,
 till I come to Lang-yê. What shall I do that my tour may be fit to be
 compared with the visits of inspection made by the ancient sovereigns?"</p>
 
 <p>5. 'The minister Yen replied, "An excellent inquiry! When the Son of
 Heaven visited the princes, it was called a tour of inspection, that is, be
 surveyed the States under their care. When the princes attended at the
 court of the Son of Heaven, it was called a report of office, that is, they
 reported their administration of their offices. Thus, neither of the
 proceedings was without a purpose. And moreover, in the spring they
 examined the ploughing, and supplied any deficiency of seed; in the autumn
 they examined the reaping, and supplied any deficiency of yield. There is
 the saying of the Hsiâ dynasty,-- If our king do not take his ramble,
 what will become of our happiness? If our king do not make his excursion,
 what will become of our help? That ramble, and that excursion, were a
 pattern to the princes.</p>
 
 <p>6. '"Now, the state of things is different.-- A host marches in
 attendance on the ruler, and stores of provisions are consumed. The hungry
 are deprived of their food, and there is no rest for those who are called
 to toil. Maledictions are uttered by one to another with eyes askance, and
 the people proceed to the commission of wickedness. Thus the royal
 ordinances are violated, and the people are oppressed, and the supplies of
 food and drink flow away like water. The rulers yield themselves to the
 current, or they urge their way against it; they are wild; they are utterly
 lost:-- these things proceed to the grief of the inferior princes.</p>
 
 <p>7. '"Descending along with the current, and forgetting to return,
 is what I call yielding to it. Pressing up against it, and forgetting to
 return, is what I call urging their way against it. Pursuing the chase
 without satiety is what I call being wild. Delighting in wine without
 satiety is what I call being lost.</p>
 
 <p>8. '"The ancient sovereigns had no pleasures to which they gave
 themselves as on the flowing stream; no doings which might be so
 characterized as wild and lost.</p>
 
 <p>9. '"It is for you, my prince, to pursue your course."'</p>
 
 <p>10. 'The duke Ching was pleased. He issued a proclamation throughout his
 State, and went out and occupied a shed in the borders. From that time he
 began to open his granaries to supply the wants of the people, and calling
 the Grand music-master, he said to him-- "Make for me music to suit a
 prince and his minister pleased with each other." And it was then that the
 Chî-shâo and Chio-shâo were made, in the words to which
 it was said, "Is it a fault to restrain one's prince?" He who restrains his
 prince loves his prince.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The king Hsüan of Ch'î said, 'People all tell me to pull
 down and remove the Hall of Distinction. Shall I pull it down, or stop the
 movement for that object?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'The Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to
 the sovereigns. If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal
 government, then do not pull it down.'</p>
 
 <p>3. The king said, 'May I hear from you what the true royal government
 is?' 'Formerly,' was the reply, 'king Wan's government of Ch'î was as
 follows:-- The husbandmen cultivated for the government one-ninth of the
 land; the descendants of officers were salaried; at the passes and in the
 markets, strangers were inspected, but goods were not taxed: there were no
 prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs; the wives and children of
 criminals were not involved in their guilt. There were the old and
 wifeless, or widowers; the old and husbandless, or widows; the old and
 childless, or solitaries ; the young and fatherless, or orphans:-- these
 four classes are the most destitute of the people, and have none to whom
 they can tell their wants, and king Wan, in the institution of his
 government with its benevolent action, made them the first objects of his
 regard, as it is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The rich may get through life well;<br>
 But alas! for the miserable and solitary!"'
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>4. The king said, 'O excellent words!' Mencius said, 'Since your Majesty
 deems them excellent, why do you not practise them?' 'I have an infirmity,'
 said the king; 'I am fond of wealth.' The reply was, 'Formerly,
 Kung-lîu was fond of wealth. It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "He reared his ricks, and filled his granaries,<br>
 He tied up dried provisions and grain,<br>
 In bottomless bags, and sacks,<br>
 That he might gather his people together, and glorify his State.<br>
 With bows and arrows all-displayed,<br>
 With shields, and spears, and battle-axes, large and small,<br>
 He commenced his march."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">In this way those who remained in their old seat had
 their ricks and granaries, and those who marched had their bags of
 provisions. It was not till after this that he thought he could begin his
 march. If your Majesty loves wealth, give the people power to gratify the
 same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal
 sway?'</p>
 
 <p>5. The king said, 'I have an infirmity; I am fond of beauty.' The reply
 was, 'Formerly, king T'âi was fond of beauty, and loved his wife. It is
 said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 Kû-kung T'an-fû
 Came in the morning, galloping his horse, 
 By the banks of the western waters,
 As far as the foot of Ch'î hill,
 Along with the lady of Chiang;
 They came and together chose the site for their settlement."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">At that time, in the seclusion of the house, there were
 no dissatisfied women, and abroad, there were no unmarried men. If your
 Majesty loves beauty, let the people be able to gratify the same feeling,
 and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said to the king Hsüan of Ch'î, 'Suppose that one
 of your Majesty's ministers were to entrust his wife and children to the
 care of his friend, while he himself went into Ch'û to travel, and
 that, on his return, he should find that the friend had let his wife and
 children suffer from cold and hunger;-- how ought he to deal with him?' The
 king said, 'He should cast him off.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius proceeded, 'Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not
 regulate the officers under him, how would you deal with him?' The king
 said, 'Dismiss him.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius again said, 'If within the four borders of your kingdom there
 is not good government, what is to be done?' The king looked to the right
 and left, and spoke of other matters.</p>
