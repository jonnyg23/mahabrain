 AOF 0 The Articles of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints. History of the Church, Vol. 4, pp. 535-541

 AOF 1 We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and
in the Holy Ghost.

 AOF 2 We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for
Adam's transgression.

 AOF 3 We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be
saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.

 AOF 4 We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are:
first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by
immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of
the Holy Ghost.

 AOF 5 We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the
laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and
administer in the ordinances thereof.

 AOF 6 We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive
Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so
forth.

 AOF 7 We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions,
healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.

 AOF 8 We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated
correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.

 AOF 9 We believe all that God has revealed, all the He does now reveal, and we
believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to
the Kingdom of God.

 AOF 10 We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of
the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American
continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the
earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.

 AOF 11 We claim the privilege of worshiping the Almighty God according to the
dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them
worship how, where, or what they may.

 AOF 12 We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and
magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.

 AOF 13 We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in
doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of
Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things,
and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous,
lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.
