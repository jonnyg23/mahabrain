 <p align="left">T'HE next task which we have assigned ourselves, is to show from 
 the ancient pyramid of Cheops that the true system of astronomy, as taught by God 
 to Abraham, was known to those who raised this mighty structure. To do this we desire 
 to draw attention and consider separately three points. </p>
 <p align="left">1st. The historical reasons we have for believing that Abraham superintended 
 the erection of this pyramid. </p>
 <p align="left">2d. The reasons why this vast structure was built, and the uses 
 for which it was designed. </p>
 <p align="left">3d. The direct evidences from the dimensions, form, etc., of the 
 pyramid of Cheops, that tend to prove that its builders were acquainted with the 
 laws that govern the starry worlds. </p>
 <p align="left">The Pharaoh, or king of Egypt, who is generally regarded as the 
 builder of the first pyramid, is known to secular history by the name of Cheops. 
 To him and his actions in closing the idolatrous temples of Egypt, we have referred 
 in a previous chapter, as well as to the statement of Herodotus, that the Egyptians 
 so detested his memory that they would not even mention his name. Hence he states, 
 "they commonly call the pyramids after Philition,[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>] 
 a shepherd, who at that time fed his flocks about the place." Remarking upon the 
 above statement, Mr. Proctor, the celebrated astronomer, writes: "The mention of 
 the shepherd Philition, who fed his flocks about the place where the great Pyramid 
 was built, is a singular feature of Herodotus' narrative. It reads like some strange 
 misinterpretation of the story related to him by the Egyptian priests. It is obvious 
 if the word Philition did not represent a people, but a person, this person must 
 have been very eminent and distinguished--a shepherd king--not a mere shepherd. 
 Rawlinson suggests that Philitis was probably a shepherd prince from Palestine, 
 perhaps of Philistine descent. Prof. Smyth comes to the conclusion that some She-mite 
 prince, 'a contemporary of, but rather older than the patriarch Abraham,' visited 
 Egypt at this time and obtained such influence over the mind of Cheops as to persuade 
 him to erect the pyramid. According to Smyth, the prince was no other than Melchizedek, 
 king of Salem, and the influence he exerted was supernatural. * * * It seems tolerably 
 clear that certain shepherd chiefs who came into Egypt during Cheops' reign were 
 connected in some way with the designing of the great pyramid. It is clear also 
 that they were men of a different religion from the Egyptians, and persauded Cheops 
 to abandon the religion of his people." </p>
 <p align="left">If Josephus be correct, Professor Smyth's deductions regarding Melchizedek 
 are wrong, for the former says that the Egyptians were taught astronomy by Abraham; 
 without Melchizedek followed Abraham into Egypt instead of preceding him, which, 
 though possible, we have no account of in any of the sacred writings. </p>
 <p align="left">Mr. Proctor further writes: "In the first place, the history of 
 the pyramids shows that the erection of the first great pyramid was in all probability 
 either suggested to Cheops by wise men who visited Egypt from the east, or else 
 some important information conveyed to him by such visitors caused him to conceive 
 the idea of building the pyramid. In either case we may suppose, as the history 
 indeed suggests, that these learned men, whoever they may have been, remained in 
 Egypt to superintend the erection of the structure. * * * The astronomical peculiarities 
 which form so significant a portion of the great pyramid were probably provided 
 for entirely under the direction of the shepherd chiefs who had exerted so strange 
 an influence upon the mind of king Cheops. * * * It is certain in any case that 
 they [the shepherd chiefs] were opposed to idolatry; and we have thus some means 
 of inferring who they were or whence they came. We know that one particular branch 
 of one particular race in the east was characterized by a most marked hatred of 
 idolatry in all its forms. * * * And the Bible record shows that members of this 
 Chaldean family visited Egypt from time to time. They were shepherds too, which 
 accords with the account of Herodotus. * * * But having formed the opinion on grounds 
 sufficiently assured, that the strangers who visited Egypt and superintended the 
 building of the great pyramid were kinsmen of the patriarch Abraham, it is not very 
 difficult to decide what was the subject respecting which they had such exact information. 
 They or their parents had come from the land of the Chaldeans, and they were doubtless 
 learned in all the wisdom of their Chaldean kinsmen. They were masters, in fact, 
 of the astronomy of their day, a science for which the Chaldeans had shown, from 
 the earliest ages, the most remarkable aptitude. * * * It is highly probable that 
 the astronomical knowledge of the Chaldeans in the days of Terah and Abraham was 
 much more accurate than that possessed by the Greeks in the time of Hipparchus." 
 Mr. Proctor ultimately comes to the conclusion that "the stranger called Philition 
 by Herodotus, may, for aught that appears, have been Abraham himself." It is a matter 
 of secondary moment, in this consideration, whether Abraham himself or some other 
 divinely inspired man, was the actual) architect of the great pyramid; it is sufficient 
 to know, which it itself testifies, that whoever that builder was, he was acquainted 
 with the same grand astronomical truths that the Book of Abraham states the Lord 
 revealed to that patriarch, and which, at the time Joseph Smith translated the papyrus, 
 were unknown to modern scientists. </p>
 <p align="left">Our next inquiries are, with regard to the causes or reasons that 
 led to the erection of the pyramids, and to the purposes for which they were used.
 </p>
 <p align="left">Various theories have been advanced on these points. Some have supposed 
 that these vast structures were associated with the religious rites of the ancient 
 Egyptians; others have suggested that they combined the purposes of tombs and temples; 
 again, that they were astronomical observatories; also that they had primarily astrological 
 import. It has also been argued that they were defences against the sands of the 
 great desert, or places of refuge during the excessive overflows of the Nile; the 
 idea has also been advanced that they were granaries, somewhat after the manner 
 of those erected under the direction of Joseph, the Israelite. A very little reflection 
 will manifest that some of the suggestions are entirely untenable. Take for instance 
 the notion that they were granaries. If so, what a vast waste of material, how entirely 
 does their structure and form unsuit them for such a purpose. As wise a people as 
 their builders must have been would scarcely have constructed a mountain of masonry, 
 with two or three relatively small rooms therein, for such a purpose. There is some 
 show of reason for believing that some of them were tombs and temples combined, 
 but this will not hold good with regard to the pyramid of Cheops. Nothing found 
 therein has given the least ground-work for the supposition that it was used for 
 sepulchral purposes. In what is called the king's chamber was found an empty stone 
 chest or coffer, without a lid; but in form, ornament and material it is entirely 
 different to the usual sarcophagus used by the ancient Egyptians for the reception 
 of the embalmed dead. </p>
 <p align="left">Two of the reasons advanced above, as applied to the pyramids of 
 Cheops, are worthy of our consideration. </p>
 <p align="left">1st. That it was an astronomical observatory. </p>
 <p align="left">2d. That it was associated with the religion of the ancient Egyptians.
 </p>
 <p align="left">The reasons for believing it to have been built as an observatory 
 are cogent and numerous. There can be no doubt that in many respects it was intended 
 by its builders to typify astronomical truths; evidence in proof of which will be 
 hereafter adduced. It has been suggested that the granite coffer found in what is 
 now called the king's chamber (simply that it may have a distinctive name) was filled, 
 in whole or in part, as circumstances required, with water, and that the face of 
 the heavens was reflected therein, through the slanting passages that pointed directly 
 to the polar star. That this coffer was used as a receptacle for water is highly 
 probable, from the fact that a well tapping the waters of the Nile is found in the 
 pyramid.[<a name="text2" href="#foot2">2</a>] In this inner chamber, surrounded 
 by this vast mass of masonry, removed as far as possible from the atmospheric and 
 electric perturbations existing on the earth's surface, it is argued that using 
 the water in the coffer as a mirror, the most accurate observations could be taken 
 that were then possible. This idea we deem untenable, as it appears to us that the 
 inclines and angles in the passages would render such reflection next to impossible. 
 According to certain Arabian historians "there were placed in the great pyramid 
 divers celestial spheres and stars, and what they severally operate in their aspects, 
 and the perfumes which are to be used to them, and the books which treat of these 
 matters." </p>
 <p align="left">The evidences that it was an edifice erected for sacred purposes 
 are not so strong as those that can be brought forward in favor of its astronomical 
 uses. We incline to the opinion that it combined both purposes; but we are scarcely 
 willing to admit that if it was a temple, it was erected by a believer in the faith 
 that looked upon Osiris and associate deities as the true Gods. The style of this 
 vast structure and the temples erected by the followers of that faith are the antipodes 
 of each other. The perfect purity of the pyramid from every idolatrous ornament 
 and reference as well as of all attempts to glorify the wealth, might or wisdom 
 of its human builders, makes it differ entirely, generically and radically from 
 all ordinary Egyptian temples, pictured from top to bottom with the praises of their 
 false gods. Besides, it is asserted, as before shown that the man who built this 
 pyramid shut up the temples, a very inconsistent act, if he were a worshiper at 
 their shrines. We hold the opinion that if this pyramid was used for religious purposes 
 at all, it was in connection with the doctrines taught by Abraham, and if the Lord 
 permitted the patriarch to preach to the Egyptians that principle of the Gospel 
 known to us as baptism for the dead, we can well imagine the use to which the coffer 
 in the king's chamber was applied. Indeed, the idea that the coffer was a baptismal 
 font has been suggested by more than one Gentile writer,[<a name="text3" href="#foot3">3</a>] 
 but if it were used especially in the ordinances for the salvation of those who 
 had passed from this sphere of action the symbolism would be almost perfect; for 
 we have here a font enshrined in the heart of an artificial mountain, that could 
 be reached only through a straight, stony gate and by a long, narrow and mysterious 
 passage. How accurately these typify the valley of the shadow of death, and the 
 grave, and how perfect the imagery of going into the heart of this solid mountain 
 to act for those who had been laid away in the sepulchre. There is one thing that 
 greatly strengthens the idea that if its uses were religious, they were Abrahamic. 
 It is that this very coffer is of the exact capacity of the ark of the covenant 
 of Moses' day, also that an originally marked oft portion of the chamber in which 
 the coffer stands is of the exact capacity of the brazen sea, or baptismal font, 
 in Solomon's Temple. Surely there is something more than a mere coincidence in this.
 </p>
 <p align="left">We next desire to draw attention to some of the important truths 
 relating to the earth and the heavens, revealed by God to Abraham (as stated in 
 part in his book), of which the generality of mankind of that and every succeeding 
 age have remained in ignorance, even to the day in which we live, but with which 
 the builders of the great pyramid were evidently acquainted. Amongst these and kindred 
 truths, as manifested in the construction of this vast artificial mountain, we may 
 mention the law of planetary and solar motion, the distance of the earth from its 
 centre--the sun, the exact size, shape and density of our terraquous globe, the 
 precise length of its solar orbit, as also the value of the sacred cubit as the 
 unit of measurement. Writing on this subject, in a recent number of the <i>Juvenile 
 Instructor, </i>Elder Joseph L. Barfoot (Beth) remarks: "There has been a great 
 deal of guess-work heretofore about the use of the great pyramid at Geezah. The 
 prevailing opinion was that it had been intended for a tomb for one of the ancient 
 kings of Egypt, Discoveries have recently been made which have led to the inference 
 that it had far more important uses, in fact that it was an observatory, built upon 
 mathematical principles, and designed to perpetuate, through all succeeding time, 
 a correct knowledge of the heavens and the earth. * * * It is found that the measure 
 by which the proportions of the great pyramid were determined is an exact proportional 
 to the axis of the earth itself. This is a very important thing, for it is thus 
 in harmony with natural standards of measure, such as used by Deity. This pyramid 
 standard measure is called the sacred cubit, as it is found that the standard divinely 
 recognized through Moses was the same as that of the pyramid. The sacred cubit was 
 the pyramid cubit." </p>
 <p align="left">Now then, with this fact before our eyes, let us turn to the Book 
 of Abraham. The explanation of Fig. 1, of the circular disc, reads thus: "Kolob, 
 signifying the first creation, nearest to the celestial, or the residence of God. 
 First in government, the last pertaining to the measurement of time. <i>The measurement, 
 according to celestial time; which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit. 
 One day in Kolob is equal to a thousand years, </i>according to the measurement 
 of this earth, which is-called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh." </p>
 <p align="left">If we understand the above aright it means that with the Gods the 
 unit of the measurement of time is one of the days of Kolob, or one thousand of 
 our years, "which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit," or, that as one 
 of Kolob's days is the unit of celestial time, so the cubit is the unit of celestial 
 measurement, by which the size of the worlds are measured when the foundations thereof 
 are laid; by which the distances of the suns and planets are regulated, and all 
 the creations of the Holy Ones controlled. That this cubit, which was the unit of 
 measurement of holy things on this earth--the ark of the tabernacle, the temple, 
 etc., was also the unit of measurement when this earth was created, is further proven 
 by the following extract from Elder Barfoot's writings: "The sacred cubit is in 
 length rather more than twenty-five (25.025) inches of English measure. <i>It is 
 one ten-millionth part of the radius of the axis of the earth at the poles;" </i>
 that is, it is 10,000,000 sacred cubits from the centre of the earth to either the 
 north or south pole, or 20,000,000 through the earth from pole to pole. Brother 
 Barfoot continues: "No higher or more reliable standard of extreme precision could 
 be given to man than the measure of the polar radius, for all other terrestrial 
 and celestial things relating to the earth are in proportion to this natural standard. 
 So important are the discoveries made recently by means of the sacred cubit that 
 men are surprised to think that the uses of the great pyramid have been so long 
 concealed." To this remark of our esteemed brother we answer, the Lord had not turned 
 the key; and here we pause for a moment to ask, and ask of all the world, how could 
 Joseph Smith have possibly become acquainted with this great truth if God had not 
 revealed it unto him. This one truth alone of which all the world was ignorant, 
 of itself, in its revelation by him, proves him to have been a prophet of the Most 
 High God. </p>
 <p align="left">We now turn to some of the peculiarities of the great pyramid, to 
 which passing reference has before been made, gleaning our information from the 
 writings of Petrie, Osborn, Smyth, Mackay, and others. We would observe, however, 
 that our space prevents us from giving any but the more prominent references.
 </p>
 <p align="left">1st. For parts cosmocally and symbolically significant, the metric 
 standard of the great pyramid is the sacred cubit, exactly one ten-millionth of 
 the earth's polar radius, the only natural standard of both unique and extreme precision; 
 a standard of divine origination, primeval, and preserved in the least disturbed 
 line of Abraham's family (the Arabs) to the present day. (Mr. Wm. Petrie.) </p>
 <p align="left">Does not this testimony almost word for word confirm the statements 
 of the Book of Abraham? </p>
 <p align="left">2d. The direction of the strait entrance passage, inclining at 26° 
 20' into the north side of the pyramid, was such that at the reputed date of its 
 establishment[<a name="text4" href="#foot4">4</a>] this direction was that of the 
 primeval pole star, then at its lower culmination, while Alcyone[<a name="text5" href="#foot5">5</a>] 
 (the centre of, or governing planet which controls our solar system) then near the 
 celestial equator, was at its upper culmination, or on the same meridian at midnight 
 of the autumnal equinox. This definite combination cannot recur for 25,898 years; 
 it marked the date of the pyramid, and of the year of the Pleiades," a commencement 
 of a natural chronologic era, traditions of which have remained in most times and 
 countries, or to put it in another shape, "the meridian of the primeval pole star 
 became rigidly stationary on Alcyone at the date of the great pyramid, after which 
 it commenced to retrograde." </p>
 <p align="left">3d. A thousand billion times the pyramid's weight, carefully computed, 
 is the mass of the whole earth, namely, six thousand and fifty trillions of British 
 tons. </p>
 <p align="left">4th. The annual circuit of the earth--that is, one year, is represented 
 by the length of the base circuit of the pyramid, and each day of twenty-four hours 
 by four cubits. Or <i>each day </i>of our year is represented by <i>one cubit
 </i>on each of the four sides of the pyramid, each side representing in its whole 
 length one year of this earth. Or <i>one day to a cubit </i>as stated in the Book 
 of Abraham. Can any one explain to us why this pyramid were so built that <i>one 
 cubit </i>should represent <i>one day </i>exactly, if Abraham did not teach this 
 to them? and if he did, then we have called the pyramids to bear witness to the 
 truth of his book, which they most assuredly do, and at the same time to the truth 
 of its translation by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Napoleon Bonaparte, when he gathered 
 his armies in Egypt, pointing to the pyramids, told his legions that forty centuries 
 looked down upon them. We have also called these mighty monuments of the past to 
 bear record to the unity of revealed truth. Admit the above to be facts, and how 
 is it possible to deny that Joseph Smith received his wisdom from a divine source, 
 and consequently was a prophet of God. </p>
 <p align="left">Mr. Mackay, writing (1870) on facts in astronomy, states that the 
 great pyramid has been "investigated and explored as no other monument, ancient 
 and modern, ever was; and the indefatigable explorers have been rewarded with an 
 abundant harvest of the most brilliant discoveries. One of these, discovered by 
 Mr. Petrie, is the clear indication that the architect of this pyramid knew the 
 mean distance of the sun from the earth with an exactitude to which modern science 
 never approached till within the last seven years. * * * The best lineal and angular 
 measurements have been combined by W. Petrie, who shows therefrom that the original 
 height of the great pyramid, from the pavement to its base, was 486.25 British feet; 
 this multiplied by the ninth power of <i>ten--i.e.</i>, 1,000,000,000 gives a result 
 of 92,093,000 British miles, for the mean distance of the sun. The latest collective 
 result of science reckons the probable truth to be between 91,970,000, and 92,150,000; 
 while the great pyramid gives 92,093,000 miles,[<a name="text6" href="#foot6">6</a>] 
 being completely within these minimum uncertainties of science." This, by other 
 references, has been proven to have been no accident, but intended by the builders, 
 as it constitutes but a small part of the evidence discovered in this direction.
 </p>
 <p align="left">Here, then, we have evidence that the ancient Egyptians had a knowledge 
 of the true distance from the sun. That they obtained this knowledge only by divine 
 light is evidenced by the abortive attempts of other ancient investigators to determine 
 this question. For instance, in the days of Herodotus, (B. C. 500,) it was thought 
 that the sun was distant only some eight or ten miles; fifty years later it was 
 estimated by Anaxagoras at 1800; 150 years later, 5,300,000 was the computed distance; 
 1900 years later, Kepler calculated the distance at 26,400,000 miles; in A. D. 1750 
 the supposed distance was increased to 81,650,000, and so, from the dawn of creation 
 until now, uninspired men have been groping after this truth, and even to-day they 
 are not entirely satisfied that the exact measurement has been obtained. </p>
 <p align="left">It is unnecessary, for our present purpose, to enter into all the 
 details of the varied geometrical, metrical, mechanical, geographical, astronomical 
 and cosmical references found in the great pyramid, all of which, it is vigorously 
 asserted, have been tested and proven correct by the very best scientific ability; 
 nor will space permit us to follow a rapidly-increasing class of writers who find 
 in its lines, angles and markings a prophetic history of the world; but we should 
 scarcely feel satisfied if we did not summarize a few of its leading characteristics. 
 "We find,"[<a name="text7" href="#foot7">7</a>] to use the language of Dr. J. A. 
 Seiss, of Philadelphia," a perfect geometric figure, so framed that the four sides 
 of its base bear the same proportion to its vertical height as the circumference 
 of a circle to its radius; that each of its base lines measures the even ten-millionth 
 part of the semi-axis of the earth just as many times as there are days in the year; 
 that its height multiplied by the ninth power of ten gives the mean distance between 
 the earth and its great centre of light; that its unit of length is the even five 
 hundredth millionth part of the polar diameter of the globe we inhabit; that its 
 two diagonals of base measure in inches the precise number of years in the great 
 processional cycle; that its bulk of masonry is an even proportion of the weight 
 of the earth itself, and that its setting and shaping are squared and oriented[<a name="text8" href="#foot8">8</a>] 
 with microscopic accuracy." Regarding the coffer in the king's chamber he continues: 
 "We perceive in it a most accurately-shaped standard of measures and proportions, 
 its sides and bottom cubically identical with its internal space, the length of 
 its two sides to its height as a circle to its diameter, its exterior volume just 
 twice the dimension of its bottom, and its whole measure just the fiftieth part 
 of the chamber in which it was put when the edifice was built," for it could not 
 have been gotten into the chamber after the building was finished, by reason of 
 the size and angles of the entrance passages. Now, then, let us add to these facts 
 a statement by the same author, and we think our position regarding the veracity 
 of the portion of the Book of Abraham we have lastly been commenting upon is amply 
 vindicated. "Everywhere do we encounter the traditions of Abraham's skill in the 
 knowledge of the heavens, how he argued from his observation of the heavenly orbs, 
 and how he occupied himself in Egypt teaching the priests of Heliopolis in the lore 
 of the skies. Doubtless this was not the naked science of astronomy as the schools 
 conceive of it, but as respected the theological and Messianic truths symbolized 
 in these celestial hieroglyphics, in which, as in the more literal promises, he 
 rejoiced to see Christ's day, and saw it and was glad. (John, viii, 56.)" Which 
 testimony of the Savior's is in direct accord with the statements of the Book of 
 Abraham; nor need we be surprised thereat, when revelation, ancient and modern, 
 states that Enoch, and indeed other antediluvian patriarchs, saw not only "Christ's 
 day," but the world's history, even to the winding up scene. </p>
 <p align="left">Admitting that the shape of the pyramid, in connection with its 
 other references, has a prophetic import, it becomes a remarkable fact that this 
 stupendous four-sided monument, in this particular phase of its construction, typifies 
 the number of days, according to the reckoning of the Lord and of Kolob, between 
 the fall of man and the incarnation of our Savior (4000 years), and the time between 
 the date of its own construction and the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ 
 in the last days (also 4000 years), Two of the most important events then in the 
 future of the world's history, and known in the economy of God, the first as the 
 ushering in of "the dispensation of the fulness of time," the second as the ushering 
 in of "the dispensation of the fulness of times." </p>
