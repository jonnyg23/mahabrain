 <p align="center">INTRODUCTORY.--THE DISCOVERY AND SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF THE MUMMIES.--TRANSLATION 
 OF THE PAPYRUS BY THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH.</p>
 <p align="left">THE late republication of the pearl of great price has drawn renewed 
 attention to the Book of Abraham, which forms a portion of its contents. And as 
 but very little has ever been said by the Elders of the Church in advocacy of its 
 claims as an inspired record, written by one prophet of God in the infancy of the 
 earth's history, and translated by another prophet of the Most High in the dispensation 
 of the fulness of times, we think that a few chapters written to prove its genuineness 
 and divine origin, will not be without value to the Latter-day Saints, and to the 
 world at large. For while the people of God have said or written little in its defense, 
 there have been those opposed to the revelations of God in these days, who have 
 vigorously attacked it, who have styled its language "gibberish," and classed it 
 among the "pious frauds" that have so often disgraced the history of religion, Christian 
 and heathen. We hold, and we have confidence that we can prove, by history, science, 
 and in various other ways, that the Book of Abraham is exactly what it claims to 
 be, and that it was translated by the wisdom and power of God for the benefit of 
 the human family, by the Prophet Joseph Smith. </p>
 <p align="left">Before entering into the discussion of its contents, we deem it 
 advisable to say a few words with regard to the manner in which it fell into the 
 possession of our martyred Prophet. The account he gives in his history of this 
 incident, is to be found under date of December 30, 1835, (Vol. XV. <i>Millennial 
 Star,) </i>from which we condense: He states that the records from which the Book 
 of Abraham was translated were found in one of the catacombs, near the city of Thebes, 
 in Egypt, in the year 1831, by a French traveler named Antonio Sebolo, who had received 
 permission from Mehemet Ali, the then ruler of Egypt, to open it. After vast labor, 
 an entrance was effected on the 7th of July, 1831, and several hundred mummies discovered 
 therein, in various stages of decomposition. M. Sebolo obtained eleven of the best 
 preserved mummies and started with them for Paris, the capital of France. On the 
 way he was taken sick, and after an illness of ten days, died at Trieste. In his 
 will he left these valued remains of ancient Egyptian art to his nephew, Mr. M. 
 H. Chandler, and after various vicissitudes they came into this latter gentleman's 
 possession in April, 1833. He proceeded to make a living by their exhibition, and 
 traveled about the country for that purpose, reaching Kirtland July 3d, 1835. In 
 the meantime he had opened the coffins and found "that in connection with two of 
 the bodies was something rolled up with the same kind of linen, saturated with the 
 same bitumen, which, when examined, proved to be two rolls of papyrus." "Two or 
 three other small pieces of papyrus, with astronomical calculations, epitaphs, etc., 
 were found with others of the mummies." In Joseph's history is the following account 
 of Mr. C's visit to Kirtland. </p>
 <p align="left">"On the 3d of July Michael H. Chandler came to Kirtland to exhibit 
 some Egyptian mummies. There were four human figures, together with some two or 
 more rolls of papyrus covered with hieroglyphic figures and devices. As Mr. Chandler 
 had been told I could translate them, he brought me some of the characters, and 
 I gave him the interpretation, and like a gentleman he gave me the following certificate:
 </p>
 <p align="right">' KIRKLAND, July 6, 1835. </p>
 <p align="left">'This is to make known to all who may be desirous, concerning the 
 knowledge of Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., in deciphering the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic 
 characters in my possession, which I have, in many eminent cities, showed to the 
 most learned; and, from the information that I could ever learn, or meet with, I 
 find that of Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., to correspond in the most minute matters.
 </p>
 <p align="right">'MICHAEL H. CHANDLER, </p>
 <p align="right">' Traveling with, and proprietor of Egyptian mummies.' "[<b><a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a></b>]
 </p>
 <p align="left">The Prophet, a few days later, writes: "Soon after this some of 
 the Saints in Kirtland purchased the mummies and the papyrus, and I, with W. W. 
 Phelps and O. Cowdery as scribes, commenced the translation of some of the characters 
 or hieroglyphics, and much to our joy found that one of the rolls contained the 
 writings of Abraham, another the writings of Joseph of Egypt, etc., a more full 
 account of which will appear in their place as I proceed to examine and unfold them. 
 Truly we can say the Lord is beginning to reveal the abundance of peace and truth."
 </p>
 <p align="left">From this time it appears from the history that Joseph set himself 
 diligently to work to translate the records, as often as his other important duties 
 permitted. Under date of October 1st, he records in his journal: "This afternoon 
 I labored on the Egyptian alphabet, in company with Brothers O. Cowdery and W. W. 
 Phelps, and during the research, the principles of astronomy as understood by Father 
 Abraham and the ancients, unfolded to our understandings." It is desirable that 
 these dates and facts should be remembered, as they have an important bearing on 
 our future inquiries. Under date of October 7th, November 24th, and in other places, 
 he refers to his labors in translating the papyrus. He also makes frequent reference 
 to showing his friends these records, and of explaining to them their contents, 
 not only to those in the Church, but to numbers who were not members. We will simply 
 cite one instance. "December 16th, 1835. Elders McLellin, B. Young, and J. Carter 
 called and paid me a visit, with which I was much gratified. I exhibited and explained 
 the Egyptian records to them, and explained many things concerning the dealings 
 of God with the ancients, and the formation of the planetary system."[<a name="text2" href="#foot2">2</a>]
 </p>
 <p align="left">The next thing we deem in order is to give the Prophet's description 
 of the appearance of the papyrus, which description, we may remark in passing, is 
 identical with that of President John Taylor, who frequently saw them when in Brother 
 Joseph's possession. The latter writes:[<a name="text3" href="#foot3">3</a>] </p>
 <p align="left">"The record of Abraham and Joseph, found with the mummies, is beautifully 
 written on papyrus, with black, and a small part with red, ink or paint, in perfect 
 preservation. The characters are such as you find upon the coffins of mummies, hieroglyphics, 
 etc., with many characters or letters like the present (though probably not quite 
 so square) form of Hebrew, without points." </p>
 <p align="left">Before proceeding further, it will doubtless be desirable to give 
 a slight sketch of the contents of those portions of the Book of Abraham already 
 translated and published. It opens with a short account of his early life at the 
 home of his father in Ur of Chaldea, of the persecutions he suffered for righteousness' 
 sake from his idolatrous kindred, and of the causes that led him to leave Chaldea 
 for Canaan. It gives, at greater length than does the Bible, the covenants made 
 with him by the Almighty, and affords some exceedingly interesting details with 
 regard to the history of the priesthood in that early day. Further on an account 
 of Abraham's visit to Egypt is given, and the revelations of God to him, with regard 
 to the order of the planetary worlds, the condition of the spirits of mankind in 
 their pre-existent state, and a history of the creation of this earth are laid before 
 the reader in plain and simple, but inspired and soul inspiring language. No short 
 synopsis can give any idea of the beauty, grandeur and value of the truths made 
 manifest by the Most High to his friend and servant, Abraham; truths which the world, 
 to-day, in part ignores and partly comprehends. We suggest to our readers the study 
 of this important, though brief fragment, feeling assured that they will arise from 
 its perusal with a more exalted and more comprehensive realization of the power, 
 the glory and the love of God, than the study of any uninspired treatise could ever 
 give, no matter how beautiful its language, or how sublime its thoughts. </p>
 <p align="left">It is our intention, as we pass along, to take up the various subjects 
 treated in the Book of Abraham, and demonstrate the exact truthfulness of the record, 
 by the writings of historians, ancient and modern, by the discoveries of archaeologists, 
 Egyptiologists, astronomers and other scientists, and prove, we believe, beyond 
 the possibility of successful contradiction, that no element of fraud enters into 
 its composition. So remarkable have been the confirmatory evidences that we have 
 met in our investigations into this subject, that we are of the opinion that there 
 is not a book in existence whose genuineness can be more easily proven than can 
 that of the record of the Father of the Faithful. Being thus fully assured, we shall 
 lay the forthcoming chapters before our readers with the joyful assurance that they 
 will add to the already incontrovertible testimonies that Joseph Smith was a prophet, 
 seer and revelator, and servant of the Most High God. </p>
 <p align="left">We make this last statement advisedly, because it must be evident 
 to all who seriously consider the matter, that if the Book of Abraham as given to 
 us by Joseph Smith be true, it must have been translated by a greater than human 
 power. We well know that so far as the wisdom of this world is concerned, Joseph 
 Smith was an unlearned man, unskilled in the higher branches of science, with little 
 other knowledge than that which heaven conferred, but had he been a scientist of 
 the highest order the production of the Book of Abraham would be but little less 
 remarkable, as many of the truths taught therein (as we shall presently see) are 
 in advance of the times, and were as unknown to the sage as to the simpleton in 
 the year that the papyrus was translated, and indeed for many years afterwards. 
 Consequently, human learning and human wisdom could not give them to the world. 
 By some other power, which we claim was divine, they must have been revealed and 
 made manifest. </p>
