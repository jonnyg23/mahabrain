 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER X</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">ON THE DOWNWARD PATH</h1>
 <p align="left">During the last years of President Woodruff's life there had 
 been a slow decline of the feeling that it was necessary for self-protection that 
 the hierarchy should preserve a political control over the people. I cannot say 
 that the feeling had wholly passed. It had continued to show itself, here and there, 
 whenever a candidate was so pertinacious in his independence that words of disfavor 
 were sent out from Church headquarters in one of those whispers that carry to the 
 confines of the kingdom of the priests. But the progress was apparent. The tendency 
 was clear. And in 1898 there was neither internal revolt nor external threat to 
 provoke a renewal of the exercise of that force which is necessarily despotic if 
 it be used at all.</p>
 <p align="left">Yet, in September, 1898, President Snow, if he did not instigate, 
 at least authorized the candidacy of Brigham H. Roberts for Congress-a polygamist 
 who had been threatened with excommunication for his opposition to the "political 
 manifesto" of 1896 and who had recanted and made his peace with the hierarchy. His 
 election, now, would be a proof that the Church could punish a brilliant orator 
 and courageous citizen in the time of his independence and then reward him in the 
 day of his submission; and the authorities would thus demonstrate to all the people 
 that the one way to political preferment lay through the annihilation of self-will 
 and the submergence of national loyalty in priestly devotion. Such a candidacy was 
 a sufficient shame to the state; but there was also a United States Senatorship 
 to be bestowed; and it was deliberately bargained for, between the Church authorities 
 and a man who deserved better than the alliance into which he entered.</p>
 <p align="left">Alfred W. McCune was a citizen of Utah who had gone out from 
 the territory in the days of its poverty (and his own), had made a fortune in British 
 Columbia and Montana, and had returned to his home state to enrich it with his generosities. 
 He was not a Mormon, but he had wide Mormon connections. He spent his millions in 
 public enterprises and benefactions; and the Church had benefited in the sum of 
 many thousands by his subscriptions to its funds and institutions.</p>
 <p align="left">Apostle Heber J. Grant, a Republican by sentiment but a Democrat 
 by pretension, was selected by President Snow to baiter the Senatorship to McCune. 
 There can be no doubt of it. Everyone immediately suspected it. Letters from Grant, 
 published in the newspapers of January, 1899, subsequently confirmed it. And President 
 Snow's actions, toward the end of the campaign, proved it.</p>
 <p align="left">The other candidates were Judge O. W. Powers, a prominent Democrat; 
 William H. King, also a Democrat, a former member of Congress and at one time a 
 Federal Judge; and myself as an independent Silver Republican. I had not allied 
 myself with the Democrats after withdrawing from the Republican convention of 1896, 
 and the Republican machine in Utah (thanks to the power of the "interests") had 
 repudiated me, in September, 1898, by adopting a platform that refused to support 
 as Senator any man who had opposed the Dingley Tariff Bill. But I had the votes 
 of my own county of Weber, and some other votes that had been pledged to me before 
 the election of members of the legislature; and though my return to the Senate seemed 
 plainly impossible, I went into the fight in fulfilment of understandings which 
 I had with progressive elements in Utah and with the "insurgents," of that day, 
 in Washington.</p>
 <p align="left">During the campaign to elect members of the Legislature, I supported 
 the Democratic State and Congressional ticket. Brigham H. Roberts had been nominated 
 for Congress on this ticket-despite the protests of my father and many others who 
 foresaw the evil results of electing a polygamist. I accepted Roberts' nomination 
 as proof that this question must be settled anew at Washington; and I contented 
 myself with predicting, throughout the campaign, that the House of Representatives 
 would determine whether it would admit a polygamist and a member of the hierarchy 
 as a lawmaker, and would so forever dispose of these ecclesiastical candidacies 
 of which Utah refused to dispose for itself. (And it is a fact that since the prompt 
 exclusion of Roberts from the House of Representatives no known polygamist has been 
 elected to either House of Congress.) A Democratic legislature was elected, and 
 A. W. McCune was put forward prominently as a candidate for the United States senator-ship. 
 He was assisted by his own newspaper, the <i>Salt Lake Herald,</i> by numberless 
 business interests, cleverly by the <i>Deseret News</i> (the organ of the hierarchy) 
 flagrantly and for financial reasons by Apostle Heber J. Grant, and incidentally 
 by the Smiths on behalf of the Church. Also a Republican assistance was given him 
 by my former colleague in the Senate, Arthur Brown, who specialized as an opponent 
 to my candidacy.</p>
 <p align="left">My old campaign manager, Ben Rich, had been withdrawn from me 
 by a Church order appointing him in control of the Eastern missions. I was without 
 the support of either the Democratic or Republican organizations: my following was 
 a personal one; and consequently the attack upon me chiefly took the form of stories 
 of personal immorality, privately circulated. These stories culminated in a motion 
 before the Woman's Republican Club, demanding my withdrawal from the Senatorial 
 contest on the ground of "gross misconduct"-a motion introduced by a Mrs. Anna M. 
 Bradley, a woman politician (who was a stranger to me), with the assistance of Mrs. 
 Arthur Brown, wife of the former Senator.</p>
 <p align="left">If I ever had any resentment against these unfortunate women 
 for allowing themselves to be used as the agents of slander, it passed in the miseries 
 that overtook them later; for Mrs. Brown died of the scandal of her husband's intimacy 
 with Mrs. Bradley, and Mrs. Bradley shot and killed ex-Senator Brown, in a Washington 
 hotel, because he refused to marry her and recognize her child after her divorce 
 from her husband.</p>
 <p align="left">My anger then, and since, was not against the women, but against 
 the men who hid behind them-against Apostle Heber J. Grant and Apostle John Henry 
 Smith and their tool, ex-Senator Brown. In my anger I decided to take an action 
 that looked as desperate as it proved successful, I hired the Salt Lake Theatre 
 for a night (February 9, 1899), and announced that I would speak on "Senatorial 
 Candidates and Pharisees"-intending to use the opportunity of self-defence in order 
 to attack the "financial apostles" who were selling Church influence.</p>
 <p align="left">In taking that step I understood, of course, that it meant the 
 death for me of any political ambition in Utah. It meant offending my father, who 
 besought me not to raise my hand against "the Lord's annointed," but to leave my 
 enemies "to God's justice"-as <i>he</i> had always done with <i>his.</i> It meant 
 a breach with many of my friends in the Church who would blindly resent my criticism 
 of the political apostles as an encouragement to the enemies of the faith. But the 
 part that I had taken in helping Utah to gain its statehood made it impossible for 
 me to stand aside, now, and see all our pledges broken, all our promises betrayed. 
 I had to offer myself as a sacrifice to hierarchical resentment in the hope that 
 my destruction might give at least a momentary pause to the reactionaries in their 
 career.</p>
 <p align="left">It is needless that I should relate all the incidents of that 
 wild night. The theatre was packed with people who joined me for the moment in a 
 sympathetic protest against the disgrace of Utah. President Lorenzo Snow, his two 
 councillors and several apostles were present, and I spoke without any reservations 
 on account of personal relationship, nay own candidacy or the possible effect upon 
 my own affairs. I appealed to the people to prevent the sale of Utah's senatorship 
 to McCune by Apostle Grant and the Church reactionaries; and by turning the light 
 of publicity upon the methods that were being employed in the legislature, I made 
 it impossible for the hierarchy to sway enough votes to elect McCune. The men who 
 had pledged themselves to the other candidates could not be shaken from their support 
 without a national scandal. The election settled for the time into a deadlock, in 
 which no candidate could obtain enough votes to elect him.</p>
 <p align="left">Apostle Heber J. Grant started to write letters that should counteract 
 the effect of my speech, but President Snow forbade him to continue the controversy 
 and sent word to me that he had forbidden Grant to continue it. I did not know why 
 President Snow wished me to feel that he was friendly to me, but I was soon to learn.</p>
 <p align="left">The deadlock in the legislature continued, in spite of all the 
 efforts of the Church authorities to break it. Our political workers, summoned one 
 by one by messengers from Church headquarters, had gone to interviews from which 
 they did not return to us-until I had left only Judge Ed. F. Colborn (a famous character 
 in Kansas, Colorado and Utah), and an old friend, Jesse W. Fox. One night, about 
 a week after the meeting in the theatre, we three were sitting alone in my rooms, 
 when the door opened and someone beckoned to Fox. He went out. Judge Colborn opened 
 a window to see Fox getting into a carriage with a man from Church headquarters-and 
 we knew that our last worker was gone.</p>
 <p align="left">He returned only to tell me that President Snow wished to see 
 me-that if I were willing, the President would like to have me call upon him, at 
 half past nine the following evening, in his residence. And I understood the significance 
 of such an invitation for such an hour. I had been too often in contact with the 
 power of the Prophets to doubt what was required of me. I was curious merely to 
 know what form the ultimatum would take.</p>
 <p align="left">President Snow was then living with his youngest wife in a house 
 a few blocks from the offices of the Presidency. I drove there in a carriage and 
 ordered the driver to wait for me. President Snow opened the door to me himself, 
 received me with his usual engaging smile, and ushered me into a reception room 
 that was shut off, by portieres, from a larger parlor. There, when he had invited 
 me to be seated, he said, winningly: "I was not sure you would come in answer to 
 my message."</p>
 <p align="left">I assured him that I had not so far lost my regard for the men 
 with whom my father was associated. "And besides," I said, "if there were no other 
 reason, it is my place, as the younger of the two, to attend on your convenience."</p>
 <p align="left">"I did not know," he replied, "but that you thought me one of 
 the 'Pharisees' of whom you spoke."</p>
 <p align="left">I did not accept this invitation to reply that I did <i>not</i> 
 consider him one of the Pharisees. I explained merely that I had identified the 
 Pharisees in my speech by name and deed and accusation. "Unless something there 
 said is applicable to you, I have no charge to make against you."</p>
 <p align="left">He excused himself a moment to go to an infant whom we could 
 hear crying in an inner room; and, when he returned, he had the child in his arms-a 
 little girl, in a night gown. He sat down, petting her, stroking her hair with his 
 supple lean hand, affectionately, and smiling with a sort of absent-minded tenderness 
 as he took up the conversation again.</p>
 <p align="left">This memory of him sticks in my mind as one of the most extraordinary 
 pictures of my experience. I knew that I had come there to hear my own or some other 
 person's political death sentence. I knew that he would not have invited me at such 
 an hour, with such secrecy, unless the issue of our conference was to be something 
 dark and fatal. And in the soft radiance of the lamp he sat smiling-fragile of build, 
 almost spirituelle, white-haired, delicately cultured-soothing the child who played 
 with his long silvery beard and blinked sleepily. He inquired whether my carriage 
 was waiting for me, and I replied that it was. He asked me to dismiss it. When I 
 returned to the room, the little girl was resting quiet, and he excused himself 
 to take her to her cot. I heard him closing the doors behind him as he came back. 
 "We may now talk with perfect freedom," he announced. "There's no one else in this 
 part of the house."</p>
 <p align="left">He sat down in his chair, composing himself with an air that 
 might have distinguished one of the ancient kings. "I have sent for you to talk 
 about the Senatorial situation. May I speak plainly to you?"</p>
 <p align="left">I replied that he might. He was watching me, under his gray eyebrows, 
 with his soft eyes, in which there was a glitter of blackness but none of the rheum 
 of old age.</p>
 <p align="left">"It would be most unfortunate," he said, "for us, as a people, 
 if we failed to elect a Senator. I've had many business and other anxieties for 
 the Church, and I want this question settled. If we act wisely-with the power and 
 influence at our command-aid will come to me. I think you would not willingly permit 
 our situation to become more difficult." He must have seen a change in my expression-a 
 change that indicated how well I understood the significance of this guarded introduction. 
 Suddenly, his manner broke into animation, and holding out both hands to me, palms 
 up, he said, smiling: "You must know, Brother Frank, that I had nothing to do with 
 Mr. McCune's candidacy for the Senate, do you not? I was not responsible for what 
 Brother Grant did. Before we go on, I want you to acquit me of responsibility for 
 that project."</p>
 <p align="left">"President Snow," I replied, "I can't admit so much. I, too, 
 wish to talk plainly-with your permission. Your responsibility is evident even to 
 the casual observer-to say nothing of one reared as I've been. Every man in this 
 community knows that when you point your finger your apostles go, and when you crook 
 your finger your apostles return-and Heber J. Grant has only done what you permitted 
 him to do with your full knowledge."</p>
 <p align="left">He drew himself up, coldly. "What I have done," he retorted, 
 "has been done with the knowledge of my Councillors."</p>
 <p align="left">The thrust was obvious. I replied: "If my father desires to discuss 
 with me his responsibility for this indignity to the state, he knows I'm at his 
 command. And if I have any charge to make, involving his good faith toward the country, 
 I'll seek him alone."</p>
 <p align="left">"Very well," he said, with a frigid suavity. "We will leave that 
 part of the question." He paused. "Last night," he continued, "lying on my bed, 
 I had a vision. I saw this work of God injured by the political strife of the brethren. 
 And the voice of the Lord came to me, directing me to see that your father was elected 
 to the Senate.'' He studied me a moment before he added: "What have you to say?"</p>
 <p align="left">I answered: "It seems to me impossible. This legislature is strongly 
 Democratic. My father's a Republican. It seems to me not only impracticable but 
 very unwise-if it could be done."</p>
 <p align="left">"Never mind that," he said. "The Lord will take care of the event. 
 I want you to withdraw from the race and throw your strength to your father. It 
 is the will of the Lord that you do so."</p>
 <p align="left">"Have you a revelation to that effect also?" I asked.</p>
 <p align="left">He answered, pontifically, "Yes." "You'll publish it to the world, 
 then, the same as other revelations?" "No," he replied. "No." "Then I'll not obey 
 it," I said, "because if God is ashamed of it, <i>I</i> am."</p>
 <p align="left">His air of prophetic authority changed to one of combative resolution. 
 He explained that one of the other candidates, a strong Democrat, had agreed to 
 accept the revelation if I would; that the two of us could give our strength to 
 the church candidate; that the Church would turn to my father the votes that it 
 had already in command for McCune, and my father's election would be carried.</p>
 <p align="left">I felt that the thumb-screws were being put on me again. For 
 the second time I was being forced to the point of denying the Sena-torship to my 
 father by refusing him my support. And there could not have been, for me, a more 
 vivid and instantaneous illumination of the hidden depths in this Church system-or 
 in the individual Prophet of the cult-than was made by Snow's determined insistence 
 that I should break my word of honor to the people of the state and of the nation, 
 pledge that broken faith to him, induce all my supporters in the legislature to 
 violate their covenants-Mormon and Gentile alike!-and upon his mere assumption of 
 divine authority, direct Mormon and Gentile to stultify and disgrace themselves 
 forever as men and public officials. There was something appalling in the calculating 
 cruelty with which he proposed to devote us all to destruction and dishonor. There 
 was something inhumanly malignant in the plan to use my known affection for my father 
 in order to make me guilty of the very betrayal of the people which I had publicly 
 denounced. I looked at him-and heard him, now, placidly, confidently, with a renewed 
 suavity, urging me to <i>do</i> the thing.</p>
 <p align="left">"President Snow," I interrupted, "does my father know of this?"</p>
 <p align="left">He answered: "No."</p>
 <p align="left">"I'm glad of it," I said. (And I was!) "This is not the way to 
 work out either the destiny of 'God's people' or the destiny of this state. It would 
 place my father in a most humiliating position to be elected-at the orders of the 
 Church-under the assumption that God Almighty had directed men to break their solemn 
 promises to their constituents. I have as high an admiration for my father's wisdom 
 and ability as you or the Democratic candidate who has offered to withdraw at the 
 will of the Church, but I should be paying no honor to my father by dishonoring 
 my pledge to my constituents and asking other men to dishonor theirs."</p>
 <p align="left">He dismissed me with an air of benignant sorrow!</p>
 <p align="left">The deadlock in the legislature continued unbroken. Among my 
 supporters was Lewis W. Shurtliff, the President of the "Stake of Zion" in which 
 I lived; he was one of the highest Church dignitaries in the legislature and was 
 regarded as my foremost champion in the Senatorial contest. On the last day of the 
 legislative session, at President Snow's instruction, my father, known as a Republican, 
 was offered as a senatorial candidate to this Democratic legislature, and all the 
 power of the Church influence was thrown to him. President Shurtliff's wife came 
 to our headquarters, that night, and knelt, with a number of other ladies, to pray 
 that her husband might be spared the humiliation of breaking his repeated promise 
 not to desert me! We all knew that if he broke his promise, it would cause <i>him</i> 
 more mental anguish than anyone else; but we knew, too, that if the command came 
 from Church headquarters, he would have to obey it. Men broke their political pledges 
 to their people and outraged their own feelings of personal independence or partisan 
 loyalty, rather than offend against "the will of the Lord." The forces of the other 
 candidates went to pieces, and on the last night of the session my father's vote 
 reached twenty-three. (It required thirty-two votes to elect.)</p>
 <p align="left">The situation was saved by the action of a number of Democrats 
 who got together and obtained a recess; when the recess was ended, a final ballot 
 was taken, and, since no candidate had enough votes to elect him, the presiding 
 officer, by preconcertment, declared the joint assembly adjourned <i>sine die,</i> 
 by operation of law. No Senator was elected.</p>
 <p align="left">But it was the last time that the Church authorities were to 
 be balked. Since that day, they have dictated the nominations and carried the elections 
 of the United States Senators from Utah as if these were candidates for a church 
 office. The present Senator, Reed Smoot, is an apostle of the Church; he obtained 
 the Mormon President's "permission" to become a candidate, as he admitted to an 
 investigating committee of the Senate; and when the recent tariff bill was being 
 attacked by insurgent Republicans and carried by Senator Aldrich, Senator Smoot 
 acted as Aldrich's lieutenant in debate, and remained to watch the defence of the 
 "interests" when his chief was absent from the Senate chamber. (Not because Smoot 
 was such an able defender of those "interests"! Not because his constituents would 
 uphold his course! But because he <i>has</i> no constituents, and is responsible 
 to no one but the hierarchical partners of those "interests.")</p>
 <p align="left">Every pledge of the Mormon leaders that the Church would not 
 interfere in politics has been broken at every election in Utah since President 
 Snow that night pleaded to me that he had had many business anxieties for the Church 
 and that if we elected the Church candidate "aid" would come to him. The covenants 
 by which Utah obtained its statehood have been violated again and again. The provisions 
 of the state constitution have been nullified. The trust of the Mormon people has 
 been abused; their political liberties have been denied them; their Gentile brethren 
 have been betrayed. And all this has been done <i>not</i> for the protection of 
 the people, who were threatened with no proscription-and <i>not</i> for the advancement 
 of the faith, which has been free to work out its own future. It has been done as 
 a part of the alliance between the "financial" prophets of the Church and the financial 
 "interests" of the country-which have been exploiting the people of Utah as they 
 have exploited the whole nation with the aid of the ecclesiastical authorities in 
 Utah.</p>
