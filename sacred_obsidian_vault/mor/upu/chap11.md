 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XI</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">THE WILL OF THE LORD</h1>
 <p align="left">The Mormon leaders were now hurried down their chosen path of 
 dishonor with a fateful rapidity. A reform movement was demanding of Washington 
 the adoption of a constitutional amendment that should give Congress power to regulate 
 the marriage and divorce laws of all the states in the Union. And this proposed 
 amendment-partly inspired by a growing doubt of the good faith of the Mormon leaders-gave 
 the politicians in Washington something to trade for Mormon votes, in the presidential 
 campaign of 1900.</p>
 <p align="left">The Republicans had lost the electoral votes of Utah and the 
 surrounding states, in 1896. Utah was now Democratic, and its one United States 
 Senator (who was still in office) was a Democrat. Senator Hanna's lieutenant, Perry 
 S. Heath, came to Salt Lake City in the summer of 1900, to confer with the heads 
 of the Mormon Church. His authority (as representative of the ruler of the Republican 
 party) had been authenticated by correspondence; and he was received by President 
 Snow as royalty receives the envoy of royalty.</p>
 <p align="left">Heath negotiated with his usual directness. In the phrase of 
 the time, "he laid down his cards on the table, face up, and asked Snow to play 
 to that hand." If the Mormon Church would pledge its support to the Republican party, 
 the Republican leaders would avert the threatened constitutional amendment that 
 was to give Congress the power to interfere in the domestic affairs of the Mormon 
 people. But if the Church denied its support to the Republican party, the constitutional 
 amendment would be carried, and the Mormons, in their marriage relations, would 
 be returned to the Federal jurisdiction from which they had escaped when the territory 
 was admitted to statehood.</p>
 <p align="left">The sentiment of the country was known to be in favor of giving 
 Congress such power. A strong body of reformers was urging the amendment, and the 
 Church leaders had sent Apostle John Henry Smith and Bishop H. B. Clawson to lobby 
 against it. After consulting with my father, I had written to President Snow pointing 
 out the danger to the Mormons of having a lobby opposing such an amendment-for I 
 was not then aware of the secret return to the practice of polygamy, after 1896. 
 President Snow replied to me (in a message of guarded prudence) that although the 
 Church inhibited plural marriage and did not intend to allow the practice, he was 
 opposed to the interference of Congress in the domestic concerns of the other states 
 of the Union!</p>
 <p align="left">He made his "deal" with Perry Heath.</p>
 <p align="left">Church messengers were sent out secretly to the Mormons in Idaho, 
 Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Oregon, California and the territories, 
 with the whispered announcement that it was "the will of the Lord" that the Republicans 
 should be aided. Utah went Republican; the Mormons in the surrounding states either 
 openly supported, or secretly voted for McKinley; and the constitutional amendment 
 was "side tracked" and forgotten.</p>
 <p align="left">Utah elected a Republican legislature. Apostle Reed Smoot applied 
 to President Snow for permission to become a candidate for the United States Senatorship, 
 and obtained a promise that if he stood aside, for the time, he should receive his 
 reward later. President Snow had decided that Thomas Kearns, already an active candidate, 
 was the man whom the Church would support-since Mr. Kearns' ability, his wealth 
 and his business connection promised greater advantages for the state and (under 
 cunning manipulation by the priests) greater advantages for the Church than the 
 election of any other candidate. And all this may be fairly said without assuming 
 that there was any definite arrangement between the Church and any friends of Mr. 
 Kearns.</p>
 <p align="left">Kearns was associated with Senator Clark of Montana and R. C. 
 Kerens of St. Louis in building a railroad from Salt Lake to Los Angeles, and the 
 Church owned some fifteen miles of track that had been laid from Salt Lake City, 
 as the beginning of a Los Angeles line. It was apparently assumed by President Snow 
 that Kearns' election to the Senate would facilitate the sale of this Church railroad 
 to the Clark-Kearns syndicate. The Church had a direct interest in numerous iron 
 and coal properties in Southern Utah, and many members of the Church also had private 
 properties there, which the Los Angeles line would develop. Some of Kearns' friends 
 were negotiating for the purchase of Church properties, and one of his partners 
 was proposing to buy (and subsequently bought) the Church's "Amelia Palace," a useless 
 and expensive property which Brigham Young had built for his favorite wife, and 
 which the Church had long been eager to sell. My father had been in ill-health for 
 some months and he was away from Utah a large part of the time. President Snow took 
 counsel of his Second Councillor, Joseph F. Smith, and of Apostle John Henry Smith; 
 and to the Smiths, he indicated Thos. Kearns as the one whose election to the United 
 States Senate might do most to advance Snow's concealed purpose. But the Smiths 
 had other plans, that were equally advantageous to the Church and more advantageous 
 to the Smiths; they rebelled against President Snow's dictation, and he ordered 
 them both away on temporary "missions."</p>
 <p align="left">As Joseph F. Smith was leaving the President's offices, in a 
 rage, he met an old friend, Joseph Howell, who (at this writing) is a member of 
 Congress from Utah, and was then a member of the Utah legislature. He told Smith 
 that President Snow had sent for him, and Smith, controlling himself-without betraying 
 any knowledge of the probable purpose of Snow's summons to Howell-said affectionately: 
 "Brother Howell, I want you to make a promise to me on your honor as an elder in 
 Israel. I want you to pledge yourself never to vote in this legislature for Thomas 
 Kearns as Senator. I ask it as your friend, and "as a Prophet to the people<i>."</i></p>
 <p align="left">Howell gave his promise, and proceeded to his interview with 
 President Snow. There he received the announcement that it was "the will of the 
 Lord" that he should vote for Kearns, and he had to reply that he had already received 
 an inspired instruction, on this point, from a Prophet of the Lord, and had given 
 his pledge against Kearns.</p>
 <p align="left">The incident became one of the jokes of the campaign, for Howell 
 held to his promise to Smith (and was subsequently rewarded by Smith with a seat 
 in Congress), and President Snow was compelled to waive the question of conflicting 
 "revelations."</p>
 <p align="left">Kearns was elected. But he had had a powerful political machine 
 of his own, and he had been supported by a strong Gentile vote. He immediately showed 
 his independence by refusing to take orders from the political Church leaders. He 
 declined, further, for himself and his financial confreres, to engage with the Church 
 in business affairs. Many charges were made that he was breaking his agreement of 
 co-operation with the authorities, but there never has been produced any evidence 
 of such an agreement, and I do not believe (from my knowledge of Senator Kearns) 
 that the agreement was ever made.</p>
 <p align="left">The railroad into Southern Utah was later built by the Harriman 
 interests in combination with Clark and Kearns; but there, too, Snow was disappointed. 
 The expected development of the Church properties proved far less profitable than 
 had been supposed, and the financial prophecies of the Seer and Revelator were not 
 fulfilled.</p>
 <p align="left">By this time it was abundantly evident that some of the Church 
 leaders intended to rule their people in politics with an absolutism as supreme 
 as any that Utah had ever known in the old days. And for these leaders to maintain 
 their authority-despite the covenant of their amnesty, the terms of Utah's statehood 
 and the provisions of the constitution-and to maintain that authority against the 
 robust American sentiment that would be sure to assert itself-it was necessary that 
 they should have the most effective political protection afforded by any organization 
 in the whole country. The ideal arrangement of evil was offered to them by the men 
 then in temporary leadership of the Republican party. The Prophets were able to 
 make the Republican party a guilty partner of their perfidy by making it a recipient 
 of the proceeds of that perfidy, and to assure themselves protection in every religious 
 tyranny so long as they did not run counter to Republican purpose.</p>
 <p align="left">For the moment, the Church took more benefit from the partnership 
 than it conferred. The result of the presidential elections of 1900 showed that 
 the Republicans could have elected their ticket without any help from the Prophets. 
 But without the help of the dominant party the Prophets could not have renewed the 
 rule of the state by the Church-could not have prevented the passage of a constitutional 
 amendment punishing polygamy by Federal statute-and could not have obtained such 
 intimate relation and commanding influence with the great "interests" of the country.</p>
 <p align="left">Throughout all these miserable incidents, I had a vague hope 
 that they would prove merely temporary and peculiar to the term of Snow's presidency. 
 He was now in his eighty-sixth year. My father was next in succession for the Presidency, 
 and he was seventy-three. He had remained personally faithful to every pledge that 
 he had made to the nation, and though he had been powerless to prevent the breaches 
 of covenant that had followed the sovereignty of statehood, I knew that he had opposed 
 some of them and been a willing party to none. It is true that he had become a director 
 of the Union Pacific Railway and was close to the leading financiers of the East; 
 but his Union Pacific connection had come from the fact that he had been one of 
 the builders of the road that had afterward merged in the Oregon Short Line; and 
 his financial relations had been those of a financier and not a politician. In all 
 the years that I had been working with him, I had never known him to have any purpose 
 that was not communistic in its final aspect and designed for the good of his people.</p>
 <p align="left">Up to his seventieth year, he had shown no ill result of his 
 early hardships. Living the abstemious life of the orthodox Mormon, to whom wine, 
 tobacco and even tea and coffee are prohibited, he had seemed inexhaustibly robust 
 and untiring. But almost from the day of President's Snow accession to office-deprived 
 of the sustaining consciousness of the responsibilities of leadership-his physical 
 strength gave signs of breaking. In the fall of 1900 he made a trip to the Sandwich 
 Islands, to recuperate, and to assist at the fiftieth anniversary of the Mormon 
 mission that he had founded there; but the Utah winter proved too rigorous for him 
 on his return, and in March, 1901, he was taken to California-to Monterey. In April 
 the word came to me in New York that he was sinking.</p>
 <p align="left">I found him in a cottage overlooking the beautiful Bay of Monterey 
 and its wooded slope; and the doctors in attendance told me that he had been kept 
 alive only by the determination to see me before he died. There was no hope. He 
 had still a clear mind, but with ominous lapses of unconsciousness that foreboded 
 the end; and in these intervals of coma, as we wheeled him to and fro on the veranda 
 in an invalid chair-in an attempt to refresh him with the motion of the sea air-he 
 would swing his right hand upward, with an old pulpit gesture, and say "Priesthood! 
 Priesthood!" as if in that word he expressed the ruling thought of his life, the 
 inspiration that had sustained his power, the obligation that had governed him in 
 his direction of his people.</p>
 <p align="left">On the afternoon of the 11th of April, he was lying in a stupor 
 on a couch before an open window, with the sound of the surf in the quiet room. 
 One of the doctors entered, looked at him intently, and said to me: "I can do nothing 
 more here-and my patients need me in San Francisco. He can't last long. Hell probably 
 never recover consciousness. If there's anything imperative-anything you <i>must</i> 
 say to him-any word you wish to have from him-you could perhaps rouse him"-I said 
 "No." We had never intruded upon any mood of his silence during his masterful life; 
 and I felt a jealous rebellion against the idea that we should intrude now upon 
 this last, helpless silence of unconsciousness. The doctor left us. I summoned the 
 other members of the family from the veranda to the bedside. He lay motionless and 
 placid, scarcely breathing, his eyes closed, his hands folded. In accordance with 
 the rites of the Church, we laid our hands on his head, while my eldest brother 
 said the prayer of filial blessing that "sealed" the dying man to eternity.</p>
 <p align="left">In the silence that followed the last "Amen" of the prayer, he 
 opened his eyes, and said in a steady, strong voice: "You thought I was passing 
 away?"</p>
 <p align="left">We replied that we had seen he was very weak.</p>
 <p align="left">With a glance at the door through which the physician had departed, 
 he said resolutely: "I shall go when my Father calls me-and not till then. I shall 
 know the moment, and I will not struggle against His command. Lift me up. Carry 
 me out on the balcony I want to see the water once more. And I want to talk with 
 you."</p>
 <p align="left">To me, it was the last struggle of the unconquerable will that 
 had silently, composedly, cheerfully fought and overcome every obstacle that had 
 opposed the purposes of his manhood for half a century. He would not yield even 
 to death at the dictation of man. He would go when he was ready-when his mind had 
 accepted the inevitable as the decree of God.</p>
 <p align="left">We sat around his couch on the veranda, and for two hours he 
 talked to us as clearly and as forcibly as ever. He spoke of the Church and of its 
 mission in the world, with all the hope of a religious altruist. From the humblest 
 beginnings, it had grown to the greatest power. From the depths of persecution, 
 it had risen to win favor from the wisest among men. It had abolished poverty for 
 hundreds of thousands, by its sound communal system. In its religious solidarity, 
 it had become a guardian and administrator of equal justice within all the sphere 
 of its influence. It was full of the most splendid possibilities of good for mankind.</p>
 <p align="left">With his eyes fixed on the sea-facing eternity as calmly as he 
 faced that great symbol of eternity-he voiced the sincerity of his life and the 
 hope that had animated his statesmanship. In an exaltation of spirituality that 
 made the moment one of the sublime experiences of my life, he adjured us all to 
 hold true to our covenants. I do not write of his personal words of love and admonition 
 to the members of his family. I wish to express only the aspects that may be of 
 public interest, in his last aspirations-for these were the aspirations of the Mormon 
 leaders of the older generation, whom he represented-and they are the aspirations 
 of all the wise among the Mormons today, whatever may be the folly and the treachery 
 of their Prophets.</p>
 <p align="left">Ten hours later, he was dead.</p>
 <p align="left">I cannot pretend that I had any true apprehension, then, of what 
 his loss meant to the community. I had no clearer vision of events than others. 
 I felt that I had no longer any tie to connect me closely with the government of 
 the Church, and I was willing to stand aside from its affairs, believing that the 
 momentum of progress imparted to it would carry it forward. The nation had cleared 
 the path for it. Its faith, put into practice as a social gospel, had been freed 
 of the offensive things that had antagonized the world. My father's last messages 
 of hope remained with me as a cheering prophecy.</p>
 <p align="left">At his funeral in the great tabernacle, President Snow put forward 
 a favorite son, Leroy, to read an official statement in which the President took 
 occasion to deny that my father had dictated the recent policies of the Church: 
 those policies, he said, had been solely the President's. (He is welcome to the 
 credit of them!) Joseph F. Smith showed more generosity of emotion, now that his 
 path of succession was clear of the superior in authority whom he had so long regarded 
 enviously; and he spoke of my father, both privately and in public, in a way that 
 won me to him.</p>
 <p align="left">The shock of grief had perhaps "mellowed" me. I felt more tolerant 
 of these men, since I was no longer necessarily engaged in opposing them. When President 
 Snow died (October, 1901), I shared only the general interest in the way Joseph 
 F. Smith set about asserting his family's title to rulership of the "Kingdom of 
 God on Earth;" for, in effect, he notified the world that his branch of the Smith 
 family had been designated by Divine revelation to rule in the affairs of all men, 
 by an appointment that had never been revoked. He has since made his cousin, John 
 Henry Smith, his First Councillor; and he has inducted his son Hyrum into the apostolate 
 by "revelation." This latter act roused the jealousy of the mother of his son Joseph 
 F. Smith, Jr., and the amused gossip of the Mormons predicted another revelation 
 that should give Joseph Jr. a similar promotion. The revelation came. So many others 
 have also come that the Smith family is today represented in the hierarchy by Joseph 
 F. Smith, President, "Prophet, Seer and Revelator to all the world;" John Smith 
 (a brother) presiding Patriarch over the whole human race; John Henry Smith (a cousin) 
 Apostle and First Councillor to the President; Hyrum Smith and Joseph F. Smith (sons) 
 Apostles; George A. Smith (son of John Henry) apostle; David S. Smith (son of Joseph 
 F.) Councillor to the presiding Bishop of the Church and in line of succession to 
 the bishopric; and Bathseba W. Smith, President of the Relief Societies.[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>] 
 As Joseph F. Smith has still thirty other sons-and at least four wives who are not 
 represented in the apostolate-there may yet be a quorum of Smiths to succeed endlessly 
 to the Presidency and make the Smith family a perpetual dynasty in Utah.</p>
 <p align="left">It is one of the fascinating contradictions of Mormonism that 
 many of the sincere people-who smilingly predicted the Divine interposition by which 
 this family succession was founded-accept its rule devoutly. "The Lord," they will 
 tell you, "will look after the Church. If these men are good enough for God, they 
 are good enough for me. I do not have to save the Kingdom." And they continue paying 
 their devotion (and their tithes) to a family autocracy whose imposition would have 
 provoked a rebellion in any other community in the civilized world!</p>
 <p align="left">It is "the will of the Lord!"</p>
