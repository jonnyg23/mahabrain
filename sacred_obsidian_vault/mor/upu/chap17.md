 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XVII</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">THE NEW POLYGAMY</h1>
 <p align="left">In the old days of Mormonism-and as late as the anti-polygamous 
 manifesto of 1890-the whole aim and effort of the Church was to exalt and sanctify 
 and make pure the practice of plural marriage by means of the community's respect 
 and the reverences of religion. The doctrine of polygamy was taught as a revealed 
 mystery of faith. It was accepted as a sacrament ordained by God for the salvation 
 of mankind. The most important families in the Church dignified it by their participation, 
 and were in turn dignified by the Church's approval and by the wealth and power 
 that followed approval. The inevitable mental sufferings of the plural wives were 
 endured by them as part of an earthly self-immolation required by God, for which 
 they should be rewarded in eternity. The very necessities of their situation compelled 
 them to exact and cherish a super-reverence for the doctrine of plural marriage-since 
 the only way a mother could justify herself to her children was by teaching, as 
 she believed, that she had been selected by God for the exaltation of this sacrifice, 
 and by inculcating in her children a scrupulous respect for sexual purity. There 
 was no pretense of denial of the polygamous relation. Plural wives held the place 
 of honor in the community. Their marriages were considered the most sanctified. 
 They and their progeny were called "the wives and children, of the holy covenant," 
 and they were esteemed accordingly.</p>
 <p align="left">But as the history of the Church shows, plural marriage was always 
 a heavy cross to the Mormon women; many had refused to bear it, in the face of the 
 frequent pulpit scoldings of the Prophets; and few did not sometime weep under it 
 in the secrecy of their family life. In the days immediately preceding the manifesto 
 of 1890, there was a general hope and longing among the Mormon mothers that God 
 would permit a relief before their daughters and their sons should become of an 
 age to be drafted into the ranks of polygamy. The great majority of the young men 
 were monogamists. It required the strong persuasions of personal affection as well 
 as the authority of Divine command to make the young women accept a polygamist in 
 marriage. And when the Church received President Woodruff's anti-polygamous revelation, 
 every profound human emotion of the people coincided with the promise to abstain.</p>
 <p align="left">Only among a few of the polygamous leaders themselves was there 
 any inclination to break the Church's pledge-an inclination that was strengthened 
 by resentment against the Federal power that had compelled the giving of the pledge. 
 Almost immediately upon obtaining the freedom of statehood, some of these leaders 
 returned to the practice of polygamous cohabitation-although they had accepted the 
 revelation, had bound themselves by their covenant to the nation and had solemnly 
 subscribed to the terms of their amnesty. To justify themselves, they found it necessary 
 to teach that polygamy was still approved by the law of God-that the practice of 
 plural marriage had only been abandoned because it was forbidden by the laws of 
 man. Joseph F. Smith continued to live with his five wives and to rear children 
 by all of them. Those of the apostles who were not assured of that attainment to 
 the principality of Heaven which was promised the man of five wives and proportionate 
 progeny, were naturally tempted (if, indeed, they were not actually encouraged) 
 to take Joseph F. Smith as their examplar. It was scarcely worse to break the covenant 
 by taking a new polygamous wife than by continuing polygamous relations with former 
 plural wives; and when an apostle took a new polygamous wife, his inevitable and 
 necessary course was to justify himself by the authority of God. He could not then 
 deny the same authority to the minor ecclesiasts, even if he had wished to. And, 
 finally, when the evil circle spread to the man on the fringe of the Church-who 
 could not obtain even such poor authorization for his perfidy-he found a way to 
 perpetrate a pretended plural marriage with his victim, and the Church authorities 
 did not dare but protect him.</p>
 <p align="left">This was polygamy without the great saving grace that had previously 
 defended the Mormon women from the cruelties and abuses of the practice. It was 
 polygamy without honor-polygamy <i>against</i> an assumed revelation of God instead 
 of by virtue of one-polygamy worse than that of the Mohammedans, since it was necessarily 
 clandestine, could claim no social respect or acceptance, and was forbidden "by 
 the laws of God and man" alike.</p>
 <p align="left">This is the "new polygamy" of Mormonism. The Church leaders dare 
 not acknowledge it-for fear of the national consequences. They dare not even secretly 
 issue certificates of plural marriage, lest the record should be betrayed. They 
 protect the polygamist by a conspiracy of falsehood that is almost as shameful as 
 the shame it seeks to cover; and the infection of the duplicity spreads like a plague 
 to corrupt the whole social life of the people. The wife of a new polygamist cannot 
 claim a husband; she has no social status; she cannot, even to her parents, prove 
 the religious sanction for her marital relations. Her children are taught that they 
 must not use a father's name. They are hopelessly outside the law-without the possibility 
 that any further statutes of legitimization will be enacted for their relief. They 
 are born in falsehood and bred to the living of a lie. Their father cannot claim 
 the authority of the Church for their parentage, for he must protect his Prophet. 
 He cannot even publicly acknowledge them-any more than he can publicly acknowledge 
 their mother.</p>
 <p align="left">Out of these terrible conditions comes such an instance as the 
 notorious case of one of Henry S. Tanner's wives, who went on a visit to one of 
 her relatives, with her children, and denied that they <i>were</i> her children, 
 and denied that she was married-and was supported by her children's denial that 
 she was their mother. Similarly, a plural wife of a wealthy Mormon, whose fortune 
 is estimated at $25,000,000-a partner of the sugar trust, a community leader, a 
 favorite of the Church-went before the Senate Committee in December, 1904, and swore 
 that her first husband had died thirteen years before, that she had had a child 
 within six years, and that she had no second husband. And by doing so she not only 
 marked the child as illegitimate beyond the relief of any future statutes legitimizing 
 the offspring of polygamous marriages, but she left herself and the child without 
 any claim upon the estate of its father and publicly swore herself a social outcast 
 before a committee of the United States Senate, and perjured herself-to the knowledge 
 of all her friends and acquaintances in Utah-for.the protection of her husband and 
 her Church. What can one say of a man who will permit a woman to commit such an 
 act of social suicide for him-or of a Church that will command it?</p>
 <p align="left">Here is a condition of society unparalleled anywhere else in 
 civilization-unparalleled even in barbarous countries, for wherever else polygamy 
 is practised it at least has the sanction of local convention. And the consequent 
 suffering that falls upon the women and the children is a heart-break to see. During 
 the days when I was in the editorial office of the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> scores 
 of miserable cases came to my knowledge by letter, by the report of friends, and 
 by the visits of the agonized wives themselves. I shall never forget one young woman, 
 in her twenties, who came to ask my help in forcing her husband to obtain a marriage 
 certificate for her from the Church, so that her boy might have the right to claim 
 a father. She wept, with her head on my desk, sobbing out her story, and appealing 
 to me for aid with a convulsed and tear-drenched face.</p>
 <p align="left">Four years earlier, she had become friendly with a man twice 
 her age, whom she admired and respected. He had taken two wives before the manifesto 
 of 1890, but that did not prevent him from coveting the youth and beauty of this 
 young woman. He first approached her mother for permission to marry the girl, and 
 when the mother-who was herself a plural wife-replied that it was impossible under 
 the law, he brought an apostle to persuade her that the practice of plural marriage 
 was still as meet, just and available to salvation as it had been when <i>she</i> 
 married. Then he went to the daughter.</p>
 <p align="left">"I was terrified," she said, "when he proposed to me. And yet-he 
 asked me if I thought my mother had done wrong when she married my father. . . . 
 There was no one else I liked as much. He was good. He was rich. He told me I'd 
 never want for anything. He said I would be fulfilling the command of God against 
 the wickedness of a persecuting world. . . . I don't know what devil of fanaticism 
 entered into me. I thought it would be smart to defy the United States."</p>
 <p align="left">Late one night, by appointment, he called for her with a carriage, 
 driven by a man unknown to her, and took her to a darkened house that had a dim 
 light only in the hallway. They entered alone and turned into a parlor that was 
 dark, except for the reflection from the hall. He led her up to the portieres that 
 hung across an inner door, and through the opening between the curtains she saw 
 the indistinct figure of a man. They stood before him, hand in hand, while he mumbled 
 over the words of a ceremony that sounded to her like the ceremonies she had heard 
 in the Temple. She caught little of it clearly; she remembered practically nothing. 
 She was not given anything to show that a ceremony had been performed, and she did 
 not ask for anything. The elderly bridegroom kissed her when the mumbling ceased, 
 led her out to the carriage, took her back to her mother's house, and that night 
 became her husband.</p>
 <p align="left">She bore him a son. No one except her mother, her father and 
 a few trusted friends knew that she was married. In the early months of 1905 she 
 read in the <i>Tribune</i> the testimony given before the Senate committee by Professor 
 James E. Talmage, for the Church, to the effect that since the manifesto of 1890 
 neither the President of the Church nor anybody else in the Church had power to 
 authorize a plural marriage, and that any woman who had become a plural wife, since 
 the manifesto, was "no more a wife by the law of the Church, than she is by the 
 law of the land."</p>
 <p align="left">She asked her husband about it. He replied that an apostle had 
 married them. "I asked my husband," she said, "to get a certificate of marriage 
 from the apostle. He told me I needed none-that it was recorded in the books here 
 and recorded in heaven-that it would put the apostle in danger if he were to sign 
 such a paper. I said that that was nothing to me-that I wanted to protect my good 
 name. Finally, he said it was not an apostle. Then we had a bitter scene. And he 
 did not come back for a long time. And he didn't write as long as he stayed away.</p>
 <p align="left">"When he came back he was more loving than ever. I was afraid 
 of having more children. I said to him: 'You cannot hold me as a wife any longer 
 unless you write a paper certifying that I'm your wife and this boy is your child. 
 You may place that paper anywhere you like, so long as I know I can get it in case 
 you die. Suppose you were to die and all your folks were to deny that I was your 
 wife-say that I was an imposter-that I was trying to foist my boy on the estate 
 of a dead man-in the name of God, then what could I do?' He went away; and he hasn't 
 come back; and he hasn't written. I don't know who married us. I don't even know 
 the house where it happened. I don't know who the driver was. I don't even know 
 who the apostle was that told mother it would be all right. He made her promise 
 under a covenant not to tell.</p>
 <p align="left">"I don't know where to go. A friend of mine told me you would 
 advise me. He said perhaps you could make them give me a certificate. I don't want 
 to expose my husband. I only want something so that my boy, when he grows up, won't 
 be"-</p>
 <p align="left">What could I do? What could anyone do for this unfortunate girl, 
 seduced in the name of religion, with the aid of a Church that repudiated her for 
 its own protection? She had to suffer, and see her boy suffer, the penalties of 
 a social outcast.</p>
 <p align="left">Her case was typical of many that came to my personal knowledge. 
 At the Sunday Schools, in the choirs, in the joint meetings of mutual improvement 
 associations, young girls-taught to believe that plural marriage was sacred, and 
 reverencing the polygamous prophets as the anointed of the Lord-were being seduced 
 into clandestine marriage relations with polygamous elders who persuaded their victims 
 that the anti-polygamous manifesto had been given out to save a persecuted people 
 from the cruelties of an unjust government; that it was never intended it should 
 be obeyed; that all the celestial blessings promised by revelation to the polygamist 
 and his wives were still waiting for those who would dare to enjoy them.</p>
 <p align="left">If the tempted girl turned to one of her women friends, and besought 
 her to say, on her honor, whether she thought that plural marriage was right, the 
 other was likely enough to answer: "Yes, yes. Indeed it is. Promise me you won't 
 tell a living soul. Tell me you'll die first. . . . I'm married to Brother L-, the 
 leader of the ward choir."</p>
 <p align="left">If she asked her mother: "Tell me. Is plural marriage wrong?" 
 the mother could only reply: "Oh-I don't know-I don't know. Your father said it 
 was right, and I accepted it-and we practised it-and you have always loved your 
 other brothers and sisters, and it seems to me it can't be wrong, since we have 
 lived it. But-Oh, I don't know, daughter. I don't know."</p>
 <p align="left">The man who is tempting her knows. He has the word of an apostle, 
 the example of the Prophet, the secret teaching of the Church. He courts her as 
 any other religious young girl might be courted-with little attentions, at the meetings, 
 over the music books-and he has, to aid him, a religious exaltation in her, induced 
 by his plea that she is to enter into the mystery of the holy covenant, to become 
 one of the most faithful of a persecuted Church, to defy the wicked laws of its 
 enemies. She is just as happy in her betrothal as any other innocent girl of her 
 age. Even the secrecy is sweet to her. And then, some evening, they saunter down 
 a side street to a strange house-or even to a back orchard where a man is waiting 
 in a cowl under a tree-(perhaps vulgarly disguised as a woman with a veil over his 
 face)-and they are married in a mutter of which she hears nothing.</p>
 <p align="left">Such a case was related to me by a horrified mother who had discovered 
 that the marriage ceremony had been performed by an accomplice of the libertine 
 who had seduced her daughter and since confessed his crime. But whether the ceremony 
 be performed by a priest of the Church or by a more unauthorized scoundrel, the 
 girl is equally at the mercy of her "husband" and equally betrayed in the world. 
 Even in this case of the pretended marriage, the elders of the ward hushed up the 
 threatened prosecution because the authorities of the Church objected to a proceeding 
 that might expose other plural marriages more orthodox.</p>
 <p align="left">Hundreds of Mormon men and women personally thanked me by letter 
 or in interviews at the <i>Tribune</i> office, for our editorial attacks upon the 
 hierarchy for encouraging these horrors. Strangers spoke to me on railroad trains, 
 thanking me and telling me of cases. Three Mormon physicians, themselves priests 
 of the Church, told me of innumerable instances that had come to them in their practice, 
 and said that they did not know what was to become of the community. One Mormon 
 woman wrote me from Mexico to say that she had exiled herself there with her husband 
 and his two plural wives, and that she felt she had worked out sufficient atonement 
 for all her descendants; yet she saw girls of the family on the verge of entering 
 into plural marriage-if they had not already done so-and she begged us to continue 
 our newspaper exposures, so that others might be saved from the bitter experiences 
 of her life.</p>
 <p align="left">President Winder met me on the street in 1905, towards the close 
 of the year, and said: "Frank, you need not continue your fight against plural marriage. 
 President Smith has stopped it." "Then," I replied, "two things are evident: I have 
 been telling the truth when I said that plural marriage had been renewed-in spite 
 of the authorized denials-and if President Smith has stopped it now, he has had 
 authority over it all the time."</p>
 <p align="left">To me, or to any other well-informed citizen of Utah, President 
 Winder's admission was not necessary to prove Smith's responsibility. In the April 
 conference of 1904, Smith had read an "official statement," signed by him, prohibiting 
 plural marriages and threatening to excommunicate any officer or member of the Church 
 who should solemnize one; and this official statement was carried to the Senate 
 committee by Professor James E. Talmage, and offered in proof that the Church was 
 keeping its covenant.</p>
 <p align="left">For us, in Utah, the declaration served merely to illuminate 
 the dark places of ecclesiastical bad faith. We knew that from the year 1900 down, 
 there had never been a sermon preached in any Mormon tabernacle, by any of the general 
 authorities of the Church, against the practice of plural marriage, or against the 
 propriety of the practice, or against the sanctity of the doctrine. We knew, on 
 the contrary, that upon numerous occasions, at funerals and in public assemblages, 
 Joseph F. Smith and John Henry Smith and others of the hierarchy, had proclaimed 
 the doctrine as sacred. We knew that it was still being taught in the secret prayer 
 meetings. Practically all the leading authorities of the Church were living in plural 
 marriage. Some of them had taken new wives since the manifesto. None of them had 
 been actually punished. All were in high favor. And though Joseph F. Smith denied 
 his responsibility, every one knew that none of these things could be, except with 
 his active approval.</p>
 <p align="left">Perhaps, for a brief time, while Smoot's case was still before 
 the Senate, some check was put upon the renewal of polygamy. But, even then, there 
 were undoubtedly, occasional marriages allowed, where the parties were so situated 
 as to make concealment perfect. And all checks were withdrawn when Smoot's case 
 was favorably disposed of, and the Church found itself protected by the political 
 power of the administration at Washington and by a political and financial alliance 
 with "the Interests."</p>
 <p align="left">Today, in spite of the difficulty of discovering plural marriages, 
 because of the concealments by which they are protected, the <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> 
 is publishing a list of more than two hundred "new" polygamists with the dates and 
 circumstances of their marriages; and these are probably not one tenth of all the 
 cases. During President Taft's visit to Salt Lake City, in 1909, Senator Thomas 
 Kearns, one of the proprietors of the <i>Tribune,</i> offered to prove to one of 
 the President's confidants hundreds of cases of new polygamy, if the President would 
 designate two secret service men to investigate. I believe, from my own observation, 
 that there are more plural wives among the Mormons today than there were before 
 1890. Then the young men married early, and were chiefly monogamists. Now the change 
 in economic conditions has raised the age at which men marry; it has made more bachelors 
 than there were when simpler modes of life prevailed. The young women have fewer 
 offers of marriage, and more of these come from well-to-do polyga-mists. The girls 
 are still taught, as they have always been, that marriage is necessary to salvation; 
 and they are betrayed into plural marriage by natural conditions as well as by the 
 persuasions of the Church.</p>
 <p align="left">A perfect "underground" system has been put in operation for 
 the protection of the lawbreakers. If they reside in Utah, they frequently go to 
 Canada or to Mexico to be married; and the whole polygamous paraphernalia can be 
 transported with ease and comfort-the priest who performs the ceremony, the husband, 
 sometimes the legal wife to give her consent so that she may not be damned, and 
 the young woman whose soul is to be saved. And this "underground" is maintained 
 against the reluctance of the Mormon people. They aid in it from a kindly feeling 
 toward their fellow-believers-and with some faint thought that perhaps these wayfarers 
 are being "persecuted"-but all the time with no personal sympathy for polygamy. 
 By one sincere word of reprehension from Joseph F. Smith every "underground" station 
 could be abolished, the route could be destroyed, and an end could be put to the 
 protection that is, of itself, an encouragement to polygamous practice. He has never 
 spoken that word.</p>
 <p align="left">Recently, the way in which the new polygamy is perpetrated in 
 Utah has been almost officially revealed. A patriarch of the Church, resident in 
 Davis County, less than fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, had been solemnizing 
 these unlawful unions at wholesale. The situation became so notorious that the authorities 
 of the Church felt themselves impelled about September, 1910, to put restrictions 
 upon his activity. In the course of their investigations they discovered that he 
 did not know the persons whom he married. They would come to his house, in the evening, 
 wearing handkerchiefs over their faces; he sat hidden behind a screen in his parlor; 
 and under these circumstances the two were declared man and wife, and were sealed 
 up to everlasting bliss to rule over principalities and kingdoms with power of endless 
 increase and progression. He refused to tell the hierarchy from which one of the 
 authorities he had received his endowment to perpetrate these crimes. He refused 
 to give the names of any of the victims, claiming that he did not know them!</p>
 <p align="left">It is probable that for a long time plural marriage ceremonies 
 were not solemnized within the Salt Lake temple. Now, we know that there have lately 
 been such marriages in it, and at Manti, and at Logan, and perhaps also in the temple 
 at St. George. There are cases on record where a man has a wife on one side of the 
 Utah-Colorado line and another wife across the border. No prosecutions are possible 
 in Utah; for, as Joseph F. Smith told the Senate committee, the officers of the 
 law have too much "respect" for the ecclesiastical rulers of the state. Similarly, 
 in the surrounding states, the officers show exactly the same sort of " respect" 
 and for the same reason. They not only know the Church's power in local politics, 
 but they see the national administration allowing the polyga-mists and priests of 
 the Church to select the Federal officials, and they are not eager to rouse a resentment 
 against themselves, at Washington as well as at home, by prosecuting polygamous 
 Mormons.</p>
 <p align="left">Some few years ago, Irving Say ford, then representing the <i>
 Los Angeles Times,</i> asked Mr. P. H. Lannan, of the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> 
 why someone did not swear out warrants against President Smith for his offences 
 against the law. Mr. Lannan said: "You mean why don't <i>I</i> do it?"</p>
 <p align="left">"Oh, no," Mr. Sayford explained, "I don't mean you particularly."</p>
 <p align="left">"Oh, yes, you do," Mr. Lannan said. "You mean me if you mean 
 anybody. If it's not my duty, it's no one's duty. . . . Well, I'll tell you why. 
 . . . I don't make a complaint, because neither the district attorney nor the prosecuting 
 attorney would entertain it. If he <i>did</i> entertain it and issued a warrant, 
 the sheriff would refuse to serve the warrant. If the sheriff served the warrant, 
 there would be no witnesses unless <i>I</i> got them. If I could get the witnesses, 
 they wouldn't testify to the facts on the stand. If they <i>did</i> testify to the 
 facts, the jury wouldn't bring in a verdict of guilty. If the jury did bring in 
 a verdict of guilty, the judge would suspend sentence. If the judge did not suspend 
 sentence, he would merely fine President Smith, three hundred dollars. And within 
 twenty-four hours there would be a procession of Mormons and Gentiles crawling on 
 their hands and knees to Church headquarters to offer to pay that three hundred 
 dollar fine at a dime apiece."</p>
 <p align="left">Mr. Lannan's statement of the case was later substantiated by 
 an action of the Salt Lake District Court. Upon the birth of the twelfth child that 
 has been borne to President Smith in plural marriage since the manifesto of 1890, 
 Charles Mostyn Owen made complaint in the District Court at Salt Lake, charging 
 Mr. Smith with a statutory offence. The District Attorney reduced the charge to 
 "unlawful cohabitation" (a misdemeanor), without the complainant's consent or knowledge. 
 All the preliminaries were then graciously arranged and President Smith appeared 
 in the District Court by appointment. He pleaded guilty. The judge in sentencing 
 him remarked that as this was the first time he had appeared before the court, he 
 would be fined three hundred dollars, but that should he again appear, the penalty 
 might be different. Smith had already testified in Washington, before the Senate 
 Committee, to the birth of eleven children in plural marriage since he had given 
 his covenant to the country to cease living in polygamy; he had practically defied 
 the Senate and the United States to punish him; he had said that he would "stand" 
 his "chances" before the law and courts of his own state. All of this was well known 
 to the judge who fined him three hundred dollars-a sum of money scarcely equal to 
 the amount of Smith's official income for the time he was in court!</p>
 <p align="left">A leader of the Church, not long ago, asked me, in private conference, 
 what was the policy of the American party with regard to the new plural wives and 
 their children. I replied that as far as I knew it, the policy was to have the Church 
 accept its responsibility in the matter and give the wives and children whatever 
 recognition could be given them by their religion. The Church was guilty before 
 God and man of having encouraged the awful condition. It was unspeakably cowardly 
 and unfair for the Church leaders to put the whole burden of suffering on the helpless 
 women and children; and, moreover, this course was a justification to polygamists 
 in deserting their wives, on the ground that the Church had never sanctioned the 
 relation.</p>
 <p align="left">This Church leader, himself a new polygamist, answered miserably: 
 "The Church will not let itself be put in such a light before the country. That 
 would be to admit that it has been responsible all the time."</p>
 <p align="left">I asked: " Has the Church <i>not</i> been responsible?"</p>
 <p align="left">He replied-equivocating-: "Well, not the Church. The Church has 
 never taken a vote on it."</p>
 <p align="left">"That," I said, "answers why you have never got redress and never 
 will get it-because you are all liars, from top to bottom. You know you would never 
 have entered the polygamous relation-nor could you have induced your wife to enter 
 it-except with full knowledge that the Church <i>did</i> authorize it. The Church 
 is one man, and you know it. The whole theory of your theology collapses if you 
 deny <i>that</i>."</p>
 <p align="left">He shook his head blankly. "I don't know what is to become of 
 us. I don't see any way out."</p>
 <p align="left">I could only advise him that he should join with other new polygamists 
 in demanding that the Church authorities make all possible reparation to the women 
 and children who were being crushed under the penalties of the Church's crime. But 
 I knew that such advice was vain. He could not make such a demand, any more than 
 any other slave could demand his freedom. And if the non-polygamists demanded it, 
 the Prophets would deny that polygamy was being practised. The children could not 
 be legitimized-for the Church cannot obtain legitimizing statutes without avowing 
 its responsibility for the need of them; and the Gentiles can not pass such statutes 
 without encouraging the continuance of polygamy by removing the social penalty against 
 it.</p>
 <p align="left">So the burden of all this guilt, this shame, this deception, 
 falls upon the unfortunate plural wife and her innocent offspring. She is bound 
 by the most sacred obligations never to reveal the name of the officiating priest-even 
 if she knew it-nor to disclose the circumstances of the ceremony. She has justified 
 her degradation by the assumption that God has commanded it; that her husband has 
 received a revelation authorizing him to take her into his household; that her children 
 will be legitimate in the sight of God, and that eventually the civilized world 
 will come to a joyous acceptance of the practice of polygamy. When the trials of 
 her life afflict her and she finds no relentment in the world's disdain, she sees 
 no avenue of retreat. To break the relation is to imply at once that it was not 
 ordained of God, and to cast a darker ignominy upon her unfortunate children. Her 
 only hope lies in her continued submission to her husband and his Church, even after 
 she has mentally and morally rejected the doctrine that betrayed her. A more pitiably 
 helpless band of self-immolants than these Mormon women has never suffered martyrdom 
 in the history of the world. Heaven help them. There is no help for them on earth.</p>
