 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XIV</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">TREASON TRIUMPHANT</h1>
 <p>While these disclosures of the Smoot investigation were shocking 
 the sentiment of the whole nation, the Prophets carried on the conspiracy of their 
 defence with all the boldness of defiant guilt. In Salt Lake City, the office of 
 the United States Marshal and even the post-office were watched for the arrival 
 of subpoenas from Washington; men were posted in the streets to give the alarm whenever 
 the Marshal should attempt to serve papers; and before he entered the front door 
 of a Mormon's house, the Church sentry had entered by the back door to warn the 
 inmates. If the Federal power had been moving in a foreign land, it could not have 
 been more determinedly opposed by local authority. Notorious polygamists, wanted 
 as witnesses before the Senate committee, made a public flight through Utah, couriered, 
 flanked and rear-guarded by the power of the hierarchy. One of these law-breakers 
 (who, it was known, had been subpoenaed) went from Salt Lake City to take secret 
 employment in one of the Church's sugar factories in Idaho. When he was discovered 
 there and served with the Senate requisition, he gave his word that he would appear 
 at Washington, and then he fled with his new polygamous wife to a polygamous Mormon 
 settlement in Alberta, Canada-a fugitive, honored because he <i>was</i> a fugitive, 
 and officially sustained as a ward of the Church.</p>
 <p>Apostles John W. Taylor and Mathias F. Cowley left the country, 
 to escape a summons to Washington; and President Smith pleaded that he had no control 
 over their movements, and promised that he would, if possible, bring them back to 
 comply with the Senate subpoenas. He knew, as every Mormon and every well-informed 
 Gentile knew, that the slightest expression of a wish from him would be the word 
 of God to those two men. They would have gloried in going to Washington to show 
 the courage of their fanaticism. They would never have left the country without 
 instructions from their President. But they could not have married plural wives 
 after the manifesto, and solemnized plural marriages for other polygamists, without 
 Smith's knowledge and consent; their testimony would have placed the responsibility 
 for these unlawful practices upon the Prophet; and the penalty would have fallen 
 on the Prophet's Senator.</p>
 <p>They not only fled, but they allowed themselves in their absence 
 to be made the scapegoats of the hierarchy. They were proven guilty of "new polygamy" 
 before the Senate committee; and, for the sake of the effect upon the country, they 
 were ostensibly deposed from the apostolate by order of the President, who, by their 
 dismissal from the quorum, advanced his son Hyrum in seniority. But their apparent 
 degradation involved none of the consequences that Moses Thatcher had suffered. 
 They continued their ministrations in the Church. They remained high in favor with 
 the hierarchy. They claimed and received from the faithful the right to be regarded 
 as holily "the Lord's anointed" as they had ever been. They still held their Melchisedec 
 priesthood. One of them afterward took a new plural wife. It seems to be well authenticated 
 that the other continued to perform plural marriages; and every Mormon looked upon 
 them both-and still looks upon them-as zealous priests who endured the appearance 
 of shame in order to preserve the power of the Prophet in governing the nation.</p>
 <p>Another crucial point in President Smith's responsibility was his 
 solemnization of the plural marriage between Apostle Abraham H. Cannon and Lillian 
 Hamlin, of which I have already written. One of the women of the dead apostle's 
 family was subpoenaed to give her testimony in the matter. She thrice telephoned 
 to me that she wished to consult me; but she was surrounded by such a system of 
 espionage that again and again she failed to keep her appointment. At last, late 
 at night, she arrived at my office-the editorial office of the <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>-having 
 escaped, as she explained, in her maid's clothes. The agents of the hierarchy had 
 been subtly and ingeniously suggesting to her that she was perhaps mistaken in her 
 recollection of the facts to which she would have to testify, and she was distressed 
 with the doubt and fear which they had instilled into her mind. I could only adjure 
 her to tell the truth as she remembered it. But on her journey to Washington she 
 was constantly surrounded by Church "advisers;" and the effect of their "advice" 
 showed in the testimony that she gave-a testimony that failed to prove the known 
 guilt of the Prophet.</p>
 <p>For the Gentiles, there had begun a sort of "reign of terror," which 
 can be best summed up by an account of a private conference of twelve prominent 
 non-Mormons held as late as 1905. That conference was called to consider the situation, 
 and to devise means of acquainting the nation with the desperate state of affairs 
 in Utah. It was independent of the political movement that had already begun; it 
 aimed rather to organize a social rebellion, so that we might not be dependent for 
 all our opposition upon the annual or semi-annual campaigns of politics.</p>
 <p>The meeting first agreed upon the following statement of facts:</p>
 <p>"Utah's statehood, as now administered, is but a protection of the 
 Mormon hierarchy in its establishment of a theocratic kingdom under the flag of 
 the republic. This hierarchy holds itself superior to the Constitution and to the 
 law. It is spreading polygamy throughout the ranks of its followers. Through its 
 agents, it dominates the politics of the state, and its power is spreading to other 
 commonwealths. It exerts such sway over the officers of the law that the hierarchy 
 and its favorites cannot be reached by the hand of justice. It is master of the 
 State Legislature and of the Governor.</p>
 <p>"By means of its immense collection of tithes and its large investments 
 in commercial and financial enterprises, it dominates every line of business in 
 Utah except mines and railroads; and these latter it influences by means of its 
 control over Mormon labor and by its control of legislation and franchises. It holds 
 nearly every Gentile merchant and professional man at its vengeance, by its influence 
 over the patronage which he must have in order to be successful. It corrupts every 
 Gentile who is affected by either fear or venality, and makes of him a part of its 
 power to play the autocrat in Utah and to deceive the country as to its purposes 
 and its operations. Every Gentile who refuses to testify at its request and in its 
 behalf becomes a marked and endangered man. It rewards and it punishes according 
 to its will; and those Gentiles who have gone to Washington to testify for Smoot 
 are well aware of this fact. Unless the Gentiles of Utah shall soon be protected 
 by the power of the United States they will suffer either ruin or exile at the hands 
 of the hierarchy."</p>
 <p>When this declaration had been accepted, by all present, as truly 
 expressing their views of the situation, it was decided that they should confer 
 with other leading Gentiles, hold a mass meeting, adopt a set of resolutions embodying 
 the declaration on which they had agreed, and then despatch the resolutions to the 
 Senate committee, as a protest against the testimony of some of the Gentiles in 
 the Smoot case, and as an appeal to the nation for help.</p>
 <p>But although all approved of the declaration and all approved of 
 the method by which it was to be sent to the nation, no man there dared to stand 
 out publicly in support of such a protest, to offer the resolutions, or to speak 
 for them. The merchant knew that his trade would vanish in a night, leaving him 
 unable to meet his obligations and certain of financial destruction. The lawyer 
 knew not only that the hierarchy would deprive him of all his Mormon clients, but 
 that it would make him so unpopular with courts and juries that no Gentile litigant 
 would dare employ him. The mining man knew that the hierarchy could direct legislation 
 against him, might possibly influence courts and could assuredly influence jurors 
 to destroy him. And so with all the others at the conference.</p>
 <p>They were not cowards. They had shown themselves, in the past, of 
 more than average human courage, loyalty and ability. All recognized that if the 
 power of the hierarchy were not soon met and broken it would grow too great to be 
 resisted-that another generation would find itself hopelessly enslaved. Every father 
 felt that the liberties of his children were at stake; that they would be bond or 
 free by the issue of the conflict then in course at Washington. And yet not one 
 dared to throw down the gauntlet to tyranny-to devote himself to certain ruin. They 
 had to prefer simple slavery to beggary and slavery combined. They had to hope silently 
 that the power of the nation would intervene. They could work only secretly for 
 the fulfilment of that hope.</p>
 <p>At first, in President Roosevelt they saw the promise of their salvation. 
 He had opposed the election of Apostle Smoot. When the report of the apostle's candidacy 
 had first reached Washington, the President had summoned to the White House Senator 
 Thomas Kearns of Utah and Senator Mark Hanna, who was chairman of the National Republican 
 committee; and to these two men he had declared his opposition to the candidacy 
 of a Mormon apostle as a Republican aspirant for a Senatorship. At his request Senator 
 Hanna, as chairman of the party, signed a letter of remonstrance to the party chiefs 
 in Utah, and President Roosevelt, at a later conference, gave this letter to Senator 
 Kearns to be communicated to the state leaders. Senator Kearns transmitted the message, 
 and by so doing he "dug his political grave" as the Mormon stake president, Lewis 
 W. Shurtliff, expressed it.</p>
 <p>Colonel C. E. Loose of Provo went to Washington on behalf of the 
 Church authorities. He was a Gentile, a partner of Apostle Smoot and of some of 
 the other Mormon leaders in business undertakings, a wealthy mining man, a prominent 
 Republican. It was reported in Utah that his arguments for Smoot carried some weight 
 in Washington. President Roosevelt was to be a candidate for election; and the old 
 guard of the Republican party, distrustful of the Roosevelt progressive policies, 
 was gathering for a grim stand around Senator Mark Hanna. Both factions were playing 
 for votes in the approaching national convention. I have it on the authority of 
 a Mormon ecclesiast, who was in the political confidence of the Church leaders, 
 that President Roosevelt was promised the votes of the Utah delegation and such 
 other convention votes as the Church politicians could control. The death of Senator 
 Hanna made this promise unnecessary, if there ever was an explicit promise. But 
 this much is certain. President Roosevelt's opposition to Apostle Smoot, for whatever 
 reason, changed to favor.</p>
 <p>The character and impulses of the President were of a sort to make 
 him peculiarly susceptible to an appeal for help on the part of the Mormons. He 
 had lived in the West. He knew something of the hardships attendant upon conquering 
 the waste places. He sympathized with those who dared, for their own opinions, to 
 oppose the opinions of the rest of the world. He had received the most adulating 
 assurances of support for his candidacies and his policies. It would have required 
 a man of the calmest discrimination and coolest judgment to find the line between 
 any just claim for mercy presented by the Mormon advocates of "religious liberty" 
 and the wilful offences which they were committing against the national integrity.</p>
 <p>I have received it personally, from the lips of more than one member 
 of the Senate committee, that never in all their experience with public questions 
 was such executive pressure brought to bear upon them as was urged from the White 
 House, at this time, for the protection of Apostle Smoot's seat in the Senate. The 
 President's most intimate friends on the committee voted with the minority to seat 
 Smoot. One of the President's closest adherents, Senator Dolliver, after having 
 signed a majority report to exclude Smoot-and having been re-elected, in the meantime, 
 by his own State legislature, to another term in the Senate-afterwards spoke and 
 voted against the report which he had signed. Senator A. J. Hopkins of Illinois, 
 who had supported Smoot consistently, found himself bitterly attacked, in his campaign 
 for re-election, because of his record in the Smoot case, and he published in his 
 defence a letter from President Roosevelt that read: "Just a line to congratulate 
 you upon the Smoot case. It is not my business, but it is a pleasure to see a public 
 servant show, under trying circumstances, the courage, ability and sense of right 
 that you have shown."</p>
 <p>After the outrageous exposures of the violations of law, the treason 
 and the criminal indifference to human rights shown by the rulers of the Church, 
 if an early vote had been taken by the committee and by the Senate itself, the antagonism 
 of the nation would have forced the exclusion of the Apostle from the upper House. 
 Delay was his salvation. More to the President's influence than to any other cause 
 is the delay attributable that prolonged the case through a term of three years. 
 During that time the unfortunate Gentiles of Utah learned that, instead of receiving 
 help from the President, they were to have only the most insuperable opposition. 
 They believed that the President was being grossly misled; that it was, of course, 
 impossible for him to read all the testimony given before the Senate committee, 
 and that the matters that reached him were being tinged with other purpose than 
 the vindication of truth and justice. But it was impossible to obtain the opportunity 
 of setting him right. Even the women who were leading the national protest against 
 the polygamous teaching and practices of Smoot's fellow apostles were told that 
 the President had made up his mind and could not be re-convinced.</p>
 <p>The Mormon appeal to his generosity was not confined to Washington. 
 On his travels he met President Smith more than once-the Prophet being accompanied 
 by a different wife each time-and naturally Smith made every effort to impress President 
 Roosevelt with his earnestness, the purity of his life, and the high motives that 
 actuated the exercise of his authority. And at this sort of pretence the Lord's 
 anointed are expert.</p>
 <p>They themselves may be crude in ideas and coarse in method, but 
 their diplomacy is a growth of eighty years of applied devotion and energy.</p>
 <p>The American people are used to meeting prominent Mormons who are 
 models of demeanor-who are hearty of manner; who carry a kindly light in their eyes; 
 who have a spontaneity that precludes hypocrisy or even deep purpose. These are 
 not the men who make the Church diplomacy-they simply obey it. It is part of that 
 diplomacy to send out such men for contact with the world. But the ablest minds 
 of the Church, whether they are of the hierarchy or not, construct its policies. 
 And given a system whose human units move instantly and un-questioningly at command; 
 given a system whose worldly power is available at any point at any moment; given 
 a system whose movement may be as secret as the grave until result is attained-and" 
 the clumsiest of politicians or the crudest of diplomats has a force to effect his 
 ends that is as powerful for its size as any that Christendom has ever known.</p>
 <p>Among the emissaries of the Church who were deputed to "reach" President 
 Roosevelt, was our old friend Ben Rich, the gay, the engaging, the apparently irresponsible 
 agent of hierarchical diplomacy. And I should like to relate the story of his "approach," 
 as it is still related in the inner circle of Church confidences. Not that I expect 
 it to be wholly credited-not that I doubt but it will be denied on all sides-but 
 because it is so characteristic of Church gossip and so typical (even if it were 
 untrue) of the humorous cynicism of Church diplomacy.</p>
 <p>When President Roosevelt was making his "swing around the circle," 
 Rich was appointed to join him, found the opportunity to do so, and (so the story 
 is told) delighted the President by the spirit and candor of his good-fellowship. 
 When they were about to part, the President is reported to have said, "Why don't 
 you run for Congress from your state? You're just the kind of man I'd like to have 
 in the House to support my policies." And here (as the Mormons are told) is the 
 dialogue that ensued:</p>
 <p><i>Rich:</i> "I have no ambition that way, Mr. President. For 
 many reasons it's out of the question-although I'm grateful for the nattering suggestion."</p>
 <p><i>The President:</i> "Then let me appoint you to some good office. 
 You're the kind of man I'd like to have in my official family."</p>
 <p><i>Rich</i> (impressively and in a low tone): "Mr. President, I'd 
 count it the greatest honor of my life to have a commission from you to <i>any</i> 
 office. I'd hand that commission down to my children as the most precious heritage. 
 But-I love you too much, Mr.</p>
 <p>President, to put you in any such hole. I'm a polygamist. It would 
 injure you before the whole country."</p>
 <p><i>The President</i> (leaning forward eagerly): "No! Are <i>you</i> 
 a polygamist? Tell me all about it."</p>
 <p><i>Rich:</i> " The Lord has bestowed that blessing on me. I wish 
 you could go into my home and see how my wives are living together like sisters-how 
 tender they are to each other-how they bear each other's burdens and share each 
 other's sorrows-and how fond all my children are of Mother and Auntie."</p>
 <p><i>The President:</i> "Well-but how can women agree 
 to share a husband?"</p>
 <p><i>Rich:</i> "They do it in obedience to a revelation 
 from the Lord-a revelation that proclaimed the doctrine of the eternity and the 
 plurality of the marriage covenant. We believe that men and women, sealed in this 
 life under proper authority, are united in the conjugal relation throughout eternity. 
 We believe that the husband is tied to his wives, and they to him; that their children 
 and all the generations of their children will belong to him hereafter. We believe 
 in eternal progression; that as man is, God was; and as God is, man shall be. We 
 believe that by obedience to this revealed covenant, we will be exalted in the celestial 
 realm of our Father, with power in ourselves to create and people worlds. It is 
 a never ending and constantly increasing intelligence and labor. If I keep my covenants 
 to my wives and they to me, in this world, all the powers and rights of our marriage 
 relation will be continued and amplified to us in the life to come; and we, in our 
 turn, will be rulers over worlds and universes of worlds."</p>
 <p>Then-according to the unctuous gossip of the devout-President Roosevelt 
 saw the true answer to his own desire to know what was to become of his mighty personality 
 after this world should have fallen away from him! He saw, in this faith, a possible 
 continuation throughout eternity of the tremendous energies of his being! He was 
 to continue to rule not merely a nation but a world, a system of worlds, a universe 
 of worlds! And it is told-sometimes solemnly, sometimes with a grin-that, in the 
 Temple at Salt Lake, a proxy has stood for him and he has been baptized into the 
 Mormon Church; that proxies have stood for the members of his family and that they 
 have been sealed to him; and finally that proxies have stood for some of the great 
 queens of the past (who had not already been sealed to Mormon leaders) and that 
 they have been sealed to the President for eternity![<u><font color="#0000ff"><a href="#foot1" name="text1" style="text-decoration: none">1</a></font></u>]</p>
 <p>This may sound blasphemous toward Theodore Roosevelt-if not toward the 
 Almighty-but it is told, and it is believed, by hundreds and thousands of the 
 faithful among the Mormon people. It is given to them as the secret explanation 
 of President Roosevelt's protection of the Mormon tyranny-a protection of which 
 Apostle Hyrum Smith boasted in a sermon in the Salt Lake tabernacle (April 5, 
 1905) in these equivocal words: "We believe-and I want to say this-that in 
 President Roosevelt we have a friend, and we believe that in the Latter-day 
 Saints President Roosevelt has the greatest friendship among them; and there are 
 no people in the world who are more friendly to him, and will remain friendly 
 unto him just so long as he remains true, as he has been, to the cause of 
 humanity."</p>
 <p>The Smiths have their own idea of what "the cause of humanity" is.</p>
 <p><a name="foot1" href="#text1">1</a> It is a not uncommon practice in the 
 Mormon Church thus to "do a work" for a Gentile who has befriended the people or 
 otherwise won the gratitude of the Church authorities.</p>
