 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XV</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY</h1>
 <p>As early as 1903, before the Smoot investigation began, the <i>Utah 
 State Journal</i> (of which I became editor) was founded as a Democratic daily newspaper, 
 to attempt a restoration of political freedom in Utah and to remonstrate against 
 the new polygamy, of which rumors were already insistent. I was at once warned by 
 Judge Henry H. Rolapp (a prominent Democrat on the District bench, and secretary 
 of the Amalgamated Sugar Company) that we need not look for aid from the political 
 or business interests of the community, inasmuch as our avowed purpose had already 
 antagonized the Church. He delivered this message in a friendly spirit from a number 
 of Democrats whose support we had been expecting. And the warning proved to be well-inspired. 
 Although a number of courageous Gentiles, like Colonel E. A. Wall of Salt Lake City, 
 gave us material aid-and although there was no other Democratic daily paper in Utah 
 (unless it was the <i>Salt Lake Herald,</i> owned by Senator Clark of Montana)-the 
 most powerful Church Democratic interests stood against us, and we found it impossible 
 to make any effective headway with the paper.</p>
 <p>After the Prophets began to give their awful testimony at Washington, 
 the Democratic National Convention of 1904 (which I attended as a delegate from 
 Utah) considered a resolution in opposition to polygamy and the Church's rule of 
 the state. This resolution was as vigorously fought by some Utah Gentiles as by 
 the Mormon delegates, on the grounds that it would defeat the Democratic party in 
 Utah. It carried in the convention. Upon returning to Salt Lake City I called a 
 meeting of the Democratic state committee (of which I was chairman) and urged that 
 we make our state campaign on the issue of ecclesiastical domination, in consonance 
 with the party's national platform. Of the whole committee only the secretary, Mr. 
 P. J. Daly, supported the proposal. The others considered it "an attempt to establish 
 a quarantine against Democratic success." Some of them had been promised by members 
 of the hierarchy that the party was to have "a square deal this time." Others had 
 fatuously accepted the assurances of ecclesiasts that "it looked like a Democratic 
 year." In short, the Democratic party in Utah, like the Republican party, proved 
 to be then, as it is now, less a political organization than the tool of a Church 
 cabal. We found that we could no more hope to move the Democratic machine against 
 the hierarchy than to move the Smoot-Republican machine itself.</p>
 <p>But when Joseph F. Smith, before the Senate committee, admitted 
 that he was violating "the laws of God and man" and tried to extenuate his guilt 
 with the plea that the Gentiles of Utah condoned it, he issued a challenge that 
 no American citizen could ignore. The Gentiles of Utah had been silent, theretofore, 
 partly because they were ignorant of the extent of the polygamous offences of the 
 hierarchy, and partly because they were hoping for better things. Smith's boast 
 made their silence the acquiescence of sympathy. A meeting was called in Salt Lake 
 City, in May, 1904, and under the direction of Colonel William Nelson, editor of 
 the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> the principles of the present "American party" were 
 enunciated as a protest against the law-breaking tyranny . of the Church leaders. 
 Later, as it became clear that the opponents of the Smith misrule must organize 
 their own party of progress, committees were formed and a convention was held (in 
 September, 1904) at which a full state and county ticket was put in the field, in 
 the name of the American Party of Utah.</p>
 <p>We agreed that no war should be made on the Mormon religion as such; 
 that no war should be made on the Mormon people because of their being Mormons; 
 that we would draw a deadline at the year 1890, when the Church had effected a composition 
 of its differences with the national government, and all the citizens of Utah, Mormon 
 and Gentile alike, had accepted the conditions of settlement; that we would find 
 our cause of quarrel in the hierarchy's violation of the statehood pledges; and 
 that when we had corrected these evil practices we should dissolve, because (to 
 quote the language used at the time) we did not wish "to raise a tyrant merely to 
 slay a tyrant."</p>
 <p>In the idea that we would fight upon living issues-that we would 
 not open the graves of the past to dig up a dead quarrel and parade it in its cerements-the 
 American party movement began. Its first enlistment included practically all the 
 Gentiles in Salt Lake City who resented the claim of the Prophet that they acquiesced 
 in his crimes and his treasons. But the most promising sign for the party was its 
 attraction of hundreds of independent Mormons of the younger generation. As one 
 Mormon of that hopeful time expressed it: "The flag represents the political power. 
 The golden angel Moroni, at the top of the Temple, represents the ecclesiastical 
 authority. I will not pay to either one a deference which belongs to the other. 
 I know how to keep them apart in my personal devotion."</p>
 <p>This was exactly what the Church authorities would not permit. It 
 would have destroyed all the special and selfish prerogatives of the Mormon hierarchs. 
 It would have subverted their claim of absolute temporal power. It would have set 
 up the nation and the state as the objects of civic devotion-instead of the Kingdom 
 of God.</p>
 <p>Although we of the American party disavowed and abstained from any 
 attack upon the Mormon Church as such-and confined ourselves to a war upon the treasons, 
 the violations of law, the breaches of covenant and the other offences of the Church 
 leaders, as the practices of individuals-these leaders dragged the whole body of 
 the Church as a wall of defence around them, and in countless sermons and printed 
 articles declared that the Church and its faith were the objects of our assault. 
 In other words, though Smith claimed in Washington-and Smoot continues to claim 
 before the nation-that the Church is not responsible for the crimes of its Prophets, 
 whenever a criticism or a prosecution is directed against any of these men, they 
 all unite in declaring that the Church is being persecuted; and the members of the 
 hierarchy rouse all their followers, and use all their agencies, in a successful 
 resistance.</p>
 <p>There was no blithesomeness in the campaign. It was not lightened 
 by any humor. It was a hopeless assault on the one side and a grim overpowering 
 resistance on the other. The American party, being organized as a protest, had at 
 first little regard for offices. It sought to promulgate the principles of its cause 
 for the enlightenment of the citizens of Utah and for the preservation of their 
 rights. Some of the Gentiles who did not join us felt, perhaps, as strong an indignation 
 as those who did, but they were entangled in politics with the hierarchs, or had 
 business connections that would be destroyed. These men, in course of time, became 
 the most dangerous opponents of our progress. (The average Mormon is obedient and 
 supine enough in the presence of his Prophets, but he is a man of personal independence 
 compared with the sycophantic Gentile who accepts political or commercial favors 
 from the Church chiefs and yet continues to deny the existence of the very power 
 to which he bends the knee.) Of the rebellious but discreet Mormons many came to 
 the leaders of our party to say: "I think you're quite right. I, myself, have suffered 
 under these tyrannies. I have no sympathy with new polygamy. But, as you know, I'm 
 attorney for some of the Church interests"-or "I'm in business with high ecclesiasts"-or 
 "I'm heavily in debt to the Church bank"-or "I'm closely connected by marriage with 
 one of the Prophets"-"and I can do you more good by my quiet efforts than by coming 
 out into the open. I'd be treated as an apostate. All my influence would be gone." 
 And in most cases he preserved his influence, and we lost him. The Church had effective 
 ways of recovering his support.</p>
 <p>For many reasons the American party looked for its recruits chiefly 
 among Republicans, the Democracy being almost entirely Mormon. And in the first 
 flush of enthusiasm some of our leaders laughed at the boast of the Republican state 
 chairman that, for every Republican he lost, he would get two Mormon Democrats to 
 vote the Republican ticket. (This was Hon. William Spry, a Mormon, since made Governor 
 of Utah, for services rendered the hierarchy.) But the claim proved anything but 
 laughable. He got probably four Mormon Democrats for every Republican he lost. As 
 usual the hierarchy "delivered the goods" to the national organization in power.</p>
 <p>According to our best calculations we got from fifteen hundred to 
 eighteen hundred Mormon votes. And, during this campaign and those that followed, 
 I was approached by hundreds of Mormons who commended our work and gave private 
 voice to the hope that we might succeed in freeing Utah so that they themselves 
 might be free. After I joined the staff of the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> as chief 
 editor, these came to my office by stealth and in obvious fear. I could not blame 
 them then, nor do I now. The cost of open defiance was too great.</p>
 <p>One woman, the first wife of a prominent Mormon physician, came 
 to me to enlist in the work of the party. (Her husband was living with a young plural 
 wife.) We accepted her aid. Her husband cut off her monthly allowance, and she had 
 to take employment as a book canvasser, so that she might be able to earn her living. 
 One Mormon who came out openly for us, was superintendent of a business owned by 
 Gentiles. He was somewhat prominent as an ecclesiast, and he was a Sunday School 
 worker in his ward. He reconciled his wife and daughters to his revolt against the 
 recrudescence of polygamy and the tyranny of the Church's political control. He 
 carried with him the sympathy of his brother, who was a newspaper editor. He won 
 over some of his personal friends to pledge their support to our cause. He seemed 
 too sturdy ever to retreat, too independent in his circumstances to be driven, and 
 with too clear a vision to be led astray by the threats, the power, or the persuasions 
 of the hierarchy. Yet, before long he came to confess that he could not continue 
 to help us openly. His employers-his Gentile employers-had notified him that his 
 work in the American party would be dangerously injurious to their business. They 
 were in hearty accord with his views; they recognized his right as a citizen to 
 act according to his convictions; but-they dared not provoke a war of business reprisals 
 with the commercial and financial institutions of the Church. He must either cease 
 his active opposition to the Church leaders, or lose his place of employment. . 
 . . He retired from the fight.</p>
 <p>Another Mormon who joined us was Don. C. Musser, a son of one of 
 the Church historians. He had been a missionary in Germany and in Palestine. He 
 had been a soldier in the Philippines, and he had edited the first American newspaper 
 there. His contact with the world and his experience in the military service of 
 the United States had given him a high ideal of his country; and a feeling of loyalty 
 to the nation had superseded his earlier devotion to the Prophets. His family was 
 wealthy, but he was supporting himself and his young wife by his own efforts in 
 business. As soon as he came out openly with the American party, his father's home 
 was closed against him. His business connections were withdrawn from him. He found 
 himself unable to provide for his wife, who was in delicate health. After a losing 
 struggle, he came to tell us that he could no longer earn a living in Utah; that 
 he had obtained means to emigrate; that he must say good-bye. And we lost <i>him</i>.</p>
 <p>Two other young men-the son and the son-in-law of an apostle-came 
 to me and asked helplessly for advice. They admitted that the practices of the hierarchy 
 were, to them, a violation of the covenant with the nation, a transgression of the 
 revelation from God given to Wilford Woodruff, and destructive of all the securities 
 of community association. But would I advise them to sacrifice their influence in 
 the Church by joining the "American movement" publicly? Or had they better retain 
 their influence and use it within the Church to correct the evils that we were attacking?</p>
 <p>With awful sincerity they spoke of conditions that had come under 
 their own eyes, and related instances to show how mercilessly the polygamous favorites 
 of the Church were permitted to prey on the young women teachers in Church schools. 
 They spoke of J. M. Tanner, who was at that time head of the Church schools, a member 
 of the general Board of Education, and one of the Sunday School superintendents. 
 According to these young men-and according to general report-Tanner was marrying 
 right and left.</p>
 <p>I knew of a young Mormon of Brigham City, who had been a suitor 
 for the hand of L--, a teacher at the Logan College. He had been away from Utah 
 for some time, and he had returned hoping to make her his wife. Stopping over night 
 in Salt Lake, on his way home, he saw Tanner and L--enter the lobby of the hotel 
 in which he sat. They registered as man and wife and went upstairs together. He 
 followed-to walk the floor of his room all night, struggling against the impulse 
 to break in, and kill Tanner, and damn his own soul by meddling with the man who 
 had been ordained by the Prophets to a wholesale polygamous prerogative.</p>
 <p>He had kept his hands clean of blood, but he had been living ever 
 since with murder in his heart. Could these two sons of the Church do more to remedy 
 such horrors by using their influence to have Tanner deposed, or by sacrificing 
 that influence in an open revolt against the conditions that made Tanner possible? 
 I could only advise them to act according to their own best sense of what was right. 
 They <i>did</i> use their influence to help force Tanner's deposition, but we lost 
 the public example of their opposition to the crimes of the hierarchy.</p>
 <p>I relate these incidents as typical of the different kinds of pressure 
 that were brought to bear upon the independent Mormons who wished to aid us, and 
 of the local difficulties against which we had to contend. Washington, of course, 
 gave us no recognition. And we did not succeed in reaching the ear of the nation. 
 Here and there a newspaper noted our effort and paid some small heed to our protest, 
 but the overwhelming success of the Republican party-and the dumb-driven acquiescence 
 of the Democracy-in Utah and the neighboring Church-ruled states, left the agitation 
 with little of political interest for the country at large.</p>
 <p>And yet the struggle went on. Animated by the spirit of the <i>Salt 
 Lake Tribune</i>, the leading newspaper of the community, the American party entered 
 the city elections in the fall of 1905 and carried them against the hierarchy's 
 Democratic ticket, with the help of the independent Mormons, under cover of the 
 secret ballot. Emboldened by this success we proposed to move on the state and county 
 offices, with the hope of gaining some members of the legislature and some of the 
 judicial and executive offices, through which to enforce the laws that the Church 
 leaders were defying. But here we failed. Outside of Salt Lake the rule of the Prophets 
 was still absolute and unquestioned. The people bowed reverently to Joseph F. Smith's 
 dictum: "When a man says 'You may direct me spiritually but not temporally,' he 
 lies in the presence of God-that is, if he has got intelligence enough to know what 
 he is talking about." The state politicians knew that they would destroy themselves 
 by joining an organization opposed by the all-powerful Church; and sufficient warning 
 of this doom appeared to them in the fact that no member of the American party could 
 obtain any recognition in Federal appointments. The Church had meanwhile dictated 
 the election of another United States Senator (George Sutherland) to join Apostle 
 Smoot, and Senator Kearns was retired for his opposition to the hierarchy.<font color="#0000ff">[<u><a name="text1" href="#foot1" style="text-decoration: none">1</a></u>]</font> 
 It began to be more and more apparent that whatever success we might achieve locally, 
 the power of the financial and political allies of the Prophets in Washington, aided 
 by the executive "Big Stick" of the President, would beat us back from any attempt 
 to rouse the state or the nation to our support.</p>
 <p>Smoot was in a happy position: all the senators who represented 
 the "Interests" were for him, and all the senators who represented the supposed 
 progressive sentiment of Theodore Roosevelt were also for him. The women of the 
 nation had sent a protest with a million signatures to the Senate; but they had 
 not votes; they received, in reply, a public scolding. Long before the Senate voted 
 on its committee's report, many of the notorious "new" polygamists of the Church 
 returned from their exile in foreign missions and began to walk the streets of Salt 
 Lake with their old swagger of self-confident authority. We foresaw the end.</p>
 <p>Early in December, 1906, Senator J. C. Burrows of Michigan, chairman 
 of the committee that had investigated Smoot, called up the committee's report and 
 spoke upon it in a denunciation of Smoot. Senator Dubois of Idaho followed, two 
 days later, with a supplementary attack, and censured President Roosevelt for "allowing 
 his name and office" to be used in defence of the Mormons. After an interval of 
 a month, Senator Albert J. Hopkins, of Illinois, undertook to reply with a defence 
 of Smoot that reduced the Apostle's excuses to the absurd. Smoot, he declared, had 
 opposed polygamy "even from his infancy;" there was "nothing in the constitution" 
 prohibiting "a State from having an established Church;" the old practices of Mormonism 
 were dying out; and Smoot, as an exponent of the newer Mormonism, was largely responsible 
 for the improvement.</p>
 <p>This bold falsehood was received with laughter by the members who 
 had heard the testimony before the Senate committee or read the record of its sittings; 
 but it was wired to all newspapers; and the contradictions that followed it failed 
 (for reasons) to get the same publicity. It was repeated by Senator Sutherland (January 
 22, 1907); and he had the audacity to add that the Mormon Church, as well as Smoot, 
 was opposed to polygamy; that the "sporadic cases" of new polygamy were "reprehended 
 by Mormon and Gentile alike;" that polygamous marriages in Utah had been forbidden 
 by the Enabling Act, but that polygamous cohabitation had been left to the state; 
 and that the latter was rapidly dying out. And Sutherland knew, as every public 
 man in Utah knew, that almost every word of this statement was untrue.</p>
 <p>Senator Philander C. Knox, of Pennsylvania (February 14, 1907) took 
 up the lie that Smoot had been "from his youth against polygamy," and he added to 
 it a legal argument that the Senate could only expel a member, by a two-thirds vote, 
 if he were guilty of crime, offensive immorality, disloyalty or gross impropriety 
 during his term of service. Senator Tillman (February 15) accused President Roosevelt 
 of protecting Smoot in return for a pledge of Mormon support given previous to the 
 last campaign. Apostle Smoot (February 19) declared that cases of "new" polygamy 
 were rare; that they were not sanctioned by the Church; that every case since 1890 
 "has the express condemnation of the Church;" and that he himself had always opposed 
 polygamy. On February 20, the question was forced to a vote after a debate that 
 repeated these falsehoods, in spite of all disproofs of them. And Apostle Smoot 
 was retained in his seat by a vote of fifty-one to thirty-seven, counting pairs.</p>
 <p>After this event, no growth of organization was immediately possible 
 to the American party. Having gained political control of Salt Lake City and given 
 it good municipal government, we were able to hold a local adherency; but hundreds 
 of Mormons, who still vote the American city ticket, vote for the Church in state 
 elections, because, though they want reform, they are not willing to risk the punishment 
 of their relatives and the leaders of the Church to attain that reform. And when 
 the national government granted its patent of approval to the hierarchy-by holding 
 the hierarchy's appointed representative in the Senate as its prophetic monitor-nearly 
 all the people of the intermountain country lost heart in the fight. Thousands of 
 Gentiles, who knew the truth and had fought for it for years, argued despairingly: 
 "If the nation likes this sort of thing-I guess it's the sort of thing it likes. 
 I'm not going to ruin myself financially and politically by keeping up a losing 
 struggle with these neighbors of mine, and fight the government at Washington besides. 
 If the administration wants to be bossed by the Prophet, Seer and Revelator, <i>
 I</i> can stand it."</p>
 <p>The nation, having accepted responsibility for past polygamy, now, 
 by accepting Senator Smoot, gave its responsible approval to the new polygamy and 
 to the commercial and political tyrannies of the Church. In the old days the Mormons 
 had claimed immunity for their practice of polygamy on the ground that the constitution 
 of the United States protected them in the exercises of their faith. The Supreme 
 Court of the country determined that the free-religion clause of the constitution 
 did not cover violations of law; and the Church deliberately abandoned its claim 
 of religious immunity. But now a majority of the Senate, supported by President 
 Roosevelt, took the old ground-which the Supreme Court had made untenable and the 
 Mormons themselves had vacated-and practically declared that violations of law were 
 a part of the constitutional guaranty!</p>
 <p><a name="foot1" href="#text1">1</a> When Senator Aldrich was carrying the tariff 
 bill of 1910 through the Senate, for the greater profit of the "Interests," Smoot 
 and Sutherland did not once vote against him. Smoot supported him on every one of 
 the one hundred and twenty-nine votes and missed none. Sutherland voted with him 
 one hundred and seventeen times and was recorded as not voting on the remaining 
 twelve. Only two other senators made anything like such a despicable record.</p>
