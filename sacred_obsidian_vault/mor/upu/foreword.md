 <h1 align="CENTER">FOREWORD</h1>
 <p align="left">On the fourth day of January, 1896, the territory of Utah was 
 admitted to statehood, and the proscribed among its people were freed to the liberties 
 of American citizenship, upon the solemn covenant of the leaders of the Mormon Church 
 that they and their followers would live, thereafter, according to the laws and 
 institutions of the nation of which they were allowed to become a part. And that 
 gracious settlement of upwards of forty years of conflict was negotiated through 
 responsible mediators, was endorsed by the good faith of the non-Mormons of Utah, 
 and was sealed by a treaty convention in which the high contracting parties were 
 the American Republic and the "Kingdom of God on Earth."</p>
 <p align="left">I propose, in this narrative, to show that the leaders of the 
 Mormon Church have broken their covenant to the nation; that they have abused the 
 confidence of the Gentiles of Utah and betrayed the trust of the people under their 
 power, by using that power to prevent the state of Utah from becoming what it had 
 engaged to become. I propose to show that the people of Utah, upraised to freedom 
 by the magnanimity of the nation, are being made to appear traitorous to the generosity 
 that saved them; that the Mormons of Utah are being falsely misled into the peculiar 
 dangers from which they thought they had forever escaped; that the unity, the solidarity, 
 the loyalty of these fervent people is being turned as a weapon of offence against 
 the whole country, for the greater profit of the leaders and the aggrandizement 
 of their power. I undertake, in fact, in this narrative, to expose and to demonstrate 
 what I do believe to be one of the most direful conspiracies of treachery in the 
 history of the United States.</p>
 <p align="left">Not that I have anything in my heart against the Mormon people! 
 Heaven forbid! I know them to be great in their virtues, wholesome in their relations, 
 capable of an heroic fortitude, living by the tenderest sentiments of fraternity, 
 as gentle as the Quakers, as staunch as the Jews. I think of them as a man among 
 strangers thinks of the dearness of his home. I am bound to them in affection by 
 all the ties of life. The smiles of neighborliness, the greetings of friends, all 
 the familiar devotion of brothers and sisters, the love of the parents who held 
 me in their arms-by these I know them as my own people, and by these I love them 
 as a good people, as a strong people, as a people worthy to be strong and fit to 
 be loved.</p>
 <p align="left">But it is even through their virtue and by their very strength 
 that they are being betrayed. A human devotion-the like of which has rarely lived 
 among the citizens of any modern state-is being directed as an instrument of subjugation 
 against others and held as a means of oppression upon the Mormons themselves. Noble 
 when they were weak, they are being led to ignoble purpose now that they have become 
 strong. Praying for justice when they had no power, now that they have gained power 
 it is being abused to ends of injustice. Their leaders, reaching for the fleshpots 
 for which these simple-hearted devotees have never sighed, have allied themselves 
 with all the predaceous "interests" of the country and now use the superhuman power 
 of a religious tyranny to increase the dividends of a national plunder. In the long 
 years of misery when the Mormons of Utah were proscribed and hunted, because they 
 refused to abandon what was to them, at that time, a divine revelation and a confirmed 
 article of faith, I sat many times in the gallery of the Senate in Washington, and 
 heard discussed new measures of destruction against these victims of their own fidelity, 
 and felt the dome above me impending like a brazen weight of national resentment 
 upon all our heads. When, a few years later, I stood before the President's desk 
 in the Senate chamber, to take my oath of office as the representative of the freed 
 people of Utah in the councils of the nation, I raised my eyes to my old seat of 
 terror in the gallery, and pledged myself, in that remembrance, never to vote nor 
 speak for anything but the largest measure of justice that my soul was big enough 
 to comprehend. By such engagement I write now, bound in a double debt of obligation 
 to the nation whose magnanimity then saved us and to the people whom I humbly helped 
 to save.</p>
