 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XII</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">THE CONSPIRACY COMPLETED</h1>
 <p align="left">The Smiths were no sooner firm in power than rumors began to 
 circulate of a recrudescence of plural marriage, and I heard reports of political 
 plots by which the Prophets were to re-establish their autocracy in worldly affairs 
 in the name of God. I sought to close my mind against such accusations, for I remembered 
 how often my father had been misjudged, and I felt that nothing but the most direct 
 evidence should be permitted to convince me of a recession by the Church authorities 
 from the miraculous opportunity of progress that was now open to their leadership. 
 Such direct evidence came, in part, in the state elections of 1902.</p>
 <p align="left">The Utah Democrats re-nominated Wm. H. King for Congress; Senator 
 Joseph L. Rawlins was their candidate to succeed himself in the United States Senate. 
 The Republicans nominated President Smith's friend, Joseph Howell, for Congress; 
 and there began to spread a rumor that Apostle Reed Smoot was to become a Republican 
 candidate for the Senatorship under an old promise given him by President Snow and 
 now endorsed by President Smith. I had been made state chairman of the Democratic 
 party; and with the growing report of Apostle Smoot's candidacy, I observed a gradual 
 cessation of political activity on the part of those prominent Democrats who were 
 close to the Church leaders.</p>
 <p align="left">Now, our party was not making war on the Church nor on any of 
 its proper missions in the world. Our candidates were capable and popular men against 
 whom no just ecclesiastical antagonism could be raised. We were asking no favors 
 from the Church. And we were determined to have no opposition from the Church without 
 a protest and an understanding.</p>
 <p align="left">For this reason-after consulting confidentially with the leaders 
 of our party-I undertook to make a personal visit to President Smith's office to 
 demand that the Church authorities should keep their hands out of politics. But 
 even while I discussed the matter with our party leaders, I was afraid that some 
 of them might betray our concerted purpose to Church headquarters. And my fear was 
 well grounded. When I went to the offices of the Presidency, the authorities-for 
 the first, last and only time-refused to see me; and the secretary betrayed a knowledge 
 of my mission by telling me that I should hear from some one of the hierarchy, later.</p>
 <p align="left">Two or three days afterward, Apostle M. F. Cowley came to me 
 with word that my call had been considered and that he had been deputed to talk 
 with me. We appointed a time for conference in my rooms at Democratic headquarters, 
 where we spent the large part of a day in consultation. And since the argument between 
 us covered the whole ground of Apostle Smoot's candidacy, I wish to give an account 
 of that interview, as a brief exposition of some of the present-day aspects of the 
 Church's interference in politics.</p>
 <p align="left">Apostle Cowley and I had been boyhood friends. He had been one 
 of the older students at the school that I had attended as a child; and I knew the 
 integrity and directness of his character. He was a stocky, strong man, with a wholesome 
 sort of face, brown with the sunburn of his missionary travels in Canada and in 
 Mexico. (He had been, in fact, solemnizing plural marriages in these polygamous 
 refuges-as we found out later.)</p>
 <p align="left">As soon as it was clearly understood between us that I represented 
 the Democratic state committee and he represented the Church authorities, I asked 
 for an explanation of Apostle Smoot's candidacy.</p>
 <p align="left">Cowley began by admitting the candidacy, which President Smith 
 had endorsed (he said) in spite of the opposition of some of the apostles. He argued 
 that Apostle Smoot was only exercising his right of American citizenship in aspiring 
 to the Senatorship; and he explained that the Church authorities did not see why 
 the Church should be drawn into the campaign.</p>
 <p align="left">But, as I pointed out to him, the Church had already drawn itself 
 in. It had held a solemn conclave of its hierarchy to authorize an apostle's candidacy. 
 The opponents of Church rule would circulate the fact; in any close campaign, the 
 apostle's friends would use the fact upon the faithful; and the Church would be 
 compelled to support its apostle in an assumed necessity of defending itself.</p>
 <p align="left">Perhaps I was objectionably forceful in my reply to him. With 
 his characteristic gentleness, he rebuked me by recalling that President Woodruff 
 had once taken him into "sacred places," assured him that "Frank Cannon, like David, 
 was a man after God's own heart," and asked him to "labor" for me in politics. If 
 it had been right for the Prophet of God to favor me, why was it not right for the 
 Prophet now to favor some one else?</p>
 <p align="left">My personal regard for Apostle Cowley kept me from showing the 
 amusement I felt at finding myself in this new scriptural role-remembering how President 
 Woodruff had once devoted me to destruction like another Isaac on the altar of Church 
 control. I replied to Cowley, as soberly as I could, that I had never consciously 
 received the aid of any Church influence; that I had always objected to its use, 
 either for or against either party; that I could oppose it now with free hands.</p>
 <p align="left">He retreated upon the favorite argument of the ecclesiasts: that 
 an apostle did not relinquish his citizenship because of his Church rank; that the 
 very political freedom which we demanded, to be effective, must apply to all men, 
 in or out of the Church. He asked naively: "What did we get statehood for-and amnesty-and 
 our political rights-if we're not to enjoy them?"</p>
 <p align="left">The answer to that was obvious: The Mormon Church is so constructed 
 that the apostle carries with him the power of the Church wherever he appears. The 
 whole people recognize in him the personified authority of the Church; and if an 
 apostle were allowed to make a political campaign without a denunciation from the 
 other Church authorities, it would be known that he had been selected for political 
 office by "the mouthpiece of the Almighty." I cited the case of Apostle Moses Thatcher 
 as proof that the Church <i>did</i> exercise power openly to negative an apostle's 
 ambition. If it failed now to rebuke Smoot, this very failure would be an affirmative 
 use of its power in his behalf; all Mormons who did not wish to raise their hands 
 against "the Lord's anointed," would have to support Smoot's legislative ticket, 
 regardless of their political convictions; and all Gentiles and independent Mormons 
 would have to fight the intrusion of the Church into open political activities.</p>
 <p align="left">Cowley replied that "the brethren"-meaning the hierarchy-believed 
 that a Mormon should have as many political rights, as a Catholic; and he asked 
 me if I would object to seeing a Catholic in the Senate.</p>
 <p align="left">Of course not. There are, and have been, many such. "But suppose," 
 I argued, "that the Pope were to select one of his Italian cardinals to come to 
 this country and be naturalized in some state of this Union that was under the sole 
 rule of the Roman Catholic Church; and suppose that-still holding his princedom 
 in the Catholic Church and exercising the plenary authority conferred on him by 
 the Pope-suppose he were to appear before the Senate in his robes of office, with 
 his credentials as a Senator from his Church-ruled state-all of this being a matter 
 of public knowledge-do you think the Senate would seat him? Certainly not. Yet the 
 cases are exactly analogous. We were but lately alien and proscribed. We were admitted 
 into the Union on a covenant that forbade Church interference in politics. It is 
 the whole teaching of the Church that a Prophet wears his prophetic authority constantly 
 as a robe of office. The case of Moses Thatcher is proof to the world that the Church 
 appoints and disappoints at its pleasure. I don't believe that Smoot, if elected, 
 will be allowed to hold his seat, and-if he is allowed to hold it-a greater trouble 
 than his exclusion will surely follow. For, with the princes of the Mormon Church 
 holding high place in the national councils-and using the power of the Church to 
 maintain themselves there-we are assuring for ourselves an indefinite future of 
 the most bitter controversy."</p>
 <p align="left">When Cowley had no more arguments to offer, he said: "Well, the 
 Prophet has spoken. That's enough for me. I submit cheerfully when the will of the 
 Lord comes to me through his appointed servants. The matter has been decided, and 
 it does not lie in your power-or anyone else's-to withstand the purposes of the 
 Almighty." He rose and put his hand on my shoulder, affectionately. "Your father 
 is gone, Frank. I loved him very dearly. I hope that you are not going to be found 
 warring against the Lord's anointed."</p>
 <p align="left">"Mat," I replied, "you have already pointed out that Apostle 
 Smoot appears in politics only as an American citizen. For the purposes of this 
 fight-and to avoid the consequences that you fear-I'll regard him as a politician 
 merely, and fight him as such."</p>
 <p align="left">"But, you know, Frank," he remonstrated, "he has been consecrated 
 to the apostleship, and I'm afraid that you'll overstep the bounds."</p>
 <p align="left">"Mat," I assured him, "I'll watch carefully, and unless he makes 
 his lightning changes too fast, I'll aim my shots only when he's in his political 
 clothes. If the change is too indefinite, blame yourselves and not us. The whole 
 teaching of the Church is that an apostle must be regarded as an apostle at all 
 times; but the whole teaching of politics is that all men should appear upon equal 
 terms-in this country. That's why we insist that no apostle should become a candidate 
 for public office."</p>
 <p align="left">Cowley took his departure with evident relief. He had discharged 
 his ambassadorial duty-and given me the warning which he had been authorized to 
 deliver-without a rupture of our personal friendship. And I saw him go, for my part, 
 in a sorrowful certainty that the Church had thrown off all disguise and proposed 
 to show the world, by the election of an apostle to the United States Senate, that 
 the "Kingdom of God" was established in Utah to rule in all the affairs of men. 
 I knew that if Smoot were excluded from the Senate, his exclusion would be argued 
 a proof that the wicked and unregenerate nation was still devilishly persecuting 
 God's anointed servants, to its own destruction; and, if he were permitted to take 
 his seat, that this fact would be cited to the faithful as proof that the Prophets 
 had been called to save the nation from the destruction that threatened it!</p>
 <p align="left">Of course, throughout the campaign that followed, the Church's 
 newspapers and many of its political workers kept protesting publicly that the election 
 of the Republican legislative ticket did not mean the election of Apostle Smoot 
 to the Senate. But by means of the authoritative whisper of ecclesiasts-carried 
 by visiting apostles to Presidents of Stakes, from them to the bishops, and from 
 the bishops to the presiding officers of subsidiary organizations-the inspired order 
 was given to the faithful that they must vote for the legislators who could be relied 
 upon to do the will of the Lord by voting for the Lord's anointed prophet, Apostle 
 Reed Smoot. This message was delivered to the sacred Sunday prayer circles. Even 
 Senator Rawlins' mother received it, from one of the ecclesiastical authorities 
 of her ward, who instructed her to vote against the election of her own son; and 
 it was "at the peril of her immortal soul" that she disobeyed the injunction. Long 
 before election day, every Mormon knew that he had been called upon by the Almighty 
 to sacrifice his individual conviction in politics to protect his "assailed Church."</p>
 <p align="left">The profound effectiveness of that appeal needs no further proof 
 than the issue of the election. King and Rawlins, the popular leaders of the Democracy 
 in a state that had but recently been overwhelmingly Democratic-after a campaign 
 in which they studiously avoided an attack upon the Church-were overwhelmingly defeated. 
 The Republican legislative ticket was carried. Apostle Smoot was elected to the 
 United States Senate; and on January 21, 1903, Governor Wells issued to him a certificate 
 of election.</p>
 <p align="left">Five days later, a number of prominent citizens signed a protest, 
 to President Roosevelt and the Senate, against allowing Apostle Smoot to take his 
 seat. And the grounds of the protest, briefly stated, were these: The Mormon priesthood 
 claimed supreme authority in politics, and such authority was exercised by the first 
 presidency and the twelve apostles, of whom Smoot was one. They had not only <i>
 not</i> abandoned the practice of political dictation, but they had not abandoned 
 the belief in polygamy and polygamous cohabitation; they connived at and encouraged 
 its practice, sought to pass laws that should nullify the statutes against the practice, 
 and protected and honored the violators of those statutes. And they had done all 
 these things despite the public sentiment of the civilized world, in violation of 
 the pledges given in procuring amnesty and in obtaining the return of the escheated 
 Church property, contrary to the promises given by the representatives of the Church 
 and of the territory in their plea for statehood, contrary to the Pledges required 
 by the Enabling Act and given in the State constitution, and contrary to the laws 
 of the State itself.</p>
 <p align="left">These charges were supported by innumerable citations from the 
 published doctrines of the Church, and from the published speeches and sermons of 
 the Prophets. Evidence was offered of the continuance of polygamous cohabitation 
 (since 1890) by President Smith, all but three or four of the apostles, the entire 
 Presidency of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and many others. New polygamy was specifically 
 charged against three apostles, and against the son of a fourth. A second protest, 
 signed by John L. Leilich, repeated these grounds of objection to Apostle Smoot, 
 and charged further that Apostle Smoot was himself a polygamist; but no attempt 
 was made to prove this latter charge.</p>
 <p align="left">Upon the filing of the protest, there was a storm of anger at 
 Church headquarters; and the ecclesiastical newspapers railed with the bitterness 
 of anxious apprehension. Throughout Utah it seemed to be the popular belief that 
 Apostle Smoot would be excluded-on the issue of whether a responsible representative 
 of a Church that was protecting and encouraging law-breaking should be allowed a 
 seat in the highest body of the nation's law-makers. But the issue against him was 
 not to be heard until twelve months after his election, and every agent and influence 
 of the Church was set to work at once to nullify the effect of the protest.</p>
 <p align="left">Every financial institution, East or West, to which the Church 
 could appeal, was solicited to demand a favorable hearing of the Smoot case from 
 the Senators of its state. Every political and business interest that could be reached 
 was moved to protect the threatened Apostle. The sugar trust magnates and their 
 Senators were enlisted. The mercantile correspondents of the Church were urged to 
 write letters to their Congressmen and to their Senators, and to use their power 
 at home to check the anti-Mormon newspapers. The Utah representative of a powerful 
 mercantile institution, that had vital business relations with the Church, confessed 
 to me that he had been called East to consult with the head of his company, who 
 had been asked to use his influence for Smoot. "I could not advise our president," 
 he said, "to send the letter that was demanded of him. And yet I couldn't take the 
 responsibility of injuring the company by advising him to refuse the Church request. 
 You know, if we had refused it, point-blank, they would have destroyed every interest 
 we had within the domain of their power. I should have been ruined financially. 
 All our stockholders would have suffered. They would never have forgiven me."</p>
 <p align="left">The president of the company failed to send the letter. His failure 
 became known, through Church espionage and the report of the Church's friends in 
 the Senate. Pressure was brought to bear upon him; and, with the aid of his Utah 
 representative, he compromised on a letter that did partial violence to his conscience 
 and partially endangered his business relations with the Church.</p>
 <p align="left">Both these men were aware that the Church had broken its covenants 
 to the country, and that Apostle Smoot could not be either a loyal citizen of the 
 nation or a free representative of the people of his state. "I did not like the 
 compromise we made," my friend told me. "I feel humiliated whenever I think of it. 
 But I tried to do the best I could under the circumstances."</p>
 <p align="left">The results of this pressure of political and business interests 
 upon Washington showed gradually in the tone of the political newspapers throughout 
 the whole country. It showed in the growing confidence expressed by the organs of 
 the Church authorities in Utah. It showed in the cheerful predictions of the Prophets 
 that the Lord would overrule in Apostle Smoot's behalf. It showed in Smoot's exercise 
 of an autocratic leadership in the political affairs of the State.</p>
 <p align="left">He was allowed to take his oath of office as Senator on March 
 5, 1903; the protests against him were referred to the Senate Committee on Privileges 
 and Elections for a hearing (January 27, 1904); and a contest began that lasted 
 from January, 1904, to February, 1907. During those years was completed the business 
 and political conspiracy between financial "privilege" and religious absolutism, 
 of which conspiracy this narrative has described the beginning and the growth.</p>
 <p align="left">It is almost impossible to expose the progression of incident 
 by which the end of that conspiracy was approached-since it was necessarily approached 
 in the darkest secrecy. But several indications of the method and the progress
 <i>did</i> show, here and there, on the surface of events; and these indications 
 are powerfully significant.</p>
 <p align="left">As early as 1901 it had become known that Apostle Smoot was negotiating 
 a sale, to the sugar trust, of the Church's sugar holdings. On May 13, 1902, the 
 president of the trust reported to the trust's executive committee[<a name="text1" href="#foot">1</a>] 
 that he had agreed to buy a one-half interest in the consolidation of the Mormon 
 factories of La Grande, Logan and Ogden. (The following day, May 14, 1902, is given 
 by Apostle Smoot as the day on which he obtained President Joseph F. Smith's permission 
 to become a candidate for the Senatorship.) On June 24, 1902 the sugar trust's executive 
 committee was informed of the trust's purchase of one-half of the capital stock 
 of these three Church-owned sugar companies. On July 5, 1902 the three companies 
 were consolidated under the name of the Amalgamated Sugar Company, with David Eccles, 
 polygamist, trustee of Church bonds, and protégé" of Joseph F. Smith, as President; 
 and the sugar trust took half the stock, in exchange for its holdings in the three 
 original companies.</p>
 <p align="left">Similarly, in this same year, the old Church-owned Utah Sugar 
 Company increased its stock in order to buy the Garland sugar factory, and the sugar 
 trust, it is understood, was concerned in the purchase In 1903, 1904 and 1905, the 
 Idaho Sugar Company, the Freemont Sugar Company, and West Idaho Sugar Company were 
 incorporated; and in 1906 all these companies were amalgamated in the present Utah-Idaho 
 Sugar Company, of which Joseph F. Smith is president, T. R. Cutler, a Mormon, is 
 vice-president, Horace G. Whitney, the general manager of the Church's <i>Deseret 
 News</i>, is secretary and treasurer, and other Church officials are directors. 
 Of the stock of this company the sugar trust holds fifty-one per cent. So that between 
 1902 and 1906 a partnership in the manufacture of beet sugar was effected between 
 the Church and the trust; and Apostle Smoot became a Sugar trust Senator, and argued 
 and voted as such.</p>
 <p align="left">Furthermore, it was at this same period that the Church sold 
 the street railway of Salt Lake City and its electric power company to the "Harriman 
 interests" under peculiar circumstances-a matter of which I have written in an earlier 
 chapter. The Church owners of this Utah Light and Railway Company, through the Church's 
 control of the City Council, had attempted to obtain a hundred-year franchise from 
 the city on terms that were outrageously unjust to the citizens; and finally, on 
 June 5, 1905, a franchise was obtained for fifty years, for the company of which 
 Joseph F. Smith was the president. On August 3, 1905, another city ordinance was 
 passed, consolidating all former franchises, then held by the Utah Light and Power 
 Company, but originally granted to D. F. Walker, the Salt Lake and Ogden Gas and 
 Electric Light Company, the Pioneer Power Company and the Utah Power Company; and 
 this ordinance extended the franchises to July 1, 1955. The properties were bonded 
 for $6,300,000, but it was understood that they were worth not more than $4,000,000. 
 They were sold to "the Harriman interests" for $10,000,000. The equipment of the 
 Salt Lake City street railway was worse than valueless, and the new company had 
 to remove the rails and discard the rolling stock. But the ten millions were well 
 invested in this public-utility trust, for the company had a monopoly of the street 
 railway service and electric power and gas supply of Salt Lake City; and its franchises 
 left it free to extort whatever it could from the people of the whole country side, 
 by virtue of a partnership with the Church authorities whereby extortion was given 
 the protection of "God's anointed Prophets."</p>
 <p align="left">Joseph F. Smith, of course, was already a director of Harriman's 
 Union Pacific Railroad, a position to which he had been elected after his accession 
 to the First Presidency. And he was so elected not because of his railroad holdings-for 
 he came to the Presidency a poor man-and not because of his ability or experience 
 as a financier or a railroad builder, for he had not had any such experience and 
 he had not shown any such ability. He was elected because of the partnership between 
 the Church leaders and the Union Pacific Railroad-a partnership that was doubtlessly 
 used in defence of Apostle Smoot's seat in the Senate, just as the power of the 
 Sugar Trust was used and the influence of the whole financial confederation in politics.</p>
