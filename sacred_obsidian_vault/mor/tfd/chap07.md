 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER VII</h1>
 <h1 align="center">A LONG RIDE THROUGH UTAH VALLEY</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"It were a journey like the path to Heaven,<br>
     To help you find them."</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Milton</i></p>
 <p>IT was the midsummer of 1876, when I was invited to take a long distance drive 
 through these Mormon settlements, with a missionary.<br>
 <br>
 He was not a Mormon missionary, however, but a representative of an orthodox Protestant 
 denomination; several such religious bodies were seeking a foothold for school and 
 church in this territory.<br>
 <br>
 In a certain sense we were doing scout duty for a Mission Board in New York City. 
 As Moses of old sent spies into the land on the other side of Jordan of Scripture, 
 so this Board sent its representatives to spy out this Promised Land, not from Dan 
 to Beersheba, but from Ogden to Mount Pleasant.<br>
 <br>
 We were almost boys in spirit, and not far removed in years, so this task appealed 
 to us as a sort of adventure mixed with duty imposed.<br>
 <br>
 We did not go afoot but drove a one-horse wagonette having for its load two dozen 
 school desks and seats for an incipient academy of elementary grade. The hope for 
 the educational up-lift of a miseducated Utah.<br>
 <br>
 This to some, in these now liberal days, may seem a bigoted endeavor and a youthful 
 assumption of a capacity to instruct others; but it, nevertheless, was the outcome 
 of the wise and weighty council of older men who accepted our offer as adventurers 
 in this Pioneer Mission in San Pete Valley.<br>
 <br>
 It was not then given us to see the long, hard grind of work and duty to establish 
 this educational plant, so we went cheerfully south, like sailors shipping for a 
 distant port.<br>
 <br>
 The pull for one lone horse, of these seats for future scholars, to say nothing 
 of a box of heavy books, was unfair when we came to see the sand-ridges in our way 
 on the roads over the valley divides. It was get out and push behind while the horse 
 panted in front.<br>
 <br>
 If we had been better horse-jockeys, we would have insisted on a team when we left 
 the city; but our commercial and theoretical well-wishers and providers, in their 
 scholarly incapacity as mountain travellers, insisted that one horse was ample.<br>
 <br>
 Well, we crawled along, and whiled away the time with some healthy and also some 
 unhealthy discussions of religious questions in comparative theology. We were like 
 most of the young men, quick to discuss deep problems, and rushed in with our logic 
 on subjects where "Angels feared to tread."<br>
 <br>
 Both warmed in body from our cart-pushings, and in mind from our arguments, we passed 
 the heat of the day and the divide of land, so that at the sunset we saw no longer 
 the Salt Lake to the north, but the sea of fresh water to the south; Lake Utah colored 
 by the last rays of light.<br>
 <br>
 My companion was a Mac, one of the numerous Macs, whose forebears came from Scotland, 
 and he lived up to his clan as "Varra creetical" in discussions. Now it is very 
 hard to overcome a Scot in argument and so I had the worst of it just then. My companion 
 wore a thin smile of victory and conceit at his superior intellectual prowess, more 
 especially as he prided himself on the possession, not only of a B.A. and B.D., 
 but an M.A. degree, whereas I had not quite finished college life when I had to 
 mix with the world.<br>
 <br>
 But I had rubbed edges with that world; had been tutored by city stock-brokers and 
 had been<br>
 <br>
 a photographer, when a man had to be not only an artist but a chemist, to ply his 
 trade; all this before I received my teaching degree. So I had my companion when 
 it came to business things, and pushed him hard to the wall over this "scrub horse" 
 that he had been tricked into by a trader; and the awful load that his ignorance 
 of teaming had put into the wagonette for so long a drive.<br>
 <br>
 Crossing a creek about twelve miles on our way, the strain was too much for the 
 harness and "crack" went one of the tugs.<br>
 <br>
 Here I gave my chum a little verbal rub on the unwisdom of cheap harnesses. I rubbed 
 it farther in during the hour we spent in mending the leather with old rope; as 
 I informed him that no Western man ever travelled far without a coil of buckskin 
 to meet such disasters as had overtaken us. He learned a great deal about the sorrows 
 of a tenderfoot before he was through with the trip, and his harness, often repaired, 
 resembled some of those rare bargains offered to the green-hand in junk stores.<br>
 <br>
 The point of the mountain, seen all day from our Salt Lake City start, ended our 
 up-grade pull, and now down-grade we went to our first stopping place. We were high 
 enough to overlook the Jordan river, flowing well within its banks; for this Utah 
 Jordan never overflows them to swell its waters like its Palestinian brother-river. 
 We could see the haze over the Great Lake north, and the forming film of vapor over 
 the smaller lake south of us, where Lehi and American Fork, two Mormon settlements, 
 showed up their dry streets and the green fields adjacent.<br>
 <br>
 "Well, Mac! do we camp when we reach the borders of that lake?" I asked, fully supposing 
 that he wanted to do the correct thing and sleep under the sky.<br>
 <br>
 "We'll not need to camp. We will make Lehi soon, and there's a chance for a room 
 for us, and a corral for the horse."<br>
 <br>
 "Any hotels in these towns?" I asked, for he had been this way before by road.<br>
 <br>
 "None: but I know a Mormon family. The elder will take in travellers, if he likes 
 their looks, and they don't catch him too much unawares." We carried a camp outfit, 
 but did not wish to trench on our supplies, if possible, so early in the journey. 
 The tired horse, that had done wonders from any point of view, but was dubbed a 
 lazy brute by Mac, pulled us slowly into the distant town, and along its adobe-lined 
 streets.<br>
 <br>
 "That is a long-drawn-out one?" I said, pointing to a low-built house of sun-dried 
 brick, "five doors and five windows all in a line."<br>
 <br>
 "Yes," said Mac, "that is an indication of plural marriage. Each door and window 
 is in a separate section. The patriarch, who lives there, has five wives."<br>
 <br>
 At last we stopped before a house. Our tired horse sighed as though his heart would 
 break with relief. But we were to face disappointment.<br>
 <br>
 "No room for travellers this night," said the elder when Mac accosted him. I saw 
 by the man's eye that he disapproved of us and our errand, although he looked with 
 pity on our tired horse. He pointed south.<br>
 <br>
 "You can make American Fork in three miles."<br>
 <br>
 It happened that we entered this new town in the right place for us. A rather larger 
 adobe than usual, was lighted up and the owner agreed to shelter us for the night 
 by our paying a good stiff fee.<br>
 <br>
 I gave the horse a good feed and rubbed him down before I went in to wash and eat.<br>
 <br>
 Our host was a hearty old man, and one of the early converts from Wales. He had 
 prospered in lands and goods, and was loud in his praise of this practical religion. 
 I cannot say much for his table manner; for he ate with dirty hands, and used them 
 twice to break up lumps of sugar in the bowl. The table-ware was primitive, indeed, 
 but the cloth was clean and the meal well cooked by his energetic daughter.<br>
 <br>
 "Sugar was a very scarce article in my early days here, and I don't like to see 
 it wasted."<br>
 <br>
 He was a widower, but no polygamist. He was a sample of the earnest, but ignorant 
 peasant class of the old world who had greatly improved their material welfare by 
 this change of country and faith.<br>
 <br>
 Mac met a horse trader at the table, and I was highly entertained by their efforts 
 to make a swap. The trader's animal was a little worse blown than Mac's, but after 
 all he was not the easy mark that he was supposed to be, and he kept his horse.<br>
 <br>
 We pulled out the next morning somewhat refreshed but hauling the same full load. 
 We passed over dry creeks, sand ridges, and through the town of Battle Creek; the 
 site of an early fight; through Provo, the county seat, to Spring-ville, the most 
 progressive of all these valley settlements.<br>
 <br>
 A knife-edged lofty ridge, Mount Aspinwall, overlooked us all the way on the east, 
 while the lake glittered in the sun, six miles distant on the west. Down the canyons 
 of this range at times the winds swept with sudden blasts, and crossing the lake, 
 churned its waters into a fury. The breezes were refreshing since they blew across 
 the road and not along it. We saw many pretty spots of green, such as fields of 
 wheat, nearly ripe, alfalfa patches of emerald hue and thrifty peach and prune orchards. 
 We carried off, from one farm a bale of alfalfa, and a generous sample of early 
 fruit.<br>
 <br>
 Just one year later, I rode through this region on a long horseback journey, and 
 all the green was gone although it was yet early summer. The locusts were in the 
 land. They had come in such clouds as to darken the day, and with such hearty appetites 
 that even the bark on the orchard trees was consumed before they left. Their hatching 
 ground was in mountainous Idaho, on the north, and periodically they passed out, 
 leaving destruction in their track. Even a piece of green-straw matting hung on 
 a fence to air and dry, went down their ready throats.<br>
 <br>
 While in Springville, we prospected for a site in the interests of a liberal school. 
 We had been invited to do so by some of the local men of influence. There was a 
 desire for something new in this progressive town at that time, and it bore fruit 
 three years later in a well built brick edifice for school and mission work. It 
 was later known as the Hungerford Academy, under the auspices of the Presbyterian 
 Mission Board. It was put in charge of George Washington Leonard, an ex-staff officer 
 of the Union Army.<br>
 <br>
 Of course we conferred with the so-called liberal element. In most of these settlements 
 there were to be found a number of disaffected people. Some were so because they 
 had been treated domineeringly by the church authorities, who ruled the civic as 
 well as the religious interests of these valley towns; others because they had changed 
 their views, with their increase of knowledge of the world at large, due to their 
 contact with the new and non-Mormon elements filtering in to the population of the 
 territory; still others because of business interests which carried them outside 
 of the commerce of the co-operative stores to deal with mining men and mining machinery.<br>
 <br>
 In the old hortatory days, when the Mormon preachers painted every gentile with 
 a coat of black, they gave a false idea of the outside world, which these business 
 men now found to be untrue, for the gentile was not as black as he had been painted.<br>
 <br>
 A natural reaction set in, and a friendliness for the new-comers sprang up, and 
 we found a few men, but no women, who desired an established opposition to the dominant 
 church; in order to check its power and to give a spice of life in the business 
 world in place of the old-time autonomy and monotony.<br>
