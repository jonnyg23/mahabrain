 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIII</h1>
 <h1 align="center">THE MIXED MULTITUDE</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"The Many-headed Multitude."</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Shakespeare</i></p>
 <p>IT was to avoid the so-called mixed multitude that the Latter Day Saints sought 
 an isolation for themselves, and their posterity from the every-day world.<br>
 <br>
 In this they were the followers of the ancient people of Israel, when they left 
 the flesh-pots of Egypt, by a most memorable desert march, and sought the promised 
 land. Canaan was, indeed, such a land. Flowing with milk and honey-supplied with 
 cattle and bees-it was a land of olive orchards and vineyards, watered by the early 
 and later rains, and well fitted to be a sample to these modern wanderers, in their 
 search for a desired habitation.<br>
 <br>
 I have shown how they found their heart's desire in the secluded mountain valleys 
 of Utah, how also they sought to keep off intrusion, and to protect themselves from 
 schism and apostasy. I have shown the logical outgrowth of their creed. It was pride 
 in their peculiar customs and confidence in their religion, which nerved them for 
 all this strenuous endeavor through forty years of patient, persevering, and conquering 
 industry.<br>
 <br>
 Now they deserve their meed of praise for this activity of mind and body, for changing 
 a waste into a garden, and in place of Indian tribes, peopling the land with a civilized 
 population. They have done a good turn for the United States, for while their religious 
 policies have made them often disloyal and antagonistic to Federal Law; they have 
 opened to commerce an immensely rich region of soil and minerals, which would have 
 remained quiescent for fifty years longer.<br>
 <br>
 I have tried to be fair and just to these people, and while noting their errors 
 of reason and action, I have also noted their good intentions and their hardihood, 
 in all their history, as far as I have had occasion to touch upon it.<br>
 <br>
 For long years none but the wandering, curious hunters and trappers travelled these 
 Utah valleys, save the Indian tribes native to the region. The Mormon Church had 
 no fear of friction with such elements.<br>
 <br>
 It was the "mixed multitude" they feared, and for as long as possible they kept 
 it at a distance.<br>
 <br>
 At last there filtered out of these mountains, carried by Dame Rumor, stories of 
 mineral wealth, of gold and silver deposits in the hills; stories like those coming 
 from California in the '50's, which set on fire such a tremendous enthusiasm for 
 the Pacific Slope.<br>
 <br>
 Men stubbing their toes in climbing the foothills after straying stock, had cast 
 up nuggets from the very "grass roots." Others, bending over purling streams to 
 quench their desert thirst, had found "color" in their drinking cups. They had stooped 
 over to wash their clothes in mountain creeks and remained to wash for gold in the 
 same vessels in which they rinsed their dirty garments.<br>
 <br>
 Of course the usual exaggeration of these acts gave a sort of <i>Arabian Nights
 </i>version to these things, and they came to the eastern world with all the charm 
 of an Aladdin's Lamp. Then the multitude stirred, and woke up. It cast covetous 
 eyes toward the hills which hid the Mormon people from the world. Wealthy men "grubstaked" 
 hard up adventurers, and sent them out as spies of wealth. They came, saw, and reported 
 that "the half had not been told."<br>
 <br>
 This started a rush of capital and labor, through the canyons by wagon road, and 
 afterwards by the Union Pacific Railroad. Miners, laborers, gamblers, storekeepers, 
 cowboys, foreigners, Jews and Gentiles, one and all hastened into these mountain 
 solitudes which existed through the policy of the Mormon Church untouched by the 
 hand of Commerce.<br>
 <br>
 Men of wealth, as usual, engineered the mass. The era of the millionaire was at 
 hand, but these millions that came were from abroad at first, for the United States 
 was still over taxed, and staggering commercially from the effect of four years 
 of war. British, French, and Italian money was flung recklessly into the hills, 
 to be sunk in ambitious mining camps, and stamp mills, under the superintendence 
 of men who had no interest in the capital but their salary.<br>
 <br>
 You can imagine the change from the quiet, pastoral, and religious color of the 
 past days to the hurry, hustle, and vociferous business of a new frontier life.<br>
 <br>
 The Jew came in, as he always does, on the crest of this wave of commerce. He seems 
 built for trade, and being both a genius at opening trade centers, and a daring 
 commercial gambler, he was in Salt Lake City, and in every new camp of this "mixed 
 multitude" with his wares and ways. He was too shrewd to enter purely Mormon towns 
 and so confront the great "Co-op." He wasted no time on such ventures, but industriously 
 sold his goods at three hundred percent profit to the reckless crowd, whose taste 
 for gold was ready to pay any price for tools, goods, and food.<br>
 <br>
 One son of Israel, I knew, a good kind fellow he was too, who came into this business 
 boiling pot, with just a pack, and before I left the Territory, he was living in 
 a palace in the city of the Saints. From "Pack to Palace," in five years, was "goin' 
 some," as the miners say.<br>
 <br>
 Now everybody could not do that, but everybody thought he could. So you see the 
 vim introduced by the "mixed multitude," and the utter impossibility of stemming 
 such a tide. The Mormon authorities simply gasped at the crowd, made one futile 
 effort to offset it with defunct laws of the defunct state of Deseret. But they 
 gave it up, and grimly accepted the influx of new people, with their new ideas.<br>
 <br>
 At first this new tide of human life and industry ran along by itself, very much 
 as the muddy Missouri does where its waters first enter the clearer stream of the 
 Mississippi. But you know the universal rule. A little mud can cloud a whole body 
 of water, and while the Missouri loses itself in the waters of the greater river, 
 yet it is the hue of the Missouri that gives color to the Mississippi at New Orleans.<br>
 <br>
 So with the "mixed multitude" and the Mormons. Soon these newcomers inoculated the 
 Territory with their more modern notions of life, and the two adverse streams, religious 
 fanaticism on the one hand, and the commercial greed for gold on the other, ran 
 a race side by side for a decade; and then intermingled as one life in camp, civic 
 centers, and throughout the countryside; and thus the isolation of the Latter Day 
 Saint was over.<br>
 <br>
 So Utah, when I first saw it in 1875, was undergoing this change. The Missouri current 
 of the "mixed multitude" was giving quite a decided color to the Mormonism of the 
 past.<br>
 <br>
 I saw a few signs of the old heroic days, but wherever I went the stamp of the coming 
 age was evident, in the looser, freer speech, the less respect, if not ridicule, 
 given religion, and the atmosphere of hard materialism common to the American frontier 
 life.<br>
 <br>
 The watchword in these regions, for a long time, had been "Duty;" now it was to 
 be "Dollars." Loss and gain set over against one another, as in most of the circles 
 of this riddle we call life.<br>
 <br>
 The old settler, with his strong faith, gazed sourly at this condition of things, 
 and as sourly proclaimed the coming wrath of God; but the newcomer of the "mixed 
 multitude" smoked his black cigar, stuck in the corner of his mouth, and answered 
 with a grin of derision, and a drive of energy, that made the new order hum with 
 the engines of machinery.<br>
 <br>
 Bingham Canyon sprang into life. It was a great gash in the Oquirreh Mountains, 
 facing the salt sea on the one side, and the Utah Valley on the other. It was a 
 mineral fissure that drew the crowd of "those who knew." It was not a high grade 
 camp, as those days valued mining camps, where no ore was worked that did not yield 
 forty dollars to the ton; but it was a big camp, in that there was no end to the 
 veins, and the pockets that were beneath its apparent sterile surface.<br>
 <br>
 It was small then, with a population of four thousand people, when I first put foot 
 in the camp one cold November day. It is now a mining city that issues every year 
 many millions in dividends to its lucky stockholders.<br>
 <br>
 Alta City, in the Little Cottonwood Canyon, on the opposite side of the valley, 
 in the Wah-satch range, and still higher up in the air than Bingham, with its altitude 
 of ten thousand feet, was a richer camp, and the site of the celebrated Emma mine. 
 This mine was sold for three million dollars to British capitalists, but was found 
 afterwards to be a fraud, it having been "salted" with "color" by the promoters 
 to deceive the purchasers.<br>
 <br>
 An amphitheater of hills, gave Alta City a notable site. Dumps and tunnel exits 
 could be seen all around, and out of this circle of industry, wealth poured and 
 was carried down to market by a miniature railway, with an average grade of three 
 hundred feet to the mile.<br>
 <br>
 Nothing was withheld in the lavish outlay of foreign money, that was making this 
 a lively camp. While it is true many became rich, it is equally true that great 
 hosts were made poor. This is about the outcome of all mining and fulfills the words 
 of Mark Twain, who was himself an old -miner as well as an author-"As much goes 
 into the hole as comes out of it."<br>
 <br>
 Park City was another outcome of this mining fever. Situated in Big Cottonwood Canyon, 
 and nearer Salt Lake City, it was conducted by a set of level-headed men who prevented 
 any collapse to the camp, as finally overtook Alta City. The result was that while 
 no furor was made over its location, yet it always produced stable wealth. Here 
 it was that George Hearst, then a miner of experience in California, bought out 
 a claim from a few discouraged tenderfoot adventurers. They had come within a few 
 feet of great wealth, when they threw down their picks and said, "we quit." George 
 Hearst began the next day, and a few hours later was confronted with a vision of 
 future wealth.<br>
 <br>
 He began his spectacular career, as a son of fortune, at this time, and began building 
 up his remarkable success at the spot where others, more faint hearted than he, 
 gave up the fight.<br>
 <br>
 Out of this mine came the means by which he became Senator of the United States, 
 as no man at that time could become a Senator unless he had a long, a very long 
 pocket book. The state university at Berkeley, California, and all the interests 
 of the Hearst's Syndicate of American Newspapers, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, 
 are under obligation to this mine in the Big Cottonwood Canyon.<br>
 <br>
 Of course there were flat failures in some of the camps. One such was at Tintic, 
 where, at first, great surface showings drew the rush, but it was a case of "pinch 
 out" for the camp, as it so often is with a promising vein of ore in a shaft, or 
 a tunnel. It ends in a pocket, and a pocket holds just so much, and no more. So 
 Tintic, as a camp, lies idle, dormant, dead.<br>
