 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER VIII</h1>
 <h1 align="center">THROUGH SPANISH FORK CANYON AND THISTLE VALLEY</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"Now let us sing, Long live the King,<br>
     And Gilpin, long live he; <br>
 And when he next doth ride abroad,<br>
     May I be there to see!"</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Cowper</i></p>
 <p>NEXT day we pushed our slow way up Spanish Fork Canyon. Some faint tradition 
 of the early Spaniards, the conquistadores of the days of Iberian rule, having reached 
 as far north as this section, riveted the name upon this great gap in the mountains.<br>
 <br>
 There is no doubt those hardy men almost demons in a way did dare the extreme both 
 in perils and distance. Some of them may have gazed with their fierce eyes set in 
 bearded bronzed faces upon these very hills and vales.<br>
 <br>
 They were too far afield for them to put more than the stamp of their name on this 
 region, so when the Mormons came, the Redmen, the Piutes and the Utes, were the 
 sole possessors of the soil. It was an up-hill and rocky road with the heat of mid-day 
 reflecting from the granite rocks lining the canyon sides and producing much perspiration, 
 both for drivers and their steed.<br>
 <br>
 Yet the evening drawing nigh, the characteristic wind-blast down this rocky tube 
 chilled us to the bone, a quick change from the noon's torrid heat. "I know of a 
 good spring hereabouts," said Mac, "one of my liberal friends of Mount Pleasant 
 comes this way at times, and always camps by it; and he told me to be sure to sample 
 its waters."<br>
 <br>
 This was refreshing news to me, for our last drink had been from a muddied and shallow 
 irrigation ditch. Round point after point, we slowly toiled, still ascending and 
 looking for this spring that never appeared. It was about two hours later that we 
 caught the odor of rotten eggs, and knew that our spring was a sulphur and therapeutic 
 one. Our liberal friend had his joke on Mac, when the latter stood at this actively 
 boiling spring, with no desire to drink.<br>
 <br>
 Yet at this writing a costly sanitarium occupies the ground, people come from afar 
 to spend both time and money for their health at this evil-smelling spring. Pure 
 water is a prize when difficult to obtain, and at that particular moment having 
 no foresight of the future business value of this sulphur spring, we would have 
 exchanged it for a few gallons of the cold article.<br>
 <br>
 We pushed on with dry tongues, and toward evening we entered Thistle Valley, now 
 alive with the coal industry and the overland railroad, but then a wild, remote, 
 upland plain.<br>
 <br>
 Here we found water in a little rill oozing out of the rocks, clear and cold as 
 a Kentucky spring.<br>
 <br>
 "Why not camp out here? Plenty of wood around for a fire. It will be dark soon!"<br>
 <br>
 "No. Not here. Let us push on," said Mac. "I know a valley rancher at no great distance. 
 He is what is called a 'Jack' Mormon and favors our work for the liberals."<br>
 <br>
 I grumbled, for I had no great liking for Mac's "little" distances, as I remembered 
 that his eye was lacking in accuracy when it came to his remembering mileage by 
 the road.<br>
 <br>
 On again we went making a long day of it. I expected the poor horse to strike, not 
 for pay, but for shorter hours; but the good animal had more grit than his appearance 
 suggested. The miles were Irish ones, if not Russian, such as make the Siberian 
 Versts such a weary terror to the traveller. We passed curve after curve in the 
 road; crossed land-draws without number, expecting<br>
 <br>
 every moment to sight the rancher's roof. It realized a modern war-song:<br>
 <br>
 "It's a long, long way to Tipperary, It's a long way to go."<br>
 <br>
 It began to look as though Mac had been sold again as to this ranch house; as he 
 had been with reference to the sulphur spring which he had been urged to sample.<br>
 <br>
 We broke another tug, just by way of diversion and use of a little more time which 
 we could not spare. I used the old rope again and, of course, being tired I had 
 to say something about buckskin, as an essential part of an "experienced" traveller's 
 outfit, the same being lacking with us.<br>
 <br>
 The moon rose. Her silvery face shone above the hills before us and made the uneven 
 road visible, but the chaparral on either hand looked all the blacker. My imagination 
 began to work concerning the Indians, who were off the reservation, trailing us 
 in these dark places; or those white bandits, of worse blood, who often waylaid 
 travellers at such an uphill disadvantage as was ours.<br>
 <br>
 We were nervously silent, but if a bear had crashed through the brush, a coyote 
 had yowled, or an owl had hooted, we might have shouted from fright, expectant of 
 an attack from Indians or bandits.<br>
 <br>
 Just then a dog barked with a homelike sound, and before long we saw the outline 
 of a corral fence lining the road; then a house loomed up all in the dark.<br>
 <br>
 We drew up at the bars across the road and holloed. The tired rancher, waked out 
 of his first sleep, came down to us in no gracious mood; but who could blame him 
 at that midnight hour?<br>
 <br>
 We were the victims of Mac's defective judgment of road distances. He had come this 
 way once before with a fast road-team downgrade, and had expected as rapid return 
 upgrade with one horse and a heavy load.<br>
 <br>
 We squared this late call with our "Jack" Mormon host in the way which is usually 
 acceptable to midnight landlords. We fed our horse and bedded him with straw, and 
 then climbed to an empty loft under the house roof, pillowing our weary heads on 
 hay.<br>
 <br>
 This Thistle Valley is known for its rich soil. The greasewood grows high and strongly, 
 a sure evidence of the depth of earth. It was sparsely settled in that day. At one 
 end there was an Indian Reserve: a section of the great Uintah Reservation for the 
 Piute nation.<br>
 <br>
 We met a crowd of Indian horsemen the next morning. They were wild and saucy, mocking 
 us and our outfit and racing around, whooping just to scare our horse by their antics; 
 but it was wasted effort. They did not know that our horse was a sedate Presbyterian 
 charger, whose charging days were long past. Our beast just looked at them in surprise, 
 and plodded on.<br>
 <br>
 We grinned at these red-painted horsemen and cried "How!" in return to their "How!", 
 and so passed on.<br>
 <br>
 It was right here that an emigrant tragedy occurred some twenty years earlier. The 
 foothills slope often into the valley with a long finger of lower hills that finally 
 sink to the level of the valley road. Behind this projection, a war party of these 
 same Piutes or Utes lay in ambush for the overlanders to California.<br>
 <br>
 Two wagons, the prairie schooner kind, with covers like an ark, and loaded to the 
 guards with everything for the household, came crawling along this upgrade. Too 
 independent to travel with the majority, they had struck out by this shorter way 
 to reach California by the road via Saint George and Arizona; thus avoiding the 
 awful Nevada deserts.<br>
 <br>
 Unsuspecting and unprepared they here were attacked by the Indians, who made a dash 
 from behind a low hill abutting the road. It ended in the usual way. After a sharp 
 and gallant fight the strong white men fell, and all were slain, even to the babies. 
 Blood and scalps and burning wagons, yelling Indians and dying men made the spot 
 memorable.<br>
 <br>
 We looked at the scene and could almost see it enacted again; one of many such bloody 
 halts to the stream of gold seekers, where a family passed out of knowledge, and 
 left but a rumor to satisfy the anxiety and long waiting of friends left behind.<br>
 <br>
 At last Thistle Valley opened into a larger one, the San Pete Valley, and from our 
 high ground we could see, by the dark patches along the valley's sides, the sites 
 of the various settlements in this remote region populated by Scandinavian converts 
 to Mormonism.<br>
 <br>
 The telephone, the rural delivery, the automobile of this favored day have brought 
 all this section into the hustle of the world, since that quiet day when I first 
 looked upon this broad expanse of fertile land. The mountains, then so silent, now 
 glow with the electric lights of great mining centers. The richest coal is found, 
 and feeds the mountain freight engines of the railroad which, as the agent of modern 
 commerce, has invaded and captured this region of riches.<br>
 <br>
 Our good old horse, and I was really getting proud of his grit despite his disreputable 
 looks, brought us late in the day to the Liberal Hall fronting the Main street of 
 Mount Pleasant, a town of three thousand inhabitants.<br>
 <br>
 Here were the headquarters of the liberal element of the valley, and this also was 
 our destination. In this Hall was the school, in embryo, for which the seats had 
 been brought from afar so toilsomely. I laughed when they had been arranged in the 
 lecture room of the Hall, to see one after another, the men, Liberals and Mormons, 
 sit in them to test their strength. They did it so boyishly and with much evident 
 interest. These seats were then up-to-date, but by this time they are antiquated, 
 and broken up for fuel.<br>
