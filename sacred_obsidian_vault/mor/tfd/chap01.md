 <h1 align="center">IN TERRITORIAL UTAH CHAPTER I</h1>
 <h1 align="center">GOING WEST IN 1874</h1>
 <p>I WAS one of the multitude of young men who heeded Horace Greeley's advice, "Go 
 West, young man, go West!" in the days when he was the ruling spirit of the New 
 York Tribune. Discredited as a prospective president by the people at the polls, 
 he yet was accepted by many as a prophet of agricultural authority on the "Opportunity 
 of the Great West."<br>
 <br>
 To me, from boyhood, the word "Mississippi" had a winsome charm. I had read of De 
 Soto and the Jesuit Fathers as the first voyagers on the great river of the West, 
 of the Lewis and Clark explorations by the pen of Washington Irving in his Astoria: 
 and to go West, was my one aim as conditions were ripe for it. The great lakes to 
 the North and the cane-brakes to the South were not in it with the West as a drawing 
 card to me. I left the charmed scenery of central New York state in the early spring 
 of '74 headed for the wonderful Porkopolis of Chicago. That city was just beginning 
 to rise from the ashes of the terrible fire of '71 when I first set foot in it. 
 Wide areas resembling San Francisco in 1906 were black with the fire's work, and 
 temporary board structures even at the depots were in common evidence. But there 
 was the tang and the vim of the West in the faces of its hustling population that 
 foretold the vigorous growth of after years. Crossing Ohio, I passed through the 
 famous Western Reserve, supposed to be, in its day, the real West. When I saw the 
 orderly neatness of farm, road, and townsite, I smiled at the invitation of an old 
 college chum of the previous year; "When you are in the West be sure to call on 
 me in the Western Reserve. I live at Youngstown, Ohio."<br>
 <br>
 The "Father of Waters," as the Indians so fitly call the Mississippi, was bank-full 
 when I crossed it one Tuesday morning. The prairies of Illinois and Wisconsin were 
 green with the early spring color that also clothed the trees along the borders 
 of this great stream. I was not disappointed, save with the awkwardly built stern-wheel 
 steamers, that were either wildly swinging down or laboriously puffing up its course. 
 When I stepped off the cars at Dubuque, Iowa, at last fairly West, I delighted in 
 the breezy speech and the freedom of the people; men and women of adaptation to 
 circumstances,-of a width of view like the plains that they were subduing.<br>
 <br>
 For a year Iowa with its agricultural beauties along the Mississippi held me prisoner. 
 Then the craving for the far West took hold of me as I heard the accounts of the 
 returning pioneers of Kansas or Nebraska. The plague of locusts had driven them 
 back and they had returned for supplies for another start.<br>
 <br>
 It will be remembered that Uncle Sam was more than generous in his land gifts at 
 this time. The pre-emption laws allowed pioneers to buy outright one hundred and 
 sixty acres of the best level land in Iowa and Minnesota at one dollar and twenty-five 
 cents an acre. Five years' time was given to pay for this, no other obligation was 
 required beyond the settler's own interests to live on it and improve it.<br>
 <br>
 I saw, as I travelled west, hundreds of these pre-emptors at work building small 
 sod or frame houses, and breaking up the heavy grassed prairies. The cars to western 
 Iowa and Minnesota were crowded every day with land seekers. The Danes, Norwegians 
 and Swedes were mainly in evidence; so new to the country that they could not make 
 themselves understood, but had to talk through their agents when inquiring, or buying. 
 These people's descendants of this day are the intelligent and prosperous farmers 
 of the choicest locations in country and town. Beginning with nothing but their 
 brawn and industry, they are independent citizens of the best prairie states.<br>
 <br>
 I crossed another great river at Omaha, the Missouri. With the imagination of youth, 
 I saw the older population of this country of illimitable plains. The Pawnees, the 
 Sioux, the Omahas, whose gatherings gave the name to Council Bluffs, upon the Iowa 
 side. I saw also the black rolling tide of bison racing before the yelling red hunters 
 or before the redder tongues of prairie fires. While I was denied my hope of running 
 down a buffalo, I was able to see several of them in their wild state, as I went 
 farther west. A great and reckless slaughter had thinned them down but one did not 
 then have to visit a government park to see a buffalo.<br>
 <br>
 It was a great event in that day for the overland express to leave Omaha for San 
 Francisco. People made preparation for this pullman ride with all the gravity of 
 a sea voyage. Baskets of supplies, wraps, rugs, and dust coats filled the arms of 
 the passengers boarding the cars.<br>
 <br>
 The express averaged sixteen miles an hour, including stops. The road-bed was of 
 very light caliber and simply spiked down without fishplates, allowing no forty 
 miles an hour speed. We swayed and teetered along some parts of the road in a way 
 that reminded me of a branch line on the Grand Trunk in Canada, where the train 
 dipped and curtseyed in the cuttings like a sail boat on the lakes. No harm came 
 of it. We stopped often for fuel and water, and to oil up the small, wide-funneled 
 engine, or to cool a hot-box in the heavily freighted baggage car.<br>
 <br>
 The winds of Nebraska are worthy of mention for they are in the business of blowing, 
 and if the people are much affected by them, they are certainly in danger of being 
 the biggest boosters of the West. Anyway, I saw the effect of these constant winds 
 on all faces; the men being as red as Indians and the women, despite the long poke 
 bonnets they wore, were almost as brown. Ma-dame Recamier's cream so much advertised 
 then, should have had a great sale in Nebraska, if the women were at all solicitous 
 of their complexions. But they were all of stern stuff and did not mind the Nebraska 
 breezes, whether hot as a blast in summer, or cold as a blizzard in winter. They 
 were a people that moved as briskly as their winds, going at top speed in their 
 buggies and on horseback.<br>
 <br>
 I saw women riding astride and they rode like cowboys. There were villages of marmots 
 or prairie dogs and these little canines shared their earth-holes with both snakes 
 and owls. Once in a while "Lo," the Indian, in his native costume was seen on a 
 hill near-by sitting on his cayuse, stoically viewing the white man's fire wagons 
 as they trailed past. These natives were also in evidence at every eating station, 
 either to sell their bead and buffalo ornaments, or to share in the white man's 
 fire-water.<br>
 <br>
 Those were the days of corn-whiskey, as yellow as gold and as hot as fire, and which 
 keeled over the drinker at "forty rods." The western men aboard the cars, filled 
 up with four fingers of this stuff at every stop. Temperance was not to the fore 
 then and the front streets of railroad towns were given up to saloons of vigorous 
 titles, and they were black with men from the cattle ranges around. These bandy-legged 
 bravos whooped 5 and rode races with the cars and even wasted some ammunition in 
 celebration of the passing express, that scarcely out-speeded their ponies.<br>
 <br>
 Those days are gone. The cowboy is now historic. The open range is now homesteaded 
 or desert-claimed by the nester. The great meat manufactory has passed from the 
 range, and is now in the hands of the farmer, who stall-feeds his cattle on the 
 cultivated roots and grains of the ranches.<br>
 <br>
 With the next morning's sun we saw the faint outline of the Rocky Mountains. We 
 had been slowly climbing and the elevation was sufficient to lower the horizon line 
 of this backbone of the continent. I was interested to see with my own eyes those 
 mountains made famous in my boyhood days by the stories of that writer for boys, 
 Captain Mayne Reid.<br>
 <br>
 Though the scenes that he so graphically described were in the great range farther 
 to the south, and on the Mexican border, yet the name, Rocky Mountains, satisfied 
 me that I was in the neighborhood of those old friends Rube and Geary in Scalp-Hunters, 
 or The War Trail. We are more or less children and beneath the layers of riper years, 
 lie recumbent the old imaginations of youth. So I sat and deamed again my boyhood 
 hours and felt young, though sad, since I could never be a boy again, nor see the 
 boy companions of those book days. Scattered to the four corners of the globe, some 
 at sea, some at antipodes, some citified and thus changed; and one old chum gone 
 away to the far country from which no traveller returns.<br>
 <br>
 What a day that was for the prospector and the cattle man! The sheep-man, so omnipresent 
 in Australia, was despised and seldom seen in this great West. The cattle owner 
 hated the sheepman almost as much as he did the Indian. It was the day of gun rule, 
 for the sheriff and the constable were persons few and far between. The reprobate 
 was in the land by voice and deed. All the dare-devils and the scum of the East 
 drifted this way, and were stranded like river debris, in these little, hideous 
 shanty railroad towns. Ten years earlier these characters ran everything to suit 
 themselves. The war was still raging, and Uncle Sam's hands full, thus giving the 
 rowdy and robber full swing to kill and steal. Some of these gentry were still about, 
 with faces hardened by excess and crime, yet the great majority had gone to the 
 greater majority via the hangman's rope or the hands of the Vigilante Committee 
 and the yet quicker way of the sawed off shot-gun.<br>
 <br>
 Next came the canyons. I had always thrilled at that word; it seemed to suggest 
 roaring waters, Mexican riders and red-men yelling. These canyons were tame, the 
 surveyors had selected the best grades and the engineers had made a level road for 
 the rails. We went orderly along these mountain streets, with little noise beyond 
 the tired asthmatic cough of our over-taxed engines, for we now had two engines 
 to draw us up these heights. How frail they looked, compared with the immense monsters 
 of to-day, dun colored and mighty, without brightness or glitter beyond their headlight! 
 Our engines were gaudy ones, brass bound, bright-painted, polished to the shining 
 point, showing all their works to the onlooker; the cylinder and driving-rods working 
 in full view. We halted at last to change cars; it was Ogden, at the junction of 
 the Union and Central Pacific Railroads.<br>
 <br>
 We saw here, for the first time, the orange-colored cars, which took all over-landers 
 to California. I was not booked for the real sea, but was bound for the Great Salt 
 Lake, or Salt Sea, in Utah Territory. As I looked around I missed the green earth 
 and the wide expanse of the plains. I found that I was among rocks of craggy height, 
 overlooking little narrow valleys, where irrigation was needed to make things grow. 
 I was m the far West at last though I knew that there was a farther West, which 
 some day I meant to see A lazy train soon started with the regulation speed of sixteen 
 miles to the hour and we slowly passed along the south line of the Salt Lake, a 
 sea so dead and dreary that it resembled dead sea of that memorable land, ancient 
 Palestine. Then we came, at last, to the city of the Latter Day Saints.</p>
