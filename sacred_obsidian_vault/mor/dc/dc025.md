 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a></font></span> Hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, while I speak unto you, Emma Smith, my daughter; for verily I say unto you, all those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a></font></span> A revelation I give unto you concerning my will; and if thou art faithful and walk in the paths of virtue before me, I will preserve thy life, and thou shalt receive an inheritance in Zion.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a></font></span> Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a></font></span> Murmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a></font></span> And the office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a></font></span> And thou shalt go with him at the time of his going, and be unto him for a scribe, while there is no one to be a scribe for him, that I may send my servant, Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I will.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a></font></span> And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a></font></span> For he shall lay his hands upon thee, and thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a></font></span> And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee in the church; for unto them is his calling, that all things might be revealed unto them, whatsoever I will, according to their faith.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a></font></span> And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a></font></span> And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a></font></span> For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a></font></span> Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a></font></span> Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride. Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and the glory which shall come upon him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a></font></span> Keep my commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt receive. And except thou do this, where I am you cannot come.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a></font></span> And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my voice unto all. Amen. </p>
