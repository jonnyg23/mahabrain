 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:1">122:1</a></font></span> The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:2">122:2</a></font></span> While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:3">122:3</a></font></span> And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:4">122:4</a></font></span> And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in honor; and but for a small moment and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce lion, because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:5">122:5</a></font></span> If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:6">122:6</a></font></span> If thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:7">122:7</a></font></span> And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:8">122:8</a></font></span> The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_122:9">122:9</a></font></span> Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever. </p>
