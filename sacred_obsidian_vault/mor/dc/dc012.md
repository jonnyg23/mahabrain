 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a></font></span> Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore, give heed unto my word.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a></font></span> Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a></font></span> Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a></font></span> Behold, I am the light and the life of the world, that speak these words, therefore give heed with your might, and then you are called. Amen. </p>
