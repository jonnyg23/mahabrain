 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>The light of God illumes the light of sense,<br>
 And then the soul aspires to meet its God;<br>
 A steed without a rider knows no way,<br>
 It wants a king to know the royal road.<br>
 Behold the sense which governed is by light,<br>
 A fine companion is this light to sense.<br>
 God's light adorns the sensual light,<br>
 This is the meaning of <i>Light on light</i>.<a name="page_64_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_64_note_*">*</a><br>
 Light physical drags down to earth beneath,<br>
 But light divine exalts to heavenly bliss.<br>
 All things of senses in a base world are,<br>
 God's light an ocean is, but sense a drop of dew.<br>
 Although this motor cannot be perceived,<br>
 Unless in virtuous effects and in speech.<br>
 The sensual light is ponderous, inert,<br>
 Concealed within the eye's recess.<br>
 As you the sensual eye-light cannot see,<br>
 How find you light which is not of the eye?<br>
 This world is swayed like chaff by the unseen wind,<br>
 Obeying helplessly the grace of God,<br>
 Which now conveys this chaff to sea and now to land;<br>
 Sometimes it moistened is and sometimes dry;<br>
 The hand unseen is; but see the writing pen!<br>
 The horse gallops, no rider does appear,<br>
 In mountains now it roams, and now in vales,<br>
 It now exalted is and now abased,<br>
 It now drives to the right and now to left,<br>
 Is now in rose-groves, now in thorny paths.<br>
 Behold, the arrow flies without a bow!<br>
 Life can be seen, but where is Life of life?<br>
 Break not the shaft, it is a royal one,<br>
 Although its nullity the mover knows;<br>
 God said: <i>thou hast not cast it, but I cast</i>.<a name="page_64_fr_dagger"></a><a href="#page_64_note_dagger">†</a><br>
 The acts of God precede all other acts,<br>
 You must your anger break and not the shaft,<br>
 Your wrathful eye turns milk to blood.<br>
 O kiss the arrow, bear it to the king,<br>
 That shaft defiled, and moist with blood of yours.<br>
 The seen is weak, and mean and base,<br>
 But quick and strong the invisible is.<br>
 We are the game, but who is master of the net?<br>
 We are the ball, but cannot see the bat.<br>
 Where is the artist who now tears, now sews?<br>
 The naphtha-thrower who now quenches and now burns,<br>
 Who now an infidel will make Siddiq,<a name="page_64_fr_ddagger"></a><a href="#page_64_note_ddagger">‡</a><br>
 And now a saintly hermit of Zandiq?<a name="page_64_fr_sect"></a><a href="#page_64_note_sect">§</a><br></td></tr>

 <h3 align="center"><a name="pp_2"></a>MOSES AND THE HERDSMAN.</h3>
 
 <p align="center"><i>Mesnavi of Jellâl-aldyn-Rûmi, 2nd Duftur.</i></p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>Once Moses saw a herdsman on the road,<br>
 Who thus exclaimed:—"O God! O Allah mine!<br>
 Where do you live? May I your servant be<br>
 To sew your overcoat, to comb your head?<br>
 O God, my life I sacrifice to you,<br>
 With all my children, all my kin and goods!<br>
 Where do you live, that I your head may comb,<br>
 Your quilt may make, and thickly sew your coat;<br>
 And if some malady you overtake,<br>
 I would your comfort be, as kinsfolk should,<br>
 To kiss your hands, to rub your little feet;<br>
 When sleep you want, to sweep your little place;<br>
 Your house if I could see, I always would<br>
 Bring oil and milk each eve and morn to you,<br>
 
 
 <!------------------------page 92------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a>
 
 Likewise some cheese with bread and greasy cakes<br>
 So nice with leaven or with curdled milk.<br>
 These make and bring I would each morn and eve;<br>
 I would supply and you might eat the food;<br>
 My goats would all I sacrifice to you;<br>
 My exclamations all are prayers to you."<br>
 Thus senseless that poor shepherd spoke;<br>
 But Moses said:—"O man, whom do you mean?"<br>
 He answered:—"Him who has created us,<br>
 Who has produced this earth and wheeling sky!"<br>
 Moses replied:—"Your head is going daft:"<br>
 Eslám you left, an infidel you turned;<br>
 What idle and blasphemous words are these?<br>
 Your mouth with cotton ought to be gagged;<br>
 Your unbelief will fill the world with dust;<br>
 Your infidelity revives the Dibadin.<a name="page_92_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_92_note_*">*</a><br>
 In need of quilted coats and socks you stand.<br>
 How could such things befit the Sun?<br>
 If you these ravings do not cease,<br>
 The world will be consumed by flames;<br>
 If fire has not appeared, then whence this smoke,<br>
 This life so black and spirit so perverse?<br>
 If you believe that God a bounteous giver is,<br>
 How can you belch out such stolidity?<br>
 A stupid friend is like an enemy.<br>
 Such adoration God does not require.<br>
 To father's or to mother's brother do you speak?<br>
 Of body and necessities to God Most High?<br>
 Milk is the beverage of a growing youth,<br>
 And trowsers are required for the legs;<br>
 But if a human being you did mean,<br>
 Has not God said:—"I am he, and he I?<br>
 When I was sick ye visited me not:<a name="page_92_fr_dagger"></a><a href="#page_92_note_dagger">†</a><br>
 Not only he; but I was sick also."<br>
 To him who neither sees nor hears your words,<br>
 To man, I say, they likewise nonsense are.<br>
 To speak unkindly to a bosom-friend<br>
 Deadens the heart and friendship kills.<br>
 If Fatimah a man you choose to call,<br>
 Though males and females both one genus are,<br>
 He will, should he be able, drink your blood.<br>
 In spite of his mild temper and religion;<br>
 Fatimah is a praise in female names,<br>
 Applied to men it is like wounds of spears.<br>
 To men their hands and feet all comfort bring;<br>
 The purity of God they would defile,<br>
 <i>He unbegotten is, begetteth not</i>,<a name="page_92_fr_ddagger"></a><a href="#page_92_note_ddagger">‡</a><br>
 But giveth life to parents and to sons.<br>
 All bodies must be witnesses of Him;<br>
 For everything produced here beneath<br>
 Created is and must corruption bear,<br>
 But made it is, and must a maker want."<br>
 He said:—"O Moses, you have sewed up my mouth,<br>
 By this repentance you have burnt my soul."<br>
 He rent his clothes and heaved a fervent sigh,<br>
 Towards the desert looking, sped his way.<br>
 A revelation Moses heard from God:—<br>
 "My servant you have driven away from me;<br>
 You have arrived the union to prepare,<br>
 And not for separation's sake:<br>
 If help you can, abstain from severing,<br>
 <i>Divorce I hate more than all other things</i>.<a name="page_92_fr_sect"></a><a href="#page_92_note_sect">§</a><br>
 On each man I his nature did bestow,<br>
 To everybody an expression I impart,<br>
 Which seems great praise to him, but blame to you;<br>
 He thinks it honey, you as poison deem;<br>
 It light to him must be, and fire to you;<br>
 But roses bright to him, and thorns to you,<br>
 What he deems good, as wicked you condemn;<br>
 What he applauds, you often disapprove;<br>
 We from pure and all impure things are free,<br>
 As well as from anxiety and speed.<br>
 I man have not produced for gain of mine,<br>
 But blessings to bestow on those who worship me.<br>
 To Hindus their expression serves for praise;<br>
 The Sindhis by their own expression laud;<br>
 Their adoration does not make me pure,<br>
 They also pure will be and shedding pearls.<br>
 Externals, words alone we disregard;<br>
 The soul within, its state, must give account;<br>
 At hearts we look, whether they humble are,<br>
 Though speech may perhaps too bold be;<br>
 For heart is essence, speech but accident:<br>
 Thus qualities are not essentials.<br>
 But why so many words and metaphors?<br>
 Flames, flames I want, comform yourself to them;<br>
 The fire of love you in your soul must raise,<br>
 Burn up your meditations, all your tropes.<br>
 O Moses, formalists quite different are<br>
 From those whose inmost souls do burn with fires!<br>
 Always to glow befits the lovers' hearts.<br>
 No taxes, tithes are asked from empty towns.<a name="page_92_fr_dvert"></a><a href="#page_92_note_dvert">‖</a><br>
 If sin he speaks, do not him sinner call;<br>
 If martyred and full of blood then wash him not:<br>
 Blood martyrs better fits than water does;<br>
 This wrong outweighs a hundred-fold reward.<br>
 In the Kabah the Qeblah cannot be looked at.<a name="page_92_fr_para"></a><a href="#page_92_note_para">¶</a><br>
 What matters it if divers do not jerk their feet?<br>
 You must not guidance seek from the inebriate,<br>
 Who rend their clothes; can they be asked to mend?<br>
 From all religions love's belief differs;<br>
 The lovers' sects and rites are God alone.<br></td></tr>

 <h3 align="center"><a name="pp_3"></a>THE FIVE SENSES.</h3>
 
 <p align="center"><i>From the Mesnavi of Jelâl-aldyn Rûmi.</i></p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>{this selection was printed accidentally and removed in the errata;<br>it is not listed in the contents of the journal}</small></p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>United are the senses five,<br>
 They all from one original spring:<br>
 The food of one is strength for all,<br>
 Each to the others drink supplies.<br>
 Sight by the eyes increases love,<br>
 Love in the heart will truth augment,<br>
 Truth every sense will rouse from sleep,<br>
 Taste friendship with the senses makes.<br>
 When an internal sense the bonds have opened,<br>
 Each other sense transfigured is;<br>
 When one sense things unfelt perceives,<br>
 To senses what's unseen revealed will be.<br>
 If one ram leaps a little from the flock,<br>
 All others follow in its track.<br>
 Impel the sheep of your perceptions<br>
 To graze in "pastures <i>He</i> produced,"<a name="page_268_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_268_note_*">*</a><br>
 To feed on basil sweet and hyacinths,<br>
 Ways to find, to rose-groves of truths divine;<br>
 Each sense to the others a herald will be,<br>
 And all to the heavenly paradise will go.<br>
 Your senses to your senses secrets tell<br>
 Without a tongue, a tale, or trope,<br>
 Although their story is the midwife of comments,<br>
 The surmise, source to speculate upon;<br>
 But things self-evident and plain<br>
 Admit no explanation or comment.<br>
 When all perceptions your senses have enslaved<br>
 The spheres cannot escape your ken;<br>
 When in the realm of husks questions arise<br>
 Its very kernel is proved to be but husk;<br>
 Amidst disputes of scarcity in blades<br>
 Their seeds you are to strive to find!<br>
 When spheres but husks will be, the spirit's light the grain,—<br>
 The one is seen, the other hid; start not:—<br>
 The body can be seen, the soul is hid;<br>
 But intellect is more concealed than the soul,<br>
 Therefore the spirit seeks the sense, and soars beyond:<br>
 You motion see and life perceive,<br>
 But that intellect fills it you forget;<br>
 Yet inspiration transcends intellect,<br>
 It is a mystery divine and unrevealed.<br></td></tr>
