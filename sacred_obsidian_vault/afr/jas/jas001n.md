 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">1. Tying Tiger.</h3>
 <p>Parkes heard this story in St. Ann Parish. Milne-Home, 99-108, tells it of Anansi and "Lion," who takes the place of Tiger in earlier Jamaica story-telling. In a famous Jamaica digging-song, the words "Tiger-Lion" are coupled much as we should say "John Smith."</p>
 <p>The story falls into three parts. (1) A bully takes for himself the food-supply of one weaker than himself, who dares not object. (2) The bully is tricked into allowing himself to be tied; when he is tormented or robbed of the food he is monopolizing. (3) He either dies, or he is rescued and (a) falls upon his rescuer, of (b) invites him to dinner, when he is again tricked by his first victim, who personates the animal who has released him and enjoys his hospitality until detected and pursued.</p>
 <p>Compare: Callaway, 29; 358; Theal, 110; Jacottet, 20-22; Dayrell, 93-97; Barker, 55-58; Cronise and Ward, 209-213; Ellis, Ewe 274; Rattray, 2:74-82; Smith, 549-551; Lenz, 41; Christensen, 23-25; Harris, Nights, 327-329; Friends, 21-23; Ernst, VBGAEU 20:275; Koch-Grünberg, 2:141; Saurière, 95-100; Lenz, Estudios, 202, 210.</p>
 <p>(1) The fish-basket story occurs in Dayrell and in Barker (antelope in a bundle). In Milne-Home, Anansi catches the fish by pretending he is going to give them new life.</p>
 <p>(2) The tying trick is variously treated. In Callaway, 29, and Theal, the "cannibal's" hair is plaited into the thatch, in Jacottet, the tail; in Callaway, 358, the tail is fastened into the ground. In Dayrell, the two play at tying each other (as in numbers 16 and 37) and the weaker animal refuses to untie the stronger. In Barker, the stronger animal consents to be hung in order to have his teeth beautifully filed. In Cronise &amp; Ward and in the American versions (Harris, Christensen, Lenz, Ernst), the lying takes place under pretence of storm, but a pretence made plausible by shaking</p>

 <p>the trees as if a storm were coming. In Jacottet's Story, Lion, whose tail has been thatched into the hut, prays for a storm to kill his tormentor; it comes and destroys Lion himself. In Koch-Grünberg (Taulipang), the story is mixed with the motive of the support of the stone.</p>
 <p>Tormenting the tied victim by throwing at him the remnants of the feast occurs in Theal, Cronise &amp; Ward, Dayrell (salt and pepper). In Callaway and Lenz, he is severely beaten.</p>
 <p>(3) Release by "White-ants" occurs in Barker, Cronise &amp; Ward, Smith; by "Bush-rat" in Dayrell, where the story ends, as in number 12 c, by the released victim falling upon his rescuer. In Milne-Home, this motive is also suggested. In Ellis, "Bush-rat" is freed by "Snail." Compare Nassau, 46, where the swollen Leopard, freed from his predicament by Crab, turns and eats up his rescuer. The overheard invitation occurs in Barker, Smith, Milne-Home.</p>
