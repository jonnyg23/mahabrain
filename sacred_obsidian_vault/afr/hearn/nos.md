 </p><p>The question "What is Voudooism?"
 could scarcely be answered to-day by any resident of New
 Orleans unfamiliar with the life of the African west coast,
 or the superstitions of Hayti, either through study or
 personal observation. The old generation of planters in
 whose day Voudooism had a recognized existence--so dangerous
 as a motive power for black insurrection that severe
 measures were adopted against it--has 
 <corr orig="passd" resp="SDavies">passed</corr> away; and the
 only person I ever met who had, as a child in his colored
 nurse's care, the rare experience of witnessing a Voudoo
 ceremonial, died some three years ago, at the advanced age
 of seventy-six. As a religion--an imported
 faith<wbr>--Voudooism in Louisiana is really dead; the rites
 of its serpent worship are forgotten; the meaning of its
 strange and frenzied chants, whereof some fragments linger
 as refrains in negro song, is not now known even to those
 who remember the words; and the story of its former
 existence is only revealed to the folklorists by the
 multitudinous débris of African superstition which it
 has left behind it. These only I propose to consider now;
 for what is to-day called Voudooism in New Orleans means,
 not an African cultus, but a curious class of negro
 practices, some possibly derived from it, and others which
 bear resemblance to the magic of the Middle Ages. What could
 be more mediæval, for instance, than molding a waxen
 heart, and sticking pins in it, or melting it slowly before
 a fire, while charms are being repeated with the hope that
 as the waxen heart melts or breaks, the life of some enemy
 will depart? What, again, could remind us more of
 thirteenth-century superstition than the burning of a
 certain number of tapers to compel some absent person's
 return, with the idea that before the last taper is consumed
 a 
 <corr orig="myserious" resp="SDavies">mysterious</corr>
 mesmerism will force the wanderer to cross rivers and
 mountains if necessary on his or her way back?
 
 <p>The fear of what are styled "Voudoo
 charms" is much more widely spread in Louisiana than
 any one who had conversed only with educated residents might
 suppose; and the most familiar superstition of this class is
 the belief in what I might call <em>pillow magic</em>, which
 is the supposed art of causing wasting sicknesses or even
 death by putting certain objects into the pillow of the bed
 in which the hated person sleeps. Feather pillows are
 supposed to be particularly well adapted to this kind of
 witchcraft. It is believed that by secret spells a
 "Voudoo" can cause some monstrous kind of bird or
 nondescript animal to shape itself into being out of the
 pillow feathers--like the <i>tupilek</i> of the Esquimau
 <i>iliseenek</i> (witchcraft.) It grows very slowly, and by
 night only; but when completely formed, the person who has
 been using the pillow dies. Another practice of pillow
 witchcraft consists in tearing a living bird
 asunder--usually a cock--and putting portions of the wings
 into the pillow. A third form of the black-art is confined
 to putting certain charms or fetiches<wbr>--consisting of
 bones, hair, feathers, rags, strings, or some fantastic
 combination of these and other trifling  objects--into any
 sort of a pillow used by the party whom it is desired to
 injure. The pure Africanism of this practice needs no
 comment. Any exact idea concerning the use of each
 particular kind of charm I have not been able to discover;
 and I doubt whether those who practise such fetichism know
 the original African beliefs connected with it. Some say
 that putting grains of corn into a child's pillow
 "prevents it from growing any more"; others
 declare that a bit of cloth in a grown person's pillow will
 cause wasting sickness; but different parties questioned by
 me gave each a different signification to the use of similar
 charms. Putting an open pair of scissors under the pillow
 before going to bed is supposed to insure a pleasant sleep
 in spite of fetiches; but the surest way to provide against
 being "hoodooed," as American residents call it,
 is to open one's pillow from time to time. If any charms are
 found, they must be first sprinkled with salt, then burned.
 A Spanish resident told me that her eldest daughter had been
 unable to sleep for weeks, owing to a fetich that had been
 put into her pillow by a spiteful colored domestic. After
 the object had been duly exorcised and burned, all the young
 lady's restlessness departed. A friend of mine living in one
 of the country parishes once found a tow string in his
 pillow, into the fibers of which a great number of feather
 stems had either been introduced or had introduced
 themselves. He wished to retain it as a curiosity, but no
 sooner did he exhibit it to some acquaintance than it was
 denounced as a Voudoo "trick," and my friend was
 actually compelled to burn it in the presence of witnesses.
 Everybody knows or ought to know that feathers in pillows
 have a natural tendency to cling and form clots or lumps of
 more or less curious form, but the discovery of these in
 some New Orleans households is enough to create a panic.
 They are viewed as incipient Voudoo <i>tupileks</i>. The
 sign of the cross is made over them by Catholics, and they
 are promptly committed to the flames.
 
 <p>Pillow magic alone, however, is far from
 being the only recognized form of maleficent negro
 witchcraft. Placing charms before the entrance of a house or
 room, or throwing them over a wall into a yard, is believed
 to be a deadly practice. When a charm is laid before a room
 door or hall door, oil is often poured on the floor or
 pavement in front of the threshold. It is supposed that
 whoever <em>crosses an oil line</em> falls into the power of
 the Voudoos. To break the oil charm, sand or salt should be
 strewn upon it. Only a few days before writing this article
 a very intelligent Spaniard told me that shortly after
 having discharged a dishonest colored servant he found
 before his bedroom door one evening a pool of oil with a
 charm Lying in the middle of it, and a candle burning near
 it. The charm contained some bones, feathers, hairs, and
 rags--all wrapped together with a string--and a dime. No
 superstitious person would have dared to use that dime; but
 my friend, not being superstitious, forthwith put it into
 his pocket.
 
 </p><p>The presence of that coin I can only attempt
 to explain by calling attention to another very interesting
 superstition connected with New Orleans fetichism. The
 negroes believe that in order to make an evil charm operate
 it is necessary to <em>sacrifice something</em>. Wine and
 cake are left occasionally in dark rooms, or candies are
 scattered over the sidewalk, by those who want to make their
 fetich hurt somebody. If food or sweetmeats are thus thrown
 away, they must be abandoned without a parting glance; the
 witch or wizard must not look back while engaged in the
 sacrifice.
 
 </p><p>Scattering dirt before a door, or making
 certain figures on the wall of a house with chalk, or
 crumbling dry leaves with the fingers and scattering the
 fragments before a residence, are also forms of a maleficent
 conjuring which sometimes cause serious annoyance. Happily
 the conjurers are almost as afraid of the counter-charms as
 the most superstitious persons are of the conjuring. An
 incident which occurred recently in one of the streets of
 the old quarter known as "Spanish Town" afforded
 me ocular proof of the fact. Through malice or
 thoughtlessness, or possibly in obedience to secret orders,
 a young negro girl had been tearing up some leaves and
 scattering them on the sidewalk in front of a cottage
 occupied by a French family. Just as she had dropped the
 last leaf the irate French woman rushed out with a broom and
 a handful of salt, and began to sweep away the leaves, after
 having flung salt both upon them and upon the little
 negress. The latter actually screamed with fright, and cried
 out, "Oh, pas jeté plis disel après moin,
 madame! pas bisoin jeté disel après moin; mo
 pas pé vini icite encore" (Oh, madam, don't
 throw any more salt after me; you needn't throw any more
 salt after me; I won't come here any more.)
 
 </p><p>Another strange belief connected with these
 practices was well illustrated by a gift made to my friend
 Professor William Henry by a negro servant for whom he had
 done some trifling favor. The gift consisted of a
 "frizzly  hen"--one of those funny little fowls
 whose feathers all seem to curl. "Mars'r Henry, you
 keep dat frizzly hen, an' ef eny niggers frow eny
 <em>conjure</em> in your yard, <em>dat frizzly hen will eat
 de conjure</em>." Some say, however, that one is not
 safe unless he keeps two frizzly hens.
 
 </p><p>The naughty little negress at whom the salt
 was thrown seemed to fear the salt more than the broom
 pointed at her. But she was not yet fully educated, I
 suspect, in regard to superstitions. The negro's terror of a
 broom is of very ancient date--it may have an African
 origin. It was commented upon by Moreau de Saint-Méry
 in his work on San Domingo, published in 1196. "What
 especially irritates the negro," he wrote, "is to
 have a broom passed over any part of his body. He asks at
 once whether the person imagined that he was dead, and
 remains convinced that the act shortens his life." Very
 similar ideas concerning the broom linger in New Orleans. To
 point either end of a broom at a person is deemed bad luck;
 and many an ignorant man would instantly knock down or
 violently abuse the party who should point a broom at him.
 Moreover, the broom is supposed to have mysterious power as
 a means of getting rid of people. "If you are pestered
 by visitors whom you would wish never to see again, sprinkle
 salt on the floor after they go, and sweep it out by the
 same door through which they have gone, and they will never
 come back." To use a broom in the evening is bad luck:
 <i>balayer le soir, on balaye sa fortune</i> (to sweep in
 the evening is to sweep your good luck away), remains a
 well-quoted proverb.
 
 </p><p>I do not know of a more mysterious disease
 than muscular atrophy in certain forms, yet it is by no
 means uncommon either in New Orleans or in the other leading
 cities of the United States. But in New Orleans, among the
 colored people, and among many of the uneducated of other
 races, the victim of muscular atrophy is believed to be the
 victim of Voudooism. A notion is prevalent that negro
 witches possess knowledge of a secret poison which may
 terminate life instantly or cause a slow "withering
 away," according as the dose is administered. A
 Frenchman under treatment for paralysis informed me that his
 misfortune was certainly the work of Voudoos, and that his
 wife and child had died through the secret agency of negro
 wizards. Mental aberration is also said to be caused by the
 administration of poisons whereof some few negroes are
 alleged to possess the secret. In short, some very
 superstitious persons of both races live in perpetual dread
 of imaginary Voudoos, and fancy that the least ailment from
 which they suffer is the work of sorcery. It is very
 doubtful whether any knowledge of those animal or vegetable
 poisons which leave no trace of their presence in the blood,
 and which may have been known to some slaves of African
 birth, still lingers in Louisiana, wide-spread as is the
 belief to the contrary. During the last decade there have
 been a few convictions of blacks for the crime of poisoning,
 but there was nothing at all mysterious or peculiar about
 these cases, and the toxic agent was invariably the most
 vulgar of all--arsenic, or some arsenious preparation in the
 shape of rat poison.
 
 </p><p>
 </p><p align="CENTER">II
 
 </p><p> The story of the frizzly hen brings me to
 the subject of superstitions regarding animals. Something of
 the African, or at least of the San Domingan, worship of the
 cock seems to have been transplanted hither by the blacks,
 and to linger in New Orleans under various metamorphoses. A
 negro charm to retain the affections of a lover consists in
 tying up the legs of the bird to the head, and plunging the
 creature alive into a vessel of gin or other spirits.
 Tearing the live bird asunder is another cruel charm, by
 which some negroes believe that a sweetheart may become
 magically fettered to the man who performs the quartering.
 Here, as in other parts of the world, the crowing hen is
 killed, the hooting of the owl presages death or bad luck,
 and the crowing of the cock by day presages the arrival of
 company. The wren (<i>roitelet</i>) must not be killed:
 <i>c'est zozeau bon Dié</i> (it is the good God's
 bird)--a belief, I think, of European origin.
 
 </p><p>It is dangerous to throw hair-combings away
 instead of burning them, because birds may weave them into
 their nests and while the nest remains the person to whom
 the hair belonged will have a continual headache. It is bad
 luck to move a cat from one house to another; seven years'
 bad luck to kill a cat; and the girl who steps, accidentally
 or otherwise, on a cat's tail need not expect to be married
 the same year. The apparition of a white butterfly means
 good news. The neighing of a horse before one's door is bad
 luck. When a fly bothers one very persistently, one may
 expect to meet an acquaintance who has been absent many
 years.
 
 </p><p>There are many superstitions about marriage,
 which seem to have a European origin, but are not less
 interesting on that account. "Twice a bridesmaid, never
 a bride," is a proverb which needs no comment. The
 bride must not keep the pins which fastened her wedding
 dress. The husband must never take off his wedding ring: to
 take it off will insure him bad luck of some kind. If a girl
 who is engaged accidentally lets a knife fall, it is a sign
 that her lover is coming. Fair or foul weather upon her
 marriage day augurs a happy or unhappy married life.
 
 </p><p>The superstitions connected with death may be
 all imported, but I have never been able to find a foreign
 origin for some of them. It is bad luck to whistle or hum
 the air that a band plays at a funeral. If a funeral stops
 before your house, it means that the dead wants company. It
 is bad luck to cross a funeral procession, or to count the
 number of carriages in it; if you do count them, you may
 expect to die after the expiration of as many weeks as there
 were carriages at the funeral. If at the cemetery there be
 any unusual delay in burying the dead, caused by any
 unlooked for circumstances, such as the tomb proving too
 small to admit the coffin, it is a sign that the deceased is
 selecting a companion from among those present, and one of
 the mourners must soon die. It is bad luck to carry a spade
 through a house. A bed should never be placed with its foot
 pointing toward the street door, for corpses leave the house
 feet foremost. It is bad luck to travel with a priest; this
 idea seems to me of Spanish importation; and I am inclined
 to attribute a similar origin to the strange tropical
 superstition about the banana, which I obtained,
 nevertheless, from an Italian. You must not <em>cut</em> a
 banana, but simply break it with the fingers, because in
 cutting it you <em>cut the cross</em>. It does not require a
 very powerful imagination to discern in a severed section of
 the fruit the ghostly suggestion of a crucifixion.
 
 </p><p>Some other creole superstitions are equally
 characterized by naïve beauty. Never put out with your
 finger the little red spark that tries to linger on the wick
 of a blown-out candle: just so long as it burns, some soul
 in purgatory enjoys rest from torment. Shooting-stars are
 souls escaping from purgatory: if you can make a good wish
 three times before the star disappears, the wish will be
 granted. When there is sunshine and rain together, a colored
 nurse will tell the children, "<i>Gadé! djabe
 apé batte so femme</i>." (Look! the devil's
 beating his wife!)
 
 </p><p>I will conclude this little paper with
 selections from a list of superstitions which I find widely
 spread, not citing them as of indubitable creole origin, but
 simply calling attention to their prevalence in New Orleans,
 and leaving the comparative study of them to folklorists.
 
 </p><p>Turning the foot suddenly in walking means
 bad or good luck. If the right foot turns, it is bad luck;
 if the left, good. This superstition seems African,
 according to a statement made by Moreau de
 Saint-Méry. Some reverse the conditions, making the
 turning of the left foot bad luck. It is also bad luck to
 walk about the house with one shoe on and one shoe off. or
 as a creole acquaintance explained it to me "<i>c'est
 appeler sa mère ou son père dans le
 tombeau</i>" (It is calling one's mother or one's
 father into the grave). An itching in the right palm means
 coming gain; in the left, coming loss.
 
 </p><p>Never leave a house by a different door from
 that by which you entered it; it is "carrying away the
 good luck of the place." Never live in a house you
 build before it has been rented for at least a year. When an
 aged person repairs his or her house, he or she is soon to
 die. Never pass a child through a window; it stops his
 growth. Stepping over a child does the same; therefore,
 whoever takes such a step inadvertently must step back again
 to break the evil spell. Never tilt a rocking-chair when it
 is empty. Never tell a bad dream before breakfast, unless
 you want it "to come true"; and never pare the
 nails on Monday morning before taking a cup of coffee. A
 funny superstition about windows is given me in this note by
 a friend: "<i>Il ne faut pas faire passer un enfant par
 la fenêtre, car avant un an il y en aura un
 autre</i>" (A child must not be passed through a
 window, for if so passed you will have another child before
 the lapse of a year.) This proverb, of course, interests
 only those who desire small families, and as a general rule
 creoles are proud of large families, and show extraordinary
 affection toward their children.
 
 </p><p>If two marriages are celebrated
 simultaneously, one of the husbands will die. Marry at the
 time of the moon's waning and your good luck will wane also.
 If two persons think and express the same thought at the
 same time, one of them will die before the year passes. To
 chop up food in a pot with a knife means a dispute in the
 house. If you have a ringing in your ears, some person is
 speaking badly of you; call out the names of all whom you
 suspect and when the ringing stops at the utterance of a
 certain name, you know who the party is. If two young girls
 are combing the hair of a third at the same time, it may be
 taken for granted that the youngest of the three will soon
 die. If you want to make it stop raining, plant a cross in
 the middle of the yard and sprinkle it with salt. The
 red-fish has the print of St. Peter's fingers on its tail.
 If water won't boil in the kettle, there may be a toad or a
 toad's egg in it. Never kill a spider in the afternoon or
 evening, but always kill the spider unlucky enough to show
 himself early in the morning, for the old French proverb
 says:
 
 </p><blockquote><blockquote><font size="-1">
 	"Araignée du matin--chagrin;<br>
 	Araignée du midi--plaisir;<br>
 	Araignée du soir--espoir"
 </font></blockquote></blockquote>
 
 <p>  </p><p>(A spider seen in the morning is a sign of
 grief; a spider seen an noon, of joy; a spider seen in the
 evening, of hope).
 
 </p><p>Even from this very brief sketch of New
 Orleans superstitions the reader may perceive that the
 subject is peculiar enough to merit the attention of
 experienced folklorists. It might be divided by a competent
 classifier under three heads: I. Negro superstitions
 confined to the black and colored. population; II. Negro
 superstitions which have proved contagious, and have spread
 among the uneducated classes of whites; III. Superstitions
 of Latin origin imported from France, Spain, and Italy. I
 have not touched much upon superstitions inherited from
 English, Irish, or Scotch sources, inasmuch as they have
 nothing especially local in their character here. It must be
 remembered that the refined classes have no share in these
 beliefs, and that, with a few really rational exceptions,
 the practices of creole medicine are ignored by educated
 persons. The study of creole superstitions has only an
 ethnological value, and that of creole medicine only a
 botanical one, in so far as it is related to empiricism.
 
 </p><p>All this represents an under side of New
 Orleans life; and if anything of it manages to push up to
 the surface, the curious growth makes itself visible only by
 some really pretty blossoms of feminine superstition in
 regard to weddings or betrothal rings, or by some dainty
 sprigs of child-lore, cultivated by those colored nurses who
 tell us that the little chickens throw up their heads while
 they drink to thank the good God for giving them water.
