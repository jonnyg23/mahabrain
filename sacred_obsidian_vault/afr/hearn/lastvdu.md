 <p>In the death of Jean Montanet, at the age of nearly a 
 hundred years, New Orleans lost, at the end of August, the most
 extraordinary African character that ever gained celebrity
 within her limits. Jean Montanet, or Jean La Ficelle, or
 Jean Latanié, or Jean Racine, or Jean Grisgris, or Jean 
 Macaque, or Jean Bayou, or "Voudoo John," or
 "Bayou John," or "Doctor John" might well
 have been termed "The Last of the Voudoos"; not that
 the strange association with which he was affiliated has ceased
 to exist with his death, but that he was the last really
 important figure of a long line of wizards or witches whose
 African titles were recognized, and who exercised an influence
 over the colored population.  Swarthy occultists will doubtless
 continue to elect their "queens" and high-priests
 through years to come, but the influence of the public school is
 gradually dissipating all faith in witchcraft, and no black
 hierophant now remains capable of manifesting such mystic
 knowledge or of inspiring such respect as Voudoo John exhibited
 and compelled.  There will never be another "Rose,"
 another "Marie," much less another Jean Bayou.

 It may reasonably be doubted whether any other negro of
 African birth who lived in the South had a more extraordinary 
 career than that of Jean Montanet.  He was a native
 of Senegal, and claimed to have been a prince's son, in proof
 of which he was wont to call attention to a number of parallel 
 scars on his cheek, extending in curves from the edge of
 either temple to the corner of the lips.  This fact seems to
 me partly confirmatory of his statement, as Berenger-Feraud
 dwells at some length on the fact that the Bambaras, who
 are probably the finest negro race in Senegal, all wear such
 disfigurations. The scars are made by gashing the cheeks
 during infancy, and are considered a sign of race.  Three
 parallel scars mark the freemen of the tribe; four distinguish
 their captives or slaves. Now Jean's face had, I am told,
 three scars, which would prove him a free-born Bambara,
 or at least a member of some free tribe allied to the 
 Bambaras, and living upon their territory.  At all events, Jean
 possessed physical characteristics answering to those by
 which the French ethnologists in Senegal distinguish the
 Bambaras. He was of middle height, very strongly built,
 with broad shoulders, well-developed muscles, an inky black
 skin, retreating forehead, small bright eyes, a very flat nose,
 and a woolly beard, gray only during the last few years of his
 long life. He had a resonant voice and a very authoritative
 manner.
 
 </p><p>
 At an early age he was kidnapped by Spanish slavers, who
 sold him at some Spanish port, whence he was ultimately
 shipped to Cuba. His West-Indian master taught him to
 be an excellent cook, ultimately became attached to him, and
 made him a present of his freedom.  Jean soon afterward
 engaged on some Spanish vessel as ship's cook, and in the
 exercise of this calling voyaged considerably in both 
 hemispheres.  Finally tiring of the sea, he left his ship at New
 Orleans, and began life on shore as a cotton-roller.  His
 physical strength gave him considerable advantage above his
 fellow-blacks; and his employers also discovered that he
 wielded some peculiar occult influence over the negroes,
 which made him valuable as an overseer or gang leader.
 Jean, in short, possessed the mysterious obi power, the 
 existence of which has been recognized in most slave-holding 
 communities, and with which many a West-Indian planter has
 been compelled by force of circumstances to effect a compromise. 
 Accordingly Jean was permitted many liberties which other blacks,
 although free, would never have presumed  to take.  Soon it
 became rumored that he was a seer of no small powers, and that he
 could tell the future by the marks upon bales of cotton.  I have
 never been able to learn the details of this queer method of
 telling fortunes; but Jean became so successful in the exercise
 of it that thousands of colored people flocked to him for
 predictions and counsel, and even white people, moved by
 curiosity or by doubt, paid him to prophesy for them.  Finally he
 became wealthy enough to abandon the levee and purchase a large
 tract of property on the Bayou Road, where he built a house.  His
 land extended from Prieur Street on the Bayou Road as far
 as Roman, covering the greater portion of an extensive
 square, now well built up.  In those days it was a marshy
 green plain, with a few scattered habitations.
 
 </p><p>
 At his new home Jean continued the practice of fortune-telling, 
 but combined it with the profession of creole medicine, and 
 of arts still more mysterious. By-and-by his reputation 
 became so great that he was able to demand and obtain 
 immense fees.  People of both races and both sexes
 thronged to see him--many coming even from far-away
 creole towns in the parishes, and well-dressed women, closely
 veiled, often knocked at his door.  Parties paid from ten to
 twenty dollars for advice, for herb medicines, for recipes to
 make the hair grow, for cataplasms supposed to possess
 mysterious virtues, but really made with scraps of shoe-leather 
 triturated into paste, for advice what ticket to buy
 in the Havana Lottery, for aid to recover stolen goods, for
 love powers, for counsel in family troubles, for charms by
 which to obtain revenge upon an enemy.  Once Jean received 
 a fee of fifty dollars for a potion.  "It was water,"
 he said to a creole confidant, "with some common herbs
 boiled in it.  I hurt nobody; but if folks want to give me
 fifty dollars, I take the fifty dollars every time!"  His
 office furniture consisted of a table, a chair, a picture of the
 Virgin Mary, an elephant's tusk, some shells which he said were
 African shells and enabled him to read the future, and a pack
 of cards in each of which a small hole had been burned.
 About his person he always carried two small bones wrapped
 around with a black string, which bones he really appeared
 to revere as fetiches.  Wax candles were burned during his
 performances; and as he bought a whole box of them every
 few days during "flush times," one can imagine how
 large the number of his clients must have been. They poured
 money into his hands so generously that he became worth at
 least $50,000!
 
 </p><p>
 Then, indeed, did this possible son of a Bambara prince
 begin to live more grandly than any black potentate of Senegal. 
 He had his carriage and pair, worthy of a planter,
 and his blooded saddle-horse, which he rode well, attired in
 a gaudy Spanish costume, and seated upon an elaborately
 decorated Mexican saddle. At home, where he ate and
 drank only the best--scorning claret worth less than a
 dollar the <i>litre</i>--he continued to find his simple
 furniture good enough for him; but he had at least fifteen
 wives--a harem worthy of Boubakar-Segou. White folks might have
 called them by a less honorific name, but Jean declared
 them his legitimate spouses according to African ritual.
 One of the curious features in modern slavery was the ownership 
 of blacks by freedmen of their own color, and these
 negro slave-holders were usually savage and merciless masters. 
 Jean was not; but it was by right of slave purchase
 that he obtained most of his wives, who bore him children
 in great multitude.  Finally he managed to woo and win
 a white woman of the lowest class, who might have been,
 after a fashion, the Sultana-Validé of this Seraglio.  On
 grand occasions Jean used to distribute largess among the
 colored population of his neighborhood in the shape of
 food--bowls of <i>gombo</i> or dishes of <i>jimbalaya</i>.  He
 did it for popularity's sake in those days, perhaps; but in
 after-years, during the great epidemics, he did it for charity,
 even when so much reduced in circumstances that he was himself
 obliged to cook the food to be given away.
 
 </p><p>
 But Jean's greatness did not fail to entail certain cares.
 He did not know what to do with his money.  He had no
 faith in banks, and had seen too much of the darker side of
 life to have much faith in human nature.  For many years
 he kept his money under-ground, burying or taking it up
 at night only, occasionally concealing large sums so well that
 he could never find them again himself; and now, after
 many years, people still believe there are treasures entombed
 somewhere in the neighborhood of Prieur Street and Bayou
 Road.  All business negotiations of a serious character
 caused him much worry, and as he found many willing to
 take advantage of his ignorance, he probably felt small 
 remorse for certain questionable actions of his own.  He was
 notoriously bad pay, and part of his property was seized at
 last to cover a debt.  Then, in an evil hour, he asked a man
 without scruples to teach him how to write, believing that
 financial misfortunes were mostly due to ignorance of the
 alphabet.  After he had learned to write his name, he was
 innocent enough one day to place his signature by request
 at the bottom of a blank sheet of paper, and, lo! his real
 estate passed from his possession in some horribly mysterious 
 way.  Still he had some money left, and made heroic
 efforts to retrieve his fortunes.  He bought other property,
 and he invested desperately in lottery tickets.  The lottery
 craze finally came upon him, and had far more to do with
 his ultimate ruin than his losses in the grocery, the 
 shoemaker's shop, and other establishments into which he had
 put several thousand dollars as the silent partner of people
 who cheated him.  He might certainly have continued to
 make a good living, since people still sent for him to cure
 them with his herbs, or went to see him to have their fortunes
 told; but all his earnings were wasted in tempting fortune.
 After a score of seizures and a long succession of evictions,
 he was at last obliged to seek hospitality from some of his
 numerous children; and of all he had once owned nothing
 remained to him but his African shells, his elephant's tusk,
 and the sewing-machine table that had served him to tell
 fortunes and to burn wax candles upon.  Even these, I
 think, were attached a day or two before his death, which
 occurred at the house of his daughter by the white wife, an
 intelligent mulatto with many children of her own.
 
 </p><p>
 Jean's ideas of religion were primitive in the extreme.
 The conversion of the chief tribes of Senegal to Islam occurred 
 in recent years, and it is probable that at the time he
 was captured by slavers his people were still in a condition
 little above gross fetichism.  If during his years of servitude
 in a Catholic colony he had imbibed some notions of Romish
 Christianity, it is certain at least that the Christian ideas
 were always subordinated to the African--just as the image
 of the Virgin Mary was used by him merely as an auxiliary
 fetich in his witchcraft, and was considered as possessing
 much less power than the "elephant's toof."  He was in
 many respects a humbug; but he may have sincerely believed 
 in the efficacy of certain superstitious rites of his own.
 He stated that he had a Master whom he was bound to obey;
 that he could read the will of this Master in the twinkling of
 the stars; and often of clear nights the neighbors used to
 watch him standing alone at some street corner staring at
 the welkin, pulling his woolly beard, and talking in an 
 unknown language to some imaginary being.  Whenever Jean
 indulged in this freak, people knew that he needed money
 badly, and would probably try to borrow a dollar or two
 from some one in the vicinity next day.
 
 </p><p>
 Testimony to his remarkable skill in the use of herbs
 could be gathered from nearly every one now living who 
 became well acquainted with him.  During the epidemic of
 1878, which uprooted the old belief in the total immunity
 of negroes and colored people from yellow fever, two of
 Jean's children were "taken down."  "I have no
 money," he said, "but I can cure my children,"
 which he proceeded to do with the aid of some weeds plucked from
 the edge of the Prieur Street gutters.  One of the herbs, I am
 told, was what our creoles call the "parasol." 
 "The children were playing on the <i>banquette</i> next
 day," said my informant.
 
 </p><p>
 Montanet, even in the most unlucky part of his career,
 retained the superstitious reverence of colored people in all
 parts of the city.  When he made his appearance even on
 the American side of Canal Street to doctor some sick person,
 there was always much subdued excitement among the
 colored folks, who whispered and stared a great deal, but
 were careful not to raise their voices when they said,
 "Dar's Hoodoo John!"  That an unlettered African slave
 should have been able to achieve what Jean Bayou achieved in a
 civilized city, and to earn the wealth and the reputation that
 he enjoyed during many years of his life, might be cited as a
 singular evidence of modern popular credulity, but it is also
 proof that Jean was not an ordinary man in point of natural
 intelligence.
