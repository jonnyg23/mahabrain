 <p>Pin Point, a Negro community about nine miles southeast of Savannah, is scattered over some twenty or thirty acres on a peninsula overlooking Shipyard Creek. Many of the small wooden cabins are neatly whitewashed and are half hidden by shrubbery and spreading oaks. Flowers and vegetables are planted in the most advantageous sunny spots near the houses and most of the yards are enclosed by picket fences, giving a cozy and pleasant privacy. The lanes, little more than wagon tracks, twist in and out and across the settlement. The informal and haphazard scattering of the houses, with high shrubbery bordering the lanes, gives an effect that is pleasing and unusual.</p> 
 <p>Pin Point has a church, a pavilion on the tidewater creek, and a crab cannery. The men and women who do not work as domestic servants at the nearby country places find employment in the crab cannery or fish and crab and shrimp for themselves. The life is quiet, soothed by the smell of the salt marsh.</p> 
 <p>It is only when some great excitement takes place, a stirring religious service, a dance at the community pavilion, a death, <a href="das26.htm#xref_37b"><font color="GREEN" size="1">37b</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_37c"><font color="GREEN" size="1">37c</font></a> or some scandal concerning a neighbor, that quiet Pin Point bestirs itself. Recently, one of the fishermen ventured into the foreign waters of the Ogeechee about ten miles distant and there he was almost devoured by an alligator. All that was left of him, "the ham," was given a burial <a href="das26.htm#xref_2"><font color="GREEN" size="1">2</font></a> amid the loud lamentations of his relatives and neighbors.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p> 
 <p>The people are, almost without exception, black or dark skinned, proud, upstanding and loyal, suspicious of strangers but generous and trusting to friends. Most of the very old inhabitants have died in the past decade, so that to have reached the age of sixty places a man or woman in the patriarchal class. The grown people between twenty-five and thirty, are still close to the traditions and beliefs in which they have been reared. Firmly believing in the Bible, they still are aware of other beliefs and customs handed down by their parents and grandparents.</p> 
 <p>A pleasant, intelligent woman <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a> of about forty-five chatted with us. "Cose, det is duh will ub God, but dey do say jis duh same wen a pusson die, 'Maybe somebody fix em' <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> aw 'I sho know dat uhmun wuz rooted.' I ain nebuh bought no powduh muhsef but jis day befo yestuhdy a uhmun frum Tatemville wuz right yuh tuh dis house sellin High John duh Conqueruh fuh fifty cent an she sho say it would bring yuh powuhful good luck, but I ain hab fifty cent. <a href="das26.htm#xref_8"><font color="GREEN" size="1">8</font></a></p> 
 <p>"Cose, it ain good tuh fool much wid dem tings, but yuh sho hab tuh be keahful not tuh let no enemy git bole uh yuh haiah combins; cuz dey say dey sho could fix yuh den." <a href="das26.htm#xref_10"><font color="GREEN" size="1">10</font></a> She laughed a little uneasily. "Ef yuh dream ub a snake dassa enemy neahby too, but ef yuh weah a snake skin roun yuh wais, it good fuh wut ail yuh. <a href="das26.htm#xref_50d"><font color="GREEN" size="1">50d</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_50e"><font color="GREEN" size="1">50e</font></a> An ef uh enemy come tuh yuh house an yuh dohn wahn im deah no mo, yuh jis take duh bruhm an sweep out quick attuh im. Den sprinkle a lill salt on duh flo weah his foot track bin an sweep em all out duh doe an he sho wohn come back no mo."</p> 
 <p>At this point in her narrative a swarm of barefoot children, black and with shining eyes, clustered around us. One and all were eating crabs, biting into the soft part of the body shell or cracking a claw with strong white teeth. Word had evidently just gone out that some excitement was brewing. Strangers had come and were talking to "Miz Minnie." If anything was going on they didn't want to miss it. But "Miz Minnie" felt differently. "Go long, yuh chillun. Go long wid yuh crahb an stop lissnin tuh grown folks." Minnie flapped her apron and they scattered like a brood of young chicks.</p> 
 <p>

 <p>"Yasm, cose yuh do heah bout cunjuhin." <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> Minnie turned back to us. "Dasso. Dey's alluz talk bout it, an I know ole Lewis McIver wut libs, yuh right now, wut foun a bottle buried in his mattress. He wuz sick an somebody wuz tryin tuh fix im. I seen dat bottle muhsef, wid muh own eyes. Yes, ma'am, I sho seen it. It hab yulluhlak oily lookin stuff in it an deah wuz a piece uh clawt stuck tru wid needles an pins in it." <a href="das26.htm#xref_8"><font color="GREEN" size="1">8</font></a> Minnie looked worried at the mere memory. "I seen it fuh sho an dohn nobody know who put it deah. But Lewis is bettuh sence it wuz took out. He say he ain hab neah so much pain.</p> 
 <p>"Den wen muh ole uncle wuz sick, <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> dey sen fuh a ole uhmun wut know bout cunjuh <a href="das26.htm#xref_48"><font color="GREEN" size="1">48</font></a> an she wehn out in duh yahd an dig up a piece uh clawt wadded intuh a ball wid nails in it an she cas it away. I seen dat too. She say somebody plant it deah gense im.</p> 
 <p>"Dey make mojoes outn anyting but dey do say grabeyahd dut <a href="das26.htm#xref_9"><font color="GREEN" size="1">9</font></a> an nails an blood an haiah, <a href="das26.htm#xref_10"><font color="GREEN" size="1">10</font></a> dey is impawtant. Cose I know bettuhn belieb all dis," she laughed, "but it make yuh sked an yuh sho full uh worry ef somebody tryin tuh fix yuh." After cogitating on these dangers Minnie smiled, "But ef yuh weahs a silbuh dime tied tuh yuh ankle an yuh step obuh anyting wut put down fuh yuh, duh dime'll sho tun black sudden an quick an den yuh knows it." <a href="das26.htm#xref_12a"><font color="GREEN" size="1">12a</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_12c"><font color="GREEN" size="1">12c</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_12d"><font color="GREEN" size="1">12d</font></a></p> 
 <p>Pin Point attained a certain measure of fame as the setting of the Bo-Cat murder in 1932. Limerick De Lancy, Pin Point Negro nicknamed Bo-Cat, killed his wife, Catherine, and dropped her corpse into the deep waters near Hell Gate. When the crime was discovered, the fact that it had taken place on Friday, the thirteenth, loomed significant in the consciousness of the small community and in no time inspired a ballad. Attributed to no single author but apparently added to from time to time, the ballad now runs:</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p><font size="-1">On duh thuteent day ub May<br> Yuh could heah ole Bo-Cat say,<br> "Git muh deed an policy.<br> Tun it in duh ashes way."</font></p> 
 <p>Den ole Catherine she begin tuh inquyuh.<br> Didn know ole Bo-Cat had dem in duh fyuh.<br> It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife. <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a><br> Put uh in duh boat,<br> Dey begin tuh float,<br> Dey float tuh duh Raccoon Keys.<br> He knock uh on duh knees.<br> Catherine holluh, "Wa-Wan-Wa."<br> Bo-Cat make uh "Na-Nan-Na."<br> It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.</p>

 <p>He knock uh in duh back<br> An duh oah miss an crack.<br> It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.<br> Wen Bo-Cat wehn back home<br> He meet uh daughtuh all alone.<br> Uh daughtuh say, "Bo-Cat, Bo-Cat,<br> Weah my mama is?"<br> Bo-Cat tun right out he head<br> An he tro uh cross duh bed.<br> It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.</p> 
 <p>Dey got Bo-Cat in jail<br> Bout tuh hang im by duh rail<br> It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>One of the Pin Point women, Margaret Snead, <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a> recalls vividly the events of the De Lancy crime.</p>
