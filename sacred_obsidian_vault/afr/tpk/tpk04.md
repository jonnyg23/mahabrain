   <h1 align="center">ETHIOPIA'S KINGDOM</h1>  
 <p>Dear inhabitants of this world King Ras Tafari and Queen Omega are the foundation stones of the Resurrection of the Kingdom of Ethiopia.</p>  
 <p>Their prayer and labour for our Resurrection is past finding out; no library in this world is able to contain the work of their hands for us, for they work both day and night for our deliverance.</p>  
 <p>As for this generation of the 20th century you and I have no knowledge how worlds are build and upon what triggers Kingdoms are set.</p>  
 <p>In King Alpha's Encyclopedia he will explain to us all, how worlds are being built and upon what trigger Kingdoms are set on. He will also explain to us the capacities of generations.</p>  
 <p>Speaking for the Universe and the womanhood of man Queen Omega the Ethiopian woman is the crown woman of this world. She hands us Her Rule-Book from the poles of supreme authority she is the Cannon Mistress of creation.</p>  
 <p>King Alpha and Queen Omega are the paymasters of the world, Bible owner and money mint. Do not forget they are Black People if you please.</p>  
 <p>Owing to the universal rend of our ancient and modem we are at this juncture of our history scattered over the Globe into little sectional groups.</p>  
 <p>All our local bands throughout the globe are bent towards King Alpha's Royal Repository, the Royal Authority is to admit all Bands, Mission Camps, Denominations into the supreme Royal Repository.</p>  
 <p>Queen Omega being the balming mistress of many worlds she charges the powerhouse right now.</p>  
 <p>Ethiopia is the succeeding Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom. A man of greater learning and a better Christian soul, than King Alpha is not to be found on the face of the Globe. He makes the nations heart rejoices with raging joy, we give him the glory. Ethiopia rulebook leads us into different departments of the Kingdom, the records of the Kingdom are with us unto this day. The Regulations points us to the basis of the Kingdom.</p>  
 <p>Many will not see the truth, because they are spiritually blind. See Matthew 3:13. The woman of Samaria first refused to obey the request of our Lord because she was spiritually blind. But when the great Physician opened up her eyes and healed her of her infirmities concerning her many husbands in the city of Samaria, she found out that her first teachers of denominations throughout the state or country of Samaria were false. Then she cried aloud unto the inhabitants of the city and said Come see a man that told me all that I ever did and is not a native of Samaria but an Hebrew, is not this man the very Christ. Our cities of today are inhabited with the same qualities of people as it was in the days of Jesus and the woman of Samaria.</p>
