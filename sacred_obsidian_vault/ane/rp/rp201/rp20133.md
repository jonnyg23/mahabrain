Since that day unchanged is thy command.<br> 8. High and low entreat thy hand:<br> 9. may the word that goes forth from thy mouth be established; untroubled is thy gift-day.<br> 10. None among the gods has surpassed thy power<br> 11. at the time when (thy hand) founded the shrine of the god of the sky. <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> 12.

Never may thy weapons be broken; <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">4</font></a> may thine enemies tremble!<br> 17.

Then they set in their midst his saying unique; <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> 20. to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span> their first-born they spake:<br> 21. "May thy destiny, O lord, go before the god of heaven;<br> 22. may <i>he confirm</i> (?) the destruction and creation of all that is said.<br> 23. Set thy mouth; let it destroy his word:<br> 24. turn, speak unto it, and let him lift up his word (again)." <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> 25. He spake and with his mouth destroyed his word;<br> 26. he turned, he spake unto it and his word was re-created.<br> 27. Like (the word) that issues from his mouth the gods his fathers saw it:<br> 28. they rejoiced, they approached <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span> the king.<br> 29. They bestowed upon him the sceptre (and) throne and reign;<br> 30. they gave him a weapon unsurpassed, consuming the hostile.<br> 31. "Go" (they said), "and cut off the life of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span>;<br> 32. let the winds carry her blood to secret places."<br> 33. The gods his fathers also hear the report of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ea</span>:<br> 34. "A path of peace and obedience is the road I have caused (him) to take."<br> 35. There was too the bow, as his weapon he prepared (it);<br> 36. he made the club swing, he fixed its seat;<br> 37. and he lifted up the sacred weapon <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">4</font></a> which he bade his right hand hold.<br> 38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side;</p>

 <p>39. he set the lightning before him;<br> 40. with a glance of swiftness he filled his body.<br> 41. He made also a snare to enclose the dragon of the sea.<br> 42. He seized the four winds that they might not issue forth, any one of them,<br> 43. the south wind, the north wind, the east wind (and) the west wind.<br> 44. His hand brought the snare near the bow <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a> of his father <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anu</span>.<br> 45. He created the evil wind, the hostile wind, the storm, the tempest,<br> 46. the four winds, the seven winds, the whirlwind, the unending wind;<br> 47. and he caused the winds which he had created to issue forth, the seven of them,<br> 48. confounding the dragon <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span>, as they swept after him.<br> 49. Then the lord lifted up the deluge, his mighty weapon.<br> 50. He rode in the chariot of destiny that retreats without a rival. <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> 51. He stood firm and hung the four reins at its side.<br> 52.

 <p>63. On that day they exalted him, the gods exalted him,<br> 64. the gods his fathers exalted him, the gods exalted him.<br> 65. Then the lord approached; he catches <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> by her waist;<br> 66. she seeks the huge <i>bulk</i> (?) of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kingu</span> her husband,<br> 67. she looks also for his counsel.<br> 68. Then the rebellious one (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span>) appointed <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">1</font></a> him the overthrower of the command of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bel</span>.<br> 69. But the gods his helpers who marched beside him<br> 70. beheld (how <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span>) the first-born held their yoke.<br> 71. He laid judgment on <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> (but) she turned not her neck.<br> 72. With her hostile lip(s) she announced opposition.<br> 73. (Then) the gods (came) to the help of the lord, sweeping after thee:<br> 74. they gathered their (forces) together to where thou vast.<br> 75. (And) the lord (launched) the deluge, his mighty weapon;<br> 76. (against) <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span>, whom he requited, he sent it with these words:<br> 77. "(War) on high thou hast excited.<br> 78. (Strengthen?) thy heart and muster (thy troops) against the god(s).<br> 79. …… their fathers beside (thee).<br> 80. …… thou hast opposed<br> 81. …… to (thy) husband.<br> 82. ……… <i>lordship</i> (?)<br> 83. …………thou seekest.</p>

 <p>1. (Against) the gods my fathers thou has directed thy hostility.<br> 2. Thou harnesser of thy companions, may thy weapons reach their bodie(s).<br> 3. Stand up, and I and thou will fight together."<br> 4. When <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> heard this,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. she uttered her former spells, she repeated her command.<br> 6. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> also cried out vehemently with a loud voice.<br> 7. From its roots she strengthened (her) seat completely.<br> 8. She recites an incantation, she casts a spell,<br> 9. and the gods of battle demand for themselves their arms.<br> 10. Then <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> attacked <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span> the chief prophet of the gods;<br> 11. in combat they joined; they met in battle.<br> 12. And the lord outspread his snare (and) enclosed her.<br> 13. He sent before him the evil wind to seize (her) from behind.<br> 14. And <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> opened her mouth to swallow it.<br> 15. He made the evil wind enter so that she could not close her lips.<br> 16. The violence of the winds tortured her stomach, and<br> 17. her heart was prostrated and her mouth was twisted.<br> 18. He swung the club, he shattered her stomach;<br> 19. he cut out her entrails; he overmastered (her) heart;<br> 20. he bound her and ended her life.<br> 21. He threw down her corpse; he stood upon it.<br> 22. When <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> who marched before (them) was conquered,<br> 23. he dispersed her forces, her host was overthrown,<br> 24. and the gods her allies who marched beside her<br> 25. trembled (and) feared (and) turned their backs.<br> 26. They escaped and saved their lives.<br> 2 7. They clung to one another fleeing helplessly.<br> 28. He followed them and shattered their weapons.<br> 29. He cast his snare and they are caught in his net.<br> 30. Knowing (?) the regions they are filled with grief.<br> 31. They bear their sin, they are kept in bondage,<br> 32. and the elevenfold offspring are troubled through fear.<br> 33. The spirits as they march <i>perceived</i> (?) the glory (of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span>).<br> 34. His hand lays blindness (on their eyes).<br> 35. At the same time their opposition (is broken) from under them;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. and the god <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kingu</span> who had (marshalled) their (forces)<br> 37. he bound him also along with the god of the tablets (of destiny in) his right hand.<br> 38. And he took from him the tablets of destiny (that were) upon him.<br> 39. With the string of the stylus he sealed (them) and held the … of the tablet.<br> 40. From the time when he had bound (and) laid the yoke on his foes<br> 41. he led the illustrious enemy captive like an ox,<br> 42. he established fully the victory of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">An-sar</span> <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">1</font></a> over the foe;<br> 43. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span> overcame the lamentation of (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ea</span>) the lord of the world.<br> 44. Over the gods in bondage he strengthened his watch, and<br> 45. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span> whom he had bound he turned head backwards;<br> 46. then the lord trampled on the underpart of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span>.<br> 47. With his club unbound he smote (her) skull;<br> 48. he broke (it) and caused her blood to flow;<br> 49. the north wind bore (it) away to secret places. <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> 50. Then his father (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ea</span>) beheld (and) rejoiced at the savour;<br> 51. he caused the <i>spirits</i> (?) to bring a peace-offering to himself.</p>

 <p>52. So the lord rested; his body he feeds.<br> 53. He strengthens (his) <i>mind</i> (?), he forms a clever plan,<br> 54. and he stripped her of (her) skin like a fish, according to his plan;<br> 55. he described her likeness and (with it) overshadowed the heavens;<br> 56. he stretched out the skin, he kept a watch,<br> 57. he urged on her waters that were not issuing forth;<br> 58. he lit up the sky; the sanctuary (of heaven) rejoiced, and<br> 59. he presented himself before the deep, the seat of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ea</span>.<br> 60. Then the lord measured (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiamat</span>) the offspring of the deep;<br> 61. the chief prophet made of her <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">1</font></a> image the house of the Firmament. <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> 62. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ê-sarra</span> which he had created (to be) the heavens<br> 63. the chief prophet caused <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anu</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bel</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ea</span> to inhabit as their stronghold.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_270"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_272">136:1</a> These are the last two lines of the Third Tablet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_271"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_273">136:2</a> <i>’Sigar</i>. In W.A.I., v. I, 12, we read that the 12th of Iyyar was the <i>’sigar</i> or "festival" of the goddess Gula.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_272"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_274">136:3</a> Literally "the covering of heaven" (<i>nalbas same</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_273"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_275">136:4</a> Literally "may they open."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_274"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_276">137:1</a> Literally "pour out."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_275"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_277">137:2</a> The "saying," or "Word," is regarded as having a real existence which could be created, destroyed, and re-created by Merodach. The "Word" is similarly personified in Zech. ix. 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_276"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_278">137:3</a> We have here the same idea as in the "burden" of the Hebrew prophets, the Assyrian verb "to lift up" being <i>nasu</i>, the Hebrew <i>nasâ</i>, whence <i>massâ</i>, "a burden" or "oracle."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_277"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_279">137:4</a> The <i>badhdhu</i> was the name of the weapon sacred to Merodach. From the sculptures it would appear to have been a kind of boomerang.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_278"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_280">138:1</a> Here we have a curiously weakened form, <i>kisti</i> instead of <i>qasti</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_279"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_281">138:2</a> Or if we correct the text and read <i>makhri la galidta</i>, "that fears not a rival."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_280"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_282">139:1</a> Read <i>ip-qid</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_281"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_283">141:1</a> The primæval god of the Firmament.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_282"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_284">141:2</a> The meaning of the blood of Tiamat is shown by the two contradictory Babylonian legends of the creation which Berôssos, the Chaldean historian, has amalgamated together:—"Bêlos (Merodach) came and cut the woman (Tiamat) asunder, and of one half of her he formed the earth, and of the other half the heavens, and at the same time destroyed the animals within her (in the abyss). All this was an allegorical description of nature. For, the whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being continually generated therein, the deity above mentioned (Bêlos) cut off his own head; upon which the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with the earth, and from thence men were formed. On this account it is that they are rational and partake of divine knowledge." Similarly, according to Philon Byblios, Phœnician cosmology declared that the blood of Uranos or Baal-samaim, when mutilated by his son Kronos near the rivers and fountains, flowed into them and fertilised the earth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_285">142:1</a> "Its" in the original.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_286">142:2</a> Ê-Sarra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="rp20133.htm#fr_287">142:3</a> Ê-Zida, "the constituted house," was the great temple of Nebo in Borsippa, now represented by the Birs-i-Nimrud. The copy of the text deposited in it by Nahid-Merodach was probably made in the Persian age.</p>
