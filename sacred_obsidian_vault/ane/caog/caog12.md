 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/13701.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table> COMBINED with these stories of the gods, traditions of the early history of man, and accounts of the Creation, are fragments of a series in which the various animals speak and act. I call these tablets "Fables" to distinguish them from the others, but, as many of the others are equally fabulous and very similar in style, the name must not be taken to imply any distinctive character in this direction. It is probable that all these stories even in Babylonia were equally believed in by the devout and the ignorant, treated as allegories  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p>by the poets, and repudiated as fabulous by the learned. In the "Fables" or stories in which animals play prominent parts, each creature is endowed with the power of speech, and this idea was common even in that day in the whole of Western Asia and Egypt, it is found in various Egyptian stories, it occurs in Genesis, where we have a speaking serpent, in Numbers where Balaam's ass reproves his master, and in the stories of Jotham and Joash, where the trees are made to speak; again in the Izdubar legends, where the trees answer Heabani.</p>  
 <p>These legends so far as I have discovered are four in number.</p>  
 <p>The first contained at least four tablets each having four columns of writing. Two of the acting animals in it are the eagle and the serpent.</p>  
 <p>The second is similar in character, the leading animal being the fox or jackal, there are only four fragments, and I have no evidence as to the number of tablets; this may belong to the same series as the fable of the eagle.</p>  
 <p>The third is a single tablet with two columns of writing, it is a discussion between the horse and ox.</p>  
 <p>The fourth is a single fragment in which a calf speaks, but there is nothing to show the nature of the story.</p>  
 <p align="center">I. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Story of the Eagle</span>.</p>  
 <p>This story appears to be the longest and most curious of these legends, but the very mutilated condition of the various fragments gives as usual</p>  
 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>considerable difficulty in attempting an explanation. One of the actors in the story is an ancient monarch named Etana who is mentioned as already dead, and as being an inhabitant of the infernal regions in the time of Izdubar.</p>  
 <p>I am unable to ascertain the order of the fragments of these legends and must translate them as they come.</p>

 <p>The next fragment, K 2606, is curious, as containing an account of some early legendary story in Babylonian history. This tablet formed the third in the series, and from it we gain part of the title of the tablets.</p>

 <p>3. The eagle his mouth opened and to Shamas his lord he spake</p>  
 <p>The next fragment is a small portion probably of the fourth tablet.</p>  
 <p>1. The eagle his mouth opened . . . .</p>  
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></a></p>

 <p>11. Etana his mouth opened and . . . .</p>  
 <p>12. speech? . . . . he . . . .</p>  
 <p>Such are the principal fragments of this curious legend. According to the fragment K 2527, the serpent had committed some sin for which it was condemned by the god Shamas to be eaten by the eagle; but the eagle declined the repast.</p>  
 <p>After this, some one, whose name is lost, baits a trap for the eagle, and the bird going to get the meat, falls into the trap and is caught. Now the eagle is left, until dying for want of food it is glad to eat the serpent, which it takes and tares open. The other birds then take offence, and desire that the eagle should be excluded from their ranks.</p>  
 <p>The other fragments concern the building of some city, Etana being king, and in these relations the eagle again appears, there are seven spirits or angels principal actors in the matter, but the whole story is obscure at present, and a connected plot cannot be made out.</p>  
 <p>This fable has evidently some direct connection</p>  
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the mythical history of Babylonia, for Etana is mentioned as an ancient Babylonian monarch in the Izdubar legends. His memory was cherished as belonging to one of the terrible monarchs who were inhabiting Hades, probably on account of their deeds.</p>  
 <p align="center">II. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Story of the Fox</span>.</p>  
 <p>The next fable, that of the fox, is perhaps part of the same story, the fragments are so disconnected that they must be given without any attempt at arrangement.</p>

 <p>15. The fox on hearing this, bowed his head in the presence of Shamas and wept.</p>  
 <p>16. To the powerful presence of Shamas he went in his tears:</p>

 <p>5. . . . fox in the forest . . . .</p>  
 <p>The last fragment is a small scrap, at the end of which the fox petitions Shamas to spare him.</p>  
 <p>The incidental allusions in these fragments show that the fox or jackal was even then considered cunning, and the animal in the story was evidently a watery specimen, as he brings tears to his assistance whenever anything is to be gained by it. He had offended Shamas by some means and the god sentenced him to death, a sentence which he escaped through powerful pleading on his own behalf.</p>  
 <p align="center">III. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fable of the Horse and Ox</span>.</p>  
 <p>The next fable, that of the horse and the ox, is a single tablet with only two columns of text. The date of the tablet is in the reign of Assurbanipal, and there is no statement that it is copied from an earlier text. There are altogether four portions of the text, but only one is perfect enough to be worth translating. This largest fragment, K 3456, contains about one third of the story.</p>  
 <p align="center">K 3456.</p>

 <p>14. they rejoiced their . . . . over the friendship,</p>  
 <p>15. they consorted and pleased their hearts, and were prosperous.</p>  
 <p>16. The ox opened his mouth, and spake and said to the horse glorious in war:</p>  
 <p>17. I am pondering now upon the good fortune at my hand.</p>  
 <p>18. From the beginning of the year to the end of the year I ponder at my appearance.</p>  
 <p>19. He destroyed abundance of food, he dried up rivers of waters,</p>  
 <p>20. in the flowers he rolled, a carpet he made,</p>

 <p></p><hr width="50%">  
 <p>Here the ox gives a good picture of his state and enjoyment, and looks with contempt on the horse because he is tamed.</p>  
 <p>After this comes a speech from the horse to the bull, the rest of the tablet being occupied by speeches and answers between the two animals. Most of these speeches are lost or only present in small fragments, and the story recommences on the reverse with the end of a speech from the horse.</p>

 <p align="center">(Colophon)</p>  
 <p>Palace of Assurbanipal, king of nations, king . . .</p>  
 <p>It appears from these fragments that the story described a time when the animals associated together, and the ox and horse fell into a friendly conversation. The ox, commencing the discussion, praised himself; the answer of the horse is lost, but where the story recommences it appears that the ox objects to the horse drawing the chariot from which he (the ox) is hunted, and the horse ultimately offers to tell the ox a story, the ox choosing the story called "When the noble Ishtar ", probably some story of the same character as Ishtar's descent into Hades.</p>  
 <p>It is uncertain if any other tablet followed this; it is, however, probable that there was one containing the story told by the horse. Although there is no indication to show the date of this fable, I should think, by the style and matter, it belonged to about the same date as the other writings given in this volume. The loss of the tablet containing the story of Ishtar, told by the horse to the ox, is unfortunate.
