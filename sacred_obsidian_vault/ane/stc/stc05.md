 <p>(109) "[...] thy father</p>  
 <p>(110) "Thou art my son, who maketh merciful his heart.</p>  
 <p>(111) " [...] to the battle shalt thou draw nigh,</p>  
 <p>(112) "[...] he that shall behold thee shall have peace."</p>  
 <p>(113) And the lord rejoiced at the word of his father,</p>  
 <p>(114) And he drew nigh and stood before An<u>sh</u>ar.</p>  
 <p>(115) An<u>sh</u>ar beheld him and his heart was filled with joy,</p>
