 Containing his Death: and the Coronation of King Henry the Fift
 
 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
 
 INDVCTION.
 
 Enter Rumour.
 
 
 Open your Eares: For which of you will stop
 The vent of Hearing, when loud Rumor speakes?
 I, from the Orient, to the drooping West
 (Making the winde my Post-horse) still vnfold
 The Acts commenced on this Ball of Earth.
 Vpon my Tongue, continuall Slanders ride,
 The which, in euery Language, I pronounce,
 Stuffing the Eares of them with false Reports:
 I speake of Peace, while couert Enmitie
 (Vnder the smile of Safety) wounds the World:
 And who but Rumour, who but onely I
 Make fearfull Musters, and prepar'd Defence,
 Whil'st the bigge yeare, swolne with some other griefes,
 Is thought with childe, by the sterne Tyrant, Warre,
 And no such matter? Rumour, is a Pipe
 Blowne by Surmises, Ielousies, Coniectures;
 And of so easie, and so plaine a stop,
 That the blunt Monster, with vncounted heads,
 The still discordant, wauering Multitude,
 Can play vpon it. But what neede I thus
 My well-knowne Body to Anathomize
 Among my houshold? Why is Rumour heere?
 I run before King Harries victory,
 Who in a bloodie field by Shrewsburie
 Hath beaten downe yong Hotspurre, and his Troopes,
 Quenching the flame of bold Rebellion,
 Euen with the Rebels blood. But what meane I
 To speake so true at first? My Office is
 To noyse abroad, that Harry Monmouth fell
 Vnder the Wrath of Noble Hotspurres Sword:
 And that the King, before the Dowglas Rage
 Stoop'd his Annointed head, as low as death.
 This haue I rumour'd through the peasant-Townes,
 Betweene the Royall Field of Shrewsburie,
 And this Worme-eaten-Hole of ragged Stone,
 Where Hotspurres Father, old Northumberland,
 Lyes crafty sicke. The Postes come tyring on,
 And not a man of them brings other newes
 Then they haue learn'd of Me. From Rumours Tongues,
 They bring smooth-Comforts-false, worse then True-wrongs.
 Enter.
 
 
 Scena Secunda.
 
 Enter Lord Bardolfe, and the Porter.
 
   L.Bar. Who keepes the Gate heere hoa?
 Where is the Earle?
   Por. What shall I say you are?
   Bar. Tell thou the Earle
 That the Lord Bardolfe doth attend him heere
 
    Por. His Lordship is walk'd forth into the Orchard,
 Please it your Honor, knocke but at the Gate,
 And he himselfe will answer.
 Enter Northumberland.
 
   L.Bar. Heere comes the Earle
 
    Nor. What newes Lord Bardolfe? Eu'ry minute now
 Should be the Father of some Stratagem;
 The Times are wilde: Contention (like a Horse
 Full of high Feeding) madly hath broke loose,
 And beares downe all before him
 
    L.Bar. Noble Earle,
 I bring you certaine newes from Shrewsbury
 
    Nor. Good, and heauen will
 
    L.Bar. As good as heart can wish:
 The King is almost wounded to the death:
 And in the Fortune of my Lord your Sonne,
 Prince Harrie slaine out-right: and both the Blunts
 Kill'd by the hand of Dowglas. Yong Prince Iohn,
 And Westmerland, and Stafford, fled the Field.
 And Harrie Monmouth's Brawne (the Hulke Sir Iohn)
 Is prisoner to your Sonne. O, such a Day,
 (So fought, so follow'd, and so fairely wonne)
 Came not, till now, to dignifie the Times
 Since Cæsars Fortunes
 
    Nor. How is this deriu'd?
 Saw you the Field? Came you from Shrewsbury?
   L.Bar. I spake with one (my L[ord].) that came fro[m] thence,
 A Gentleman well bred, and of good name,
 That freely render'd me these newes for true
 
    Nor. Heere comes my Seruant Trauers, whom I sent
 On Tuesday last, to listen after Newes.
 Enter Trauers.
 
   L.Bar. My Lord, I ouer-rod him on the way,
 And he is furnish'd with no certainties,
 More then he (haply) may retaile from me
 
    Nor. Now Trauers, what good tidings comes fro[m] you?
   Tra. My Lord, Sir Iohn Vmfreuill turn'd me backe
 With ioyfull tydings; and (being better hors'd)
 Out-rod me. After him, came spurring head
 A Gentleman (almost fore-spent with speed)
 That stopp'd by me, to breath his bloodied horse.
 He ask'd the way to Chester: And of him
 I did demand what Newes from Shrewsbury:
 He told me, that Rebellion had ill lucke,
 And that yong Harry Percies Spurre was cold.
 With that he gaue his able Horse the head,
 And bending forwards strooke his able heeles
 Against the panting sides of his poore Iade
 Vp to the Rowell head, and starting so,
 He seem'd in running, to deuoure the way,
 Staying no longer question
 
    North. Ha? Againe:
 Said he yong Harrie Percyes Spurre was cold?
 (Of Hot-Spurre, cold-Spurre?) that Rebellion,
 Had met ill lucke?
   L.Bar. My Lord: Ile tell you what,
 If my yong Lord your Sonne, haue not the day,
 Vpon mine Honor, for a silken point
 Ile giue my Barony. Neuer talke of it
 
    Nor. Why should the Gentleman that rode by Trauers
 Giue then such instances of Losse?
   L.Bar. Who, he?
 He was some hielding Fellow, that had stolne
 The Horse he rode-on: and vpon my life
 Speake at aduenture. Looke, here comes more Newes.
 Enter Morton.
 
   Nor. Yea, this mans brow, like to a Title-leafe,
 Fore-tels the Nature of a Tragicke Volume:
 So lookes the Strond, when the Imperious Flood
 Hath left a witnest Vsurpation.
 Say Morton, did'st thou come from Shrewsbury?
   Mor. I ran from Shrewsbury (my Noble Lord)
 Where hatefull death put on his vgliest Maske
 To fright our party
 
    North. How doth my Sonne, and Brother?
 Thou trembl'st; and the whitenesse in thy Cheeke
 Is apter then thy Tongue, to tell thy Errand.
 Euen such a man, so faint, so spiritlesse,
 So dull, so dead in looke, so woe-be-gone,
 Drew Priams Curtaine, in the dead of night,
 And would haue told him, Halfe his Troy was burn'd.
 But Priam found the Fire, ere he his Tongue:
 And I, my Percies death, ere thou report'st it.
 This, thou would'st say: Your Sonne did thus, and thus:
 Your Brother, thus. So fought the Noble Dowglas,
 Stopping my greedy eare, with their bold deeds.
 But in the end (to stop mine Eare indeed)
 Thou hast a Sigh, to blow away this Praise,
 Ending with Brother, Sonne, and all are dead
 
    Mor. Dowglas is liuing, and your Brother, yet:
 But for my Lord, your Sonne
 
    North. Why, he is dead.
 See what a ready tongue Suspition hath:
 He that but feares the thing, he would not know,
 Hath by Instinct, knowledge from others Eyes,
 That what he feard, is chanc'd. Yet speake (Morton)
 Tell thou thy Earle, his Diuination Lies,
 And I will take it, as a sweet Disgrace,
 And make thee rich, for doing me such wrong
 
    Mor. You are too great, to be (by me) gainsaid:
 Your Spirit is too true, your Feares too certaine
 
    North. Yet for all this, say not that Percies dead.
 I see a strange Confession in thine Eye:
 Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it Feare, or Sinne,
 To speake a truth. If he be slaine, say so:
 The Tongue offends not, that reports his death:
 And he doth sinne that doth belye the dead:
 Not he, which sayes the dead is not aliue:
 Yet the first bringer of vnwelcome Newes
 Hath but a loosing Office: and his Tongue,
 Sounds euer after as a sullen Bell
 Remembred, knolling a departing Friend
 
    L.Bar. I cannot thinke (my Lord) your son is dead
 
    Mor. I am sorry, I should force you to beleeue
 That, which I would to heauen, I had not seene.
 But these mine eyes, saw him in bloody state,
 Rend'ring faint quittance (wearied, and out-breath'd)
 To Henrie Monmouth, whose swift wrath beate downe
 The neuer-daunted Percie to the earth,
 From whence (with life) he neuer more sprung vp.
 In few; his death (whose spirit lent a fire,
 Euen to the dullest Peazant in his Campe)
 Being bruited once, tooke fire and heate away
 From the best temper'd Courage in his Troopes.
 For from his Mettle, was his Party steel'd;
 Which once, in him abated, all the rest
 Turn'd on themselues, like dull and heauy Lead:
 And as the Thing, that's heauy in it selfe,
 Vpon enforcement, flyes with greatest speede,
 So did our Men, heauy in Hotspurres losse,
 Lend to this weight, such lightnesse with their Feare,
 That Arrowes fled not swifter toward their ayme,
 Then did our Soldiers (ayming at their safety)
 Fly from the field. Then was that Noble Worcester
 Too soone ta'ne prisoner: and that furious Scot,
 (The bloody Dowglas) whose well-labouring sword
 Had three times slaine th' appearance of the King,
 Gan vaile his stomacke, and did grace the shame
 Of those that turn'd their backes: and in his flight,
 Stumbling in Feare, was tooke. The summe of all,
 Is, that the King hath wonne: and hath sent out
 A speedy power, to encounter you my Lord,
 Vnder the Conduct of yong Lancaster
 And Westmerland. This is the Newes at full
 
    North. For this, I shall haue time enough to mourne.
 In Poyson, there is Physicke: and this newes
 (Hauing beene well) that would haue made me sicke,
 Being sicke, haue in some measure, made me well.
 And as the Wretch, whose Feauer-weakned ioynts,
 Like strengthlesse Hindges, buckle vnder life,
 Impatient of his Fit, breakes like a fire
 Out of his keepers armes: Euen so, my Limbes
 (Weak'ned with greefe) being now inrag'd with greefe,
 Are thrice themselues. Hence therefore thou nice crutch,
 A scalie Gauntlet now, with ioynts of Steele
 Must gloue this hand. And hence thou sickly Quoife,
 Thou art a guard too wanton for the head,
 Which Princes, flesh'd with Conquest, ayme to hit.
 Now binde my Browes with Iron and approach
 The ragged'st houre, that Time and Spight dare bring
 To frowne vpon th' enrag'd Northumberland.
 Let Heauen kisse Earth: now let not Natures hand
 Keepe the wilde Flood confin'd: Let Order dye,
 And let the world no longer be a stage
 To feede Contention in a ling'ring Act:
 But let one spirit of the First-borne Caine
 Reigne in all bosomes, that each heart being set
 On bloody Courses, the rude Scene may end,
 And darknesse be the burier of the dead
 
    L.Bar. Sweet Earle, diuorce not wisedom from your Honor
 
    Mor. The liues of all your louing Complices
 Leane-on your health, the which if you giue-o're
 To stormy Passion, must perforce decay.
 You cast th' euent of Warre (my Noble Lord)
 And summ'd the accompt of Chance, before you said
 Let vs make head: It was your presurmize,
 That in the dole of blowes, your Son might drop.
 You knew he walk'd o're perils, on an edge
 More likely to fall in, then to get o're:
 You were aduis'd his flesh was capeable
 Of Wounds, and Scarres; and that his forward Spirit
 Would lift him, where most trade of danger rang'd,
 Yet did you say go forth: and none of this
 (Though strongly apprehended) could restraine
 The stiffe-borne Action: What hath then befalne?
 Or what hath this bold enterprize bring forth,
 More then that Being, which was like to be?
   L.Bar. We all that are engaged to this losse,
 Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous Seas,
 That if we wrought out life, was ten to one:
 And yet we ventur'd for the gaine propos'd,
 Choak'd the respect of likely perill fear'd,
 And since we are o're-set, venture againe.
 Come, we will all put forth; Body, and Goods,
   Mor. 'Tis more then time: And (my most Noble Lord)
 I heare for certaine, and do speake the truth:
 The gentle Arch-bishop of Yorke is vp
 With well appointed Powres: he is a man
 Who with a double Surety bindes his Followers.
 My Lord (your Sonne) had onely but the Corpes,
 But shadowes, and the shewes of men to fight.
 For that same word (Rebellion) did diuide
 The action of their bodies, from their soules,
 And they did fight with queasinesse, constrain'd
 As men drinke Potions; that their Weapons only
 Seem'd on our side: but for their Spirits and Soules,
 This word (Rebellion) it had froze them vp,
 As Fish are in a Pond. But now the Bishop
 Turnes Insurrection to Religion,
 Suppos'd sincere, and holy in his Thoughts:
 He's follow'd both with Body, and with Minde:
 And doth enlarge his Rising, with the blood
 Of faire King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones,
 Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cause:
 Tels them, he doth bestride a bleeding Land,
 Gasping for life, vnder great Bullingbrooke,
 And more, and lesse, do flocke to follow him
 
    North. I knew of this before. But to speake truth,
 This present greefe had wip'd it from my minde.
 Go in with me, and councell euery man
 The aptest way for safety, and reuenge:
 Get Posts, and Letters, and make Friends with speed,
 Neuer so few, nor neuer yet more need.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Scena Tertia.
 
 Enter Falstaffe, and Page.
 
   Fal. Sirra, you giant, what saies the Doct[or]. to my water?
   Pag. He said sir, the water it selfe was a good healthy
 water: but for the party that ow'd it, he might haue more
 diseases then he knew for
 
    Fal. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at mee: the
 braine of this foolish compounded Clay-man, is not able
 to inuent any thing that tends to laughter, more then I
 inuent, or is inuented on me. I am not onely witty in my
 selfe, but the cause that wit is in other men. I doe heere
 walke before thee, like a Sow, that hath o'rewhelm'd all
 her Litter, but one. If the Prince put thee into my Seruice
 for any other reason, then to set mee off, why then I
 haue no iudgement. Thou horson Mandrake, thou art
 fitter to be worne in my cap, then to wait at my heeles. I
 was neuer mann'd with an Agot till now: but I will sette
 you neyther in Gold, nor Siluer, but in vilde apparell, and
 send you backe againe to your Master, for a Iewell. The
 Iuuenall (the Prince your Master) whose Chin is not yet
 fledg'd, I will sooner haue a beard grow in the Palme of
 my hand, then he shall get one on his cheeke: yet he will
 not sticke to say, his Face is a Face-Royall. Heauen may
 finish it when he will, it is not a haire amisse yet: he may
 keepe it still at a Face-Royall, for a Barber shall neuer
 earne six pence out of it; and yet he will be crowing, as if
 he had writ man euer since his Father was a Batchellour.
 He may keepe his owne Grace, but he is almost out of
 mine, I can assure him. What said M[aster]. Dombledon, about
 the Satten for my short Cloake, and Slops?
   Pag. He said sir, you should procure him better Assurance,
 then Bardolfe: he wold not take his Bond &amp; yours,
 he lik'd not the Security
 
    Fal. Let him bee damn'd like the Glutton, may his
 Tongue be hotter, a horson Achitophel; a
 Rascally-yea-forsooth-knaue,
 to beare a Gentleman in hand, and then
 stand vpon Security? The horson smooth-pates doe now
 weare nothing but high shoes, and bunches of Keyes at
 their girdles: and if a man is through with them in honest
 Taking-vp, then they must stand vpon Securitie: I
 had as liefe they would put Rats-bane in my mouth, as
 offer to stoppe it with Security. I look'd hee should haue
 sent me two and twenty yards of Satten (as I am true
 Knight) and he sends me Security. Well, he may sleep in
 Security, for he hath the horne of Abundance: and the
 lightnesse of his Wife shines through it, and yet cannot
 he see, though he haue his owne Lanthorne to light him.
 Where's Bardolfe?
   Pag. He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship
 a horse
 
    Fal. I bought him in Paules, and hee'l buy mee a horse
 in Smithfield. If I could get mee a wife in the Stewes, I
 were Mann'd, Hors'd, and Wiu'd.
 Enter Chiefe Iustice, and Seruant.
 
   Pag. Sir, heere comes the Nobleman that committed
 the Prince for striking him, about Bardolfe
 
    Fal. Wait close, I will not see him
 
    Ch.Iust. What's he that goes there?
   Ser. Falstaffe, and't please your Lordship
 
    Iust. He that was in question for the Robbery?
   Ser. He my Lord, but he hath since done good seruice
 at Shrewsbury: and (as I heare) is now going with some
 Charge, to the Lord Iohn of Lancaster
 
    Iust. What to Yorke? Call him backe againe
 
    Ser. Sir Iohn Falstaffe
 
    Fal. Boy, tell him, I am deafe
 
    Pag. You must speake lowder, my Master is deafe
 
    Iust. I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
 Go plucke him by the Elbow, I must speake with him
 
    Ser. Sir Iohn
 
    Fal. What? a yong knaue and beg? Is there not wars? Is
 there not imployment? Doth not the K[ing]. lack subiects? Do
 not the Rebels want Soldiers? Though it be a shame to be
 on any side but one, it is worse shame to begge, then to
 be on the worst side, were it worse then the name of Rebellion
 can tell how to make it
 
    Ser. You mistake me Sir
 
    Fal. Why sir? Did I say you were an honest man? Setting
 my Knight-hood, and my Souldiership aside, I had
 lyed in my throat, if I had said so
 
    Ser. I pray you (Sir) then set your Knighthood and
 your Souldier-ship aside, and giue mee leaue to tell you,
 you lye in your throat, if you say I am any other then an
 honest man
 
    Fal. I giue thee leaue to tell me so? I lay a-side that
 which growes to me? If thou get'st any leaue of me, hang
 me: if thou tak'st leaue, thou wer't better be hang'd: you
 Hunt-counter, hence: Auant
 
    Ser. Sir, my Lord would speake with you
 
    Iust. Sir Iohn Falstaffe, a word with you
 
    Fal. My good Lord: giue your Lordship good time of
 the day. I am glad to see your Lordship abroad: I heard
 say your Lordship was sicke. I hope your Lordship goes
 abroad by aduise. Your Lordship (though not clean past
 your youth) hath yet some smack of age in you: some rellish
 of the saltnesse of Time, and I most humbly beseech
 your Lordship, to haue a reuerend care of your health
 
    Iust. Sir Iohn, I sent you before your Expedition, to
 Shrewsburie
 
    Fal. If it please your Lordship, I heare his Maiestie is
 return'd with some discomfort from Wales
 
    Iust. I talke not of his Maiesty: you would not come
 when I sent for you?
   Fal. And I heare moreouer, his Highnesse is falne into
 this same whorson Apoplexie
 
    Iust. Well, heauen mend him. I pray let me speak with you
 
    Fal. This Apoplexie is (as I take it) a kind of Lethargie,
 a sleeping of the blood, a horson Tingling
 
    Iust. What tell you me of it? be it as it is
 
    Fal. It hath it originall from much greefe; from study
 and perturbation of the braine. I haue read the cause of
 his effects in Galen. It is a kinde of deafenesse
 
    Iust. I thinke you are falne into the disease: For you
 heare not what I say to you
 
    Fal. Very well (my Lord) very well: rather an't please
 you) it is the disease of not Listning, the malady of not
 Marking, that I am troubled withall
 
    Iust. To punish you by the heeles, would amend the
 attention of your eares, &amp; I care not if I be your Physitian
   Fal. I am as poore as Iob, my Lord; but not so Patient:
 your Lordship may minister the Potion of imprisonment
 to me, in respect of Pouertie: but how I should bee your
 Patient, to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make
 some dram of a scruple, or indeede, a scruple it selfe
 
    Iust. I sent for you (when there were matters against
 you for your life) to come speake with me
 
    Fal. As I was then aduised by my learned Councel, in
 the lawes of this Land-seruice, I did not come
 
    Iust. Wel, the truth is (sir Iohn) you liue in great infamy
   Fal. He that buckles him in my belt, ca[n]not liue in lesse
 
    Iust. Your Meanes is very slender, and your wast great
 
    Fal. I would it were otherwise: I would my Meanes
 were greater, and my waste slenderer
 
    Iust. You haue misled the youthfull Prince
 
    Fal. The yong Prince hath misled mee. I am the Fellow
 with the great belly, and he my Dogge
 
    Iust. Well, I am loth to gall a new-heal'd wound: your
 daies seruice at Shrewsbury, hath a little gilded ouer
 your Nights exploit on Gads-hill. You may thanke the
 vnquiet time, for your quiet o're-posting that Action
 
    Fal. My Lord?
   Iust. But since all is wel, keep it so: wake not a sleeping Wolfe
 
    Fal. To wake a Wolfe, is as bad as to smell a Fox
 
    Iu. What? you are as a candle, the better part burnt out
   Fal. A Wassell-Candle, my Lord; all Tallow: if I did
 say of wax, my growth would approue the truth
 
    Iust. There is not a white haire on your face, but shold
 haue his effect of grauity
 
    Fal. His effect of grauy, grauy, grauy
 
    Iust. You follow the yong Prince vp and downe, like
 his euill Angell
 
    Fal. Not so (my Lord) your ill Angell is light: but I
 hope, he that lookes vpon mee, will take mee without,
 weighing: and yet, in some respects I grant, I cannot go:
 I cannot tell. Vertue is of so little regard in these Costormongers,
 that true valor is turn'd Beare-heard. Pregnancie
 is made a Tapster, and hath his quicke wit wasted in
 giuing Recknings: all the other gifts appertinent to man
 (as the malice of this Age shapes them) are not woorth a
 Gooseberry. You that are old, consider not the capacities
 of vs that are yong: you measure the heat of our Liuers,
 with the bitternes of your gals: &amp; we that are in the
 vaward of our youth, I must confesse, are wagges too
 
    Iust. Do you set downe your name in the scrowle of
 youth, that are written downe old, with all the Charracters
 of age? Haue you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yellow
 cheeke? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an incresing
 belly? Is not your voice broken? your winde short? your
 wit single? and euery part about you blasted with Antiquity?
 and wil you cal your selfe yong? Fy, fy, fy, sir Iohn
 
    Fal. My Lord, I was borne with a white head, &amp; somthing
 a round belly. For my voice, I haue lost it with hallowing
 and singing of Anthemes. To approue my youth
 farther, I will not: the truth is, I am onely olde in iudgement
 and vnderstanding: and he that will caper with mee
 for a thousand Markes, let him lend me the mony, &amp; haue
 at him. For the boxe of th' eare that the Prince gaue you,
 he gaue it like a rude Prince, and you tooke it like a sensible
 Lord. I haue checkt him for it, and the yong Lion repents:
 Marry not in ashes and sacke-cloath, but in new
 Silke, and old Sacke
 
    Iust. Wel, heauen send the Prince a better companion
 
    Fal. Heauen send the Companion a better Prince: I
 cannot rid my hands of him
 
    Iust. Well, the King hath seuer'd you and Prince Harry,
 I heare you are going with Lord Iohn of Lancaster, against
 the Archbishop, and the Earle of Northumberland
   Fal. Yes, I thanke your pretty sweet wit for it: but
 looke you pray, (all you that kisse my Ladie Peace, at
 home) that our Armies ioyn not in a hot day: for if I take
 but two shirts out with me, and I meane not to sweat
 extraordinarily:
 if it bee a hot day, if I brandish any thing
 but my Bottle, would I might neuer spit white againe:
 There is not a daungerous Action can peepe out his head,
 but I am thrust vpon it. Well, I cannot last euer
 
    Iust. Well, be honest, be honest, and heauen blesse your
 Expedition
 
    Fal. Will your Lordship lend mee a thousand pound,
 to furnish me forth?
   Iust. Not a peny, not a peny: you are too impatient
 to beare crosses. Fare you well. Commend mee to my
 Cosin Westmerland
 
    Fal. If I do, fillop me with a three-man-Beetle. A man
 can no more separate Age and Couetousnesse, then he can
 part yong limbes and letchery: but the Gowt galles the
 one, and the pox pinches the other; and so both the Degrees
 preuent my curses. Boy?
   Page. Sir
 
    Fal. What money is in my purse?
   Page. Seuen groats, and two pence
 
    Fal. I can get no remedy against this Consumption of
 the purse. Borrowing onely lingers, and lingers it out,
 but the disease is incureable. Go beare this letter to my
 Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earle of
 Westmerland, and this to old Mistris Vrsula, whome I
 haue weekly sworne to marry, since I perceiu'd the first
 white haire on my chin. About it: you know where to
 finde me. A pox of this Gowt, or a Gowt of this Poxe:
 for the one or th' other playes the rogue with my great
 toe: It is no matter, if I do halt, I haue the warres for my
 colour, and my Pension shall seeme the more reasonable.
 A good wit will make vse of any thing: I will turne diseases
 to commodity.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Scena Quarta.
 
 Enter Archbishop, Hastings, Mowbray, and Lord Bardolfe.
 
   Ar. Thus haue you heard our causes, &amp; kno our Means:
 And my most noble Friends, I pray you all
 Speake plainly your opinions of our hopes,
 And first (Lord Marshall) what say you to it?
   Mow. I well allow the occasion of our Armes,
 But gladly would be better satisfied,
 How (in our Meanes) we should aduance our selues
 To looke with forhead bold and big enough
 Vpon the Power and puisance of the King
 
    Hast. Our present Musters grow vpon the File
 To fiue and twenty thousand men of choice:
 And our Supplies, liue largely in the hope
 Of great Northumberland, whose bosome burnes
 With an incensed Fire of Iniuries
 
    L.Bar. The question then (Lord Hastings) standeth thus
 Whether our present fiue and twenty thousand
 May hold-vp-head, without Northumberland:
   Hast. With him, we may
 
    L.Bar. I marry, there's the point:
 But if without him we be thought to feeble,
 My iudgement is, we should not step too farre
 Till we had his Assistance by the hand.
 For in a Theame so bloody fac'd, as this,
 Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise
 Of Aydes incertaine, should not be admitted
 
    Arch. 'Tis very true Lord Bardolfe, for indeed
 It was yong Hotspurres case, at Shrewsbury
 
    L.Bar. It was (my Lord) who lin'd himself with hope,
 Eating the ayre, on promise of Supply,
 Flatt'ring himselfe with Proiect of a power,
 Much smaller, then the smallest of his Thoughts,
 And so with great imagination
 (Proper to mad men) led his Powers to death,
 And (winking) leap'd into destruction
 
    Hast. But (by your leaue) it neuer yet did hurt,
 To lay downe likely-hoods, and formes of hope
 
    L.Bar. Yes, if this present quality of warre,
 Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot,
 Liues so in hope: As in an early Spring,
 We see th' appearing buds, which to proue fruite,
 Hope giues not so much warrant, as Dispaire
 That Frosts will bite them. When we meane to build,
 We first suruey the Plot, then draw the Modell,
 And when we see the figure of the house,
 Then must we rate the cost of the Erection,
 Which if we finde out-weighes Ability,
 What do we then, but draw a-new the Modell
 In fewer offices? Or at least, desist
 To builde at all? Much more, in this great worke,
 (Which is (almost) to plucke a Kingdome downe,
 And set another vp) should we suruey
 The plot of Situation, and the Modell;
 Consent vpon a sure Foundation:
 Question Surueyors, know our owne estate,
 How able such a Worke to vndergo,
 To weigh against his Opposite? Or else,
 We fortifie in Paper, and in Figures,
 Vsing the Names of men, instead of men:
 Like one, that drawes the Modell of a house
 Beyond his power to builde it; who (halfe through)
 Giues o're, and leaues his part-created Cost
 A naked subiect to the Weeping Clouds,
 And waste, for churlish Winters tyranny
 
    Hast. Grant that our hopes (yet likely of faire byrth)
 Should be still-borne: and that we now possest
 The vtmost man of expectation:
 I thinke we are a Body strong enough
 (Euen as we are) to equall with the King
 
    L.Bar. What is the King but fiue &amp; twenty thousand?
   Hast. To vs no more: nay not so much Lord Bardolf.
 For0his diuisions (as the Times do braul)
 Are in three Heads: one Power against the French,
 And one against Glendower: Perforce a third
 Must take vp vs: So is the vnfirme King
 In three diuided: and his Coffers sound
 With hollow Pouerty, and Emptinesse
 
    Ar. That he should draw his seuerall strengths togither
 And come against vs in full puissance
 Need not be dreaded
 
    Hast. If he should do so,
 He leaues his backe vnarm'd, the French, and Welch
 Baying him at the heeles: neuer feare that
 
    L.Bar. Who is it like should lead his Forces hither?
   Hast. The Duke of Lancaster, and Westmerland:
 Against the Welsh himselfe, and Harrie Monmouth.
 But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
 I haue no certaine notice
 
    Arch. Let vs on:
 And publish the occasion of our Armes.
 The Common-wealth is sicke of their owne Choice,
 Their ouer-greedy loue hath surfetted:
 An habitation giddy, and vnsure
 Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
 O thou fond Many, with what loud applause
 Did'st thou beate heauen with blessing Bullingbrooke,
 Before he was, what thou would'st haue him be?
 And being now trimm'd in thine owne desires,
 Thou (beastly Feeder) art so full of him,
 That thou prouok'st thy selfe to cast him vp.
 So, so, (thou common Dogge) did'st thou disgorge
 Thy glutton-bosome of the Royall Richard,
 And now thou would'st eate thy dead vomit vp,
 And howl'st to finde it. What trust is in these Times?
 They, that when Richard liu'd, would haue him dye,
 Are now become enamour'd on his graue.
 Thou that threw'st dust vpon his goodly head
 When through proud London he came sighing on,
 After th' admired heeles of Bullingbrooke,
 Cri'st now, O Earth, yeeld vs that King againe,
 And take thou this (O thoughts of men accurs'd)
 ``Past, and to Come, seemes best; things Present, worst
 
    Mow. Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?
   Hast. We are Times subiects, and Time bids, be gon.
 
 Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima.
 
 Enter Hostesse, with two Officers, Fang, and Snare.
 
   Hostesse. Mr. Fang, haue you entred the Action?
   Fang. It is enter'd
 
    Hostesse. Wher's your Yeoman? Is it a lusty yeoman?
 Will he stand to it?
   Fang. Sirrah, where's Snare?
   Hostesse. I, I, good M[aster]. Snare
 
    Snare. Heere, heere
 
    Fang. Snare, we must Arrest Sir Iohn Falstaffe
 
    Host. I good M[aster]. Snare, I haue enter'd him, and all
 
    Sn. It may chance cost some of vs our liues: he wil stab
   Hostesse. Alas the day: take heed of him: he stabd me
 in mine owne house, and that most beastly: he cares not
 what mischeefe he doth, if his weapon be out. Hee will
 foyne like any diuell, he will spare neither man, woman,
 nor childe
 
    Fang. If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust
 
    Hostesse. No, nor I neither: Ile be at your elbow
 
    Fang. If I but fist him once: if he come but within my
 Vice
 
    Host. I am vndone with his going: I warrant he is an
 infinitiue thing vpon my score. Good M[aster]. Fang hold him
 sure: good M[aster]. Snare let him not scape, he comes
 continuantly
 to Py-Corner (sauing your manhoods) to buy a saddle,
 and hee is indited to dinner to the Lubbars head in
 Lombardstreet, to M[aster]. Smoothes the Silkman. I pra' ye, since
 my Exion is enter'd, and my Case so openly known to the
 world, let him be brought in to his answer: A 100. Marke
 is a long one, for a poore lone woman to beare: &amp; I haue
 borne, and borne, and borne, and haue bin fub'd off, and
 fub'd-off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to
 be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, vnles
 a woman should be made an Asse and a Beast, to beare euery
 Knaues wrong.
 
 Enter Falstaffe and Bardolfe.
 
 Yonder he comes, and that arrant Malmesey-Nose Bardolfe
 with him. Do your Offices, do your offices: M[aster]. Fang, &amp;
 M[aster].
 Snare, do me, do me, do me your Offices
 
    Fal. How now? whose Mare's dead? what's the matter?
   Fang. Sir Iohn, I arrest you, at the suit of Mist. Quickly
 
    Falst. Away Varlets, draw Bardolfe: Cut me off the
 Villaines head: throw the Queane in the Channel
 
    Host. Throw me in the channell? Ile throw thee there.
 Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue. Murder, murder,
 O thou Hony-suckle villaine, wilt thou kill Gods officers,
 and the Kings? O thou hony-seed Rogue, thou art
 a honyseed, a Man-queller, and a woman-queller
 
    Falst. Keep them off, Bardolfe
 
    Fang. A rescu, a rescu
 
    Host. Good people bring a rescu. Thou wilt not? thou
 wilt not? Do, do thou Rogue: Do thou Hempseed
 
    Page. Away you Scullion, you Rampallian, you Fustillirian:
 Ile tucke your Catastrophe.
 Enter Ch. Iustice.
 
   Iust. What's the matter? Keepe the Peace here, hoa
 
    Host. Good my Lord be good to mee. I beseech you
 stand to me
 
    Ch.Iust. How now sir Iohn? What are you brauling here?
 Doth this become your place, your time, and businesse?
 You should haue bene well on your way to Yorke.
 Stand from him Fellow; wherefore hang'st vpon him?
   Host. Oh my most worshipfull Lord, and't please your
 Grace, I am a poore widdow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested
 at my suit
 
    Ch.Iust. For what summe?
   Host. It is more then for some (my Lord) it is for all: all
 I haue, he hath eaten me out of house and home; hee hath
 put all my substance into that fat belly of his: but I will
 haue some of it out againe, or I will ride thee o' Nights,
 like the Mare
 
    Falst. I thinke I am as like to ride the Mare, if I haue
 any vantage of ground, to get vp
 
    Ch.Iust. How comes this, Sir Iohn? Fy, what a man of
 good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
 Are you not asham'd to inforce a poore Widdowe to so
 rough a course, to come by her owne?
   Falst. What is the grosse summe that I owe thee?
   Host. Marry (if thou wer't an honest man) thy selfe, &amp;
 the mony too. Thou didst sweare to mee vpon a parcell
 gilt Goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber at the round
 table, by a sea-cole fire, on Wednesday in Whitson week,
 when the Prince broke thy head for lik'ning him to a singing
 man of Windsor; Thou didst sweare to me then (as I
 was washing thy wound) to marry me, and make mee my
 Lady thy wife. Canst y deny it? Did not goodwife Keech
 the Butchers wife come in then, and cal me gossip Quickly?
 comming in to borrow a messe of Vinegar: telling vs,
 she had a good dish of Prawnes: whereby y didst desire to
 eat some: whereby I told thee they were ill for a greene
 wound? And didst not thou (when she was gone downe
 staires) desire me to be no more familiar with such poore
 people, saying, that ere long they should call me Madam?
 And did'st y not kisse me, and bid mee fetch thee 30.s? I
 put thee now to thy Book-oath, deny it if thou canst?
   Fal. My Lord, this is a poore mad soule: and she sayes
 vp &amp; downe the town, that her eldest son is like you. She
 hath bin in good case, &amp; the truth is, pouerty hath distracted
 her: but for these foolish Officers, I beseech you, I
 may haue redresse against them
 
    Iust. Sir Iohn, sir Iohn, I am well acquainted with your
 maner of wrenching the true cause, the false way. It is not
 a confident brow, nor the throng of wordes, that come
 with such (more then impudent) sawcines from you, can
 thrust me from a leuell consideration, I know you ha' practis'd
 vpon the easie-yeelding spirit of this woman
 
    Host. Yes in troth my Lord
 
    Iust. Prethee peace: pay her the debt you owe her, and
 vnpay the villany you haue done her: the one you may do
 with sterling mony, &amp; the other with currant repentance
 
    Fal. My Lord, I will not vndergo this sneape without
 reply. You call honorable Boldnes, impudent Sawcinesse:
 If a man wil curt'sie, and say nothing, he is vertuous: No,
 my Lord (your humble duty reme[m]bred) I will not be your
 sutor. I say to you, I desire deliu'rance from these Officers
 being vpon hasty employment in the Kings Affaires
 
    Iust. You speake, as hauing power to do wrong: But
 answer in the effect of your Reputation, and satisfie the
 poore woman
 
    Falst. Come hither Hostesse.
 Enter M[aster]. Gower]
   Ch.Iust. Now Master Gower; What newes?
   Gow. The King (my Lord) and Henrie Prince of Wales
 Are neere at hand: The rest the Paper telles
 
    Falst. As I am a Gentleman
 
    Host. Nay, you said so before
 
    Fal. As I am a Gentleman. Come, no more words of it
   Host. By this Heauenly ground I tread on, I must be
 faine to pawne both my Plate, and the Tapistry of my dyning
 Chambers
 
    Fal. Glasses, glasses, is the onely drinking: and for
 thy walles a pretty slight Drollery, or the Storie of the
 Prodigall, or the Germane hunting in Waterworke, is
 worth a thousand of these Bed-hangings, and these Flybitten
 Tapistries. Let it be tenne pound (if thou canst.)
 Come, if it were not for thy humors, there is not a better
 Wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw thy
 Action: Come, thou must not bee in this humour with
 me, come, I know thou was't set on to this
 
    Host. Prethee (Sir Iohn) let it be but twenty Nobles,
 I loath to pawne my Plate, in good earnest la
 
    Fal. Let it alone, Ile make other shift: you'l be a fool
 still
 
    Host. Well, you shall haue it although I pawne my
 Gowne. I hope you'l come to Supper: You'l pay me altogether?
   Fal. Will I liue? Go with her, with her: hooke-on,
 hooke-on
 
    Host. Will you haue Doll Teare-sheet meet you at supper?
   Fal. No more words. Let's haue her
 
    Ch.Iust. I haue heard bitter newes
 
    Fal. What's the newes (my good Lord?)
   Ch.Iu. Where lay the King last night?
   Mes. At Basingstoke my Lord
 
    Fal. I hope (my Lord) all's well. What is the newes
 my Lord?
   Ch.Iust. Come all his Forces backe?
   Mes. No: Fifteene hundred Foot, fiue hundred Horse
 Are march'd vp to my Lord of Lancaster,
 Against Northumberland, and the Archbishop
 
    Fal. Comes the King backe from Wales, my noble L[ord]?
   Ch.Iust. You shall haue Letters of me presently.
 Come, go along with me, good M[aster]. Gowre
 
    Fal. My Lord
 
    Ch.Iust. What's the matter?
   Fal. Master Gowre, shall I entreate you with mee to
 dinner?
   Gow. I must waite vpon my good Lord heere.
 I thanke you, good Sir Iohn
 
    Ch.Iust. Sir Iohn, you loyter heere too long being you
 are to take Souldiers vp, in Countries as you go
 
    Fal. Will you sup with me, Master Gowre?
   Ch.Iust. What foolish Master taught you these manners,
 Sir Iohn?
   Fal. Master Gower, if they become mee not, hee was a
 Foole that taught them mee. This is the right Fencing
 grace (my Lord) tap for tap, and so part faire
 
    Ch.Iust. Now the Lord lighten thee, thou art a great
 Foole.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Scena Secunda.
 
 Enter Prince Henry, Pointz, Bardolfe, and Page.
 
   Prin. Trust me, I am exceeding weary
 
    Poin. Is it come to that? I had thought wearines durst
 not haue attach'd one of so high blood
 
    Prin. It doth me: though it discolours the complexion
 of my Greatnesse to acknowledge it. Doth it not shew
 vildely in me, to desire small Beere?
   Poin. Why, a Prince should not be so loosely studied,
 as to remember so weake a Composition
 
    Prince. Belike then, my Appetite was not Princely
 got: for (in troth) I do now remember the poore Creature,
 Small Beere. But indeede these humble considerations
 make me out of loue with my Greatnesse. What a
 disgrace is it to me, to remember thy name? Or to know
 thy face to morrow? Or to take note how many paire of
 Silk stockings y hast? (Viz. these, and those that were thy
 peach-colour'd ones:) Or to beare the Inuentorie of thy
 shirts, as one for superfluity, and one other, for vse. But
 that the Tennis-Court-keeper knowes better then I, for
 it is a low ebbe of Linnen with thee, when thou kept'st
 not Racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, because
 the rest of thy Low Countries, haue made a shift to
 eate vp thy Holland
 
    Poin. How ill it followes, after you haue labour'd so
 hard, you should talke so idlely? Tell me how many good
 yong Princes would do so, their Fathers lying so sicke, as
 yours is?
   Prin. Shall I tell thee one thing, Pointz?
   Poin. Yes: and let it be an excellent good thing
 
    Prin. It shall serue among wittes of no higher breeding
 then thine
 
    Poin. Go to: I stand the push of your one thing, that
 you'l tell
 
    Prin. Why, I tell thee, it is not meet, that I should be
 sad now my Father is sicke: albeit I could tell to thee (as
 to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend)
 I could be sad, and sad indeed too
 
    Poin. Very hardly, vpon such a subiect
 
    Prin. Thou think'st me as farre in the Diuels Booke, as
 thou, and Falstaffe, for obduracie and persistencie. Let the
 end try the man. But I tell thee, my hart bleeds inwardly,
 that my Father is so sicke: and keeping such vild company
 as thou art, hath in reason taken from me, all ostentation
 of sorrow
 
    Poin. The reason?
   Prin. What would'st thou think of me, if I shold weep?
   Poin. I would thinke thee a most Princely hypocrite
 
    Prin. It would be euery mans thought: and thou art
 a blessed Fellow, to thinke as euery man thinkes: neuer a
 mans thought in the world, keepes the Rode-way better
 then thine: euery man would thinke me an Hypocrite indeede.
 And what accites your most worshipful thought
 to thinke so?
   Poin. Why, because you haue beene so lewde, and so
 much ingraffed to Falstaffe
 
    Prin. And to thee
 
    Pointz. Nay, I am well spoken of, I can heare it with
 mine owne eares: the worst that they can say of me is, that
 I am a second Brother, and that I am a proper Fellowe of
 my hands: and those two things I confesse I canot helpe.
 Looke, looke, here comes Bardolfe
 
    Prince. And the Boy that I gaue Falstaffe, he had him
 from me Christian, and see if the fat villain haue not transform'd
 him Ape.
 Enter Bardolfe.
 
   Bar. Saue your Grace
 
    Prin. And yours, most Noble Bardolfe
 
    Poin. Come you pernitious Asse, you bashfull Foole,
 must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? what
 a Maidenly man at Armes are you become? Is it such a
 matter to get a Pottle-pots Maiden-head?
   Page. He call'd me euen now (my Lord) through a red
 Lattice, and I could discerne no part of his face from the
 window: at last I spy'd his eyes, and me thought he had
 made two holes in the Ale-wiues new Petticoat, &amp; peeped
 through
 
    Prin. Hath not the boy profited?
   Bar. Away, you horson vpright Rabbet, away
 
    Page. Away, you rascally Altheas dreame, away
 
    Prin. Instruct vs Boy: what dreame, Boy?
   Page. Marry (my Lord) Althea dream'd, she was deliuer'd
 of a Firebrand, and therefore I call him hir dream
 
    Prince. A Crownes-worth of good Interpretation:
 There it is, Boy
 
    Poin. O that this good Blossome could bee kept from
 Cankers: Well, there is six pence to preserue thee
 
    Bard. If you do not make him be hang'd among you,
 the gallowes shall be wrong'd
 
    Prince. And how doth thy Master, Bardolph?
   Bar. Well, my good Lord: he heard of your Graces
 comming to Towne. There's a Letter for you
 
    Poin. Deliuer'd with good respect: And how doth the
 Martlemas, your Master?
   Bard. In bodily health Sir
 
    Poin. Marry, the immortall part needes a Physitian:
 but that moues not him: though that bee sicke, it dyes
 not
 
    Prince. I do allow this Wen to bee as familiar with
 me, as my dogge: and he holds his place, for looke you
 he writes
 
    Poin.
 
 Letter.
 
 Iohn Falstaffe Knight: (Euery man must
 know that, as oft as hee hath occasion to name himselfe:)
 Euen like those that are kinne to the King, for they neuer
 pricke their finger, but they say, there is som of the kings
 blood spilt. How comes that (sayes he) that takes vpon
 him not to conceiue? the answer is as ready as a borrowed
 cap: I am the Kings poore Cosin, Sir
 
    Prince. Nay, they will be kin to vs, but they wil fetch
 it from Iaphet. But to the Letter: - Sir Iohn Falstaffe,
 Knight, to the Sonne of the King, neerest his Father, Harrie
 Prince of Wales, greeting
 
    Poin. Why this is a Certificate
 
    Prin. Peace.
 I will imitate the honourable Romaines in breuitie
 
    Poin. Sure he meanes breuity in breath: short-winded.
 I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leaue thee. Bee
 not too familiar with Pointz, for hee misuses thy Fauours so
 much, that he sweares thou art to marrie his Sister Nell. Repent
 at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewell.
 Thine, by yea and no: which is as much as to say, as thou
 vsest him. Iacke Falstaffe with my Familiars:
 Iohn with my Brothers and Sister: &amp; Sir
 Iohn, with all Europe.
 My Lord, I will steepe this Letter in Sack, and make him
 eate it
 
    Prin. That's to make him eate twenty of his Words.
 But do you vse me thus Ned? Must I marry your Sister?
   Poin. May the Wench haue no worse Fortune. But I
 neuer said so
 
    Prin. Well, thus we play the Fooles with the time, &amp;
 the spirits of the wise, sit in the clouds, and mocke vs: Is
 your Master heere in London?
   Bard. Yes my Lord
 
    Prin. Where suppes he? Doth the old Bore, feede in
 the old Franke?
   Bard. At the old place my Lord, in East-cheape
 
    Prin. What Company?
   Page. Ephesians my Lord, of the old Church
 
    Prin. Sup any women with him?
   Page. None my Lord, but old Mistris Quickly, and M[istris].
 Doll Teare-sheet
 
    Prin. What Pagan may that be?
   Page. A proper Gentlewoman, Sir, and a Kinswoman
 of my Masters
 
    Prin. Euen such Kin, as the Parish Heyfors are to the
 Towne-Bull?
 Shall we steale vpon them (Ned) at Supper?
   Poin. I am your shadow, my Lord, Ile follow you
 
    Prin. Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
 Master that I am yet in Towne.
 There's for your silence
 
    Bar. I haue no tongue, sir
 
    Page. And for mine Sir, I will gouerne it
 
    Prin. Fare ye well: go.
 This Doll Teare-sheet should be some Rode
 
    Poin. I warrant you, as common as the way betweene
 S[aint]. Albans, and London
 
    Prin. How might we see Falstaffe bestow himselfe to
 night, in his true colours, and not our selues be seene?
   Poin. Put on two Leather Ierkins, and Aprons, and
 waite vpon him at his Table, like Drawers
 
    Prin. From a God, to a Bull? A heauie declension: It
 was Ioues case. From a Prince, to a Prentice, a low transformation,
 that shall be mine: for in euery thing, the purpose
 must weigh with the folly. Follow me Ned.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Scena Tertia.
 
 Enter Northumberland, his Ladie, and Harrie Percies Ladie.
 
   North. I prethee louing Wife, and gentle Daughter,
 Giue an euen way vnto my rough Affaires:
 Put not you on the visage of the Times,
 And be like them to Percie, troublesome
 
    Wife. I haue giuen ouer, I will speak no more,
 Do what you will: your Wisedome, be your guide
 
    North. Alas (sweet Wife) my Honor is at pawne,
 And but my going, nothing can redeeme it
 
    La. Oh yet, for heauens sake, go not to these Warrs;
 The Time was (Father) when you broke your word,
 When you were more endeer'd to it, then now,
 When your owne Percy, when my heart-deereHarry,
 Threw many a Northward looke, to see his Father
 Bring vp his Powres: but he did long in vaine.
 Who then perswaded you to stay at home?
 There were two Honors lost; Yours, and your Sonnes.
 For Yours, may heauenly glory brighten it:
 For His, it stucke vpon him, as the Sunne
 In the gray vault of Heauen: and by his Light
 Did all the Cheualrie of England moue
 To do braue Acts. He was (indeed) the Glasse
 Wherein the Noble-Youth did dresse themselues.
 He had no Legges, that practic'd not his Gate:
 And speaking thicke (which Nature made his blemish)
 Became the Accents of the Valiant.
 For those that could speake low, and tardily,
 Would turne their owne Perfection, to Abuse,
 To seeme like him. So that in Speech, in Gate,
 In Diet, in Affections of delight,
 In Militarie Rules, Humors of Blood,
 He was the Marke, and Glasse, Coppy, and Booke,
 That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous! him,
 O Miracle of Men! Him did you leaue
 (Second to none) vn-seconded by you,
 To looke vpon the hideous God of Warre,
 In dis-aduantage, to abide a field,
 Where nothing but the sound of Hotspurs Name
 Did seeme defensible: so you left him.
 Neuer, O neuer doe his Ghost the wrong,
 To hold your Honor more precise and nice
 With others, then with him. Let them alone:
 The Marshall and the Arch-bishop are strong.
 Had my sweet Harry had but halfe their Numbers,
 To day might I (hanging on Hotspurs Necke)
 Haue talk'd of Monmouth's Graue
 
    North. Beshrew your heart,
 (Faire Daughter) you doe draw my Spirits from me,
 With new lamenting ancient Ouer-sights.
 But I must goe, and meet with Danger there,
 Or it will seeke me in another place,
 And finde me worse prouided
 
    Wife. O flye to Scotland,
 Till that the Nobles, and the armed Commons,
 Haue of their Puissance made a little taste
 
    Lady. If they get ground, and vantage of the King,
 Then ioyne you with them, like a Ribbe of Steele,
 To make Strength stronger. But, for all our loues,
 First let them trye themselues. So did your Sonne,
 He was so suffer'd; so came I a Widow:
 And neuer shall haue length of Life enough,
 To raine vpon Remembrance with mine Eyes,
 That it may grow, and sprowt, as high as Heauen,
 For Recordation to my Noble Husband
 
    North. Come, come, go in with me: 'tis with my Minde
 As with the Tyde, swell'd vp vnto his height,
 That makes a still-stand, running neyther way.
 Faine would I goe to meet the Arch-bishop,
 But many thousand Reasons hold me backe.
 I will resolue for Scotland: there am I,
 Till Time and Vantage craue my company.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Scaena Quarta.
 
 Enter two Drawers.
 
   1.Drawer. What hast thou brought there? Apple-Iohns?
 Thou know'st Sir Iohn cannot endure an Apple-Iohn
 
    2.Draw. Thou say'st true: the Prince once set a Dish
 of Apple-Iohns before him, and told him there were fiue
 more Sir Iohns: and, putting off his Hat, said, I will now
 take my leaue of these sixe drie, round, old-wither'd
 Knights. It anger'd him to the heart: but hee hath forgot
 that
 
    1.Draw. Why then couer, and set them downe: and
 see if thou canst finde out Sneakes Noyse; Mistris Teare-sheet
 would faine haue some Musique
 
    2.Draw. Sirrha, heere will be the Prince, and Master
 Points, anon: and they will put on two of our Ierkins,
 and Aprons, and Sir Iohn must not know of it: Bardolph
 hath brought word
 
    1.Draw. Then here will be old Vtis: it will be an excellent
 stratagem
 
    2.Draw. Ile see if I can finde out Sneake.
 Enter.
 
 Enter Hostesse, and Dol.
 
   Host. Sweet-heart, me thinkes now you are in an excellent
 good temperalitie: your Pulsidge beates as extraordinarily,
 as heart would desire; and your Colour
 (I warrant you) is as red as any Rose: But you haue
 drunke too much Canaries, and that's a maruellous searching
 Wine; and it perfumes the blood, ere wee can say
 what's this. How doe you now?
   Dol. Better then I was: Hem
 
    Host. Why that was well said: A good heart's worth
 Gold. Looke, here comes Sir Iohn.
 Enter Falstaffe.
 
   Falst. When Arthur first in Court - (emptie the Iordan)
 and was a worthy King: How now Mistris Dol?
   Host. Sick of a Calme: yea, good-sooth
 
    Falst. So is all her Sect: if they be once in a Calme,
 they are sick
 
    Dol. You muddie Rascall, is that all the comfort you
 giue me?
   Falst. You make fat Rascalls, Mistris Dol
 
    Dol. I make them? Gluttonie and Diseases make
 them, I make them not
 
    Falst. If the Cooke make the Gluttonie, you helpe to
 make the Diseases (Dol) we catch of you (Dol) we catch
 of you: Grant that, my poore Vertue, grant that
 
    Dol. I marry, our Chaynes, and our Iewels
 
    Falst. Your Brooches, Pearles, and Owches: For to
 serue brauely, is to come halting off: you know, to come
 off the Breach, with his Pike bent brauely, and to Surgerie
 brauely; to venture vpon the charg'd-Chambers
 brauely
 
    Host. Why this is the olde fashion: you two neuer
 meete, but you fall to some discord: you are both (in
 good troth) as Rheumatike as two drie Tostes, you cannot
 one beare with anothers Confirmities. What the
 good-yere? One must beare, and that must bee you:
 you are the weaker Vessell; as they say, the emptier
 Vessell
 
    Dol. Can a weake emptie Vessell beare such a huge
 full Hogs-head? There's a whole Marchants Venture
 of Burdeux-Stuffe in him: you haue not seene a Hulke
 better stufft in the Hold. Come, Ile be friends with thee
 Iacke: Thou art going to the Warres, and whether I
 shall euer see thee againe, or no, there is no body
 cares.
 Enter Drawer.
 
   Drawer. Sir, Ancient Pistoll is below, and would
 speake with you
 
    Dol. Hang him, swaggering Rascall, let him not
 come hither: it is the foule-mouth'dst Rogue in England
 
    Host. If hee swagger, let him not come here: I must
 liue amongst my Neighbors, Ile no Swaggerers: I am
 in good name, and fame, with the very best: shut the
 doore, there comes no Swaggerers heere: I haue not
 liu'd all this while, to haue swaggering now: shut the
 doore, I pray you
 
    Falst. Do'st thou heare, Hostesse?
   Host. 'Pray you pacifie your selfe (Sir Iohn) there comes
 no Swaggerers heere
 
    Falst. Do'st thou heare? it is mine Ancient
 
    Host. Tilly-fally (Sir Iohn) neuer tell me, your ancient
 Swaggerer comes not in my doores. I was before Master
 Tisick the Deputie, the other day: and as hee said to me,
 it was no longer agoe then Wednesday last: Neighbour
 Quickly (sayes hee;) Master Dombe, our Minister, was by
 then: Neighbour Quickly (sayes hee) receiue those that
 are Ciuill; for (sayth hee) you are in an ill Name: now
 hee said so, I can tell whereupon: for (sayes hee) you are
 an honest Woman, and well thought on; therefore take
 heede what Guests you receiue: Receiue (sayes hee) no
 swaggering Companions. There comes none heere. You
 would blesse you to heare what hee said. No, Ile no
 Swaggerers
 
    Falst. Hee's no Swaggerer (Hostesse:) a tame Cheater,
 hee: you may stroake him as gently, as a Puppie Greyhound:
 hee will not swagger with a Barbarie Henne, if
 her feathers turne backe in any shew of resistance. Call
 him vp (Drawer.)
   Host. Cheater, call you him? I will barre no honest
 man my house, nor no Cheater: but I doe not loue swaggering;
 I am the worse when one sayes, swagger: Feele
 Masters, how I shake: looke you, I warrant you
 
    Dol. So you doe, Hostesse
 
    Host. Doe I? yea, in very truth doe I, if it were an Aspen
 Leafe: I cannot abide Swaggerers.
 Enter Pistol, and Bardolph and his Boy.
 
   Pist. 'Saue you, Sir Iohn
 
    Falst. Welcome Ancient Pistol. Here (Pistol) I charge
 you with a Cup of Sacke: doe you discharge vpon mine
 Hostesse
 
    Pist. I will discharge vpon her (Sir Iohn) with two
 Bullets
 
    Falst. She is Pistoll-proofe (Sir) you shall hardly offend
 her
 
    Host. Come, Ile drinke no Proofes, nor no Bullets: I
 will drinke no more then will doe me good, for no mans
 pleasure, I
 
    Pist. Then to you (Mistris Dorothie) I will charge
 you
 
    Dol. Charge me? I scorne you (scuruie Companion)
 what? you poore, base, rascally, cheating, lacke-Linnen-Mate:
 away you mouldie Rogue, away; I am meat for
 your Master
 
    Pist. I know you, Mistris Dorothie
 
    Dol. Away you Cut-purse Rascall, you filthy Bung,
 away: By this Wine, Ile thrust my Knife in your mouldie
 Chappes, if you play the sawcie Cuttle with me. Away
 you Bottle-Ale Rascall, you Basket-hilt stale Iugler, you.
 Since when, I pray you, Sir? what, with two Points on
 your shoulder? much
 
    Pist. I will murther your Ruffe, for this
 
    Host. No, good Captaine Pistol: not heere, sweete
 Captaine
 
    Dol. Captaine? thou abhominable damn'd Cheater,
 art thou not asham'd to be call'd Captaine? If Captaines
 were of my minde, they would trunchion you out, for taking
 their Names vpon you, before you haue earn'd them.
 You a Captaine? you slaue, for what? for tearing a poore
 Whores Ruffe in a Bawdy-house? Hee a Captaine? hang
 him Rogue, hee liues vpon mouldie stew'd-Pruines, and
 dry'de Cakes. A Captaine? These Villaines will make
 the word Captaine odious: Therefore Captaines had
 neede looke to it
 
    Bard. 'Pray thee goe downe, good Ancient
 
    Falst. Hearke thee hither, Mistris Dol
 
    Pist. Not I: I tell thee what, Corporall Bardolph, I
 could teare her: Ile be reueng'd on her
 
    Page. 'Pray thee goe downe
 
    Pist. Ile see her damn'd first: to Pluto's damn'd Lake,
 to the Infernall Deepe, where Erebus and Tortures vilde
 also. Hold Hooke and Line, say I: Downe: downe
 Dogges, downe Fates: haue wee not Hiren here?
   Host. Good Captaine Peesel be quiet, it is very late:
 I beseeke you now, aggrauate your Choler
 
    Pist. These be good Humors indeede. Shall PackHorses,
 and hollow-pamper'd Iades of Asia, which cannot
 goe but thirtie miles a day, compare with Cæsar, and
 with Caniballs, and Troian Greekes? nay, rather damne
 them with King Cerberus, and let the Welkin roare: shall
 wee fall foule for Toyes?
   Host. By my troth Captaine, these are very bitter
 words
 
    Bard. Be gone, good Ancient: this will grow to a
 Brawle anon
 
    Pist. Die men, like Dogges; giue Crownes like Pinnes:
 Haue we not Hiren here?
   Host. On my word (Captaine) there's none such here.
 What the good-yere, doe you thinke I would denye her?
 I pray be quiet
 
    Pist. Then feed, and be fat (my faire Calipolis.) Come,
 giue me some Sack, Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contente.
 Feare wee broad-sides? No, let the Fiend giue fire:
 Giue me some Sack: and Sweet-heart lye thou there:
 Come wee to full Points here, and are et cetera's nothing?
   Fal. Pistol, I would be quiet
 
    Pist. Sweet Knight, I kisse thy Neaffe: what? wee haue
 seene the seuen Starres
 
    Dol. Thrust him downe stayres, I cannot endure such
 a Fustian Rascall
 
    Pist. Thrust him downe stayres? know we not Galloway
 Nagges?
   Fal. Quoit him downe (Bardolph) like a shoue-groat
 shilling: nay, if hee doe nothing but speake nothing, hee
 shall be nothing here
 
    Bard. Come, get you downe stayres
 
    Pist. What? shall wee haue Incision? shall wee embrew?
 then Death rocke me asleepe, abridge my dolefull
 dayes: why then let grieuous, gastly, gaping Wounds,
 vntwin'd the Sisters three: Come Atropos, I say
 
    Host. Here's good stuffe toward
 
    Fal. Giue me my Rapier, Boy
 
    Dol. I prethee Iack, I prethee doe not draw
 
    Fal. Get you downe stayres
 
    Host. Here's a goodly tumult: Ile forsweare keeping
 house, before Ile be in these tirrits, and frights. So: Murther
 I warrant now. Alas, alas, put vp your naked Weapons,
 put vp your naked Weapons
 
    Dol. I prethee Iack be quiet, the Rascall is gone: ah,
 you whorson little valiant Villaine, you
 
    Host. Are you not hurt i'th' Groyne? me thought hee
 made a shrewd Thrust at your Belly
 
    Fal. Haue you turn'd him out of doores?
   Bard. Yes Sir: the Rascall's drunke: you haue hurt
 him (Sir) in the shoulder
 
    Fal. A Rascall to braue me
 
    Dol. Ah, you sweet little Rogue, you: alas, poore Ape,
 how thou sweat'st? Come, let me wipe thy Face: Come
 on, you whorson Chops: Ah Rogue, I loue thee: Thou
 art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth fiue of Agamemnon,
 and tenne times better then the nine Worthies: ah
 Villaine
 
    Fal. A rascally Slaue, I will tosse the Rogue in a Blanket
 
    Dol. Doe, if thou dar'st for thy heart: if thou doo'st,
 Ile canuas thee betweene a paire of Sheetes.
 Enter Musique.
 
   Page. The Musique is come, Sir
 
    Fal. Let them play: play Sirs. Sit on my Knee, Dol.
 A Rascall, bragging Slaue: the Rogue fled from me like
 Quick-siluer
 
    Dol. And thou followd'st him like a Church: thou
 whorson little tydie Bartholmew Bore-pigge, when wilt
 thou leaue fighting on dayes, and foyning on nights, and
 begin to patch vp thine old Body for Heauen?
 Enter the Prince and Poines disguis'd.
 
   Fal. Peace (good Dol) doe not speake like a Deathshead:
 doe not bid me remember mine end
 
    Dol. Sirrha, what humor is the Prince of?
   Fal. A good shallow young fellow: hee would haue
 made a good Pantler, hee would haue chipp'd Bread
 well
 
    Dol. They say Poines hath a good Wit
 
    Fal. Hee a good Wit? hang him Baboone, his Wit is
 as thicke as Tewksburie Mustard: there is no more conceit
 in him, then is in a Mallet
 
    Dol. Why doth the Prince loue him so then?
   Fal. Because their Legges are both of a bignesse: and
 hee playes at Quoits well, and eates Conger and Fennell,
 and drinkes off Candles ends for Flap-dragons, and rides
 the wilde-Mare with the Boyes, and iumpes vpon Ioyn'dstooles,
 and sweares with a good grace, and weares his
 Boot very smooth, like vnto the Signe of the Legge; and
 breedes no bate with telling of discreete stories: and such
 other Gamboll Faculties hee hath, that shew a weake
 Minde, and an able Body, for the which the Prince admits
 him; for the Prince himselfe is such another: the
 weight of an hayre will turne the Scales betweene their
 Haberdepois
 
    Prince. Would not this Naue of a Wheele haue his
 Eares cut off?
   Poin. Let vs beat him before his Whore
 
    Prince. Looke, if the wither'd Elder hath not his Poll
 claw'd like a Parrot
 
    Poin. Is it not strange, that Desire should so many
 yeeres out-liue performance?
   Fal. Kisse me Dol
 
    Prince. Saturne and Venus this yeere in Coniunction?
 What sayes the Almanack to that?
   Poin. And looke whether the fierie Trigon, his Man,
 be not lisping to his Masters old Tables, his Note-Booke,
 his Councell-keeper?
   Fal. Thou do'st giue me flatt'ring Busses
 
    Dol. Nay truely, I kisse thee with a most constant
 heart
 
    Fal. I am olde, I am olde
 
    Dol. I loue thee better, then I loue ere a scuruie young
 Boy of them all
 
    Fal. What Stuffe wilt thou haue a Kirtle of? I shall
 receiue Money on Thursday: thou shalt haue a Cappe
 to morrow. A merrie Song, come: it growes late,
 wee will to Bed. Thou wilt forget me, when I am
 gone
 
    Dol. Thou wilt set me a weeping, if thou say'st so:
 proue that euer I dresse my selfe handsome, till thy returne:
 well, hearken the end
 
    Fal. Some Sack, Francis
 
    Prin. Poin. Anon, anon, Sir
 
    Fal. Ha? a Bastard Sonne of the Kings? And art not
 thou Poines, his Brother?
   Prince. Why thou Globe of sinfull Continents, what
 a life do'st thou lead?
   Fal. A better then thou: I am a Gentleman, thou art
 a Drawer
 
    Prince. Very true, Sir: and I come to draw you out
 by the Eares
 
    Host. Oh, the Lord preserue thy good Grace: Welcome
 to London. Now Heauen blesse that sweete Face
 of thine: what, are you come from Wales?
   Fal. Thou whorson mad Compound of Maiestie: by
 this light Flesh, and corrupt Blood, thou art welcome
 
    Dol. How? you fat Foole, I scorne you
 
    Poin. My Lord, hee will driue you out of your reuenge,
 and turne all to a merryment, if you take not the
 heat
 
    Prince. You whorson Candle-myne you, how vildly
 did you speake of me euen now, before this honest, vertuous,
 ciuill Gentlewoman?
   Host. 'Blessing on your good heart, and so shee is by
 my troth
 
    Fal. Didst thou heare me?
   Prince. Yes: and you knew me, as you did when you
 ranne away by Gads-hill: you knew I was at your back,
 and spoke it on purpose, to trie my patience
 
    Fal. No, no, no: not so: I did not thinke, thou wast
 within hearing
 
    Prince. I shall driue you then to confesse the wilfull
 abuse, and then I know how to handle you
 
    Fal. No abuse (Hall) on mine Honor, no abuse
 
    Prince. Not to disprayse me? and call me Pantler, and
 Bread-chopper, and I know not what?
   Fal. No abuse (Hal.)
   Poin. No abuse?
   Fal. No abuse (Ned) in the World: honest Ned none.
 I disprays'd him before the Wicked, that the Wicked
 might not fall in loue with him: In which doing, I haue
 done the part of a carefull Friend, and a true Subiect, and
 thy Father is to giue me thankes for it. No abuse (Hal:)
 none (Ned) none; no Boyes, none
 
    Prince. See now whether pure Feare, and entire Cowardise,
 doth not make thee wrong this vertuous Gentlewoman,
 to close with vs? Is shee of the Wicked? Is thine
 Hostesse heere, of the Wicked? Or is the Boy of the
 Wicked? Or honest Bardolph (whose Zeale burnes in his
 Nose) of the Wicked?
   Poin. Answere thou dead Elme, answere
 
    Fal. The Fiend hath prickt downe Bardolph irrecouerable,
 and his Face is Lucifers Priuy-Kitchin, where hee
 doth nothing but rost Mault-Wormes: for the Boy,
 there is a good Angell about him, but the Deuill outbids
 him too
 
    Prince. For the Women?
   Fal. For one of them, shee is in Hell alreadie, and
 burnes poore Soules: for the other, I owe her Money;
 and whether shee bee damn'd for that, I know
 not
 
    Host. No, I warrant you
 
    Fal. No, I thinke thou art not: I thinke thou art quit
 for that. Marry, there is another Indictment vpon thee,
 for suffering flesh to bee eaten in thy house, contrary to
 the Law, for the which I thinke thou wilt howle
 
    Host. All Victuallers doe so: What is a Ioynt of
 Mutton, or two, in a whole Lent?
   Prince. You, Gentlewoman
 
    Dol. What sayes your Grace?
   Falst. His Grace sayes that, which his flesh rebells
 against
 
    Host. Who knocks so lowd at doore? Looke to the
 doore there, Francis?
 Enter Peto.
 
   Prince. Peto, how now? what newes?
   Peto. The King, your Father, is at Westminster,
 And there are twentie weake and wearied Postes,
 Come from the North: and as I came along,
 I met, and ouer-tooke a dozen Captaines,
 Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the Tauernes,
 And asking euery one for Sir Iohn Falstaffe
 
    Prince. By Heauen (Poines) I feele me much to blame,
 So idly to prophane the precious time,
 When Tempest of Commotion, like the South,
 Borne with black Vapour, doth begin to melt,
 And drop vpon our bare vnarmed heads.
 Giue me my Sword, and Cloake:
 Falstaffe, good night.
 Enter.
 
   Falst. Now comes in the sweetest Morsell of the
 night, and wee must hence, and leaue it vnpickt. More
 knocking at the doore? How now? what's the matter?
   Bard. You must away to Court, Sir, presently,
 A dozen Captaines stay at doore for you
 
    Falst. Pay the Musitians, Sirrha: farewell Hostesse,
 farewell Dol. You see (my good Wenches) how men of
 Merit are sought after: the vndeseruer may sleepe, when
 the man of Action is call'd on. Farewell good Wenches:
 if I be not sent away poste, I will see you againe, ere I
 goe
 
    Dol. I cannot speake: if my heart bee not readie
 to burst- Well (sweete Iacke) haue a care of thy
 selfe
 
    Falst. Farewell, farewell.
 Enter.
 
   Host. Well, fare thee well: I haue knowne thee
 these twentie nine yeeres, come Pescod-time: but an
 honester, and truer-hearted man- Well, fare thee
 well
 
    Bard. Mistris Teare-sheet
 
    Host. What's the matter?
   Bard. Bid Mistris Teare-sheet come to my Master
 
    Host. Oh runne Dol, runne: runne, good Dol.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
 
 Enter the King, with a Page.
 
   King. Goe, call the Earles of Surrey, and of Warwick:
 But ere they come, bid them ore-reade these Letters,
 And well consider of them: make good speed.
 Enter.
 
 How many thousand of my poorest Subiects
 Are at this howre asleepe? O Sleepe, O gentle Sleepe,
 Natures soft Nurse, how haue I frighted thee,
 That thou no more wilt weigh my eye-lids downe,
 And steepe my Sences in Forgetfulnesse?
 Why rather (Sleepe) lyest thou in smoakie Cribs,
 Vpon vneasie Pallads stretching thee,
 And huisht with bussing Night, flyes to thy slumber,
 Then in the perfum'd Chambers of the Great?
 Vnder the Canopies of costly State,
 And lull'd with sounds of sweetest Melodie?
 O thou dull God, why lyest thou with the vilde,
 In loathsome Beds, and leau'st the Kingly Couch,
 A Watch-case, or a common Larum-Bell?
 Wilt thou, vpon the high and giddie Mast,
 Seale vp the Ship-boyes Eyes, and rock his Braines,
 In Cradle of the rude imperious Surge,
 And in the visitation of the Windes,
 Who take the Ruffian Billowes by the top,
 Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
 With deaff'ning Clamors in the slipp'ry Clouds,
 That with the hurley, Death it selfe awakes?
 Canst thou (O partiall Sleepe) giue thy Repose
 To the wet Sea-Boy, in an houre so rude:
 And in the calmest, and most stillest Night,
 With all appliances, and meanes to boote,
 Deny it to a King? Then happy Lowe, lye downe,
 Vneasie lyes the Head, that weares a Crowne.
 Enter Warwicke and Surrey.
 
   War. Many good-morrowes to your Maiestie
 
    King. Is it good-morrow, Lords?
   War. 'Tis One a Clock, and past
 
    King. Why then good-morrow to you all (my Lords:)
 Haue you read o're the Letters that I sent you?
   War. We haue (my Liege.)
   King. Then you perceiue the Body of our Kingdome,
 How foule it is: what ranke Diseases grow,
 And with what danger, neere the Heart of it?
   War. It is but as a Body, yet distemper'd,
 Which to his former strength may be restor'd,
 With good aduice, and little Medicine:
 My Lord Northumberland will soone be cool'd
 
    King. Oh Heauen, that one might read the Book of Fate,
 And see the reuolution of the Times
 Make Mountaines leuell, and the Continent
 (Wearie of solide firmenesse) melt it selfe
 Into the Sea: and other Times, to see
 The beachie Girdle of the Ocean
 Too wide for Neptunes hippes; how Chances mocks
 And Changes fill the Cuppe of Alteration
 With diuers Liquors. 'Tis not tenne yeeres gone,
 Since Richard, and Northumberland, great friends,
 Did feast together; and in two yeeres after,
 Were they at Warres. It is but eight yeeres since,
 This Percie was the man, neerest my Soule,
 Who, like a Brother, toyl'd in my Affaires,
 And layd his Loue and Life vnder my foot:
 Yea, for my sake, euen to the eyes of Richard
 Gaue him defiance. But which of you was by
 (You Cousin Neuil, as I may remember)
 When Richard, with his Eye, brim-full of Teares,
 (Then check'd, and rated by Northumberland)
 Did speake these words (now prou'd a Prophecie:)
 Northumberland, thou Ladder, by the which
 My Cousin Bullingbrooke ascends my Throne:
 (Though then, Heauen knowes, I had no such intent,
 But that necessitie so bow'd the State,
 That I and Greatnesse were compell'd to kisse:)
 The Time shall come (thus did hee follow it)
 The Time will come, that foule Sinne gathering head,
 Shall breake into Corruption: so went on,
 Fore-telling this same Times Condition,
 And the diuision of our Amitie
 
    War. There is a Historie in all mens Liues,
 Figuring the nature of the Times deceas'd:
 The which obseru'd, a man may prophecie
 With a neere ayme, of the maine chance of things,
 As yet not come to Life, which in their Seedes
 And weake beginnings lye entreasured:
 Such things become the Hatch and Brood of Time;
 And by the necessarie forme of this,
 King Richard might create a perfect guesse,
 That great Northumberland, then false to him,
 Would of that Seed, grow to a greater falsenesse,
 Which should not finde a ground to roote vpon,
 Vnlesse on you
 
    King. Are these things then Necessities?
 Then let vs meete them like Necessities;
 And that same word, euen now cryes out on vs:
 They say, the Bishop and Northumberland
 Are fiftie thousand strong
 
    War. It cannot be (my Lord:)
 Rumor doth double, like the Voice, and Eccho,
 The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace
 To goe to bed, vpon my Life (my Lord)
 The Pow'rs that you alreadie haue sent forth,
 Shall bring this Prize in very easily.
 To comfort you the more, I haue receiu'd
 A certaine instance, that Glendour is dead.
 Your Maiestie hath beene this fort-night ill,
 And these vnseason'd howres perforce must adde
 Vnto your Sicknesse
 
    King. I will take your counsaile:
 And were these inward Warres once out of hand,
 Wee would (deare Lords) vnto the Holy-Land.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Scena Secunda.
 
 Enter Shallow and Silence: with Mouldie, Shadow, Wart, Feeble,
 Bull-calfe.
 
   Shal. Come-on, come-on, come-on: giue mee your
 Hand, Sir; giue mee your Hand, Sir: an early stirrer, by
 the Rood. And how doth my good Cousin Silence?
   Sil. Good-morrow, good Cousin Shallow
 
    Shal. And how doth my Cousin, your Bed-fellow?
 and your fairest Daughter, and mine, my God-Daughter
 Ellen?
   Sil. Alas, a blacke Ouzell (Cousin Shallow.)
   Shal. By yea and nay, Sir. I dare say my Cousin William
 is become a good Scholler? hee is at Oxford still, is hee
 not?
   Sil. Indeede Sir, to my cost
 
    Shal. Hee must then to the Innes of Court shortly: I
 was once of Clements Inne; where (I thinke) they will
 talke of mad Shallow yet
 
    Sil. You were call'd lustie Shallow then (Cousin.)
   Shal. I was call'd any thing: and I would haue done
 any thing indeede too, and roundly too. There was I, and
 little Iohn Doit of Staffordshire, and blacke George Bare,
 and Francis Pick-bone, and Will Squele a Cotsal-man, you
 had not foure such Swindge-bucklers in all the Innes of
 Court againe: And I may say to you, wee knew where
 the Bona-Roba's were, and had the best of them all at
 commandement. Then was Iacke Falstaffe (now Sir Iohn)
 a Boy, and Page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolke
 
    Sil. This Sir Iohn (Cousin) that comes hither anon about
 Souldiers?
   Shal. The same Sir Iohn, the very same: I saw him
 breake Scoggan's Head at the Court-Gate, when hee was
 a Crack, not thus high: and the very same day did I fight
 with one Sampson Stock-fish, a Fruiterer, behinde Greyes-Inne.
 Oh the mad dayes that I haue spent! and to see
 how many of mine olde Acquaintance are dead?
   Sil. Wee shall all follow (Cousin.)
   Shal. Certaine: 'tis certaine: very sure, very sure:
 Death is certaine to all, all shall dye. How a good Yoke
 of Bullocks at Stamford Fayre?
   Sil. Truly Cousin, I was not there
 
    Shal. Death is certaine. Is old Double of your Towne
 liuing yet?
   Sil. Dead, Sir
 
    Shal. Dead? See, see: hee drew a good Bow: and
 dead? hee shot a fine shoote. Iohn of Gaunt loued
 him well, and betted much Money on his head. Dead?
 hee would haue clapt in the Clowt at Twelue-score, and
 carryed you a fore-hand Shaft at foureteene, and foureteene
 and a halfe, that it would haue done a mans heart
 good to see. How a score of Ewes now?
   Sil. Thereafter as they be: a score of good Ewes
 may be worth tenne pounds
 
    Shal. And is olde Double dead?
 Enter Bardolph and his Boy.
 
   Sil. Heere come two of Sir Iohn Falstaffes Men (as I
 thinke.)
   Shal. Good-morrow, honest Gentlemen
 
    Bard. I beseech you, which is Iustice Shallow?
   Shal. I am Robert Shallow (Sir) a poore Esquire of this
 Countie, and one of the Kings Iustices of the Peace:
 What is your good pleasure with me?
   Bard. My Captaine (Sir) commends him to you:
 my Captaine, Sir Iohn Falstaffe: a tall Gentleman, and a
 most gallant Leader
 
    Shal. Hee greetes me well: (Sir) I knew him a
 good Back-Sword-man. How doth the good Knight?
 may I aske, how my Lady his Wife doth?
   Bard. Sir, pardon: a Souldier is better accommodated,
 then with a Wife
 
    Shal. It is well said, Sir; and it is well said, indeede,
 too: Better accommodated? it is good, yea indeede is
 it: good phrases are surely, and euery where very commendable.
 Accommodated, it comes of Accommodo:
 very good, a good Phrase
 
    Bard. Pardon, Sir, I haue heard the word. Phrase
 call you it? by this Day, I know not the Phrase: but
 I will maintaine the Word with my Sword, to bee a
 Souldier-like Word, and a Word of exceeding good
 Command. Accommodated: that is, when a man is
 (as they say) accommodated: or, when a man is, being
 whereby he thought to be accommodated, which is an
 excellent thing.
 Enter Falstaffe.
 
   Shal. It is very iust: Looke, heere comes good Sir
 Iohn. Giue me your hand, giue me your Worships good
 hand: Trust me, you looke well: and beare your yeares
 very well. Welcome, good Sir Iohn
 
    Fal. I am glad to see you well, good M[aster]. Robert Shallow:
 Master Sure-card as I thinke?
   Shal. No sir Iohn, it is my Cosin Silence: in Commission
 with mee
 
    Fal. Good M[aster]. Silence, it well befits you should be of
 the peace
 
    Sil. Your good Worship is welcome
 
    Fal. Fye, this is hot weather (Gentlemen) haue you
 prouided me heere halfe a dozen of sufficient men?
   Shal. Marry haue we sir: Will you sit?
   Fal. Let me see them, I beseech you
 
    Shal. Where's the Roll? Where's the Roll? Where's
 the Roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see: so, so, so, so:
 yea marry Sir. Raphe Mouldie: let them appeare as I call:
 let them do so, let them do so: Let mee see, Where is
 Mouldie?
   Moul. Heere, if it please you
 
    Shal. What thinke you (Sir Iohn) a good limb'd fellow:
 yong, strong, and of good friends
 
    Fal. Is thy name Mouldie?
   Moul. Yea, if it please you
 
    Fal. 'Tis the more time thou wert vs'd
 
    Shal. Ha, ha, ha, most excellent. Things that are mouldie,
 lacke vse: very singular good. Well saide Sir Iohn,
 very well said
 
    Fal. Pricke him
 
    Moul. I was prickt well enough before, if you could
 haue let me alone: my old Dame will be vndone now, for
 one to doe her Husbandry, and her Drudgery; you need
 not to haue prickt me, there are other men fitter to goe
 out, then I
 
    Fal. Go too: peace Mouldie, you shall goe. Mouldie,
 it is time you were spent
 
    Moul. Spent?
   Shallow. Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: Know you
 where you are? For the other sir Iohn: Let me see: Simon
 Shadow
 
    Fal. I marry, let me haue him to sit vnder: he's like to
 be a cold souldier
 
    Shal. Where's Shadow?
   Shad. Heere sir
 
    Fal. Shadow, whose sonne art thou?
   Shad. My Mothers sonne, Sir
 
    Falst. Thy Mothers sonne: like enough, and thy Fathers
 shadow: so the sonne of the Female, is the shadow
 of the Male: it is often so indeede, but not of the Fathers
 substance
 
    Shal. Do you like him, sir Iohn?
   Falst. Shadow will serue for Summer: pricke him: For
 wee haue a number of shadowes to fill vppe the Muster-Booke
 
    Shal. Thomas Wart?
   Falst. Where's he?
   Wart. Heere sir
 
    Falst. Is thy name Wart?
   Wart. Yea sir
 
    Fal. Thou art a very ragged Wart
 
    Shal. Shall I pricke him downe,
 Sir Iohn?
   Falst. It were superfluous: for his apparrel is built vpon
 his backe, and the whole frame stands vpon pins: prick
 him no more
 
    Shal. Ha, ha, ha, you can do it sir: you can doe it: I
 commend you well.
 Francis Feeble
 
    Feeble. Heere sir
 
    Shal. What Trade art thou Feeble?
   Feeble. A Womans Taylor sir
 
    Shal. Shall I pricke him, sir?
   Fal. You may:
 But if he had beene a mans Taylor, he would haue prick'd
 you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemies Battaile,
 as thou hast done in a Womans petticote?
   Feeble. I will doe my good will sir, you can haue no
 more
 
    Falst. Well said, good Womans Tailour: Well sayde
 Couragious Feeble: thou wilt bee as valiant as the wrathfull
 Doue, or most magnanimous Mouse. Pricke the womans
 Taylour well Master Shallow, deepe Maister Shallow
 
    Feeble. I would Wart might haue gone sir
 
    Fal. I would thou wert a mans Tailor, that y might'st
 mend him, and make him fit to goe. I cannot put him to
 a priuate souldier, that is the Leader of so many thousands.
 Let that suffice, most Forcible Feeble
 
    Feeble. It shall suffice
 
    Falst. I am bound to thee, reuerend Feeble. Who is
 the next?
   Shal. Peter Bulcalfe of the Greene
 
    Falst. Yea marry, let vs see Bulcalfe
 
    Bul. Heere sir
 
    Fal. Trust me, a likely Fellow. Come, pricke me Bulcalfe
 till he roare againe
 
    Bul. Oh, good my Lord Captaine
 
    Fal. What? do'st thou roare before th'art prickt
 
    Bul. Oh sir, I am a diseased man
 
    Fal. What disease hast thou?
   Bul. A whorson cold sir, a cough sir, which I caught
 with Ringing in the Kings affayres, vpon his Coronation
 day, sir
 
    Fal. Come, thou shalt go to the Warres in a Gowne:
 we will haue away thy Cold, and I will take such order,
 that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is heere all?
   Shal. There is two more called then your number:
 you must haue but foure heere sir, and so I pray you go in
 with me to dinner
 
    Fal. Come, I will goe drinke with you, but I cannot
 tarry dinner. I am glad to see you in good troth, Master
 Shallow
 
    Shal. O sir Iohn, doe you remember since wee lay all
 night in the Winde-mill, in S[aint]. Georges Field
 
    Falstaffe. No more of that good Master Shallow: No
 more of that
 
    Shal. Ha? it was a merry night. And is Iane Nightworke
 aliue?
   Fal. She liues, M[aster]. Shallow
 
    Shal. She neuer could away with me
 
    Fal. Neuer, neuer: she would alwayes say shee could
 not abide M[aster]. Shallow
 
    Shal. I could anger her to the heart: shee was then a
 Bona-Roba. Doth she hold her owne well
 
    Fal. Old, old, M[aster]. Shallow
 
    Shal. Nay, she must be old, she cannot choose but be
 old: certaine shee's old: and had Robin Night-worke, by
 old Night-worke, before I came to Clements Inne
 
    Sil. That's fiftie fiue yeeres agoe
 
    Shal. Hah, Cousin Silence, that thou hadst seene that,
 that this Knight and I haue seene: hah, Sir Iohn, said I
 well?
   Falst. Wee haue heard the Chymes at mid-night, Master
 Shallow
 
    Shal. That wee haue, that wee haue; in faith, Sir Iohn,
 wee haue: our watch-word was, Hem-Boyes. Come,
 let's to Dinner; come, let's to Dinner: Oh the dayes that
 wee haue seene. Come, come
 
    Bul. Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my
 friend, and heere is foure Harry tenne shillings in French
 Crownes for you: in very truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd
 sir, as goe: and yet, for mine owne part, sir, I do not care;
 but rather, because I am vnwilling, and for mine owne
 part, haue a desire to stay with my friends: else, sir, I did
 not care, for mine owne part, so much
 
    Bard. Go-too: stand aside
 
    Mould. And good Master Corporall Captaine, for my
 old Dames sake, stand my friend: shee hath no body to
 doe any thing about her, when I am gone: and she is old,
 and cannot helpe her selfe: you shall haue fortie, sir
 
    Bard. Go-too: stand aside
 
    Feeble. I care not, a man can die but once: wee owe a
 death. I will neuer beare a base minde: if it be my destinie,
 so: if it be not, so: no man is too good to serue his
 Prince: and let it goe which way it will, he that dies this
 yeere, is quit for the next
 
    Bard. Well said, thou art a good fellow
 
    Feeble. Nay, I will beare no base minde
 
    Falst. Come sir, which men shall I haue?
   Shal. Foure of which you please
 
    Bard. Sir, a word with you: I haue three pound, to
 free Mouldie and Bull-calfe
 
    Falst. Go-too: well
 
    Shal. Come, sir Iohn, which foure will you haue?
   Falst. Doe you chuse for me
 
    Shal. Marry then, Mouldie, Bull-calfe, Feeble, and
 Shadow
 
    Falst. Mouldie, and Bull-calfe: for you Mouldie, stay
 at home, till you are past seruice: and for your part, Bull-calfe,
 grow till you come vnto it: I will none of you
 
    Shal. Sir Iohn, Sir Iohn, doe not your selfe wrong, they
 are your likelyest men, and I would haue you seru'd with
 the best
 
    Falst. Will you tell me (Master Shallow) how to chuse
 a man? Care I for the Limbe, the Thewes, the stature,
 bulke, and bigge assemblance of a man? giue mee the
 spirit (Master Shallow.) Where's Wart? you see what
 a ragged appearance it is: hee shall charge you, and
 discharge you, with the motion of a Pewterers Hammer:
 come off, and on, swifter then hee that gibbets on
 the Brewers Bucket. And this same halfe-fac'd fellow,
 Shadow, giue me this man: hee presents no marke to the
 Enemie, the foe-man may with as great ayme leuell at
 the edge of a Pen-knife: and for a Retrait, how swiftly
 will this Feeble, the Womans Taylor, runne off. O, giue
 me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a
 Calyuer into Warts hand, Bardolph
 
    Bard. Hold Wart, Trauerse: thus, thus, thus
 
    Falst. Come, manage me your Calyuer: so: very well,
 go-too, very good, exceeding good. O, giue me alwayes
 a little, leane, old, chopt, bald Shot. Well said Wart, thou
 art a good Scab: hold, there is a Tester for thee
 
    Shal. Hee is not his Crafts-master, hee doth not doe
 it right. I remember at Mile-end-Greene, when I lay
 at Clements Inne, I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthurs
 Show: there was a little quiuer fellow, and hee would
 manage you his Peece thus: and hee would about,
 and about, and come you in, and come you in: Rah,
 tah, tah, would hee say, Bownce would hee say, and
 away againe would hee goe, and againe would he come:
 I shall neuer see such a fellow
 
    Falst. These fellowes will doe well, Master Shallow.
 Farewell Master Silence, I will not vse many wordes with
 you: fare you well, Gentlemen both: I thanke you:
 I must a dozen mile to night. Bardolph, giue the Souldiers
 Coates
 
    Shal. Sir Iohn, Heauen blesse you, and prosper your
 Affaires, and send vs Peace. As you returne, visit
 my house. Let our old acquaintance be renewed: peraduenture
 I will with you to the Court
 
    Falst. I would you would, Master Shallow
 
    Shal. Go-too: I haue spoke at a word. Fare you
 well.
 Enter.
 
   Falst. Fare you well, gentle Gentlemen. On Bardolph,
 leade the men away. As I returne, I will fetch off
 these Iustices: I doe see the bottome of Iustice Shallow.
 How subiect wee old men are to this vice of Lying?
 This same staru'd Iustice hath done nothing but
 prate to me of the wildenesse of his Youth, and the
 Feates hee hath done about Turnball-street, and euery
 third word a Lye, duer pay'd to the hearer, then the
 Turkes Tribute. I doe remember him at Clements Inne,
 like a man made after Supper, of a Cheese-paring. When
 hee was naked, hee was, for all the world, like a forked
 Radish, with a Head fantastically caru'd vpon it with a
 Knife. Hee was so forlorne, that his Dimensions (to
 any thicke sight) were inuincible. Hee was the very
 Genius of Famine: hee came euer in the rere-ward of
 the Fashion: And now is this Vices Dagger become a
 Squire, and talkes as familiarly of Iohn of Gaunt, as if
 hee had beene sworne Brother to him: and Ile be sworne
 hee neuer saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he
 burst his Head, for crowding among the Marshals men.
 I saw it, and told Iohn of Gaunt, hee beat his owne
 Name, for you might haue truss'd him and all his Apparrell
 into an Eele-skinne: the Case of a Treble Hoeboy
 was a Mansion for him: a Court: and now hath
 hee Land, and Beeues. Well, I will be acquainted with
 him, if I returne: and it shall goe hard, but I will make
 him a Philosophers two Stones to me. If the young
 Dace be a Bayt for the old Pike, I see no reason, in the
 Law of Nature, but I may snap at him. Let time shape,
 and there an end.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
 
 Enter the Arch-bishop, Mowbray, Hastings, Westmerland,
 Coleuile.
 
   Bish. What is this Forrest call'd?
   Hast. 'Tis Gaultree Forrest, and't shall please your
 Grace
 
    Bish. Here stand (my Lords) and send discouerers forth,
 To know the numbers of our Enemies
 
    Hast. Wee haue sent forth alreadie
 
    Bish. 'Tis well done.
 My Friends, and Brethren (in these great Affaires)
 I must acquaint you, that I haue receiu'd
 New-dated Letters from Northumberland:
 Their cold intent, tenure, and substance thus.
 Here doth hee wish his Person, with such Powers
 As might hold sortance with his Qualitie,
 The which hee could not leuie: whereupon
 Hee is retyr'd, to ripe his growing Fortunes,
 To Scotland; and concludes in heartie prayers,
 That your Attempts may ouer-liue the hazard,
 And fearefull meeting of their Opposite
 
    Mow. Thus do the hopes we haue in him, touch ground,
 And dash themselues to pieces.
 Enter a Messenger.
 
   Hast. Now? what newes?
   Mess. West of this Forrest, scarcely off a mile,
 In goodly forme, comes on the Enemie:
 And by the ground they hide, I iudge their number
 Vpon, or neere, the rate of thirtie thousand
 
    Mow. The iust proportion that we gaue them out.
 Let vs sway-on, and face them in the field.
 Enter Westmerland.
 
   Bish. What well-appointed Leader fronts vs here?
   Mow. I thinke it is my Lord of Westmerland
 
    West. Health, and faire greeting from our Generall,
 The Prince, Lord Iohn, and Duke of Lancaster
 
    Bish. Say on (my Lord of Westmerland) in peace:
 What doth concerne your comming?
   West. Then (my Lord)
 Vnto your Grace doe I in chiefe addresse
 The substance of my Speech. If that Rebellion
 Came like it selfe, in base and abiect Routs,
 Led on by bloodie Youth, guarded with Rage,
 And countenanc'd by Boyes, and Beggerie:
 I say, if damn'd Commotion so appeare,
 In his true, natiue, and most proper shape,
 You (Reuerend Father, and these Noble Lords)
 Had not beene here, to dresse the ougly forme
 Of base, and bloodie Insurrection,
 With your faire Honors. You, Lord Arch-bishop,
 Whose Sea is by a Ciuill Peace maintain'd,
 Whose Beard, the Siluer Hand of Peace hath touch'd,
 Whose Learning, and good Letters, Peace hath tutor'd,
 Whose white Inuestments figure Innocence,
 The Doue, and very blessed Spirit of Peace.
 Wherefore doe you so ill translate your selfe,
 Out of the Speech of Peace, that beares such grace,
 Into the harsh and boystrous Tongue of Warre?
 Turning your Bookes to Graues, your Inke to Blood,
 Your Pennes to Launces, and your Tongue diuine
 To a lowd Trumpet, and a Point of Warre
 
    Bish. Wherefore doe I this? so the Question stands.
 Briefely to this end: Wee are all diseas'd,
 And with our surfetting, and wanton howres,
 Haue brought our selues into a burning Feuer,
 And wee must bleede for it: of which Disease,
 Our late King Richard (being infected) dy'd.
 But (my most Noble Lord of Westmerland)
 I take not on me here as a Physician,
 Nor doe I, as an Enemie to Peace,
 Troope in the Throngs of Militarie men:
 But rather shew a while like fearefull Warre,
 To dyet ranke Mindes, sicke of happinesse,
 And purge th' obstructions, which begin to stop
 Our very Veines of Life: heare me more plainely.
 I haue in equall ballance iustly weigh'd,
 What wrongs our Arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
 And finde our Griefes heauier then our Offences.
 Wee see which way the streame of Time doth runne,
 And are enforc'd from our most quiet there,
 By the rough Torrent of Occasion,
 And haue the summarie of all our Griefes
 (When time shall serue) to shew in Articles;
 Which long ere this, wee offer'd to the King,
 And might, by no Suit, gayne our Audience:
 When wee are wrong'd, and would vnfold our Griefes,
 Wee are deny'd accesse vnto his Person,
 Euen by those men, that most haue done vs wrong.
 The dangers of the dayes but newly gone,
 Whose memorie is written on the Earth
 With yet appearing blood; and the examples
 Of euery Minutes instance (present now)
 Hath put vs in these ill-beseeming Armes:
 Not to breake Peace, or any Branch of it,
 But to establish here a Peace indeede,
 Concurring both in Name and Qualitie
 
    West. When euer yet was your Appeale deny'd?
 Wherein haue you beene galled by the King?
 What Peere hath beene suborn'd, to grate on you,
 That you should seale this lawlesse bloody Booke
 Of forg'd Rebellion, with a Seale diuine?
   Bish. My Brother generall, the Common-wealth,
 I make my Quarrell, in particular
 
    West. There is no neede of any such redresse:
 Or if there were, it not belongs to you
 
    Mow. Why not to him in part, and to vs all,
 That feele the bruizes of the dayes before,
 And suffer the Condition of these Times
 To lay a heauie and vnequall Hand vpon our Honors?
   West. O my good Lord Mowbray,
 Construe the Times to their Necessities,
 And you shall say (indeede) it is the Time,
 And not the King, that doth you iniuries.
 Yet for your part, it not appeares to me,
 Either from the King, or in the present Time,
 That you should haue an ynch of any ground
 To build a Griefe on: were you not restor'd
 To all the Duke of Norfolkes Seignories,
 Your Noble, and right well-remembred Fathers?
   Mow. What thing, in Honor, had my Father lost,
 That need to be reuiu'd, and breath'd in me?
 The King that lou'd him, as the State stood then,
 Was forc'd, perforce compell'd to banish him:
 And then, that Henry Bullingbrooke and hee
 Being mounted, and both rowsed in their Seates,
 Their neighing Coursers daring of the Spurre,
 Their armed Staues in charge, their Beauers downe,
 Their eyes of fire, sparkling through sights of Steele,
 And the lowd Trumpet blowing them together:
 Then, then, when there was nothing could haue stay'd
 My Father from the Breast of Bullingbrooke;
 O, when the King did throw his Warder downe,
 (His owne Life hung vpon the Staffe hee threw)
 Then threw hee downe himselfe, and all their Liues,
 That by Indictment, and by dint of Sword,
 Haue since mis-carryed vnder Bullingbrooke
 
    West. You speak (Lord Mowbray) now you know not what.
 The Earle of Hereford was reputed then
 In England the most valiant Gentleman.
 Who knowes, on whom Fortune would then haue smil'd?
 But if your Father had beene Victor there,
 Hee ne're had borne it out of Couentry.
 For all the Countrey, in a generall voyce,
 Cry'd hate vpon him: and all their prayers, and loue,
 Were set on Herford, whom they doted on,
 And bless'd, and grac'd, and did more then the King.
 But this is meere digression from my purpose.
 Here come I from our Princely Generall,
 To know your Griefes; to tell you, from his Grace,
 That hee will giue you Audience: and wherein
 It shall appeare, that your demands are iust,
 You shall enioy them, euery thing set off,
 That might so much as thinke you Enemies
 
    Mow. But hee hath forc'd vs to compell this Offer,
 And it proceedes from Pollicy, not Loue
 
    West. Mowbray, you ouer-weene to take it so:
 This Offer comes from Mercy, not from Feare.
 For loe, within a Ken our Army lyes,
 Vpon mine Honor, all too confident
 To giue admittance to a thought of feare.
 Our Battaile is more full of Names then yours,
 Our Men more perfect in the vse of Armes,
 Our Armor all as strong, our Cause the best;
 Then Reason will, our hearts should be as good.
 Say you not then, our Offer is compell'd
 
    Mow. Well, by my will, wee shall admit no Parley
 
    West. That argues but the shame of your offence:
 A rotten Case abides no handling
 
    Hast. Hath the Prince Iohn a full Commission,
 In very ample vertue of his Father,
 To heare, and absolutely to determine
 Of what Conditions wee shall stand vpon?
   West. That is intended in the Generals Name:
 I muse you make so slight a Question
 
    Bish. Then take (my Lord of Westmerland) this Schedule,
 For this containes our generall Grieuances:
 Each seuerall Article herein redress'd,
 All members of our Cause, both here, and hence,
 That are insinewed to this Action,
 Acquitted by a true substantiall forme,
 And present execution of our wills,
 To vs, and to our purposes confin'd,
 Wee come within our awfull Banks againe,
 And knit our Powers to the Arme of Peace
 
    West. This will I shew the Generall. Please you Lords,
 In sight of both our Battailes, wee may meete
 At either end in peace: which Heauen so frame,
 Or to the place of difference call the Swords,
 Which must decide it
 
    Bish. My Lord, wee will doe so
 
    Mow. There is a thing within my Bosome tells me,
 That no Conditions of our Peace can stand
 
    Hast. Feare you not, that if wee can make our Peace
 Vpon such large termes, and so absolute,
 As our Conditions shall consist vpon,
 Our Peace shall stand as firme as Rockie Mountaines
 
    Mow. I, but our valuation shall be such,
 That euery slight, and false-deriued Cause,
 Yea, euery idle, nice, and wanton Reason,
 Shall, to the King, taste of this Action:
 That were our Royall faiths, Martyrs in Loue,
 Wee shall be winnowed with so rough a winde,
 That euen our Corne shall seeme as light as Chaffe,
 And good from bad finde no partition
 
    Bish. No, no (my Lord) note this: the King is wearie
 Of daintie, and such picking Grieuances:
 For hee hath found, to end one doubt by Death,
 Reuiues two greater in the Heires of Life.
 And therefore will hee wipe his Tables cleane,
 And keepe no Tell-tale to his Memorie,
 That may repeat, and Historie his losse,
 To new remembrance. For full well hee knowes,
 Hee cannot so precisely weede this Land,
 As his mis-doubts present occasion:
 His foes are so en-rooted with his friends,
 That plucking to vnfixe an Enemie,
 Hee doth vnfasten so, and shake a friend.
 So that this Land, like an offensiue wife,
 That hath enrag'd him on, to offer strokes,
 As he is striking, holds his Infant vp,
 And hangs resolu'd Correction in the Arme,
 That was vprear'd to execution
 
    Hast. Besides, the King hath wasted all his Rods,
 On late Offenders, that he now doth lacke
 The very Instruments of Chasticement:
 So that his power, like to a Fanglesse Lion
 May offer, but not hold
 
    Bish. 'Tis very true:
 And therefore be assur'd (my good Lord Marshal)
 If we do now make our attonement well,
 Our Peace, will (like a broken Limbe vnited)
 Grow stronger, for the breaking
 
    Mow. Be it so:
 Heere is return'd my Lord of Westmerland.
 Enter Westmerland.
 
   West. The Prince is here at hand: pleaseth your Lordship
 To meet his Grace, iust distance 'tweene our Armies?
   Mow. Your Grace of Yorke, in heauen's name then
 forward
 
    Bish. Before, and greet his Grace (my Lord) we come.
 Enter Prince Iohn.
 
   Iohn. You are wel encountred here (my cosin Mowbray)
 Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,
 And so to you Lord Hastings, and to all.
 My Lord of Yorke, it better shew'd with you,
 When that your Flocke (assembled by the Bell)
 Encircled you, to heare with reuerence
 Your exposition on the holy Text,
 Then now to see you heere an Iron man
 Chearing a rowt of Rebels with your Drumme,
 Turning the Word, to Sword; and Life to death:
 That man that sits within a Monarches heart,
 And ripens in the Sunne-shine of his fauor,
 Would hee abuse the Countenance of the King,
 Alack, what Mischiefes might hee set abroach,
 In shadow of such Greatnesse? With you, Lord Bishop,
 It is euen so. Who hath not heard it spoken,
 How deepe you were within the Bookes of Heauen?
 To vs, the Speaker in his Parliament;
 To vs, th' imagine Voyce of Heauen it selfe:
 The very Opener, and Intelligencer,
 Betweene the Grace, the Sanctities of Heauen;
 And our dull workings. O, who shall beleeue,
 But you mis-vse the reuerence of your Place,
 Employ the Countenance, and Grace of Heauen,
 As a false Fauorite doth his Princes Name,
 In deedes dis-honorable? You haue taken vp,
 Vnder the counterfeited Zeale of Heauen,
 The Subiects of Heauens Substitute, my Father,
 And both against the Peace of Heauen, and him,
 Haue here vp-swarmed them
 
    Bish. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
 I am not here against your Fathers Peace:
 But (as I told my Lord of Westmerland)
 The Time (mis-order'd) doth in common sence
 Crowd vs, and crush vs, to this monstrous Forme,
 To hold our safetie vp. I sent your Grace
 The parcels, and particulars of our Griefe,
 The which hath been with scorne shou'd from the Court:
 Whereon this Hydra-Sonne of Warre is borne,
 Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleepe,
 With graunt of our most iust and right desires;
 And true Obedience, of this Madnesse cur'd,
 Stoope tamely to the foot of Maiestie
 
    Mow. If not, wee readie are to trye our fortunes,
 To the last man
 
    Hast. And though wee here fall downe,
 Wee haue Supplyes, to second our Attempt:
 If they mis-carry, theirs shall second them.
 And so, successe of Mischiefe shall be borne,
 And Heire from Heire shall hold this Quarrell vp,
 Whiles England shall haue generation
 
    Iohn. You are too shallow (Hastings)
 Much too shallow,
 To sound the bottome of the after-Times
 
    West. Pleaseth your Grace, to answere them directly,
 How farre-forth you doe like their Articles
 
    Iohn. I like them all, and doe allow them well:
 And sweare here, by the honor of my blood,
 My Fathers purposes haue beene mistooke,
 And some, about him, haue too lauishly
 Wrested his meaning, and Authoritie.
 My Lord, these Griefes shall be with speed redrest:
 Vpon my Life, they shall. If this may please you,
 Discharge your Powers vnto their seuerall Counties,
 As wee will ours: and here, betweene the Armies,
 Let's drinke together friendly, and embrace,
 That all their eyes may beare those Tokens home,
 Of our restored Loue, and Amitie
 
    Bish. I take your Princely word, for these redresses
 
    Iohn. I giue it you, and will maintaine my word:
 And thereupon I drinke vnto your Grace
 
    Hast. Goe Captaine, and deliuer to the Armie
 This newes of Peace: let them haue pay, and part:
 I know, it will well please them.
 High thee Captaine.
 Enter.
 
   Bish. To you, my Noble Lord of Westmerland
 
    West. I pledge your Grace:
 And if you knew what paines I haue bestow'd,
 To breede this present Peace,
 You would drinke freely: but my loue to ye,
 Shall shew it selfe more openly hereafter
 
    Bish. I doe not doubt you
 
    West. I am glad of it.
 Health to my Lord, and gentle Cousin Mowbray
 
    Mow. You wish me health in very happy season,
 For I am, on the sodaine, something ill
 
    Bish. Against ill Chances, men are euer merry,
 But heauinesse fore-runnes the good euent
 
    West. Therefore be merry (Cooze) since sodaine sorrow
 Serues to say thus: some good thing comes to morrow
 
    Bish. Beleeue me, I am passing light in spirit
 
    Mow. So much the worse, if your owne Rule be true
 
    Iohn. The word of Peace is render'd: hearke how
 they showt
 
    Mow. This had been chearefull, after Victorie
 
    Bish. A Peace is of the nature of a Conquest:
 For then both parties nobly are subdu'd,
 And neither partie looser
 
    Iohn. Goe (my Lord)
 And let our Army be discharged too:
 And good my Lord (so please you) let our Traines
 March by vs, that wee may peruse the men
 Enter.
 
 Wee should haue coap'd withall
 
    Bish. Goe, good Lord Hastings:
 And ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.
 Enter.
 
   Iohn. I trust (Lords) wee shall lye to night together.
 Enter Westmerland.
 
 Now Cousin, wherefore stands our Army still?
   West. The Leaders hauing charge from you to stand,
 Will not goe off, vntill they heare you speake
 
    Iohn. They know their duties.
 Enter Hastings.
 
   Hast. Our Army is dispers'd:
 Like youthfull Steeres, vnyoak'd, they tooke their course
 East, West, North, South: or like a Schoole, broke vp,
 Each hurryes towards his home, and sporting place
 
    West. Good tidings (my Lord Hastings) for the which,
 I doe arrest thee (Traytor) of high Treason:
 And you Lord Arch-bishop, and you Lord Mowbray,
 Of Capitall Treason, I attach you both
 
    Mow. Is this proceeding iust, and honorable?
   West. Is your Assembly so?
   Bish. Will you thus breake your faith?
   Iohn. I pawn'd thee none:
 I promis'd you redresse of these same Grieuances
 Whereof you did complaine; which, by mine Honor,
 I will performe, with a most Christian care.
 But for you (Rebels) looke to taste the due
 Meet for Rebellion, and such Acts as yours.
 Most shallowly did you these Armes commence,
 Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.
 Strike vp our Drummes, pursue the scatter'd stray,
 Heauen, and not wee, haue safely fought to day.
 Some guard these Traitors to the Block of Death,
 Treasons true Bed, and yeelder vp of breath.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter Falstaffe and Colleuile.
 
   Falst. What's your Name, Sir? of what Condition are
 you? and of what place, I pray?
   Col. I am a Knight, Sir:
 And my Name is Colleuile of the Dale
 
    Falst. Well then, Colleuile is your Name, a Knight is
 your Degree, and your Place, the Dale. Colleuile shall
 still be your Name, a Traytor your Degree, and the Dungeon
 your Place, a place deepe enough: so shall you be
 still Colleuile of the Dale
 
    Col. Are not you Sir Iohn Falstaffe?
   Falst. As good a man as he sir, who ere I am: doe yee
 yeelde sir, or shall I sweate for you? if I doe sweate, they
 are the drops of thy Louers, and they weep for thy death,
 therefore rowze vp Feare and Trembling, and do obseruance
 to my mercy
 
    Col. I thinke you are Sir Iohn Falstaffe, &amp; in that thought
 yeeld me
 
    Fal. I haue a whole Schoole of tongues in this belly of
 mine, and not a Tongue of them all, speakes anie other
 word but my name: and I had but a belly of any indifferencie,
 I were simply the most actiue fellow in Europe:
 my wombe, my wombe, my wombe vndoes mee. Heere
 comes our Generall.
 Enter Prince Iohn, and Westmerland.
 
   Iohn. The heat is past, follow no farther now:
 Call in the Powers, good Cousin Westmerland.
 Now Falstaffe, where haue you beene all this while?
 When euery thing is ended, then you come.
 These tardie Tricks of yours will (on my life)
 One time, or other, breake some Gallowes back
 
    Falst. I would bee sorry (my Lord) but it should bee
 thus: I neuer knew yet, but rebuke and checke was the
 reward of Valour. Doe you thinke me a Swallow, an Arrow,
 or a Bullet? Haue I, in my poore and olde Motion,
 the expedition of Thought? I haue speeded hither with
 the very extremest ynch of possibilitie. I haue fowndred
 nine score and odde Postes: and heere (trauell-tainted
 as I am) haue, in my pure and immaculate Valour, taken
 Sir Iohn Colleuile of the Dale, a most furious Knight, and
 valorous Enemie: But what of that? hee saw mee, and
 yeelded: that I may iustly say with the hooke-nos'd
 fellow of Rome, I came, saw, and ouer-came
 
    Iohn. It was more of his Courtesie, then your deseruing
 
    Falst. I know not: heere hee is, and heere I yeeld
 him: and I beseech your Grace, let it be book'd, with
 the rest of this dayes deedes; or I sweare, I will haue it
 in a particular Ballad, with mine owne Picture on the top
 of it (Colleuile kissing my foot:) To the which course, if
 I be enforc'd, if you do not all shew like gilt two-pences
 to me; and I, in the cleare Skie of Fame, o're-shine you
 as much as the Full Moone doth the Cynders of the Element
 (which shew like Pinnes-heads to her) beleeue not
 the Word of the Noble: therefore let mee haue right,
 and let desert mount
 
    Iohn. Thine's too heauie to mount
 
    Falst. Let it shine then
 
    Iohn. Thine's too thick to shine
 
    Falst. Let it doe something (my good Lord) that may
 doe me good, and call it what you will
 
    Iohn. Is thy Name Colleuile?
   Col. It is (my Lord.)
   Iohn. A famous Rebell art thou, Colleuile
 
    Falst. And a famous true Subiect tooke him
 
    Col. I am (my Lord) but as my Betters are,
 That led me hither: had they beene rul'd by me,
 You should haue wonne them dearer then you haue
 
    Falst. I know not how they sold themselues, but thou
 like a kinde fellow, gau'st thy selfe away; and I thanke
 thee, for thee.
 Enter Westmerland.
 
   Iohn. Haue you left pursuit?
   West. Retreat is made, and Execution stay'd
 
    Iohn. Send Colleuile, with his Confederates,
 To Yorke, to present Execution.
 Blunt, leade him hence, and see you guard him sure.
 
 Exit with Colleuile.
 
 And now dispatch we toward the Court (my Lords)
 I heare the King, my Father, is sore sicke.
 Our Newes shall goe before vs, to his Maiestie,
 Which (Cousin) you shall beare, to comfort him:
 And wee with sober speede will follow you
 
    Falst. My Lord, I beseech you, giue me leaue to goe
 through Gloucestershire: and when you come to Court,
 stand my good Lord, 'pray, in your good report
 
    Iohn. Fare you well, Falstaffe: I, in my condition,
 Shall better speake of you, then you deserue.
 Enter.
 
   Falst. I would you had but the wit: 'twere better
 then your Dukedome. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded
 Boy doth not loue me, nor a man cannot
 make him laugh: but that's no maruaile, hee drinkes no
 Wine. There's neuer any of these demure Boyes come
 to any proofe: for thinne Drinke doth so ouer-coole
 their blood, and making many Fish-Meales, that they
 fall into a kinde of Male Greene-sicknesse: and then,
 when they marry, they get Wenches. They are generally
 Fooles, and Cowards; which some of vs should be too,
 but for inflamation. A good Sherris-Sack hath a two-fold
 operation in it: it ascends me into the Braine, dryes
 me there all the foolish, and dull, and cruddie Vapours,
 which enuiron it: makes it apprehensiue, quicke, forgetiue,
 full of nimble, fierie, and delectable shapes; which
 deliuer'd o're to the Voyce, the Tongue, which is the
 Birth, becomes excellent Wit. The second propertie of
 your excellent Sherris, is, the warming of the Blood:
 which before (cold, and setled) left the Liuer white, and
 pale; which is the Badge of Pusillanimitie, and Cowardize:
 but the Sherris warmes it, and makes it course
 from the inwards, to the parts extremes: it illuminateth
 the Face, which (as a Beacon) giues warning to all the
 rest of this little Kingdome (Man) to Arme: and then
 the Vitall Commoners, and in-land pettie Spirits, muster
 me all to their Captaine, the Heart; who great, and pufft
 vp with his Retinue, doth any Deed of Courage: and this
 Valour comes of Sherris. So, that skill in the Weapon
 is nothing, without Sack (for that sets it a-worke:) and
 Learning, a meere Hoord of Gold, kept by a Deuill, till
 Sack commences it, and sets it in act, and vse. Hereof
 comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant: for the cold blood
 hee did naturally inherite of his Father, hee hath, like
 leane, stirrill, and bare Land, manured, husbanded, and
 tyll'd, with excellent endeauour of drinking good, and
 good store of fertile Sherris, that hee is become very hot,
 and valiant. If I had a thousand Sonnes, the first Principle
 I would teach them, should be to forsweare thinne Potations,
 and to addict themselues to Sack.
 Enter Bardolph.
 
 How now Bardolph?
   Bard. The Armie is discharged all, and gone
 
    Falst. Let them goe: Ile through Gloucestershire,
 and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire: I
 haue him alreadie tempering betweene my finger and my
 thombe, and shortly will I seale with him. Come away.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Scena Secunda.
 
 Enter King, Warwicke, Clarence, Gloucester.
 
   King. Now Lords, if Heauen doth giue successefull end
 To this Debate, that bleedeth at our doores,
 Wee will our Youth lead on to higher Fields,
 And draw no Swords, but what are sanctify'd.
 Our Nauie is addressed, our Power collected,
 Our Substitutes, in absence, well inuested,
 And euery thing lyes leuell to our wish;
 Onely wee want a little personall Strength:
 And pawse vs, till these Rebels, now a-foot,
 Come vnderneath the yoake of Gouernment
 
    War. Both which we doubt not, but your Maiestie
 Shall soone enioy
 
    King. Humphrey (my Sonne of Gloucester) where is
 the Prince, your Brother?
   Glo. I thinke hee's gone to hunt (my Lord) at Windsor
 
    King. And how accompanied?
   Glo. I doe not know (my Lord.)
   King. Is not his Brother, Thomas of Clarence, with
 him?
   Glo. No (my good Lord) hee is in presence heere
 
    Clar. What would my Lord, and Father?
   King. Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
 How chance thou art not with the Prince, thy Brother?
 Hee loues thee, and thou do'st neglect him (Thomas.)
 Thou hast a better place in his Affection,
 Then all thy Brothers: cherish it (my Boy)
 And Noble Offices thou may'st effect
 Of Mediation (after I am dead)
 Betweene his Greatnesse, and thy other Brethren.
 Therefore omit him not: blunt not his Loue,
 Nor loose the good aduantage of his Grace,
 By seeming cold, or carelesse of his will.
 For hee is gracious, if hee be obseru'd:
 Hee hath a Teare for Pitie, and a Hand
 Open (as Day) for melting Charitie:
 Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, hee's Flint,
 As humorous as Winter, and as sudden,
 As Flawes congealed in the Spring of day.
 His temper therefore must be well obseru'd:
 Chide him for faults, and doe it reuerently,
 When you perceiue his blood enclin'd to mirth:
 But being moodie, giue him Line, and scope,
 Till that his passions (like a Whale on ground)
 Confound themselues with working. Learne this Thomas,
 And thou shalt proue a shelter to thy friends,
 A Hoope of Gold, to binde thy Brothers in:
 That the vnited Vessell of their Blood
 (Mingled with Venome of Suggestion,
 As force, perforce, the Age will powre it in)
 Shall neuer leake, though it doe worke as strong
 As Aconitum, or rash Gun-powder
 
    Clar. I shall obserue him with all care, and loue
 
    King. Why art thou not at Windsor with him (Thomas?)
   Clar. Hee is not there to day: hee dines in London
 
    King. And how accompanyed? Canst thou tell
 that?
   Clar. With Pointz, and other his continuall followers
 
    King. Most subiect is the fattest Soyle to Weedes:
 And hee (the Noble Image of my Youth)
 Is ouer-spread with them: therefore my griefe
 Stretches it selfe beyond the howre of death.
 The blood weepes from my heart, when I doe shape
 (In formes imaginarie) th' vnguided Dayes,
 And rotten Times, that you shall looke vpon,
 When I am sleeping with my Ancestors.
 For when his head-strong Riot hath no Curbe,
 When Rage and hot-Blood are his Counsailors,
 When Meanes and lauish Manners meete together;
 Oh, with what Wings shall his Affections flye
 Towards fronting Perill, and oppos'd Decay?
   War. My gracious Lord, you looke beyond him quite:
 The Prince but studies his Companions,
 Like a strange Tongue: wherein, to gaine the Language,
 'Tis needfull, that the most immodest word
 Be look'd vpon, and learn'd: which once attayn'd,
 Your Highnesse knowes, comes to no farther vse,
 But to be knowne, and hated. So, like grosse termes,
 The Prince will, in the perfectnesse of time,
 Cast off his followers: and their memorie
 Shall as a Patterne, or a Measure, liue,
 By which his Grace must mete the liues of others,
 Turning past-euills to aduantages
 
    King. 'Tis seldome, when the Bee doth leaue her Combe
 In the dead Carrion.
 Enter Westmerland.
 
 Who's heere? Westmerland?
   West. Health to my Soueraigne, and new happinesse
 Added to that, that I am to deliuer.
 Prince Iohn, your Sonne, doth kisse your Graces Hand:
 Mowbray, the Bishop, Scroope, Hastings, and all,
 Are brought to the Correction of your Law.
 There is not now a Rebels Sword vnsheath'd,
 But Peace puts forth her Oliue euery where:
 The manner how this Action hath beene borne,
 Here (at more leysure) may your Highnesse reade,
 With euery course, in his particular
 
    King. O Westmerland, thou art a Summer Bird,
 Which euer in the haunch of Winter sings
 The lifting vp of day.
 Enter Harcourt.
 
 Looke, heere's more newes
 
    Harc. From Enemies, Heauen keepe your Maiestie:
 And when they stand against you, may they fall,
 As those that I am come to tell you of.
 The Earle Northumberland, and the Lord Bardolfe,
 With a great Power of English, and of Scots,
 Are by the Sherife of Yorkeshire ouerthrowne:
 The manner, and true order of the fight,
 This Packet (please it you) containes at large
 
    King. And wherefore should these good newes
 Make me sicke?
 Will Fortune neuer come with both hands full,
 But write her faire words still in foulest Letters?
 Shee eyther giues a Stomack, and no Foode,
 (Such are the poore, in health) or else a Feast,
 And takes away the Stomack (such are the Rich,
 That haue aboundance, and enioy it not.)
 I should reioyce now, at this happy newes,
 And now my Sight fayles, and my Braine is giddie.
 O me, come neere me, now I am much ill
 
    Glo. Comfort your Maiestie
 
    Cla. Oh, my Royall Father
 
    West. My Soueraigne Lord, cheare vp your selfe, looke
 vp
 
    War. Be patient (Princes) you doe know, these Fits
 Are with his Highnesse very ordinarie.
 Stand from him, giue him ayre:
 Hee'le straight be well
 
    Clar. No, no, hee cannot long hold out: these pangs,
 Th' incessant care, and labour of his Minde,
 Hath wrought the Mure, that should confine it in,
 So thinne, that Life lookes through, and will breake out
 
    Glo. The people feare me: for they doe obserue
 Vnfather'd Heires, and loathly Births of Nature:
 The Seasons change their manners, as the Yeere
 Had found some Moneths asleepe, and leap'd them ouer
 
    Clar. The Riuer hath thrice flow'd, no ebbe betweene:
 And the old folke (Times doting Chronicles)
 Say it did so, a little time before
 That our great Grand-sire Edward sick'd, and dy'de
 
    War. Speake lower (Princes) for the King recouers
 
    Glo. This Apoplexie will (certaine) be his end
 
    King. I pray you take me vp, and beare me hence
 Into some other Chamber: softly 'pray.
 Let there be no noyse made (my gentle friends)
 Vnlesse some dull and fauourable hand
 Will whisper Musicke to my wearie Spirit
 
    War. Call for the Musicke in the other Roome
 
    King. Set me the Crowne vpon my Pillow here
 
    Clar. His eye is hollow, and hee changes much
 
    War. Lesse noyse, lesse noyse.
 Enter Prince Henry.
 
   P.Hen. Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
   Clar. I am here (Brother) full of heauinesse
 
    P.Hen. How now? Raine within doores, and none
 abroad? How doth the King?
   Glo. Exceeding ill
 
    P.Hen. Heard hee the good newes yet?
 Tell it him
 
    Glo. Hee alter'd much, vpon the hearing it
 
    P.Hen. If hee be sicke with Ioy,
 Hee'le recouer without Physicke
 
    War. Not so much noyse (my Lords)
 Sweet Prince speake lowe,
 The King, your Father, is dispos'd to sleepe
 
    Clar. Let vs with-draw into the other Roome
 
    War. Wil't please your Grace to goe along with vs?
   P.Hen. No: I will sit, and watch here, by the King.
 Why doth the Crowne lye there, vpon his Pillow,
 Being so troublesome a Bed-fellow?
 O pollish'd Perturbation! Golden Care!
 That keep'st the Ports of Slumber open wide,
 To many a watchfull Night: sleepe with it now,
 Yet not so sound, and halfe so deepely sweete,
 As hee whose Brow (with homely Biggen bound)
 Snores out the Watch of Night. O Maiestie!
 When thou do'st pinch thy Bearer, thou do'st sit
 Like a rich Armor, worne in heat of day,
 That scald'st with safetie: by his Gates of breath,
 There lyes a dowlney feather, which stirres not:
 Did hee suspire, that light and weightlesse dowlne
 Perforce must moue. My gracious Lord, my Father,
 This sleepe is sound indeede: this is a sleepe,
 That from this Golden Rigoll hath diuorc'd
 So many English Kings. Thy due, from me,
 Is Teares, and heauie Sorrowes of the Blood,
 Which Nature, Loue, and filiall tendernesse,
 Shall (O deare Father) pay thee plenteously.
 My due, from thee, is this Imperiall Crowne,
 Which (as immediate from thy Place, and Blood)
 Deriues it selfe to me. Loe, heere it sits,
 Which Heauen shall guard:
 And put the worlds whole strength into one gyant Arme,
 It shall not force this Lineall Honor from me.
 This, from thee, will I to mine leaue,
 As 'tis left to me.
 Enter.
 
 Enter Warwicke, Gloucester, Clarence.
 
   King. Warwicke, Gloucester, Clarence
 
    Clar. Doth the King call?
   War. What would your Maiestie? how fares your
 Grace?
   King. Why did you leaue me here alone (my Lords?)
   Cla. We left the Prince (my Brother) here (my Liege)
 Who vndertooke to sit and watch by you
 
    King. The Prince of Wales? where is hee? let mee
 see him
 
    War. This doore is open, hee is gone this way
 
    Glo. Hee came not through the Chamber where wee
 stayd
 
    King. Where is the Crowne? who tooke it from my
 Pillow?
   War. When wee with-drew (my Liege) wee left it
 heere
 
    King. The Prince hath ta'ne it hence:
 Goe seeke him out.
 Is hee so hastie, that hee doth suppose
 My sleepe, my death? Finde him (my Lord of Warwick)
 Chide him hither: this part of his conioynes
 With my disease, and helpes to end me.
 See Sonnes, what things you are:
 How quickly Nature falls into reuolt,
 When Gold becomes her Obiect?
 For this, the foolish ouer-carefull Fathers
 Haue broke their sleepes with thoughts,
 Their braines with care, their bones with industry.
 For this, they haue ingrossed and pyl'd vp
 The canker'd heapes of strange-atchieued Gold:
 For this, they haue beene thoughtfull, to inuest
 Their Sonnes with Arts, and Martiall Exercises:
 When, like the Bee, culling from euery flower
 The vertuous Sweetes, our Thighes packt with Wax,
 Our Mouthes with Honey, wee bring it to the Hiue;
 And like the Bees, are murthered for our paines.
 This bitter taste yeelds his engrossements,
 To the ending Father.
 Enter Warwicke.
 
 Now, where is hee, that will not stay so long,
 Till his Friend Sicknesse hath determin'd me?
   War. My Lord, I found the Prince in the next Roome,
 Washing with kindly Teares his gentle Cheekes,
 With such a deepe demeanure, in great sorrow,
 That Tyranny, which neuer quafft but blood,
 Would (by beholding him) haue wash'd his Knife
 With gentle eye-drops. Hee is comming hither
 
    King. But wherefore did hee take away the Crowne?
 Enter Prince Henry.
 
 Loe, where hee comes. Come hither to me (Harry.)
 Depart the Chamber, leaue vs heere alone.
 Enter.
 
   P.Hen. I neuer thought to heare you speake againe
 
    King. Thy wish was Father (Harry) to that thought:
 I stay too long by thee, I wearie thee.
 Do'st thou so hunger for my emptie Chayre,
 That thou wilt needes inuest thee with mine Honors,
 Before thy howre be ripe? O foolish Youth!
 Thou seek'st the Greatnesse, that will ouer-whelme thee.
 Stay but a little: for my Cloud of Dignitie
 Is held from falling, with so weake a winde,
 That it will quickly drop: my Day is dimme.
 Thou hast stolne that, which after some few howres
 Were thine, without offence: and at my death
 Thou hast seal'd vp my expectation.
 Thy Life did manifest, thou lou'dst me not,
 And thou wilt haue me dye assur'd of it.
 Thou hid'st a thousand Daggers in thy thoughts,
 Which thou hast whetted on thy stonie heart,
 To stab at halfe an howre of my Life.
 What? canst thou not forbeare me halfe an howre?
 Then get thee gone, and digge my graue thy selfe,
 And bid the merry Bels ring to thy eare
 That thou art Crowned, not that I am dead.
 Let all the Teares, that should bedew my Hearse
 Be drops of Balme, to sanctifie thy head:
 Onely compound me with forgotten dust.
 Giue that, which gaue thee life, vnto the Wormes:
 Plucke downe my Officers, breake my Decrees;
 For now a time is come, to mocke at Forme.
 Henry the fift is Crown'd: Vp Vanity,
 Downe Royall State: All you sage Counsailors, hence:
 And to the English Court, assemble now
 From eu'ry Region, Apes of Idlenesse.
 Now neighbor-Confines, purge you of your Scum:
 Haue you a Ruffian that will sweare? drinke? dance?
 Reuell the night? Rob? Murder? and commit
 The oldest sinnes, the newest kinde of wayes?
 Be happy, he will trouble you no more:
 England, shall double gill'd, his trebble guilt.
 England, shall giue him Office, Honor, Might:
 For the Fift Harry, from curb'd License pluckes
 The muzzle of Restraint; and the wilde Dogge
 Shall flesh his tooth in euery Innocent.
 O my poore Kingdome (sicke, with ciuill blowes)
 When that my Care could not with-hold thy Ryots,
 What wilt thou do, when Ryot is thy Care?
 O, thou wilt be a Wildernesse againe,
 Peopled with Wolues (thy old Inhabitants.)
   Prince. O pardon me (my Liege)
 But for my Teares,
 The most Impediments vnto my Speech,
 I had fore-stall'd this deere, and deepe Rebuke,
 Ere you (with greefe) had spoke, and I had heard
 The course of it so farre. There is your Crowne,
 And he that weares the Crowne immortally,
 Long guard it yours. If I affect it more,
 Then as your Honour, and as your Renowne,
 Let me no more from this Obedience rise,
 Which my most true, and inward duteous Spirit
 Teacheth this prostrate, and exteriour bending.
 Heauen witnesse with me, when I heere came in,
 And found no course of breath within your Maiestie,
 How cold it strooke my heart. If I do faine,
 O let me, in my present wildenesse, dye,
 And neuer liue, to shew th' incredulous World,
 The Noble change that I haue purposed.
 Comming to looke on you, thinking you dead,
 (And dead almost (my Liege) to thinke you were)
 I spake vnto the Crowne (as hauing sense)
 And thus vpbraided it. The Care on thee depending,
 Hath fed vpon the body of my Father,
 Therefore, thou best of Gold, art worst of Gold.
 Other, lesse fine in Charract, is more precious,
 Preseruing life, in Med'cine potable:
 But thou, most Fine, most Honour'd, most Renown'd,
 Hast eate the Bearer vp.
 Thus (my Royall Liege)
 Accusing it, I put it on my Head,
 To try with it (as with an Enemie,
 That had before my face murdred my Father)
 The Quarrell of a true Inheritor.
 But if it did infect my blood with Ioy,
 Or swell my Thoughts, to any straine of Pride,
 If any Rebell, or vaine spirit of mine,
 Did, with the least Affection of a Welcome,
 Giue entertainment to the might of it,
 Let heauen, for euer, keepe it from my head,
 And make me, as the poorest Vassaile is,
 That doth with awe, and terror kneele to it
 
    King. O my Sonne!
 Heauen put it in thy minde to take it hence,
 That thou might'st ioyne the more, thy Fathers loue,
 Pleading so wisely, in excuse of it.
 Come hither Harrie, sit thou by my bedde,
 And heare (I thinke, the very latest Counsell
 That euer I shall breath: Heauen knowes, my Sonne)
 By what by-pathes, and indirect crook'd-wayes
 I met this Crowne: and I my selfe know well
 How troublesome it sate vpon my head.
 To thee, it shall descend with better Quiet,
 Better Opinion, better Confirmation:
 For all the soyle of the Atchieuement goes
 With me, into the Earth. It seem'd in mee,
 But as an Honour snatch'd with boyst'rous hand,
 And I had many liuing, to vpbraide
 My gaine of it, by their Assistances,
 Which dayly grew to Quarrell, and to Blood-shed,
 Wounding supposed Peace.
 All these bold Feares,
 Thou seest (with perill) I haue answered:
 For all my Reigne, hath beene but as a Scene
 Acting that argument. And now my death
 Changes the Moode: For what in me, was purchas'd,
 Falles vpon thee, in a more Fayrer sort.
 So thou, the Garland wear'st successiuely.
 Yet, though thou stand'st more sure, then I could do,
 Thou art not firme enough, since greefes are greene:
 And all thy Friends, which thou must make thy Friends
 Haue but their stings, and teeth, newly tak'n out,
 By whose fell working, I was first aduanc'd,
 And by whose power, I well might lodge a Feare
 To be againe displac'd. Which to auoyd,
 I cut them off: and had a purpose now
 To leade out many to the Holy Land;
 Least rest, and lying still, might make them looke
 Too neere vnto my State.
 Therefore (my Harrie)
 Be it thy course to busie giddy Mindes
 With Forraigne Quarrels: that Action hence borne out,
 May waste the memory of the former dayes.
 More would I, but my Lungs are wasted so,
 That strength of Speech it vtterly deni'de mee.
 How I came by the Crowne, O heauen forgiue:
 And grant it may, with thee, in true peace liue
 
    Prince. My gracious Liege:
 You wonne it, wore it: kept it, gaue it me,
 Then plaine and right must my possession be;
 Which I, with more, then with a Common paine,
 'Gainst all the World, will rightfully maintaine.
 Enter Lord Iohn of Lancaster, and Warwicke.
 
   King. Looke, looke,
 Heere comes my Iohn of Lancaster:
   Iohn. Health, Peace, and Happinesse,
 To my Royall Father
 
    King. Thou bring'st me happinesse and Peace
 (Sonne Iohn:)
 But health (alacke) with youthfull wings is flowne
 From this bare, wither'd Trunke. Vpon thy sight
 My worldly businesse makes a period.
 Where is my Lord of Warwicke?
   Prin. My Lord of Warwicke
 
    King. Doth any name particular, belong
 Vnto the Lodging, where I first did swoon'd?
   War. 'Tis call'd Ierusalem, my Noble Lord
 
    King. Laud be to heauen:
 Euen there my life must end.
 It hath beene prophesi'de to me many yeares,
 I should not dye, but in Ierusalem:
 Which (vainly) I suppos'd the Holy-Land.
 But beare me to that Chamber, there Ile lye:
 In that Ierusalem, shall Harry dye.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Actus Quintus. Scoena Prima.
 
 Enter Shallow, Silence, Falstaffe, Bardolfe, Page, and Dauie.
 
   Shal. By Cocke and Pye, you shall not away to night.
 What Dauy, I say
 
    Fal. You must excuse me, M[aster]. Robert Shallow
 
    Shal. I will not excuse you: you shall not be excused.
 Excuses shall not be admitted: there is no excuse shall
 serue: you shall not be excus'd.
 Why Dauie
 
    Dauie. Heere sir
 
    Shal. Dauy, Dauy, Dauy, let me see (Dauy) let me see:
 William Cooke, bid him come hither. Sir Iohn, you shal
 not be excus'd
 
    Dauy. Marry sir, thus: those Precepts cannot bee
 seru'd: and againe sir, shall we sowe the head-land with
 Wheate?
   Shal. With red Wheate Dauy. But for William Cook:
 are there no yong Pigeons?
   Dauy. Yes Sir.
 Heere is now the Smithes note, for Shooing,
 And Plough-Irons
 
    Shal. Let it be cast, and payde: Sir Iohn, you shall
 not be excus'd
 
    Dauy. Sir, a new linke to the Bucket must needes bee
 had: And Sir, doe you meane to stoppe any of Williams
 Wages, about the Sacke he lost the other day, at Hinckley
 Fayre?
   Shal. He shall answer it:
 Some Pigeons Dauy, a couple of short-legg'd Hennes: a
 ioynt of Mutton, and any pretty little tine Kickshawes,
 tell William Cooke
 
    Dauy. Doth the man of Warre, stay all night sir?
   Shal. Yes Dauy:
 I will vse him well. A Friend i'th Court, is better then a
 penny in purse. Vse his men well Dauy, for they are arrant
 Knaues, and will backe-bite
 
    Dauy. No worse then they are bitten, sir: For they
 haue maruellous fowle linnen
 
    Shallow. Well conceited Dauy: about thy Businesse,
 Dauy
 
    Dauy. I beseech you sir,
 To countenance William Visor of Woncot, against Clement
 Perkes of the hill
 
    Shal. There are many Complaints Dauy, against that
 Visor, that Visor is an arrant Knaue, on my knowledge
 
    Dauy. I graunt your Worship, that he is a knaue (Sir:)
 But yet heauen forbid Sir, but a Knaue should haue some
 Countenance, at his Friends request. An honest man sir,
 is able to speake for himselfe, when a Knaue is not. I haue
 seru'd your Worshippe truely sir, these eight yeares: and
 if I cannot once or twice in a Quarter beare out a knaue,
 against an honest man, I haue but a very litle credite with
 your Worshippe. The Knaue is mine honest Friend Sir,
 therefore I beseech your Worship, let him bee Countenanc'd
 
    Shal. Go too,
 I say he shall haue no wrong: Looke about Dauy.
 Where are you Sir Iohn? Come, off with your Boots.
 Giue me your hand M[aster]. Bardolfe
 
    Bard. I am glad to see your Worship
 
    Shal. I thanke thee, with all my heart, kinde Master
 Bardolfe: and welcome my tall Fellow:
 Come Sir Iohn
 
    Falstaffe. Ile follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.
 Bardolfe, looke to our Horsses. If I were saw'de into
 Quantities, I should make foure dozen of such bearded
 Hermites staues, as Master Shallow. It is a wonderfull
 thing to see the semblable Coherence of his mens spirits,
 and his: They, by obseruing of him, do beare themselues
 like foolish Iustices: Hee, by conuersing with them, is
 turn'd into a Iustice-like Seruingman. Their spirits are
 so married in Coniunction, with the participation of Society,
 that they flocke together in consent, like so many
 Wilde-Geese. If I had a suite to Mayster Shallow, I
 would humour his men, with the imputation of beeing
 neere their Mayster. If to his Men, I would currie with
 Maister Shallow, that no man could better command his
 Seruants. It is certaine, that either wise bearing, or ignorant
 Carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of
 another: therefore, let men take heede of their Companie.
 I will deuise matter enough out of this Shallow, to
 keepe Prince Harry in continuall Laughter, the wearing
 out of sixe Fashions (which is foure Tearmes) or two Actions,
 and he shall laugh with Interuallums. O it is much
 that a Lye (with a slight Oath) and a iest (with a sadde
 brow) will doe, with a Fellow, that neuer had the Ache
 in his shoulders. O you shall see him laugh, till his Face
 be like a wet Cloake, ill laid vp
 
    Shal. Sir Iohn
 
    Falst. I come Master Shallow, I come Master Shallow.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Scena Secunda.
 
 
 Enter the Earle of Warwicke, and the Lord Chiefe Iustice.
 
   Warwicke. How now, my Lord Chiefe Iustice, whether
 away?
   Ch.Iust. How doth the King?
   Warw. Exceeding well: his Cares
 Are now, all ended
 
    Ch.Iust. I hope, not dead
 
    Warw. Hee's walk'd the way of Nature,
 And to our purposes, he liues no more
 
    Ch.Iust. I would his Maiesty had call'd me with him,
 The seruice, that I truly did his life,
 Hath left me open to all iniuries
 
    War. Indeed I thinke the yong King loues you not
 
    Ch.Iust. I know he doth not, and do arme my selfe
 To welcome the condition of the Time,
 Which cannot looke more hideously vpon me,
 Then I haue drawne it in my fantasie.
 Enter Iohn of Lancaster, Gloucester, and Clarence.
 
   War. Heere come the heauy Issue of dead Harrie:
 O, that the liuing Harrie had the temper
 Of him, the worst of these three Gentlemen:
 How many Nobles then, should hold their places,
 That must strike saile, to Spirits of vilde sort?
   Ch.Iust. Alas, I feare, all will be ouer-turn'd
 
    Iohn. Good morrow Cosin Warwick, good morrow
 
    Glou. Cla. Good morrow, Cosin
 
    Iohn. We meet, like men, that had forgot to speake
 
    War. We do remember: but our Argument
 Is all too heauy, to admit much talke
 
    Ioh. Well: Peace be with him, that hath made vs heauy
   Ch.Iust. Peace be with vs, least we be heauier
 
    Glou. O, good my Lord, you haue lost a friend indeed:
 And I dare sweare, you borrow not that face
 Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your owne
 
    Iohn. Though no man be assur'd what grace to finde,
 You stand in coldest expectation.
 I am the sorrier, would 'twere otherwise
 
    Cla. Wel, you must now speake Sir Iohn Falstaffe faire,
 Which swimmes against your streame of Quality
 
    Ch.Iust. Sweet Princes: what I did, I did in Honor,
 Led by th' Imperiall Conduct of my Soule,
 And neuer shall you see, that I will begge
 A ragged, and fore-stall'd Remission.
 If Troth, and vpright Innocency fayle me,
 Ile to the King (my Master) that is dead,
 And tell him, who hath sent me after him
 
    War. Heere comes the Prince.
 Enter Prince Henrie.
 
   Ch.Iust. Good morrow: and heauen saue your Maiesty
   Prince. This new, and gorgeous Garment, Maiesty,
 Sits not so easie on me, as you thinke.
 Brothers, you mixe your Sadnesse with some Feare:
 This is the English, not the Turkish Court:
 Not Amurah, an Amurah succeeds,
 But Harry, Harry: Yet be sad (good Brothers)
 For (to speake truth) it very well becomes you:
 Sorrow, so Royally in you appeares,
 That I will deeply put the Fashion on,
 And weare it in my heart. Why then be sad,
 But entertaine no more of it (good Brothers)
 Then a ioynt burthen, laid vpon vs all.
 For me, by Heauen (I bid you be assur'd)
 Ile be your Father, and your Brother too:
 Let me but beare your Loue, Ile beare your Cares;
 But weepe that Harrie's dead, and so will I.
 But Harry liues, that shall conuert those Teares
 By number, into houres of Happinesse
 
    Iohn, &amp;c. We hope no other from your Maiesty
 
    Prin. You all looke strangely on me: and you most,
 You are (I thinke) assur'd, I loue you not
 
    Ch.Iust. I am assur'd (if I be measur'd rightly)
 Your Maiesty hath no iust cause to hate mee
 
    Pr. No? How might a Prince of my great hopes forget
 So great Indignities you laid vpon me?
 What? Rate? Rebuke? and roughly send to Prison
 Th' immediate Heire of England? Was this easie?
 May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?
   Ch.Iust. I then did vse the Person of your Father:
 The Image of his power, lay then in me,
 And in th' administration of his Law,
 Whiles I was busie for the Commonwealth,
 Your Highnesse pleased to forget my place,
 The Maiesty, and power of Law, and Iustice,
 The Image of the King, whom I presented,
 And strooke me in my very Seate of Iudgement:
 Whereon (as an Offender to your Father)
 I gaue bold way to my Authority,
 And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
 Be you contented, wearing now the Garland,
 To haue a Sonne, set your Decrees at naught?
 To plucke downe Iustice from your awefull Bench?
 To trip the course of Law, and blunt the Sword
 That guards the peace, and safety of your Person?
 Nay more, to spurne at your most Royall Image,
 And mocke your workings, in a Second body?
 Question your Royall Thoughts, make the case yours:
 Be now the Father, and propose a Sonne:
 Heare your owne dignity so much prophan'd,
 See your most dreadfull Lawes, so loosely slighted;
 Behold your selfe, so by a Sonne disdained:
 And then imagine me, taking your part,
 And in your power, soft silencing your Sonne:
 After this cold considerance, sentence me;
 And, as you are a King, speake in your State,
 What I haue done, that misbecame my place,
 My person, or my Lieges Soueraigntie
 
    Prin. You are right Iustice, and you weigh this well:
 Therefore still beare the Ballance, and the Sword:
 And I do wish your Honors may encrease,
 Till you do liue, to see a Sonne of mine
 Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
 So shall I liue, to speake my Fathers words:
 Happy am I, that haue a man so bold,
 That dares do Iustice, on my proper Sonne;
 And no lesse happy, hauing such a Sonne,
 That would deliuer vp his Greatnesse so,
 Into the hands of Iustice. You did commit me:
 For which, I do commit into your hand,
 Th' vnstained Sword that you haue vs'd to beare:
 With this Remembrance; That you vse the same
 With the like bold, iust, and impartiall spirit
 As you haue done 'gainst me. There is my hand,
 You shall be as a Father, to my Youth:
 My voice shall sound, as you do prompt mine eare,
 And I will stoope, and humble my Intents,
 To your well-practis'd, wise Directions.
 And Princes all, beleeue me, I beseech you:
 My Father is gone wilde into his Graue,
 (For in his Tombe, lye my Affections)
 And with his Spirits, sadly I suruiue,
 To mocke the expectation of the World;
 To frustrate Prophesies, and to race out
 Rotten Opinion, who hath writ me downe
 After my seeming. The Tide of Blood in me,
 Hath prowdly flow'd in Vanity, till now.
 Now doth it turne, and ebbe backe to the Sea,
 Where it shall mingle with the state of Floods,
 And flow henceforth in formall Maiesty.
 Now call we our High Court of Parliament,
 And let vs choose such Limbes of Noble Counsaile,
 That the great Body of our State may go
 In equall ranke, with the best gouern'd Nation,
 That Warre, or Peace, or both at once may be
 As things acquainted and familiar to vs,
 In which you (Father) shall haue formost hand.
 Our Coronation done, we will accite
 (As I before remembred) all our State,
 And heauen (consigning to my good intents)
 No Prince, nor Peere, shall haue iust cause to say,
 Heauen shorten Harries happy life, one day.
 
 Exeunt.

 Silence, and then to bed

 Lads rome heere, and there: so merrily, and euer among

    Shal. Good M[aster]. Bardolfe: some wine, Dauie
 
    Da. Sweet sir, sit: Ile be with you anon: most sweete

 you want in meate, wee'l haue in drinke: but you beare,
 the heart's all
 
    Shal. Be merry M[aster]. Bardolfe, and my little Souldiour
 there, be merry
 
    Sil. Be merry, be merry, my wife ha's all.
 For women are Shrewes, both short, and tall:
 'Tis merry in Hall, when Beards wagge all;
 And welcome merry Shrouetide. Be merry, be merry
 
    Fal. I did not thinke M[aster]. Silence had bin a man of this
 Mettle
 
    Sil. Who I? I haue beene merry twice and once, ere

    Dauy. There is a dish of Lether-coats for you
 
    Shal. Dauie
 
    Dau. Your Worship: Ile be with you straight. A cup
 of Wine, sir?
   Sil. A Cup of Wine, that's briske and fine, &amp; drinke
 vnto the Leman mine: and a merry heart liues long-a
 
    Fal. Well said, M[aster]. Silence
 
    Sil. If we shall be merry, now comes in the sweete of
 the night
 
    Fal. Health, and long life to you, M[aster]. Silence
 
    Sil. Fill the Cuppe, and let it come. Ile pledge you a
 mile to the bottome
 
    Shal. Honest Bardolfe, welcome: If thou want'st any
 thing, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome my
 little tyne theefe, and welcome indeed too: Ile drinke to
 M[aster]. Bardolfe, and to all the Cauileroes about London
 
    Dau. I hope to see London, once ere I die
 
    Bar. If I might see you there, Dauie
 
    Shal. You'l cracke a quart together? Ha, will you not
 M[aster]. Bardolfe?
   Bar. Yes Sir, in a pottle pot
 
    Shal. I thanke thee: the knaue will sticke by thee, I
 can assure thee that. He will not out, he is true bred
 
    Bar. And Ile sticke by him, sir
 
    Shal. Why there spoke a King: lack nothing, be merry.
 Looke, who's at doore there, ho: who knockes?
   Fal. Why now you haue done me right
 
    Sil. Do me right, and dub me Knight, Samingo. Is't
 not so?
   Fal. 'Tis so
 
    Sil. Is't so? Why then say an old man can do somwhat
 
    Dau. If it please your Worshippe, there's one Pistoll
 come from the Court with newes
 
    Fal. From the Court? Let him come in.
 Enter Pistoll.
 
 How now Pistoll?
   Pist. Sir Iohn, 'saue you sir
 
    Fal. What winde blew you hither, Pistoll?
   Pist. Not the ill winde which blowes none to good,
 sweet Knight: Thou art now one of the greatest men in
 the Realme
 
    Sil. Indeed, I thinke he bee, but Goodman Puffe of
 Barson

 And shall good newes be baffel'd?
 Then Pistoll lay thy head in Furies lappe
 
    Shal. Honest Gentleman,

 If sir, you come with news from the Court, I take it, there

 Bezonian, speake, or dye

 Harry the Fift's the man, I speake the truth.
 When Pistoll lyes, do this, and figge-me, like
 The bragging Spaniard
 
    Fal. What, is the old King dead?

 In the Land, 'tis thine. Pistol, I will double charge thee
 With Dignities

 I would not take a Knighthood for my Fortune

 Lord Shallow, be what thou wilt, I am Fortunes Steward.
 Get on thy Boots, wee'l ride all night. Oh sweet Pistoll:
 Away Bardolfe: Come Pistoll, vtter more to mee: and
 withall deuise something to do thy selfe good. Boote,
 boote Master Shallow, I know the young King is sick for

    Off. The Constables haue deliuer'd her ouer to mee:
 and shee shall haue Whipping cheere enough, I warrant
 her. There hath beene a man or two (lately) kill'd about

    Dol. Nut-hooke, nut-hooke, you Lye: Come on, Ile

 Childe I now go with, do miscarrie, thou had'st better
 thou had'st strooke thy Mother, thou Paper-fac'd Villaine
 
    Host. O that Sir Iohn were come, hee would make

    Pistol. Blesse thy Lungs, good Knight
 
    Falst. Come heere Pistol, stand behind me. O if I had
 had time to haue made new Liueries, I would haue bestowed
 the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But it is
 no matter, this poore shew doth better: this doth inferre
 the zeale I had to see him
 
    Shal. It doth so
 
    Falst. It shewes my earnestnesse in affection
 
    Pist. It doth so
 
    Fal. My deuotion
 
    Pist. It doth, it doth, it doth
 
    Fal. As it were, to ride day and night,
 And not to deliberate, not to remember,
 Not to haue patience to shift me
 
    Shal. It is most certaine
 
    Fal. But to stand stained with Trauaile, and sweating
 with desire to see him, thinking of nothing else, putting
 all affayres in obliuion, as if there were nothing els to bee
 done, but to see him
 
    Pist. 'Tis semper idem: for obsque hoc nihil est. 'Tis all
 in euery part
 
    Shal. 'Tis so indeed
 
    Pist. My Knight, I will enflame thy Noble Liuer, and
 make thee rage. Thy Dol, and Helen of thy noble thoghts
 is in base Durance, and contagious prison: Hall'd thither
 by most Mechanicall and durty hand. Rowze vppe
 Reuenge from Ebon den, with fell Alecto's Snake, for
 Dol is in. Pistol, speakes nought but troth
 
    Fal. I will deliuer her
 
    Pistol. There roar'd the Sea: and Trumpet Clangour
 sounds.
 
 The Trumpets sound. Enter King Henrie the Fift, Brothers, Lord
 Chiefe
 Iustice.
 
   Falst. Saue thy Grace, King Hall, my Royall Hall
 
    Pist. The heauens thee guard, and keepe, most royall
 Impe of Fame
 
    Fal. 'Saue thee my sweet Boy
 
    King. My Lord Chiefe Iustice, speake to that vaine
 man
 
    Ch.Iust. Haue you your wits?
 Know you what 'tis you speake?
   Falst. My King, my Ioue; I speake to thee, my heart
 
    King. I know thee not, old man: Fall to thy Prayers:
 How ill white haires become a Foole, and Iester?
 I haue long dream'd of such a kinde of man,
 So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so prophane:
 But being awake, I do despise my dreame.
 Make lesse thy body (hence) and more thy Grace,
 Leaue gourmandizing; Know the Graue doth gape
 For thee, thrice wider then for other men.
 Reply not to me, with a Foole-borne Iest,
 Presume not, that I am the thing I was,
 For heauen doth know (so shall the world perceiue)
 That I haue turn'd away my former Selfe,
 So will I those that kept me Companie.
 When thou dost heare I am, as I haue bin,
 Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou was't
 The Tutor and the Feeder of my Riots:
 Till then, I banish thee, on paine of death,
 As I haue done the rest of my Misleaders,
 Not to come neere our Person, by ten mile.
 For competence of life, I will allow you,
 That lacke of meanes enforce you not to euill:
 And as we heare you do reforme your selues,
 We will according to your strength, and qualities,
 Giue you aduancement. Be it your charge (my Lord)
 To see perform'd the tenure of our word. Set on.
 
 Exit King.
 
   Fal. Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound
 
    Shal. I marry Sir Iohn, which I beseech you to let me
 haue home with me
 
    Fal. That can hardly be, M[aster]. Shallow, do not you grieue
 at this: I shall be sent for in priuate to him: Looke you,
 he must seeme thus to the world: feare not your aduancement:
 I will be the man yet, that shall make you great
 
    Shal. I cannot well perceiue how, vnlesse you should
 giue me your Doublet, and stuffe me out with Straw. I
 beseech you, good Sir Iohn, let mee haue fiue hundred of
 my thousand
 
    Fal. Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you
 heard, was but a colour
 
    Shall. A colour I feare, that you will dye in, Sir Iohn
 
    Fal. Feare no colours, go with me to dinner:
 Come Lieutenant Pistol, come Bardolfe,
 I shall be sent for soone at night
 
    Ch.Iust. Go carry Sir Iohn Falstaffe to the Fleete,
 Take all his Company along with him
 
    Fal. My Lord, my Lord
 
    Ch.Iust. I cannot now speake, I will heare you soone:
 Take them away
 
    Pist. Si fortuna me tormento, spera me contento.
 
 Exit. Manent Lancaster and Chiefe Iustice
 
    Iohn. I like this faire proceeding of the Kings:
 He hath intent his wonted Followers
 Shall all be very well prouided for:
 But all are banisht, till their conuersations
 Appeare more wise, and modest to the world
 
    Ch.Iust. And so they are
 
    Iohn. The King hath call'd his Parliament,
 My Lord
 
    Ch.Iust. He hath
 
    Iohn. I will lay oddes, that ere this yeere expire,
 We beare our Ciuill Swords, and Natiue fire
 As farre as France. I heare a Bird so sing,
 Whose Musicke (to my thinking) pleas'd the King.
 Come, will you hence?
 
 Exeunt.

 First, my Feare: then, my Curtsie: last, my Speech.
 My Feare, is your Displeasure: My Curtsie, my Dutie:
 And my speech, to Begge your Pardons. If you looke for a
 good speech now, you vndoe me: For what I haue to say, is
 of mine owne making: and what (indeed) I should say, will
 (I doubt) prooue mine owne marring. But to the Purpose,
 and so to the Venture. Be it knowne to you (as it is very
 well) I was lately heere in the end of a displeasing Play, to pray
 your
 Patien for it, and to promise you a Better: I did meane (indeede) to
 pay you with
 thi which if (like an ill Venture) it come vnluckily home, I breake;
 and you,
 my Creditors lose. Heere I promist you I would be, and heere I
 commit my Bodie
 to your Mercies: Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as
 most Debtors d
 promise you infinitely.
 If my Tongue cannot entreate you to acquit me: will you command
 me to vse
 my Legges? And yet that were but light payment, to Dance out of
 your debt:
 But
 a good Conscience, will make any possible satisfaction, and so
 will I. All
 the

 One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much cloid with

 know) Fals

 Epilogue. The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, Containing his

 The Life of Henry the Fift
 
 Enter Prologue.
 
 O For a Muse of Fire, that would ascend
 The brightest Heauen of Inuention:
 A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act,
 And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene.
 Then should the Warlike Harry, like himselfe,
 Assume the Port of Mars, and at his heeles
 (Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire
 Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:
 The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd,
 On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth
 So great an Obiect. Can this Cock-Pit hold
 The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme
 Within this Woodden O, the very Caskes
 That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?
 O pardon: since a crooked Figure may
 Attest in little place a Million,
 And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt,
 On your imaginarie Forces worke.
 Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls
 Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies,
 Whose high, vp-reared, and abutting Fronts,
 The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder.
 Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:
 Into a thousand parts diuide one Man,
 And make imaginarie Puissance.
 Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them
 Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:
 For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings,
 Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;
 Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres
 Into an Howre-glasse: for the which supplie,
 Admit me Chorus to this Historie;
 Who Prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
 Gently to heare, kindly to iudge our Play.
 Enter.
 
 
 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
 
 Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.
 
   Bish.Cant. My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd,
 Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign
 Was like, and had indeed against vs past,
 But that the scambling and vnquiet time
 Did push it out of farther question
 
    Bish.Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now?
   Bish.Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,
 We loose the better halfe of our Possession:
 For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout
 By Testament haue giuen to the Church,
 Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,
 As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,
 Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,
 Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:
 And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age
 Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,
 A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd:
 And to the Coffers of the King beside,
 A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill
 
    Bish.Ely. This would drinke deepe
 
    Bish.Cant. 'Twould drinke the Cup and all
 
    Bish.Ely. But what preuention?
   Bish.Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard
 
    Bish.Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church
 
    Bish.Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
 The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,
 But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,
 Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,
 Consideration like an Angell came,
 And whipt th' offending Adam out of him;
 Leauing his body as a Paradise,
 T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.
 Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:
 Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,
 With such a heady currance scowring faults:
 Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse
 So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;
 As in this King
 
    Bish.Ely. We are blessed in the Change
 
    Bish.Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;
 And all-admiring, with an inward wish
 You would desire the King were made a Prelate:
 Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;
 You would say, it hath been all in all his study:
 List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare
 A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.
 Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,
 The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,
 Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,
 The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,
 And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,
 To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:
 So that the Art and Practique part of Life,
 Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.
 Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,
 Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,
 His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,
 His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;
 And neuer noted in him any studie,
 Any retyrement, any sequestration,
 From open Haunts and Popularitie
 
    B.Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,
 And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,
 Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:
 And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation
 Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)
 Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,
 Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie
 
    B.Cant. It must be so; for Miracles are ceast:
 And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,
 How things are perfected
 
    B.Ely. But my good Lord:
 How now for mittigation of this Bill,
 Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie
 Incline to it, or no?
   B.Cant. He seemes indifferent:
 Or rather swaying more vpon our part,
 Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:
 For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,
 Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,
 And in regard of Causes now in hand,
 Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,
 As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,
 Then euer at one time the Clergie yet
 Did to his Predecessors part withall
 
    B.Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?
   B.Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie:
 Saue that there was not time enough to heare,
 As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,
 The seueralls and vnhidden passages
 Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,
 And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,
 Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather
 
    B.Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off?
   B.Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant
 Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,
 To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?
   B.Ely. It is
 
    B.Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:
 Which I could with a ready guesse declare,
 Before the Frenchman speake a word of it
 
    B.Ely. Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick,
 Westmerland, and
 Exeter.
 
   King. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
   Exeter. Not here in presence
 
    King. Send for him, good Vnckle
 
    Westm. Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege?
   King. Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd,
 Before we heare him, of some things of weight,
 That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.
 Enter two Bishops.
 
   B.Cant. God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne,
 And make you long become it
 
    King. Sure we thanke you.
 My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,
 And iustly and religiously vnfold,
 Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,
 Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:
 And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,
 That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
 Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,
 With opening Titles miscreate, whose right
 Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:
 For God doth know, how many now in health,
 Shall drop their blood, in approbation
 Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.
 Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,
 How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;
 We charge you in the Name of God take heed:
 For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,
 Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops
 Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,
 'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,
 That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.
 Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:
 For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,
 That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,
 As pure as sinne with Baptisme
 
    B.Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, &amp; you Peers,
 That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,
 To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre
 To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,
 But this which they produce from Pharamond,
 In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,
 No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:
 Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze
 To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond
 The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.
 Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,
 That the Land Salike is in Germanie,
 Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:
 Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,
 There left behind and settled certaine French:
 Who holding in disdaine the German Women,
 For some dishonest manners of their life,
 Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female
 Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:
 Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,
 Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen.
 Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law
 Was not deuised for the Realme of France:
 Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land,
 Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
 After defunction of King Pharamond,
 Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,
 Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,
 Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great
 Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
 Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere
 Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,
 King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,
 Did as Heire Generall, being descended
 Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,
 Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.
 Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne
 Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male
 Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:
 To find his Title with some shewes of truth,
 Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
 Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare,
 Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne
 To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne
 Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,
 Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,
 Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,
 Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,
 That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,
 Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,
 Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:
 By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great
 Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.
 So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,
 King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,
 King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare
 To hold in Right and Title of the Female:
 So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.
 Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,
 To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,
 And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,
 Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,
 Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors
 
    King. May I with right and conscience make this claim?
   Bish.Cant. The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:
 For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ,
 When the man dyes, let the Inheritance
 Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,
 Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,
 Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:
 Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,
 From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,
 And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince,
 Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie,
 Making defeat on the full Power of France:
 Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill
 Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe
 Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.
 O Noble English, that could entertaine
 With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,
 And let another halfe stand laughing by,
 All out of worke, and cold for action
 
    Bish. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
 And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;
 You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:
 The Blood and Courage that renowned them,
 Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege
 Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,
 Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises
 
    Exe. Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth
 Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,
 As did the former Lyons of your Blood
 
    West. They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;
 So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England
 Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,
 Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,
 And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France
 
    Bish.Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege
 With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:
 In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie
 Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,
 As neuer did the Clergie at one time
 Bring in to any of your Ancestors
 
    King. We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,
 But lay downe our proportions, to defend
 Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,
 With all aduantages
 
    Bish.Can. They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,
 Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend
 Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers
 
    King. We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,
 But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,
 Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:
 For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather
 Neuer went with his forces into France,
 But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,
 Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,
 With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,
 Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,
 Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:
 That England being emptie of defence,
 Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood
 
    B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:
 For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,
 When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,
 And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,
 Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,
 But taken and impounded as a Stray,
 The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,
 To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,
 And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,
 As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea
 With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries
 
    Bish.Ely. But there's a saying very old and true,
 If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.
 For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,
 To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)
 Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,
 Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,
 To tame and hauocke more then she can eate
 
    Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,
 Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
 Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,
 And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.
 While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,
 Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:
 For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,
 Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,
 Congreeing in a full and natural close,
 Like Musicke
 
    Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide
 The state of man in diuers functions,
 Setting endeuour in continual motion:
 To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,
 Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,
 Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach
 The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.
 They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,
 Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
 Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:
 Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,
 Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:
 Which pillage, they with merry march bring home
 To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:
 Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes
 The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,
 The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;
 The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in
 Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:
 The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,
 Deliuering ore to Executors pale
 The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,
 That many things hauing full reference
 To one consent, may worke contrariously,
 As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
 Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,
 As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;
 As many Lynes close in the Dials center:
 So may a thousand actions once a foote,
 And in one purpose, and be all well borne
 Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,
 Diuide your happy England into foure,
 Whereof, take you one quarter into France,
 And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.
 If we with thrice such powers left at home,
 Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,
 Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose
 The name of hardinesse and policie
 
    King. Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.
 Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe
 And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,
 France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,
 Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,
 (Ruling in large and ample Emperie,
 Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)
 Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,
 Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:
 Either our History shall with full mouth
 Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue
 Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,
 Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.
 Enter Ambassadors of France.
 
 Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
 Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,
 Your greeting is from him, not from the King
 
    Amb. May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
 Freely to render what we haue in charge:
 Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
 The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie
 
    King. We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,
 Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
 As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,
 Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,
 Tell vs the Dolphins minde
 
    Amb. Thus than in few:
 Your Highnesse lately sending into France,
 Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right
 Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third.
 In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master
 Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,
 And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,
 That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:
 You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.
 He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
 This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,
 Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
 Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes
 
    King. What Treasure Vncle?
   Exe. Tennis balles, my Liege
 
    Kin. We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,
 His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:
 When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,
 We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,
 Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.
 Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,
 That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd
 With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,
 How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,
 Not measuring what vse we made of them.
 We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,
 And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe
 To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,
 That men are merriest, when they are from home.
 But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,
 Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,
 When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.
 For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,
 And plodded like a man for working dayes:
 But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
 That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
 Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
 And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
 Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule
 Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
 That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows
 Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;
 Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:
 And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,
 That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.
 But this lyes all within the wil of God,
 To whom I do appeale, and in whose name
 Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,
 To venge me as I may, and to put forth
 My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause.
 So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,
 His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,
 When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.
 Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
 
 Exeunt. Ambassadors.
 
   Exe. This was a merry Message
 
    King. We hope to make the Sender blush at it:
 Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre,
 That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition:
 For we haue now no thought in vs but France,
 Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse.
 Therefore let our proportions for these Warres
 Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon,
 That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
 More Feathers to our Wings: for God before,
 Wee'le chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore.
 Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,
 That this faire Action may on foot be brought.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Flourish. Enter Chorus.
 
 Now all the Youth of England are on fire,
 And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes:
 Now thriue the Armorers, and Honors thought
 Reignes solely in the breast of euery man.
 They sell the Pasture now, to buy the Horse;
 Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings,
 With winged heeles, as English Mercuries.
 For now sits Expectation in the Ayre,
 And hides a Sword, from Hilts vnto the Point,
 With Crownes Imperiall, Crownes and Coronets,
 Promis'd to Harry, and his followers.
 The French aduis'd by good intelligence
 Of this most dreadfull preparation,
 Shake in their feare, and with pale Pollicy
 Seeke to diuert the English purposes.
 O England: Modell to thy inward Greatnesse,
 Like little Body with a mightie Heart:
 What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
 Were all thy children kinde and naturall:
 But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
 A nest of hollow bosomes, which he filles
 With treacherous Crownes, and three corrupted men:
 One, Richard Earle of Cambridge, and the second
 Henry Lord Scroope of Masham, and the third
 Sir Thomas Grey Knight of Northumberland,
 Haue for the Gilt of France (O guilt indeed)
 Confirm'd Conspiracy with fearefull France,
 And by their hands, this grace of Kings must dye.
 If Hell and Treason hold their promises,
 Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton.
 Linger your patience on, and wee'l digest
 Th' abuse of distance; force a play:
 The summe is payde, the Traitors are agreed,
 The King is set from London, and the Scene
 Is now transported (Gentles) to Southampton,
 There is the Play-house now, there must you sit,
 And thence to France shall we conuey you safe,
 And bring you backe: Charming the narrow seas
 To giue you gentle Passe: for if we may,
 Wee'l not offend one stomacke with our Play.
 But till the King come forth, and not till then,
 Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene.
 
 Exit
 
 Enter Corporall Nym, and Lieutenant Bardolfe.
 
   Bar. Well met Corporall Nym
 
    Nym. Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolfe
 
    Bar. What, are Ancient Pistoll and you friends yet?
   Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little: but when
 time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as
 it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out
 mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though? It will
 toste Cheese, and it will endure cold, as another mans
 sword will: and there's an end
 
    Bar. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friendes,
 and wee'l bee all three sworne brothers to France: Let't
 be so good Corporall Nym
 
    Nym. Faith, I will liue so long as I may, that's the certaine
 of it: and when I cannot liue any longer, I will doe
 as I may: That is my rest, that is the rendeuous of it
 
    Bar. It is certaine Corporall, that he is marryed to
 Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you
 were troth-plight to her
 
    Nym. I cannot tell, Things must be as they may: men
 may sleepe, and they may haue their throats about them
 at that time, and some say, kniues haue edges: It must
 be as it may, though patience be a tyred name, yet shee
 will plodde, there must be Conclusions, well, I cannot
 tell.
 Enter Pistoll, &amp; Quickly.
 
   Bar. Heere comes Ancient Pistoll and his wife: good
 Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll?
   Pist. Base Tyke, cal'st thou mee Hoste, now by this
 hand I sweare I scorne the terme: nor shall my Nel keep
 Lodgers
 
    Host. No by my troth, not long: For we cannot lodge
 and board a dozen or fourteene Gentlewomen that liue
 honestly by the pricke of their Needles, but it will bee
 thought we keepe a Bawdy-house straight. O welliday
 Lady, if he be not hewne now, we shall see wilful adultery
 and murther committed
 
    Bar. Good Lieutenant, good Corporal offer nothing
 heere
 
    Nym. Pish
 
    Pist. Pish for thee, Island dogge: thou prickeard cur
 of Island
 
    Host. Good Corporall Nym shew thy valor, and put
 vp your sword
 
    Nym. Will you shogge off? I would haue you solus
 
    Pist. Solus, egregious dog? O Viper vile; The solus
 in thy most meruailous face, the solus in thy teeth, and
 in thy throate, and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw
 perdy; and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth. I
 do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and Pistols
 cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow
 
    Nym. I am not Barbason, you cannot coniure mee: I
 haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you
 grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my
 Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes. If you would walke
 off, I would pricke your guts a little in good tearmes, as
 I may, and that's the humor of it
 
    Pist. O Braggard vile, and damned furious wight,
 The Graue doth gape, and doting death is neere,
 Therefore exhale
 
    Bar. Heare me, heare me what I say: Hee that strikes
 the first stroake, Ile run him vp to the hilts, as I am a soldier
 
    Pist. An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
 Giue me thy fist, thy fore-foote to me giue: Thy spirites
 are most tall
 
    Nym. I will cut thy throate one time or other in faire
 termes, that is the humor of it
 
    Pistoll. Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defie thee againe.
 O hound of Creet, think'st thou my spouse to get?
 No, to the spittle goe, and from the Poudring tub of infamy,
 fetch forth the Lazar Kite of Cressids kinde, Doll
 Teare-sheete, she by name, and her espouse. I haue, and I
 will hold the Quondam Quickely for the onely shee: and
 Pauca, there's enough to go to.
 Enter the Boy.
 
   Boy. Mine Hoast Pistoll, you must come to my Mayster,
 and your Hostesse: He is very sicke, &amp; would to bed.
 Good Bardolfe, put thy face betweene his sheets, and do
 the Office of a Warming-pan: Faith, he's very ill
 
    Bard. Away you Rogue
 
    Host. By my troth he'l yeeld the Crow a pudding one
 of these dayes: the King has kild his heart. Good Husband
 come home presently.
 
 Exit
 
   Bar. Come, shall I make you two friends. Wee must
 to France together: why the diuel should we keep kniues
 to cut one anothers throats?
   Pist. Let floods ore-swell, and fiends for food howle
 on
 
    Nym. You'l pay me the eight shillings I won of you
 at Betting?
   Pist. Base is the Slaue that payes
 
    Nym. That now I wil haue: that's the humor of it
 
    Pist. As manhood shal compound: push home.
 
 Draw
 
   Bard. By this sword, hee that makes the first thrust,
 Ile kill him: By this sword, I wil
 
    Pi. Sword is an Oath, &amp; Oaths must haue their course
   Bar. Coporall Nym, &amp; thou wilt be friends be frends,
 and thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me to: prethee
 put vp
 
    Pist. A Noble shalt thou haue, and present pay, and
 Liquor likewise will I giue to thee, and friendshippe
 shall combyne, and brotherhood. Ile liue by Nymme, &amp;
 Nymme shall liue by me, is not this iust? For I shal Sutler
 be vnto the Campe, and profits will accrue. Giue mee
 thy hand
 
    Nym. I shall haue my Noble?
   Pist. In cash, most iustly payd
 
    Nym. Well, then that the humor of't.
 Enter Hostesse.
 
   Host. As euer you come of women, come in quickly
 to sir Iohn: A poore heart, hee is so shak'd of a burning
 quotidian Tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold.
 Sweet men, come to him
 
    Nym. The King hath run bad humors on the Knight,
 that's the euen of it
 
    Pist. Nym, thou hast spoke the right, his heart is fracted
 and corroborate
 
    Nym. The King is a good King, but it must bee as it
 may: he passes some humors, and carreeres
 
    Pist. Let vs condole the Knight, for (Lambekins) we
 will liue.
 Enter Exeter, Bedford, &amp; Westmerland.
 
   Bed. Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
   Exe. They shall be apprehended by and by
 
    West. How smooth and euen they do bear themselues,
 As if allegeance in their bosomes sate
 Crowned with faith, and constant loyalty
 
    Bed. The King hath note of all that they intend,
 By interception, which they dreame not of
 
    Exe. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
 Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious fauours;
 That he should for a forraigne purse, so sell
 His Soueraignes life to death and treachery.
 
 Sound Trumpets.
 
 Enter the King, Scroope, Cambridge, and Gray.
 
   King. Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord.
 My Lord of Cambridge, and my kinde Lord of Masham,
 And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts:
 Thinke you not that the powres we beare with vs
 Will cut their passage through the force of France?
 Doing the execution, and the acte,
 For which we haue in head assembled them
 
    Scro. No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best
 
    King. I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded
 We carry not a heart with vs from hence,
 That growes not in a faire consent with ours:
 Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish
 Successe and Conquest to attend on vs
 
    Cam. Neuer was Monarch better fear'd and lou'd,
 Then is your Maiesty; there's not I thinke a subiect
 That sits in heart-greefe and vneasinesse
 Vnder the sweet shade of your gouernment
 
    Kni. True: those that were your Fathers enemies,
 Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you
 With hearts create of duty, and of zeale
 
    King. We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,
 And shall forget the office of our hand
 Sooner then quittance of desert and merit,
 According to the weight and worthinesse
 
    Scro. So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,
 And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope
 To do your Grace incessant seruices
 
    King. We Iudge no lesse. Vnkle of Exeter,
 Inlarge the man committed yesterday,
 That rayl'd against our person: We consider
 It was excesse of Wine that set him on,
 And on his more aduice, We pardon him
 
    Scro. That's mercy, but too much security:
 Let him be punish'd Soueraigne, least example
 Breed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind
 
    King. O let vs yet be mercifull
 
    Cam. So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too
 
    Grey. Sir, you shew great mercy if you giue him life,
 After the taste of much correction
 
    King. Alas, your too much loue and care of me,
 Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:
 If little faults proceeding on distemper,
 Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
 When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
 Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,
 Though Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care
 And tender preseruation of our person
 Wold haue him punish'd. And now to our French causes,
 Who are the late Commissioners?
   Cam. I one my Lord,
 Your Highnesse bad me aske for it to day
 
    Scro. So did you me my Liege
 
    Gray. And I my Royall Soueraigne
 
    King. Then Richard Earle of Cambridge, there is yours:
 There yours Lord Scroope of Masham, and Sir Knight:
 Gray of Northumberland, this same is yours:
 Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.
 My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,
 We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?
 What see you in those papers, that you loose
 So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:
 Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,
 That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood
 Out of apparance
 
    Cam. I do confesse my fault,
 And do submit me to your Highnesse mercy
 
    Gray. Scro. To which we all appeale
 
    King. The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,
 By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd:
 You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,
 For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,
 As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:
 See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,
 These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,
 You know how apt our loue was, to accord
 To furnish with all appertinents
 Belonging to his Honour; and this man,
 Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd
 And sworne vnto the practises of France
 To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,
 This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs
 Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,
 What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,
 Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?
 Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,
 That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,
 That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,
 Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?
 May it be possible, that forraigne hyer
 Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
 That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
 That though the truth of it stands off as grosse
 As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.
 Treason, and murther, euer kept together,
 As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,
 Working so grossely in an naturall cause,
 That admiration did not hoope at them.
 But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in
 Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:
 And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
 That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,
 Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:
 And other diuels that suggest by treasons,
 Do botch and bungle vp damnation,
 With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht
 From glist'ring semblances of piety:
 But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,
 Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
 Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.
 If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,
 Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,
 He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,
 And tell the Legions, I can neuer win
 A soule so easie as that Englishmans.
 Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected
 The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,
 Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?
 Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?
 Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?
 Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
 Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,
 Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,
 Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
 Not working with the eye, without the eare,
 And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,
 Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:
 And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,
 To make thee full fraught man, and best indued
 With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.
 For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like
 Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,
 Arrest them to the answer of the Law,
 And God acquit them of their practises
 
    Exe. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of
 Richard Earle of Cambridge.
 I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
 Lord Scroope of Marsham.
 I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
 Grey, Knight of Northumberland
 
    Scro. Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd,
 And I repent my fault more then my death,
 Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,
 Although my body pay the price of it
 
    Cam. For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,
 Although I did admit it as a motiue,
 The sooner to effect what I intended:
 But God be thanked for preuention,
 Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce,
 Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee
 
    Gray. Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
 At the discouery of most dangerous Treason,
 Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,
 Preuented from a damned enterprize;
 My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne
 
    King. God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence
 You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person,
 Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers,
 Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death:
 Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,
 His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,
 His Subiects to oppression, and contempt,
 And his whole Kingdome into desolation:
 Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge,
 But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,
 Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes
 We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,
 (Poore miserable wretches) to your death:
 The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue
 You patience to indure, and true Repentance
 Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence.
 Enter.
 
 Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof
 Shall be to you as vs, like glorious.
 We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,
 Since God so graciously hath brought to light
 This dangerous Treason, lurking in our way,
 To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,
 But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.
 Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer
 Our Puissance into the hand of God,
 Putting it straight in expedition.
 Chearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance,
 No King of England, if not King of France.
 
 Flourish.
 
 Enter Pistoll, Nim, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostesse.
 
   Hostesse. 'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring
 thee to Staines
 
    Pistoll. No: for my manly heart doth erne. Bardolph,
 be blythe: Nim, rowse thy vaunting Veines: Boy, brissle
 thy Courage vp: for Falstaffe hee is dead, and wee must
 erne therefore
 
    Bard. Would I were with him, wheresomere hee is,
 eyther in Heauen, or in Hell
 
    Hostesse. Nay sure, hee's not in Hell: hee's in Arthurs
 Bosome, if euer man went to Arthurs Bosome: a made a
 finer end, and went away and it had beene any Christome
 Childe: a parted eu'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu'n
 at the turning o'th' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with
 the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fingers
 end, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was
 as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now
 Sir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? be a good cheare: so a
 cryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I,
 to comfort him, bid him a should not thinke of God; I
 hop'd there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any
 such thoughts yet: so a bad me lay more Clothes on his
 feet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they
 were as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so
 vp-peer'd, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone
 
    Nim. They say he cryed out of Sack
 
    Hostesse. I, that a did
 
    Bard. And of Women
 
    Hostesse. Nay, that a did not
 
    Boy. Yes that a did, and said they were Deules incarnate
 
    Woman. A could neuer abide Carnation, 'twas a Colour
 he neuer lik'd
 
    Boy. A said once, the Deule would haue him about
 Women
 
    Hostesse. A did in some sort (indeed) handle Women:
 but then hee was rumatique, and talk'd of the Whore of
 Babylon
 
    Boy. Doe you not remember a saw a Flea sticke vpon
 Bardolphs Nose, and a said it was a blacke Soule burning
 in Hell
 
    Bard. Well, the fuell is gone that maintain'd that fire:
 that's all the Riches I got in his seruice
 
    Nim. Shall wee shogg? the King will be gone from
 Southampton
 
    Pist. Come, let's away. My Loue, giue me thy Lippes:
 Looke to my Chattels, and my Moueables: Let Sences
 rule: The world is, Pitch and pay: trust none: for Oathes
 are Strawes, mens Faiths are Wafer-Cakes, and hold-fast
 is the onely Dogge: My Ducke, therefore Caueto bee
 thy Counsailor. Goe, cleare thy Chrystalls. Yokefellowes
 in Armes, let vs to France, like Horseleeches
 my Boyes, to sucke, to sucke, the very blood to
 sucke
 
    Boy. And that's but vnwholesome food, they say
 
    Pist. Touch her soft mouth, and march
 
    Bard. Farwell Hostesse
 
    Nim. I cannot kisse, that is the humor of it: but
 adieu
 
    Pist. Let Huswiferie appeare: keepe close, I thee
 command
 
    Hostesse. Farwell: adieu.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Flourish.
 
 Enter the French King, the Dolphin, the Dukes of Berry and
 Britaine.
 
   King. Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs,
 And more then carefully it vs concernes,
 To answer Royally in our defences.
 Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,
 Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,
 And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch
 To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre
 With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:
 For England his approaches makes as fierce,
 As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe.
 It fits vs then to be as prouident,
 As feare may teach vs, out of late examples
 Left by the fatall and neglected English,
 Vpon our fields
 
    Dolphin. My most redoubted Father,
 It is most meet we arme vs 'gainst the Foe:
 For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome,
 (Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)
 But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,
 Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
 As were a Warre in expectation.
 Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth,
 To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
 And let vs doe it with no shew of feare,
 No, with no more, then if we heard that England
 Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance:
 For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd,
 Her Scepter so phantastically borne,
 By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth,
 That feare attends her not
 
    Const. O peace, Prince Dolphin,
 You are too much mistaken in this King:
 Question your Grace the late Embassadors,
 With what great State he heard their Embassie,
 How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,
 How modest in exception; and withall,
 How terrible in constant resolution:
 And you shall find, his Vanities fore-spent,
 Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus,
 Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly;
 As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots
 That shall first spring, and be most delicate
 
    Dolphin. Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
 But though we thinke it so, it is no matter:
 In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh
 The Enemie more mightie then he seemes,
 So the proportions of defence are fill'd:
 Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,
 Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting
 A little Cloth
 
    King. Thinke we King Harry strong:
 And Princes, looke you strongly arme to meet him.
 The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs:
 And he is bred out of that bloodie straine,
 That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes:
 Witnesse our too much memorable shame,
 When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke,
 And all our Princes captiu'd, by the hand
 Of that black Name, Edward, black Prince of Wales:
 Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing
 Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne,
 Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him
 Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface
 The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers
 Had twentie yeeres been made. This is a Stem
 Of that Victorious Stock: and let vs feare
 The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him.
 Enter a Messenger.
 
   Mess. Embassadors from Harry King of England,
 Doe craue admittance to your Maiestie
 
    King. Weele giue them present audience.
 Goe, and bring them.
 You see this Chase is hotly followed, friends
 
    Dolphin. Turne head, and stop pursuit: for coward Dogs
 Most spend their mouths, whe[n] what they seem to threaten
 Runs farre before them. Good my Soueraigne
 Take vp the English short, and let them know
 Of what a Monarchie you are the Head:
 Selfe-loue, my Liege, is not so vile a sinne,
 As selfe-neglecting.
 Enter Exeter.
 
   King. From our Brother of England?
   Exe. From him, and thus he greets your Maiestie:
 He wills you in the Name of God Almightie,
 That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart
 The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen,
 By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs
 To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne,
 And all wide-stretched Honors, that pertaine
 By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times,
 Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know
 'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme,
 Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes,
 Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt,
 He sends you this most memorable Lyne,
 In euery Branch truly demonstratiue;
 Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree:
 And when you find him euenly deriu'd
 From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors,
 Edward the third; he bids you then resigne
 Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held
 From him, the Natiue and true Challenger
 
    King. Or else what followes?
   Exe. Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne
 Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
 Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,
 In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue:
 That if requiring faile, he will compell.
 And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,
 Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie
 On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre
 Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head
 Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,
 The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,
 For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,
 That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.
 This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message:
 Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here;
 To whom expressely I bring greeting to
 
    King. For vs, we will consider of this further:
 To morrow shall you beare our full intent
 Back to our Brother of England
 
    Dolph. For the Dolphin,
 I stand here for him: what to him from England?
   Exe. Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt,
 And any thing that may not mis-become
 The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.
 Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse
 Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large,
 Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;
 Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it,
 That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France
 Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock
 In second Accent of his Ordinance
 
    Dolph. Say: if my Father render faire returne,
 It is against my will: for I desire
 Nothing but Oddes with England.
 To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie,
 I did present him with the Paris-Balls
 
    Exe. Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it,
 Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe:
 And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence,
 As we his Subiects haue in wonder found,
 Betweene the promise of his greener dayes,
 And these he masters now: now he weighes Time
 Euen to the vtmost Graine: that you shall reade
 In your owne Losses, if he stay in France
 
    King. To morrow shall you know our mind at full.
 
 Flourish.
 
   Exe. Dispatch vs with all speed, least that our King
 Come here himselfe to question our delay;
 For he is footed in this Land already
 
    King. You shalbe soone dispatcht, with faire conditions.
 A Night is but small breathe, and little pawse,
 To answer matters of this consequence.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Actus Secundus.
 
 Flourish. Enter Chorus.
 
 Thus with imagin'd wing our swift Scene flyes,
 In motion of no lesse celeritie then that of Thought.
 Suppose, that you haue seene
 The well-appointed King at Douer Peer,
 Embarke his Royaltie: and his braue Fleet,
 With silken Streamers, the young Phebus fayning;
 Play with your Fancies: and in them behold,
 Vpon the Hempen Tackle, Ship-boyes climbing;
 Heare the shrill Whistle, which doth order giue
 To sounds confus'd: behold the threaden Sayles,
 Borne with th' inuisible and creeping Wind,
 Draw the huge Bottomes through the furrowed Sea,
 Bresting the loftie Surge. O, doe but thinke
 You stand vpon the Riuage, and behold
 A Citie on th' inconstant Billowes dauncing:
 For so appeares this Fleet Maiesticall,
 Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow:
 Grapple your minds to sternage of this Nauie,
 And leaue your England as dead Mid-night, still,
 Guarded with Grandsires, Babyes, and old Women,
 Eyther past, or not arriu'd to pyth and puissance:
 For who is he, whose Chin is but enricht
 With one appearing Hayre, that will not follow
 These cull'd and choyse-drawne Caualiers to France?
 Worke, worke your Thoughts, and therein see a Siege:
 Behold the Ordenance on their Carriages,
 With fatall mouthes gaping on girded Harflew.
 Suppose th' Embassador from the French comes back:
 Tells Harry, That the King doth offer him
 Katherine his Daughter, and with her to Dowrie,
 Some petty and vnprofitable Dukedomes.
 The offer likes not: and the nimble Gunner
 With Lynstock now the diuellish Cannon touches,
 
 Alarum, and Chambers goe off.
 
 And downe goes all before them. Still be kind,
 And eech out our performance with your mind.
 Enter.
 
 Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester. Alarum: Scaling
 Ladders
 at Harflew.
 
   King. Once more vnto the Breach,
 Deare friends, once more;
 Or close the Wall vp with our English dead:
 In Peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,
 As modest stillnesse, and humilitie:
 But when the blast of Warre blowes in our eares,
 Then imitate the action of the Tyger:
 Stiffen the sinewes, commune vp the blood,
 Disguise faire Nature with hard-fauour'd Rage:
 Then lend the Eye a terrible aspect:
 Let it pry through the portage of the Head,
 Like the Brasse Cannon: let the Brow o'rewhelme it,
 As fearefully, as doth a galled Rocke
 O're-hang and iutty his confounded Base,
 Swill'd with the wild and wastfull Ocean.
 Now set the Teeth, and stretch the Nosthrill wide,
 Hold hard the Breath, and bend vp euery Spirit
 To his full height. On, on, you Noblish English,
 Whose blood is fet from Fathers of Warre-proofe:
 Fathers, that like so many Alexanders,
 Haue in these parts from Morne till Euen fought,
 And sheath'd their Swords, for lack of argument.
 Dishonour not your Mothers: now attest,
 That those whom you call'd Fathers, did beget you.
 Be Coppy now to men of grosser blood,
 And teach them how to Warre. And you good Yeomen,
 Whose Lyms were made in England; shew vs here
 The mettell of your Pasture: let vs sweare,
 That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not:
 For there is none of you so meane and base,
 That hath not Noble luster in your eyes.
 I see you stand like Grey-hounds in the slips,
 Straying vpon the Start. The Game's afoot:
 Follow your Spirit; and vpon this Charge,
 Cry, God for Harry, England, and S[aint]. George.
 
 Alarum, and Chambers goe off.
 
 Enter Nim, Bardolph, Pistoll, and Boy.
 
   Bard. On, on, on, on, on, to the breach, to the breach
 
    Nim. 'Pray thee Corporall stay, the Knocks are too
 hot: and for mine owne part, I haue not a Case of Liues:
 the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine-Song
 of it
 
    Pist. The plaine-Song is most iust: for humors doe abound:
 Knocks goe and come: Gods Vassals drop and
 dye: and Sword and Shield, in bloody Field, doth winne
 immortall fame
 
    Boy. Would I were in a Ale-house in London, I
 would giue all my fame for a Pot of Ale, and safetie
 
    Pist. And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my
 purpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I
 high
 
    Boy. As duly, but not as truly, as Bird doth sing on
 bough.
 Enter Fluellen.
 
   Flu. Vp to the breach, you Dogges; auaunt you
 Cullions
 
    Pist. Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: abate
 thy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage,
 great Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie
 sweet Chuck
 
    Nim. These be good humors: your Honor wins bad
 humors.
 Enter.
 
   Boy. As young as I am, I haue obseru'd these three
 Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three,
 though they would serue me, could not be Man to me;
 for indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man:
 for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
 meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,
 hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
 meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole
 Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
 Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
 his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
 few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
 a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
 against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
 thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
 bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
 Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
 in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece
 of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
 haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues
 or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
 Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
 into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.
 I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their
 Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
 I must cast it vp.
 Enter.
 
 Enter Gower.
 
   Gower. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to
 the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with
 you
 
    Flu. To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so
 good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes
 is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities
 of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuersarie,
 you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt
 himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu,
 I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions
 
    Gower. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order
 of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish
 man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith
 
    Welch. It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not?
   Gower. I thinke it be
 
    Welch. By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will
 verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions
 in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the
 Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.
 Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy.
 
   Gower. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine
 Iamy, with him
 
    Welch. Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman,
 that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge
 in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge
 of his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his
 Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in
 the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans
 
    Scot. I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen
 
    Welch. Godden to your Worship, good Captaine
 Iames
 
    Gower. How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you
 quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're?
   Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish
 giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand
 I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done:
 it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,
 so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill
 done: by my Hand tish ill done
 
    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now,
 will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with
 you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
 the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,
 looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie
 my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of
 my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline,
 that is the Point
 
    Scot. It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,
 and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:
 that sall I mary
 
    Irish. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:
 the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the
 King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town
 is beseech'd: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and
 we talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:
 so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my
 hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be
 done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law
 
    Scot. By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues
 to slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th'
 grund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay't as valorously
 as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and
 the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question
 tween you tway
 
    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you,
 vnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation
 
    Irish. Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a
 Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What
 ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?
   Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise
 then is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I
 shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in
 discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good
 a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and
 in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities
 
    Irish. I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe:
 so Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head
 
    Gower. Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other
 
    Scot. A, that's a foule fault.
 
 A Parley.
 
   Gower. The Towne sounds a Parley
 
    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more
 better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be
 so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:
 and there is an end.
 Enter.
 
 Enter the King and all his Traine before the Gates.
 
   King. How yet resolues the Gouernour of the Towne?
 This is the latest Parle we will admit:
 Therefore to our best mercy giue your selues,
 Or like to men prowd of destruction,
 Defie vs to our worst: for as I am a Souldier,
 A Name that in my thoughts becomes me best;
 If I begin the batt'rie once againe,
 I will not leaue the halfe-atchieued Harflew,
 Till in her ashes she lye buryed.
 The Gates of Mercy shall be all shut vp,
 And the flesh'd Souldier, rough and hard of heart,
 In libertie of bloody hand, shall raunge
 With Conscience wide as Hell, mowing like Grasse
 Your fresh faire Virgins, and your flowring Infants.
 What is it then to me, if impious Warre,
 Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends,
 Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats,
 Enlynckt to wast and desolation?
 What is't to me, when you your selues are cause,
 If your pure Maydens fall into the hand
 Of hot and forcing Violation?
 What Reyne can hold licentious Wickednesse,
 When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere?
 We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command
 Vpon th' enraged Souldiers in their spoyle,
 As send Precepts to the Leuiathan, to come ashore.
 Therefore, you men of Harflew,
 Take pitty of your Towne and of your People,
 Whiles yet my Souldiers are in my Command,
 Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace
 O're-blowes the filthy and contagious Clouds
 Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany.
 If not: why in a moment looke to see
 The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand
 Desire the Locks of your shrill-shriking Daughters:
 Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards,
 And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls:
 Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes,
 Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd,
 Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry,
 At Herods bloody-hunting slaughter-men.
 What say you? Will you yeeld, and this auoyd?
 Or guiltie in defence, be thus destroy'd.
 Enter Gouernour.
 
   Gouer. Our expectation hath this day an end:
 The Dolphin, whom of Succours we entreated,
 Returnes vs, that his Powers are yet not ready,
 To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King,
 We yeeld our Towne and Liues to thy soft Mercy:
 Enter our Gates, dispose of vs and ours,
 For we no longer are defensible
 
    King. Open your Gates: Come Vnckle Exeter,
 Goe you and enter Harflew; there remaine,
 And fortifie it strongly 'gainst the French:
 Vse mercy to them all for vs, deare Vnckle.
 The Winter comming on, and Sicknesse growing
 Vpon our Souldiers, we will retyre to Calis.
 To night in Harflew will we be your Guest,
 To morrow for the March are we addrest.
 
 Flourish, and enter the Towne.
 
 Enter Katherine and an old Gentlewoman.

 Enter.
 
 Enter the King of France, the Dolphin, the Constable of France,
 and
 others.
 
   King. 'Tis certaine he hath past the Riuer Some
 
    Const. And if he be not fought withall, my Lord,
 Let vs not liue in France: let vs quit all,
 And giue our Vineyards to a barbarous People
 
    Dolph. O Dieu viuant: Shall a few Sprayes of vs,
 The emptying of our Fathers Luxurie,
 Our Syens, put in wilde and sauage Stock,
 Spirt vp so suddenly into the Clouds,
 And ouer-looke their Grafters?
   Brit. Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards:
 Mort du ma vie, if they march along
 Vnfought withall, but I will sell my Dukedome,
 To buy a slobbry and a durtie Farme
 In that nooke-shotten Ile of Albion
 
    Const. Dieu de Battailes, where haue they this mettell?
 Is not their Clymate foggy, raw, and dull?
 On whom, as in despight, the Sunne lookes pale,
 Killing their Fruit with frownes. Can sodden Water,
 A Drench for sur-reyn'd Iades, their Barly broth,
 Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
 And shall our quick blood, spirited with Wine,
 Seeme frostie? O, for honor of our Land,
 Let vs not hang like roping Isyckles
 Vpon our Houses Thatch, whiles a more frostie People
 Sweat drops of gallant Youth in our rich fields:
 Poore we call them, in their Natiue Lords
 
    Dolphin. By Faith and Honor,
 Our Madames mock at vs, and plainely say,
 Our Mettell is bred out, and they will giue
 Their bodyes to the Lust of English Youth,
 To new-store France with Bastard Warriors
 
    Brit. They bid vs to the English Dancing-Schooles,
 And teach Lauolta's high, and swift Carranto's,
 Saying, our Grace is onely in our Heeles,
 And that we are most loftie Run-awayes
 
    King. Where is Montioy the Herald? speed him hence,
 Let him greet England with our sharpe defiance.
 Vp Princes, and with spirit of Honor edged,
 More sharper then your Swords, high to the field:
 Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
 You Dukes of Orleance, Burbon, and of Berry,
 Alanson, Brabant, Bar, and Burgonie,
 Iaques Chattillion, Rambures, Vandemont,
 Beumont, Grand Pree, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,
 Loys, Lestrale, Bouciquall, and Charaloyes,
 High Dukes, great Princes, Barons, Lords, and Kings;
 For your great Seats, now quit you of great shames:
 Barre Harry England, that sweepes through our Land
 With Penons painted in the blood of Harflew:
 Rush on his Hoast, as doth the melted Snow
 Vpon the Valleyes, whose low Vassall Seat,
 The Alpes doth spit, and void his rhewme vpon.
 Goe downe vpon him, you haue Power enough,
 And in a Captiue Chariot, into Roan
 Bring him our Prisoner
 
    Const. This becomes the Great.
 Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
 His Souldiers sick, and famisht in their March:
 For I am sure, when he shall see our Army,
 Hee'le drop his heart into the sinck of feare,
 And for atchieuement, offer vs his Ransome
 
    King. Therefore Lord Constable, hast on Montioy,
 And let him say to England, that we send,
 To know what willing Ransome he will giue.
 Prince Dolphin, you shall stay with vs in Roan
 
    Dolph. Not so, I doe beseech your Maiestie
 
    King. Be patient, for you shall remaine with vs.
 Now forth Lord Constable, and Princes all,
 And quickly bring vs word of Englands fall.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter Captaines, English and Welch, Gower and Fluellen.
 
   Gower. How now Captaine Fluellen, come you from
 the Bridge?
   Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed
 at the Bridge
 
    Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
   Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
 and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
 and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
 and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
 blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
 most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient
 Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
 conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
 hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
 him doe as gallant seruice
 
    Gower. What doe you call him?
   Flu. Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll
 
    Gower. I know him not.
 Enter Pistoll.
 
   Flu. Here is the man
 
    Pist. Captaine, I thee beseech to doe me fauours: the
 Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well
 
    Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at
 his hands
 
    Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
 and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
 Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
 stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone
 
    Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is
 painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
 to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
 with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
 it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
 and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
 Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
 in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description
 of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall
 
    Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
 for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
 death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
 and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter
 hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
 Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
 and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
 Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
 his Life, and I will thee requite
 
    Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your
 meaning
 
    Pist. Why then reioyce therefore
 
    Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
 at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
 the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;
 for discipline ought to be vsed
 
    Pist. Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship
 
    Flu. It is well
 
    Pist. The Figge of Spaine.
 Enter.
 
   Flu. Very good
 
    Gower. Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I
 remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse
 
    Flu. Ile assure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the
 Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
 well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
 when time is serue
 
    Gower. Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
 then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
 into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
 fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
 they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
 at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:
 who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd,
 what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
 conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
 vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
 Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among
 foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull
 to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
 slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke
 
    Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue
 hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
 the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
 him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
 must speake with him from the Pridge.
 
 Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.
 
   Flu. God plesse your Maiestie
 
    King. How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
   Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
 ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
 gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
 passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
 the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
 Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
 the Duke is a praue man
 
    King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?
   Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
 great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
 Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
 for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie
 know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
 and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
 nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
 sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
 out
 
    King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
 and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
 the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages;
 nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
 vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
 Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
 Gamester is the soonest winner.
 
 Tucket. Enter Mountioy.
 
   Mountioy. You know me by my habit
 
    King. Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of
 thee?
   Mountioy. My Masters mind
 
    King. Vnfold it
 
    Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
 of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
 Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
 wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
 thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
 ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:
 England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,
 and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider
 of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
 haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
 haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
 would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
 too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
 Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
 owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse
 satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
 conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
 is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
 so much my Office
 
    King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie
 
    Mount. Mountioy
 
    King. Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe,
 And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,
 But could be willing to march on to Callice,
 Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,
 Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much
 Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,
 My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,
 My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,
 Almost no better then so many French;
 Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,
 I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges
 Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,
 That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France
 Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:
 Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;
 My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;
 My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:
 Yet God before, tell him we will come on,
 Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor
 Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy.
 Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.
 If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,
 We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
 Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well.
 The summe of all our Answer is but this:
 We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,
 Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:
 So tell your Master
 
    Mount. I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse
 
    Glouc. I hope they will not come vpon vs now
 
    King. We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs:
 March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night,
 Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues,
 And on to morrow bid them march away.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Ramburs, Orleance,
 Dolphin, with
 others.
 
   Const. Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World:
 would it were day
 
    Orleance. You haue an excellent Armour: but let my
 Horse haue his due
 
    Const. It is the best Horse of Europe
 
    Orleance. Will it neuer be Morning?
   Dolph. My Lord of Orleance, and my Lord High Constable,
 you talke of Horse and Armour?
   Orleance. You are as well prouided of both, as any
 Prince in the World
 
    Dolph. What a long Night is this? I will not change
 my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:
 ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were
 hayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de
 feu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots
 the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest
 horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of
 Hermes
 
    Orleance. Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg
 
    Dolph. And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast
 for Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements
 of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only
 in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee
 is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call
 Beasts
 
    Const. Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent
 Horse
 
    Dolph. It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like
 the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces
 Homage
 
    Orleance. No more Cousin
 
    Dolph. Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from
 the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,
 varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as
 fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,
 and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect
 for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne
 to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,
 and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,
 and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,
 and began thus, Wonder of Nature
 
    Orleance. I haue heard a Sonnet begin so to ones Mistresse
 
    Dolph. Then did they imitate that which I compos'd
 to my Courser, for my Horse is my Mistresse
 
    Orleance. Your Mistresse beares well
 
    Dolph. Me well, which is the prescript prayse and perfection
 of a good and particular Mistresse
 
    Const. Nay, for me thought yesterday your Mistresse
 shrewdly shooke your back
 
    Dolph. So perhaps did yours
 
    Const. Mine was not bridled
 
    Dolph. O then belike she was old and gentle, and you
 rode like a Kerne of Ireland, your French Hose off, and in
 your strait Strossers
 
    Const. You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship
 
    Dolph. Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and
 ride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue
 my Horse to my Mistresse
 
    Const. I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade
 
    Dolph. I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his
 owne hayre
 
    Const. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
 Sow to my Mistresse
 
    Dolph. Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est
 la leuye lauee au bourbier: thou mak'st vse of any thing
 
    Const. Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse,
 or any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose
 
    Ramb. My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in
 your Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it?
   Const. Starres my Lord
 
    Dolph. Some of them will fall to morrow, I hope
 
    Const. And yet my Sky shall not want
 
    Dolph. That may be, for you beare a many superfluously,
 and 'twere more honor some were away
 
    Const. Eu'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who
 would trot as well, were some of your bragges dismounted
 
    Dolph. Would I were able to loade him with his desert.
 Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,
 and my way shall be paued with English Faces
 
    Const. I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out
 of my way: but I would it were morning, for I would
 faine be about the eares of the English
 
    Ramb. Who will goe to Hazard with me for twentie
 Prisoners?
   Const. You must first goe your selfe to hazard, ere you
 haue them
 
    Dolph. 'Tis Mid-night, Ile goe arme my selfe.
 Enter.
 
   Orleance. The Dolphin longs for morning
 
    Ramb. He longs to eate the English
 
    Const. I thinke he will eate all he kills
 
    Orleance. By the white Hand of my Lady, hee's a gallant
 Prince
 
    Const. Sweare by her Foot, that she may tread out the
 Oath
 
    Orleance. He is simply the most actiue Gentleman of
 France
 
    Const. Doing is actiuitie, and he will still be doing
 
    Orleance. He neuer did harme, that I heard of
 
    Const. Nor will doe none to morrow: hee will keepe
 that good name still
 
    Orleance. I know him to be valiant
 
    Const. I was told that, by one that knowes him better
 then you
 
    Orleance. What's hee?
   Const. Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee
 car'd not who knew it
 
    Orleance. Hee needes not, it is no hidden vertue in
 him
 
    Const. By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw
 it, but his Lacquey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it
 appeares, it will bate
 
    Orleance. Ill will neuer sayd well
 
    Const. I will cap that Prouerbe with, There is flatterie
 in friendship
 
    Orleance. And I will take vp that with, Giue the Deuill
 his due
 
    Const. Well plac't: there stands your friend for the
 Deuill: haue at the very eye of that Prouerbe with, A
 Pox of the Deuill
 
    Orleance. You are the better at Prouerbs, by how much
 a Fooles Bolt is soone shot
 
    Const. You haue shot ouer
 
    Orleance. 'Tis not the first time you were ouer-shot.
 Enter a Messenger.
 
   Mess. My Lord high Constable, the English lye within
 fifteene hundred paces of your Tents
 
    Const. Who hath measur'd the ground?
   Mess. The Lord Grandpree
 
    Const. A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would
 it were day? Alas poore Harry of England: hee longs
 not for the Dawning, as wee doe
 
    Orleance. What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this
 King of England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers
 so farre out of his knowledge
 
    Const. If the English had any apprehension, they
 would runne away
 
    Orleance. That they lack: for if their heads had any intellectuall
 Armour, they could neuer weare such heauie
 Head-pieces
 
    Ramb. That Iland of England breedes very valiant
 Creatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable courage
 
    Orleance. Foolish Curres, that runne winking into
 the mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht
 like rotten Apples: you may as well say, that's a valiant
 Flea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a
 Lyon
 
    Const. Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with
 the Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on,
 leauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue
 them great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they
 will eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils
 
    Orleance. I, but these English are shrowdly out of
 Beefe
 
    Const. Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only
 stomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to
 arme: come, shall we about it?
   Orleance. It is now two a Clock: but let me see, by ten
 Wee shall haue each a hundred English men.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Actus Tertius.
 
 Chorus.
 
 Now entertaine coniecture of a time,
 When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke
 Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse.
 From Camp to Camp, through the foule Womb of Night
 The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds;
 That the fixt Centinels almost receiue
 The secret Whispers of each others Watch.
 Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
 Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face.
 Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastfull Neighs
 Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents,
 The Armourers accomplishing the Knights,
 With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp,
 Giue dreadfull note of preparation.
 The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle:
 And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam'd,
 Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule,
 The confident and ouer-lustie French,
 Doe the low-rated English play at Dice;
 And chide the creeple-tardy-gated Night,
 Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe
 So tediously away. The poore condemned English,
 Like Sacrifices, by their watchfull Fires
 Sit patiently, and inly ruminate
 The Mornings danger: and their gesture sad,
 Inuesting lanke-leane Cheekes, and Warre-worne Coats,
 Presented them vnto the gazing Moone
 So many horride Ghosts. O now, who will behold
 The Royall Captaine of this ruin'd Band
 Walking from Watch to Watch, from Tent to Tent;
 Let him cry, Prayse and Glory on his head:
 For forth he goes, and visits all his Hoast,
 Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle,
 And calls them Brothers, Friends, and Countreymen.
 Vpon his Royall Face there is no note,
 How dread an Army hath enrounded him;
 Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour
 Vnto the wearie and all-watched Night:
 But freshly lookes, and ouer-beares Attaint,
 With chearefull semblance, and sweet Maiestie:
 That euery Wretch, pining and pale before,
 Beholding him, plucks comfort from his Lookes.
 A Largesse vniuersall, like the Sunne,
 His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one,
 Thawing cold feare, that meane and gentle all
 Behold, as may vnworthinesse define.
 A little touch of Harry in the Night,
 And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye:
 Where, O for pitty, we shall much disgrace,
 With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles,
 (Right ill dispos'd, in brawle ridiculous)
 The Name of Agincourt: Yet sit and see,
 Minding true things, by what their Mock'ries bee.
 Enter.
 
 Enter the King, Bedford, and Gloucester.
 
   King. Gloster, 'tis true that we are in great danger,
 The greater therefore should our Courage be.
 God morrow Brother Bedford: God Almightie,
 There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill,
 Would men obseruingly distill it out.
 For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers,
 Which is both healthfull, and good husbandry.
 Besides, they are our outward Consciences,
 And Preachers to vs all; admonishing,
 That we should dresse vs fairely for our end.
 Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed,
 And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe.
 Enter Erpingham.
 
 Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
 A good soft Pillow for that good white Head,
 Were better then a churlish turfe of France
 
    Erping. Not so my Liege, this Lodging likes me better,
 Since I may say, now lye I like a King
 
    King. 'Tis good for men to loue their present paines,
 Vpon example, so the Spirit is eased:
 And when the Mind is quickned, out of doubt
 The Organs, though defunct and dead before,
 Breake vp their drowsie Graue, and newly moue
 With casted slough, and fresh legeritie.
 Lend me thy Cloake Sir Thomas: Brothers both,
 Commend me to the Princes in our Campe;
 Doe my good morrow to them, and anon
 Desire them all to my Pauillion
 
    Gloster. We shall, my Liege
 
    Erping. Shall I attend your Grace?
   King. No, my good Knight:
 Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England:
 I and my Bosome must debate a while,
 And then I would no other company
 
    Erping. The Lord in Heauen blesse thee, Noble
 Harry.
 
 Exeunt.
 
   King. God a mercy old Heart, thou speak'st chearefully.
 Enter Pistoll
 
    Pist. Che vous la?
   King. A friend
 
    Pist. Discusse vnto me, art thou Officer, or art thou
 base, common, and popular?
   King. I am a Gentleman of a Company
 
    Pist. Trayl'st thou the puissant Pyke?
   King. Euen so: what are you?
   Pist. As good a Gentleman as the Emperor
 
    King. Then you are a better then the King
 
    Pist. The King's a Bawcock, and a Heart of Gold, a
 Lad of Life, an Impe of Fame, of Parents good, of Fist
 most valiant: I kisse his durtie shooe, and from heartstring
 I loue the louely Bully. What is thy Name?
   King. Harry le Roy
 
    Pist. Le Roy? a Cornish Name: art thou of Cornish Crew?
   King. No, I am a Welchman
 
    Pist. Know'st thou Fluellen?
   King. Yes
 
    Pist. Tell him Ile knock his Leeke about his Pate vpon
 S[aint]. Dauies day
 
    King. Doe not you weare your Dagger in your Cappe
 that day, least he knock that about yours
 
    Pist. Art thou his friend?
   King. And his Kinsman too
 
    Pist. The Figo for thee then
 
    King. I thanke you: God be with you
 
    Pist. My name is Pistol call'd.
 Enter.
 
   King. It sorts well with your fiercenesse.
 
 Manet King.
 
 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
 
   Gower. Captaine Fluellen
 
    Flu. 'So, in the Name of Iesu Christ, speake fewer: it
 is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World, when
 the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the
 Warres is not kept: if you would take the paines but to
 examine the Warres of Pompey the Great, you shall finde,
 I warrant you, that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble bable
 in Pompeyes Campe: I warrant you, you shall finde
 the Ceremonies of the Warres, and the Cares of it, and
 the Formes of it, and the Sobrietie of it, and the Modestie
 of it, to be otherwise
 
    Gower. Why the Enemie is lowd, you heare him all
 Night
 
    Flu. If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole, and a prating
 Coxcombe; is it meet, thinke you, that wee should
 also, looke you, be an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Coxcombe,
 in your owne conscience now?
   Gow. I will speake lower
 
    Flu. I pray you, and beseech you, that you will.
 Enter.
 
   King. Though it appeare a little out of fashion,
 There is much care and valour in this Welchman.
 Enter three Souldiers, Iohn Bates, Alexander Court, and Michael
 Williams.
 
 
   Court. Brother Iohn Bates, is not that the Morning
 which breakes yonder?
   Bates. I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to
 desire the approach of day
 
    Williams. Wee see yonder the beginning of the day,
 but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes
 there?
   King. A Friend
 
    Williams. Vnder what Captaine serue you?
   King. Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham
 
    Williams. A good old Commander, and a most kinde
 Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?
   King. Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to
 be washt off the next Tyde
 
    Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?
   King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I
 speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:
 the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element
 shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but
 humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse
 he appeares but a man; and though his affections
 are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,
 they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
 reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
 the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
 possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
 shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army
 
    Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:
 but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe
 in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
 and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here
 
    King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
 King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
 but where hee is
 
    Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
 sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued
 
    King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him
 here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
 mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,
 as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
 his Quarrell honorable
 
    Williams. That's more then we know
 
    Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
 know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
 if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
 the Cryme of it out of vs
 
    Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe
 hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
 Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
 shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed
 at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;
 some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
 some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
 rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
 in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
 thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
 doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
 that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion
 of subiection
 
    King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
 Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation
 of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed
 vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder
 his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,
 be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
 Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
 author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
 The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
 of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
 of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
 they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
 his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement
 of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:
 some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
 premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling
 Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
 making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored
 the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.
 Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne
 Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip
 men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
 his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
 are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
 now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
 they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
 safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
 is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before
 guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
 now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
 euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
 euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
 his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
 dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
 the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
 gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
 thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue
 that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
 how they should prepare
 
    Will. 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon
 his owne head, the King is not to answer it
 
    Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and
 yet I determine to fight lustily for him
 
    King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be
 ransom'd
 
    Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
 when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
 ne're the wiser
 
    King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after
 
    Will. You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
 of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
 can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
 to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
 Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
 come, 'tis a foolish saying
 
    King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should
 be angry with you, if the time were conuenient
 
    Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you
 liue
 
    King. I embrace it
 
    Will. How shall I know thee againe?
   King. Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it
 in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it,
 I will make it my Quarrell
 
    Will. Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of
 thine
 
    King. There
 
    Will. This will I also weare in my Cap: if euer thou
 come to me, and say, after to morrow, This is my Gloue,
 by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare
 
    King. If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it
 
    Will. Thou dar'st as well be hang'd
 
    King. Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the
 Kings companie
 
    Will. Keepe thy word: fare thee well
 
    Bates. Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee
 haue French Quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
 
 Exit Souldiers.
 
   King. Indeede the French may lay twentie French
 Crownes to one, they will beat vs, for they beare them
 on their shoulders: but it is no English Treason to cut
 French Crownes, and to morrow the King himselfe will
 be a Clipper.
 Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules,
 Our Debts, our carefull Wiues,
 Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King:
 We must beare all.
 O hard Condition, Twin-borne with Greatnesse,
 Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose sence
 No more can feele, but his owne wringing.
 What infinite hearts-ease must Kings neglect,
 That priuate men enioy?
 And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too,
 Saue Ceremonie, saue generall Ceremonie?
 And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie?
 What kind of God art thou? that suffer'st more
 Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers.
 What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in?
 O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth.
 What? is thy Soule of Odoration?
 Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme,
 Creating awe and feare in other men?
 Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd,
 Then they in fearing.
 What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet,
 But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse,
 And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure.
 Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out
 With Titles blowne from Adulation?
 Will it giue place to flexure and low bending?
 Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee,
 Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame,
 That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose.
 I am a King that find thee: and I know,
 'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball,
 The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall,
 The enter-tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle,
 The farsed Title running 'fore the King,
 The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe,
 That beates vpon the high shore of this World:
 No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie;
 Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall,
 Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue:
 Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind,
 Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread,
 Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of Hell:
 But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set,
 Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night
 Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne,
 Doth rise and helpe Hiperio[n] to his Horse,
 And followes so the euer-running yeere
 With profitable labour to his Graue:
 And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch,
 Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe,
 Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King.
 The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace,
 Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots,
 What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace;
 Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages.
 Enter Erpingham.
 
   Erp. My Lord, your Nobles iealous of your absence,
 Seeke through your Campe to find you
 
    King. Good old Knight, collect them all together
 At my Tent: Ile be before thee
 
    Erp. I shall doo't, my Lord.
 Enter.
 
   King. O God of Battailes, steele my Souldiers hearts,
 Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now
 The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers:
 Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord,
 O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault
 My Father made, in compassing the Crowne.
 I Richards body haue interred new,
 And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,
 Then from it issued forced drops of blood.
 Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay,
 Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp
 Toward Heauen, to pardon blood:
 And I haue built two Chauntries,
 Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still
 For Richards Soule. More will I doe:
 Though all that I can doe, is nothing worth;
 Since that my Penitence comes after all,
 Imploring pardon.
 Enter Gloucester.
 
   Glouc. My Liege
 
    King. My Brother Gloucesters voyce? I:
 I know thy errand, I will goe with thee:
 The day, my friend, and all things stay for me.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter the Dolphin, Orleance, Ramburs, and Beaumont.
 
   Orleance. The Sunne doth gild our Armour vp, my
 Lords
 
    Dolph. Monte Cheual: My Horse, Verlot Lacquay:
 Ha
 
    Orleance. Oh braue Spirit
 
    Dolph. Via les ewes &amp; terre
 
    Orleance. Rien puis le air &amp; feu
 
    Dolph. Cein, Cousin Orleance.
 Enter Constable.
 
 Now my Lord Constable?
   Const. Hearke how our Steedes, for present Seruice
 neigh
 
    Dolph. Mount them, and make incision in their Hides,
 That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
 And doubt them with superfluous courage: ha
 
    Ram. What, wil you haue them weep our Horses blood?
 How shall we then behold their naturall teares?
 Enter Messenger.
 
   Messeng. The English are embattail'd, you French
 Peeres
 
    Const. To Horse you gallant Princes, straight to Horse.
 Doe but behold yond poore and starued Band,
 And your faire shew shall suck away their Soules,
 Leauing them but the shales and huskes of men.
 There is not worke enough for all our hands,
 Scarce blood enough in all their sickly Veines,
 To giue each naked Curtleax a stayne,
 That our French Gallants shall to day draw out,
 And sheath for lack of sport. Let vs but blow on them,
 The vapour of our Valour will o're-turne them.
 'Tis positiue against all exceptions, Lords,
 That our superfluous Lacquies, and our Pesants,
 Who in vnnecessarie action swarme
 About our Squares of Battaile, were enow
 To purge this field of such a hilding Foe;
 Though we vpon this Mountaines Basis by,
 Tooke stand for idle speculation:
 But that our Honours must not. What's to say?
 A very little little let vs doe,
 And all is done: then let the Trumpets sound
 The Tucket Sonuance, and the Note to mount:
 For our approach shall so much dare the field,
 That England shall couch downe in feare, and yeeld.
 Enter Graundpree.
 
   Grandpree. Why do you stay so long, my Lords of France?
 Yond Iland Carrions, desperate of their bones,
 Ill-fauoredly become the Morning field:
 Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose,
 And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully.
 Bigge Mars seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast,
 And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes.
 The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks,
 With Torch-staues in their hand: and their poore Iades
 Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips:
 The gumme downe roping from their pale-dead eyes,
 And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt
 Lyes foule with chaw'd-grasse, still and motionlesse.
 And their executors, the knauish Crowes,
 Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre.
 Description cannot sute it selfe in words,
 To demonstrate the Life of such a Battaile,
 In life so liuelesse, as it shewes it selfe
 
    Const. They haue said their prayers,
 And they stay for death
 
    Dolph. Shall we goe send them Dinners, and fresh Sutes,
 And giue their fasting Horses Prouender,
 And after fight with them?
   Const. I stay but for my Guard: on
 To the field, I will the Banner from a Trumpet take,
 And vse it for my haste. Come, come away,
 The Sunne is high, and we out-weare the day.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham with all his Hoast:
 Salisbury, and Westmerland.
 
   Glouc. Where is the King?
   Bedf. The King himselfe is rode to view their Battaile
 
    West. Of fighting men they haue full threescore thousand
 
    Exe. There's fiue to one, besides they all are fresh
 
    Salisb. Gods Arme strike with vs, 'tis a fearefull oddes.
 God buy' you Princes all; Ile to my Charge:
 If we no more meet, till we meet in Heauen;
 Then ioyfully, my Noble Lord of Bedford,
 My deare Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
 And my kind Kinsman, Warriors all, adieu
 
    Bedf. Farwell good Salisbury, &amp; good luck go with thee:
 And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it,
 For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour
 
    Exe. Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day
 
    Bedf. He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse,
 Princely in both.
 Enter the King.
 
   West. O that we now had here
 But one ten thousand of those men in England,
 That doe no worke to day
 
    King. What's he that wishes so?
 My Cousin Westmerland. No, my faire Cousin:
 If we are markt to dye, we are enow
 To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,
 The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
 Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
 By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold,
 Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:
 It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;
 Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
 But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,
 I am the most offending Soule aliue.
 No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England:
 Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor,
 As one man more me thinkes would share from me,
 For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more:
 Rather proclaime it (Westmerland) through my Hoast,
 That he which hath no stomack to this fight,
 Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made,
 And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse:
 We would not dye in that mans companie,
 That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs.
 This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian:
 He that out-liues this day, and comes safe home,
 Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
 And rowse him at the Name of Crispian.
 He that shall see this day, and liue old age,
 Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours,
 And say, to morrow is Saint Crispian.
 Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres:
 Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot:
 But hee'le remember, with aduantages,
 What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names,
 Familiar in his mouth as household words,
 Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
 Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
 Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred.
 This story shall the good man teach his sonne:
 And Crispine Crispian shall ne're goe by,
 From this day to the ending of the World,
 But we in it shall be remembred;
 We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:
 For he to day that sheds his blood with me,
 Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile,
 This day shall gentle his Condition.
 And Gentlemen in England, now a bed,
 Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here;
 And hold their Manhoods cheape, whiles any speakes,
 That fought with vs vpon Saint Crispines day.
 Enter Salisbury.
 
   Sal. My Soueraign Lord, bestow your selfe with speed:
 The French are brauely in their battailes set,
 And will with all expedience charge on vs
 
    King. All things are ready, if our minds be so
 
    West. Perish the man, whose mind is backward now
 
    King. Thou do'st not wish more helpe from England,
 Couze?
   West. Gods will, my Liege, would you and I alone,
 Without more helpe, could fight this Royall battaile
 
    King. Why now thou hast vnwisht fiue thousand men:
 Which likes me better, then to wish vs one.
 You know your places: God be with you all.
 
 Tucket. Enter Montioy.
 
   Mont. Once more I come to know of thee King Harry,
 If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound,
 Before thy most assured Ouerthrow:
 For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe,
 Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy
 The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind
 Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules
 May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre
 From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies
 Must lye and fester
 
    King. Who hath sent thee now?
   Mont. The Constable of France
 
    King. I pray thee beare my former Answer back:
 Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones.
 Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus?
 The man that once did sell the Lyons skin
 While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
 A many of our bodyes shall no doubt
 Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust
 Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke.
 And those that leaue their valiant bones in France,
 Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills,
 They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them,
 And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,
 Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,
 The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.
 Marke then abounding valour in our English:
 That being dead, like to the bullets crasing,
 Breake out into a second course of mischiefe,
 Killing in relapse of Mortalitie.
 Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable,
 We are but Warriors for the working day:
 Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht
 With raynie Marching in the painefull field.
 There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast:
 Good argument (I hope) we will not flye:
 And time hath worne vs into slouenrie.
 But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim:
 And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night,
 They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck
 The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,
 And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,
 As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then
 Will soone be leuyed.
 Herauld, saue thou thy labour:
 Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,
 They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts:
 Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them,
 Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable
 
    Mont. I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
 Thou neuer shalt heare Herauld any more.
 Enter.
 
   King. I feare thou wilt once more come againe for a
 Ransome.
 Enter Yorke.
 
   Yorke. My Lord, most humbly on my knee I begge
 The leading of the Vaward
 
    King. Take it, braue Yorke.
 Now Souldiers march away,
 And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Alarum. Excursions. Enter Pistoll, French Souldier, Boy.
 
   Pist. Yeeld Curre
 
    French. Ie pense que vous estes le Gentilhome de bon qualitee
 
    Pist. Qualtitie calmie custure me. Art thou a Gentleman?
 What is thy Name? discusse
 
    French. O Seigneur Dieu
 
    Pist. O Signieur Dewe should be a Gentleman: perpend
 my words O Signieur Dewe, and marke: O Signieur
 Dewe, thou dyest on point of Fox, except O Signieur
 thou doe giue to me egregious Ransome
 
    French. O prennes miserecordie aye pitez de moy
 
    Pist. Moy shall not serue, I will haue fortie Moyes: for
 I will fetch thy rymme out at thy Throat, in droppes of
 Crimson blood
 
    French. Est il impossible d' eschapper le force de ton bras
 
    Pist. Brasse, Curre? thou damned and luxurious Mountaine
 Goat, offer'st me Brasse?
   French. O perdonne moy
 
    Pist. Say'st thou me so? is that a Tonne of Moyes?
 Come hither boy, aske me this slaue in French what is his
 Name
 
    Boy. Escoute comment estes vous appelle?
   French. Mounsieur le Fer
 
    Boy. He sayes his Name is M. Fer
 
    Pist. M. Fer: Ile fer him, and firke him, and ferret him:
 discusse the same in French vnto him
 
    Boy. I doe not know the French for fer, and ferret, and
 firke
 
    Pist. Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat
 
    French. Que dit il Mounsieur?
   Boy. Il me commande a vous dire que vous faite vous
 prest, car ce soldat icy est disposee tout asture de couppes vostre
 gorge
 
    Pist. Owy, cuppele gorge permafoy pesant, vnlesse
 thou giue me Crownes, braue Crownes; or mangled shalt
 thou be by this my Sword
 
    French. O Ie vous supplie pour l' amour de Dieu: ma pardonner,
 Ie suis le Gentilhome de bon maison, garde ma vie, &amp; Ie
 vous donneray deux cent escus
 
    Pist. What are his words?
   Boy. He prayes you to saue his life, he is a Gentleman
 of a good house, and for his ransom he will giue you two
 hundred Crownes
 
    Pist. Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the Crownes
 will take
 
    Fren. Petit Monsieur que dit il?
   Boy. Encore qu'il et contra son Iurement, de pardonner aucune
 prisonner: neantmons pour les escues que vous layt a promets,
 il est content a vous donnes le liberte le franchisement
 
    Fre. Sur mes genoux se vous donnes milles remercious, et
 Ie me estime heurex que Ie intombe, entre les main d' vn Cheualier
 Ie pense le plus braue valiant et tres distime signieur
 d' Angleterre
 
    Pist. Expound vnto me boy
 
    Boy. He giues you vpon his knees a thousand thanks,
 and he esteemes himselfe happy, that he hath falne into
 the hands of one (as he thinkes) the most braue, valorous
 and thrice-worthy signeur of England
 
    Pist. As I sucke blood, I will some mercy shew. Follow
 mee
 
    Boy. Saaue vous le grand Capitaine?
 I did neuer know so full a voyce issue from so emptie a
 heart: but the saying is true, The empty vessel makes the
 greatest sound, Bardolfe and Nym had tenne times more
 valour, then this roaring diuell i'th olde play, that euerie
 one may payre his nayles with a woodden dagger, and
 they are both hang'd, and so would this be, if hee durst
 steale any thing aduenturously. I must stay with the
 Lackies with the luggage of our camp, the French might
 haue a good pray of vs, if he knew of it, for there is none
 to guard it but boyes.
 Enter.
 
 Enter Constable, Orleance, Burbon, Dolphin, and Rambures.
 
   Con. O Diable
 
    Orl. O signeur le iour et perdia, toute et perdie
 
    Dol. Mor Dieu ma vie, all is confounded all,
 Reproach, and euerlasting shame
 Sits mocking in our Plumes.
 
 A short Alarum.
 
 O meschante Fortune, do not runne away
 
    Con. Why all our rankes are broke
 
    Dol. O perdurable shame, let's stab our selues:
 Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for?
   Orl. Is this the King we sent too, for his ransome?
   Bur. Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame,
 Let vs dye in once more backe againe,
 And he that will not follow Burbon now,
 Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
 Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore,
 Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge,
 His fairest daughter is contaminated
 
    Con. Disorder that hath spoyl'd vs, friend vs now,
 Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues
 
    Orl. We are enow yet liuing in the Field,
 To smother vp the English in our throngs,
 If any order might be thought vpon
 
    Bur. The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng;
 Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
 Enter.
 
 Alarum. Enter the King and his trayne, with Prisoners.
 
   King. Well haue we done, thrice-valiant Countrimen,
 But all's not done, yet keepe the French the field
 
    Exe. The D[uke]. of York commends him to your Maiesty
   King. Liues he good Vnckle: thrice within this houre
 I saw him downe; thrice vp againe, and fighting,
 From Helmet to the spurre, all blood he was
 
    Exe. In which array (braue Soldier) doth he lye,
 Larding the plaine: and by his bloody side,
 (Yoake-fellow to his honour-owing-wounds)
 The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes.
 Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer
 Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,
 And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes
 That bloodily did yawne vpon his face.
 He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke,
 My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen:
 Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a-brest:
 As in this glorious and well-foughten field
 We kept together in our Chiualrie.
 Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp,
 He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
 And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord,
 Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne,
 So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke
 He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes,
 And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
 A Testament of Noble-ending-loue:
 The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd
 Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd,
 But I had not so much of man in mee,
 And all my mother came into mine eyes,
 And gaue me vp to teares
 
    King. I blame you not,
 For hearing this, I must perforce compound
 With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue to.
 
 Alarum
 
 But hearke, what new alarum is this same?
 The French haue re-enforc'd their scatter'd men:
 Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners,
 Giue the word through.
 
 Exit
 
 
 Actus Quartus.
 
 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
 
   Flu. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
 against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery
 marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
 now, is it not?
   Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
 Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done
 this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away
 all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
 most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners
 throat. O 'tis a gallant King
 
    Flu. I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower:
 What call you the Townes name where Alexander the
 pig was borne?
   Gow. Alexander the Great
 
    Flu. Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
 the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,
 are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations
 
    Gower. I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in
 Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I
 take it
 
    Flu. I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is
 porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
 the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene
 Macedon &amp; Monmouth, that the situations looke
 you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, &amp; there
 is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at
 Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
 of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
 is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
 marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is
 come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
 things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his
 rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
 his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
 and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
 his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
 Clytus
 
    Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
 any of his friends
 
    Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
 tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
 but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander
 kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
 also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his
 good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
 great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
 knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name
 
    Gow. Sir Iohn Falstaffe
 
    Flu. That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne
 at Monmouth
 
    Gow. Heere comes his Maiesty.
 
 Alarum. Enter King Harry and Burbon with prisoners. Flourish.
 
   King. I was not angry since I came to France,
 Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald,
 Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:
 If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,
 Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight.
 If they'l do neither, we will come to them,
 And make them sker away, as swift as stones
 Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
 Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue,
 And not a man of them that we shall take,
 Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
 Enter Montioy.
 
   Exe. Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege
   Glou. His eyes are humbler then they vs'd to be
 
    King. How now, what meanes this Herald? Knowst
 thou not,
 That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome?
 Com'st thou againe for ransome?
   Her. No great King:
 I come to thee for charitable License,
 That we may wander ore this bloody field,
 To booke our dead, and then to bury them,
 To sort our Nobles from our common men.
 For many of our Princes (woe the while)
 Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:
 So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes
 In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds
 Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage
 Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,
 Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,
 To view the field in safety, and dispose
 Of their dead bodies
 
    Kin. I tell thee truly Herald,
 I know not if the day be ours or no,
 For yet a many of your horsemen peere,
 And gallop ore the field
 
    Her. The day is yours
 
    Kin. Praised be God, and not our strength for it:
 What is this Castle call'd that stands hard by
 
    Her. They call it Agincourt
 
    King. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
 Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus
 
    Flu. Your Grandfather of famous memory (an't please
 your Maiesty) and your great Vncle Edward the Placke
 Prince of Wales, as I haue read in the Chronicles, fought
 a most praue pattle here in France
 
    Kin. They did Fluellen
 
    Flu. Your Maiesty sayes very true: If your Maiesties
 is remembred of it, the Welchmen did good seruice in a
 Garden where Leekes did grow, wearing Leekes in their
 Monmouth caps, which your Maiesty know to this houre
 is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue
 your Maiesty takes no scorne to weare the Leeke vppon
 S[aint]. Tauies day
 
    King. I weare it for a memorable honor:
 For I am Welch you know good Countriman
 
    Flu. All the water in Wye, cannot wash your Maiesties
 Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
 God plesse it, and preserue it, as long as it pleases his
 Grace, and his Maiesty too
 
    Kin. Thankes good my Countrymen
 
    Flu. By Ieshu, I am your Maiesties Countreyman, I
 care not who know it: I will confesse it to all the Orld, I
 need not to be ashamed of your Maiesty, praised be God
 so long as your Maiesty is an honest man
 
    King. Good keepe me so.
 Enter Williams.
 
 Our Heralds go with him,
 Bring me iust notice of the numbers dead
 On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither
 
    Exe. Souldier, you must come to the King
 
    Kin. Souldier, why wear'st thou that Gloue in thy
 Cappe?
   Will. And't please your Maiesty, tis the gage of one
 that I should fight withall, if he be aliue
 
    Kin. An Englishman?
   Wil. And't please your Maiesty, a Rascall that swagger'd
 with me last night: who if aliue, and euer dare to
 challenge this Gloue, I haue sworne to take him a boxe
 a'th ere: or if I can see my Gloue in his cappe, which he
 swore as he was a Souldier he would weare (if aliue) I wil
 strike it out soundly
 
    Kin. What thinke you Captaine Fluellen, is it fit this
 souldier keepe his oath
 
    Flu. Hee is a Crauen and a Villaine else, and't please
 your Maiesty in my conscience
 
    King. It may bee, his enemy is a Gentleman of great
 sort quite from the answer of his degree
 
    Flu. Though he be as good a Ientleman as the diuel is,
 as Lucifer and Belzebub himselfe, it is necessary (looke
 your Grace) that he keepe his vow and his oath: If hee
 bee periur'd (see you now) his reputation is as arrant a
 villaine and a Iacke sawce, as euer his blacke shoo trodd
 vpon Gods ground, and his earth, in my conscience law
   King. Then keepe thy vow sirrah, when thou meet'st
 the fellow
 
    Wil. So, I wil my Liege, as I liue
 
    King. Who seru'st thou vnder?
   Will. Vnder Captaine Gower, my Liege
 
    Flu. Gower is a good Captaine, and is good knowledge
 and literatured in the Warres
 
    King. Call him hither to me, Souldier
 
    Will. I will my Liege.
 Enter.
 
   King. Here Fluellen, weare thou this fauour for me, and
 sticke it in thy Cappe: when Alanson and my selfe were
 downe together, I pluckt this Gloue from his Helme: If
 any man challenge this, hee is a friend to Alanson, and an
 enemy to our Person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend
 him, and thou do'st me loue
 
    Flu. Your Grace doo's me as great Honors as can be
 desir'd in the hearts of his Subiects: I would faine see
 the man, that ha's but two legges, that shall find himselfe
 agreefd at this Gloue; that is all: but I would faine see
 it once, and please God of his grace that I might see
 
    King. Know'st thou Gower?
   Flu. He is my deare friend, and please you
 
    King. Pray thee goe seeke him, and bring him to my
 Tent
 
    Flu. I will fetch him.
 Enter.
 
   King. My Lord of Warwick, and my Brother Gloster,
 Follow Fluellen closely at the heeles.
 The Gloue which I haue giuen him for a fauour,
 May haply purchase him a box a'th' eare.
 It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should
 Weare it my selfe. Follow good Cousin Warwick:
 If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge
 By his blunt bearing, he will keepe his word;
 Some sodaine mischiefe may arise of it:
 For I doe know Fluellen valiant,
 And toucht with Choler, hot as Gunpowder,
 And quickly will returne an iniurie.
 Follow, and see there be no harme betweene them.
 Goe you with me, Vnckle of Exeter.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 Enter Gower and Williams.
 
   Will. I warrant it is to Knight you, Captaine.
 Enter Fluellen.
 
   Flu. Gods will, and his pleasure, Captaine, I beseech
 you now, come apace to the King: there is more good
 toward you peraduenture, then is in your knowledge to
 dreame of
 
    Will. Sir, know you this Gloue?
   Flu. Know the Gloue? I know the Gloue is a Gloue
 
    Will. I know this, and thus I challenge it.
 
 Strikes him.
 
   Flu. 'Sblud, an arrant Traytor as anyes in the Vniuersall
 World, or in France, or in England
 
    Gower. How now Sir? you Villaine
 
    Will. Doe you thinke Ile be forsworne?
   Flu. Stand away Captaine Gower, I will giue Treason
 his payment into plowes, I warrant you
 
    Will. I am no Traytor
 
    Flu. That's a Lye in thy Throat. I charge you in his
 Maiesties Name apprehend him, he's a friend of the Duke
 Alansons.
 Enter Warwick and Gloucester.
 
   Warw. How now, how now, what's the matter?
   Flu. My Lord of Warwick, heere is, praysed be God
 for it, a most contagious Treason come to light, looke
 you, as you shall desire in a Summers day. Heere is his
 Maiestie.
 Enter King and Exeter.
 
   King. How now, what's the matter?
   Flu. My Liege, heere is a Villaine, and a Traytor,
 that looke your Grace, ha's strooke the Gloue which
 your Maiestie is take out of the Helmet of Alanson
 
    Will. My Liege, this was my Gloue, here is the fellow
 of it: and he that I gaue it to in change, promis'd to weare
 it in his Cappe: I promis'd to strike him, if he did: I met
 this man with my Gloue in his Cappe, and I haue been as
 good as my word
 
    Flu. Your Maiestie heare now, sauing your Maiesties
 Manhood, what an arrant rascally, beggerly, lowsie
 Knaue it is: I hope your Maiestie is peare me testimonie
 and witnesse, and will auouchment, that this is the Gloue
 of Alanson, that your Maiestie is giue me, in your Conscience
 now
 
    King. Giue me thy Gloue Souldier;
 Looke, heere is the fellow of it:
 'Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike,
 And thou hast giuen me most bitter termes
 
    Flu. And please your Maiestie, let his Neck answere
 for it, if there is any Marshall Law in the World
 
    King. How canst thou make me satisfaction?
   Will. All offences, my Lord, come from the heart: neuer
 came any from mine, that might offend your Maiestie
 
    King. It was our selfe thou didst abuse
 
    Will. Your Maiestie came not like your selfe: you
 appear'd to me but as a common man; witnesse the
 Night, your Garments, your Lowlinesse: and what
 your Highnesse suffer'd vnder that shape, I beseech you
 take it for your owne fault, and not mine: for had you
 beene as I tooke you for, I made no offence; therefore I
 beseech your Highnesse pardon me
 
    King. Here Vnckle Exeter, fill this Gloue with Crownes,
 And giue it to this fellow. Keepe it fellow,
 And weare it for an Honor in thy Cappe,
 Till I doe challenge it. Giue him the Crownes:
 And Captaine, you must needs be friends with him
 
    Flu. By this Day and this Light, the fellow ha's mettell
 enough in his belly: Hold, there is twelue-pence for
 you, and I pray you to serue God, and keepe you out of
 prawles and prabbles, and quarrels and dissentions, and I
 warrant you it is the better for you
 
    Will. I will none of your Money
 
    Flu. It is with a good will: I can tell you it will serue
 you to mend your shooes: come, wherefore should you
 be so pashfull, your shooes is not so good: 'tis a good
 silling I warrant you, or I will change it.
 Enter Herauld.
 
   King. Now Herauld, are the dead numbred?
   Herald. Heere is the number of the slaught'red
 French
 
    King. What Prisoners of good sort are taken,
 Vnckle?
   Exe. Charles Duke of Orleance, Nephew to the King,
 Iohn Duke of Burbon, and Lord Bouchiquald:
 Of other Lords and Barons, Knights and Squires,
 Full fifteene hundred, besides common men
 
    King. This Note doth tell me of ten thousand French
 That in the field lye slaine: of Princes in this number,
 And Nobles bearing Banners, there lye dead
 One hundred twentie six: added to these,
 Of Knights, Esquires, and gallant Gentlemen,
 Eight thousand and foure hundred: of the which,
 Fiue hundred were but yesterday dubb'd Knights.
 So that in these ten thousand they haue lost,
 There are but sixteene hundred Mercenaries:
 The rest are Princes, Barons, Lords, Knights, Squires,
 And Gentlemen of bloud and qualitie.
 The Names of those their Nobles that lye dead:
 Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
 Iaques of Chatilion, Admirall of France,
 The Master of the Crosse-bowes, Lord Rambures,
 Great Master of France, the braue Sir Guichard Dolphin,
 Iohn Duke of Alanson, Anthonie Duke of Brabant,
 The Brother to the Duke of Burgundie,
 And Edward Duke of Barr: of lustie Earles,
 Grandpree and Roussie, Fauconbridge and Foyes,
 Beaumont and Marle, Vandemont and Lestrale.
 Here was a Royall fellowship of death.
 Where is the number of our English dead?
 Edward the Duke of Yorke, the Earle of Suffolke,
 Sir Richard Ketly, Dauy Gam Esquire;
 None else of name: and of all other men,
 But fiue and twentie.
 O God, thy Arme was heere:
 And not to vs, but to thy Arme alone,
 Ascribe we all: when, without stratagem,
 But in plaine shock, and euen play of Battaile,
 Was euer knowne so great and little losse?
 On one part and on th' other, take it God,
 For it is none but thine
 
    Exet. 'Tis wonderfull
 
    King. Come, goe we in procession to the Village:
 And be it death proclaymed through our Hoast,
 To boast of this, or take that prayse from God,
 Which is his onely
 
    Flu. Is it not lawfull and please your Maiestie, to tell
 how many is kill'd?
   King. Yes Captaine: but with this acknowledgement,
 That God fought for vs
 
    Flu. Yes, my conscience, he did vs great good
 
    King. Doe we all holy Rights:
 Let there be sung Non nobis, and Te Deum,
 The dead with charitie enclos'd in Clay:
 And then to Callice, and to England then,
 Where ne're from France arriu'd more happy men.
 
 Exeunt.
 
 
 Actus Quintus.
 
 Enter Chorus.
 
 Vouchsafe to those that haue not read the Story,
 That I may prompt them: and of such as haue,
 I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse
 Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
 Which cannot in their huge and proper life,
 Be here presented. Now we beare the King
 Toward Callice: Graunt him there; there seene,
 Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts,
 Athwart the Sea: Behold the English beach
 Pales in the flood; with Men, Wiues, and Boyes,
 Whose shouts &amp; claps out-voyce the deep-mouth'd Sea,
 Which like a mightie Whiffler 'fore the King,
 Seemes to prepare his way: So let him land,
 And solemnly see him set on to London.
 So swift a pace hath Thought, that euen now
 You may imagine him vpon Black-Heath:
 Where, that his Lords desire him, to haue borne
 His bruised Helmet, and his bended Sword
 Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it,
 Being free from vainnesse, and selfe-glorious pride;
 Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and Ostent,
 Quite from himselfe, to God. But now behold,
 In the quick Forge and working-house of Thought,
 How London doth powre out her Citizens,
 The Maior and all his Brethren in best sort,
 Like to the Senatours of th' antique Rome,
 With the Plebeians swarming at their heeles,
 Goe forth and fetch their Conqu'ring Cæsar in:
 As by a lower, but by louing likelyhood,
 Were now the Generall of our gracious Empresse,
 As in good time he may, from Ireland comming,
 Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;
 How many would the peacefull Citie quit,
 To welcome him? much more, and much more cause,
 Did they this Harry. Now in London place him.
 As yet the lamentation of the French
 Inuites the King of Englands stay at home:
 The Emperour's comming in behalfe of France,
 To order peace betweene them: and omit
 All the occurrences, what euer chanc't,
 Till Harryes backe returne againe to France:
 There must we bring him; and my selfe haue play'd
 The interim, by remembring you 'tis past.
 Then brooke abridgement, and your eyes aduance,
 After your thoughts, straight backe againe to France.
 Enter.
 
 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
 
   Gower. Nay, that's right: but why weare you your
 Leeke to day? S[aint]. Dauies day is past
 
    Flu. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
 in all things: I will tell you asse my friend, Captaine
 Gower; the rascally, scauld, beggerly, lowsie, pragging
 Knaue Pistoll, which you and your selfe, and all the World,
 know to be no petter then a fellow, looke you now, of no
 merits: hee is come to me, and prings me pread and
 sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke:
 it was in a place where I could not breed no contention
 with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap
 till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little
 piece of my desires.
 Enter Pistoll.
 
   Gower. Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turkycock
 
    Flu. 'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his Turkycocks.
 God plesse you aunchient Pistoll: you scuruie lowsie
 Knaue, God plesse you
 
    Pist. Ha, art thou bedlam? doest thou thirst, base
 Troian, to haue me fold vp Parcas fatall Web? Hence;
 I am qualmish at the smell of Leeke
 
    Flu. I peseech you heartily, scuruie lowsie Knaue, at
 my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eate,
 looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not
 loue it, nor your affections, and your appetites and your
 disgestions doo's not agree with it, I would desire you
 to eate it
 
    Pist. Not for Cadwallader and all his Goats
 
    Flu. There is one Goat for you.
 
  Strikes him.
 
 Will you be so good, scauld Knaue, as eate it?
   Pist. Base Troian, thou shalt dye
 
    Flu. You say very true, scauld Knaue, when Gods
 will is: I will desire you to liue in the meane time, and
 eate your Victuals: come, there is sawce for it. You
 call'd me yesterday Mountaine-Squier, but I will make
 you to day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall too, if
 you can mocke a Leeke, you can eate a Leeke
 
    Gour. Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him
 
    Flu. I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke,
 or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is
 good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxecombe
 
    Pist. Must I bite
 
    Flu. Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of question
 too, and ambiguities
 
    Pist. By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I
 eate and eate I sweare
 
    Flu. Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce
 to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by
 
    Pist. Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate
 
    Flu. Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay,
 pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your
 broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see
 Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all
 
    Pist. Good
 
    Flu. I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to
 heale your pate
 
    Pist. Me a groat?
   Flu. Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue
 another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate
 
    Pist. I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge
 
    Flu. If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cudgels,
 you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of
 me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, &amp; heale
 your pate.
 
 Exit
 
   Pist. All hell shall stirre for this
 
    Gow. Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue,
 will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
 honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
 of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
 any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking &amp; galling
 at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
 he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
 not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise,
 and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach
 you a good English condition, fare ye well.
 
 Exit
 
   Pist. Doeth fortune play the huswife with me now?
 Newes haue I that my Doll is dead i'th Spittle of a malady
 of France, and there my rendeuous is quite cut off:
 Old I do waxe, and from my wearie limbes honour is
 Cudgeld. Well, Baud Ile turne, and something leane to
 Cut-purse of quicke hand: To England will I steale, and
 there Ile steale:
 And patches will I get vnto these cudgeld scarres,
 And swore I got them in the Gallia warres.
 Enter.
 
 Enter at one doore, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwicke, and
 other
 Lords. At another, Queene Isabel, the King, the Duke of
 Bourgougne, and
 other French.
 
   King. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met;
 Vnto our brother France, and to our Sister
 Health and faire time of day: Ioy and good wishes
 To our most faire and Princely Cosine Katherine:
 And as a branch and member of this Royalty,
 By whom this great assembly is contriu'd,
 We do salute you Duke of Burgogne,
 And Princes French and Peeres health to you all
 
    Fra. Right ioyous are we to behold your face,
 Most worthy brother England, fairely met,
 So are you Princes (English) euery one
 
    Quee. So happy be the Issue brother Ireland
 Of this good day, and of this gracious meeting,
 As we are now glad to behold your eyes,
 Your eyes which hitherto haue borne
 In them against the French that met them in their bent,
 The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes:
 The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope
 Haue lost their qualitie, and that this day
 Shall change all griefes and quarrels into loue
 
    Eng. To cry Amen to that, thus we appeare
 
    Quee. You English Princes all, I doe salute you
 
    Burg. My dutie to you both, on equall loue.
 Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd
 With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,
 To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties
 Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;
 Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.
 Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,
 That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,
 You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,
 If I demand before this Royall view,
 What Rub, or what Impediment there is,
 Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,
 Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,
 Should not in this best Garden of the World,
 Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?
 Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,
 And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,
 Corrupting in it owne fertilitie.
 Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,
 Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,
 Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,
 Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,
 The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,
 Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,
 That should deracinate such Sauagery:
 The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth
 The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,
 Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;
 Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,
 But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,
 Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;
 And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,
 Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.
 Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,
 Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,
 The Sciences that should become our Countrey;
 But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,
 That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,
 To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,
 And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.
 Which to reduce into our former fauour,
 You are assembled: and my speech entreats,
 That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace
 Should not expell these inconueniences,
 And blesse vs with her former qualities
 
    Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,
 Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections
 Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace
 With full accord to all our iust demands,
 Whose Tenures and particular effects
 You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands
 
    Burg. The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet
 There is no Answer made
 
    Eng. Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd,
 Lyes in his Answer
 
    France. I haue but with a curselarie eye
 O're-glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace
 To appoint some of your Councell presently
 To sit with vs once more, with better heed
 To re-suruey them; we will suddenly
 Passe our accept and peremptorie Answer
 
    England. Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle Exeter,
 And Brother Clarence, and you Brother Gloucester,
 Warwick, and Huntington, goe with the King,
 And take with you free power, to ratifie,
 Augment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best
 Shall see aduantageable for our Dignitie,
 Any thing in or out of our Demands,
 And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,
 Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?
   Quee. Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:
 Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,
 When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on
 
    England. Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs,
 She is our capitall Demand, compris'd
 Within the fore-ranke of our Articles
 
    Quee. She hath good leaue.
 
 Exeunt. omnes.
 
 Manet King and Katherine
 
    King. Faire Katherine, and most faire,
 Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,
 Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,
 And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart
 
    Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake
 your England
 
    King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly
 with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse
 it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
 like me, Kate?
   Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me
 
    King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an
 Angell
 
    Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?
   Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il
 
    King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush
 to affirme it
 
    Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de
 tromperies
 
    King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of
 men are full of deceits?
   Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:
 dat is de Princesse
 
    King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:
 yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
 glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
 could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
 thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
 Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly
 to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
 then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
 me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:
 how say you, Lady?
   Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well
 
    King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
 Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one
 I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
 haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
 strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by
 vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
 vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
 quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
 Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
 like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
 before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
 my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
 onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
 nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
 of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?
 that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
 thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
 to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
 take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
 for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
 while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and
 vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
 because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
 these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
 into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
 out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
 but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
 stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
 grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
 hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the
 Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
 shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
 truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
 take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
 And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
 and fairely, I pray thee
 
    Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
 Fraunce?
   King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
 of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue
 the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
 will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
 and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
 is France, and you are mine
 
    Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat
 
    King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
 sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife
 about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie
 quand sur le possession de Fraunce, &amp; quand vous aues le
 possession
 de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee
 my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, &amp; vous estes mienne.
 It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
 speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
 French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me
 
    Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il
 &amp; melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle
 
    King. No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
 my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
 needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st
 thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
 mee?
   Kath. I cannot tell
 
    King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile
 aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
 when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
 Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
 her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
 heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather
 gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
 beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
 me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
 must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:
 Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
 George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
 that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
 the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire
 Flower-de-Luce
 
    Kate. I doe not know dat
 
    King. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
 doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your
 French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,
 take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer
 you. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher &amp; deuin
 deesse
 
    Kath. Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to
 deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce
 
    King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
 in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare
 not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter
 me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
 vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
 Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
 when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne
 out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
 to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder
 I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
 Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
 spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
 the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
 better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,
 will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
 auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
 an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of
 England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
 blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England
 is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
 Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his
 Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
 finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer
 in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
 thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,
 breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
 haue me?
   Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere
 
    King. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please
 him, Kate
 
    Kath. Den it sall also content me
 
    King. Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my
 Queene
 
    Kath. Laisse mon Seigneur, laisse, laisse, may foy: Ie ne
 veus point que vous abbaisse vostre grandeus, en baisant le
 main d' une nostre Seigneur indignie seruiteur excuse moy. Ie
 vous supplie mon tres-puissant Seigneur
 
    King. Then I will kisse your Lippes, Kate
 
    Kath. Les Dames &amp; Damoisels pour estre baisee deuant
 leur nopcese il net pas le costume de Fraunce
 
    King. Madame, my Interpreter, what sayes shee?
   Lady. Dat it is not be de fashon pour le Ladies of
 Fraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish
 
    King. To kisse
 
    Lady. Your Maiestee entendre bettre que moy
 
    King. It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to
 kisse before they are marryed, would she say?
   Lady. Ouy verayment
 
    King. O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.
 Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
 weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers
 of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes
 our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I
 will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
 Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
 and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,
 Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
 them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
 they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a
 generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your
 Father.
 Enter the French Power, and the English Lords.
 
   Burg. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,
 teach you our Princesse English?
   King. I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how
 perfectly I loue her, and that is good English
 
    Burg. Is shee not apt?
   King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition
 is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
 the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
 the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
 likenesse
 
    Burg. Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
 you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must
 make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
 likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you
 blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
 Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
 of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
 (my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne
 to
 
    King. Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind
 and enforces
 
    Burg. They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see
 not what they doe
 
    King. Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to
 consent winking
 
    Burg. I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you
 will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well
 Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde,
 blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then
 they will endure handling, which before would not abide
 looking on
 
    King. This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot
 Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in
 the latter end, and she must be blinde to
 
    Burg. As Loue is my Lord, before it loues
 
    King. It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke
 Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire
 French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my
 way
 
    French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely:
 the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are
 all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred
 
    England. Shall Kate be my Wife?
   France. So please you
 
    England. I am content, so the Maiden Cities you
 talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in
 the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my
 Will
 
    France. Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason
 
    England. Is't so, my Lords of England?
   West. The King hath graunted euery Article:
 His Daughter first; and in sequele, all,
 According to their firme proposed natures
 
    Exet. Onely he hath not yet subscribed this:
 Where your Maiestie demands, That the King of France
 hauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall
 name your Highnesse in this forme, and with this addition,
 in French: Nostre trescher filz Henry Roy d' Angleterre
 Heretere de Fraunce: and thus in Latine; Praeclarissimus
 Filius noster Henricus Rex Angliæ &amp; Heres Franciae
 
    France. Nor this I haue not Brother so deny'd,
 But your request shall make me let it passe
 
    England. I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance,
 Let that one Article ranke with the rest,
 And thereupon giue me your Daughter
 
    France. Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp
 Issue to me, that the contending Kingdomes
 Of France and England, whose very shoares looke pale,
 With enuy of each others happinesse,
 May cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction
 Plant Neighbour-hood and Christian-like accord
 In their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance
 His bleeding Sword 'twixt England and faire France
 
    Lords. Amen
 
    King. Now welcome Kate: and beare me witnesse all,
 That here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene.
 
 Flourish.
 
   Quee. God, the best maker of all Marriages,
 Combine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one:
 As Man and Wife being two, are one in loue,
 So be there 'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall,
 That neuer may ill Office, or fell Iealousie,
 Which troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage,
 Thrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes,
 To make diuorce of their incorporate League:
 That English may as French, French Englishmen,
 Receiue each other. God speake this Amen
 
    All. Amen
 
    King. Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day,
 My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath
 And all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues.
 Then shall I sweare to Kate, and you to me,
 And may our Oathes well kept and prosp'rous be.
 
 Senet. Exeunt.
 
 Enter Chorus.
 
 Thus farre with rough, and all-vnable Pen,
 Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story,
 In little roome confining mightie men,
 Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
 Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued
 This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword;
 By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:
 And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord.
 Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King
 Of France and England, did this King succeed:
 Whose State so many had the managing,
 That they lost France, and made his England bleed:
 Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,
 In your faire minds let this acceptance take.
