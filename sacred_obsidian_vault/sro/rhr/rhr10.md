 <p align="center"><i>The Second Day</i>.</p>  
 <p>I was hardly got out of my cell into a forrest when methought the whole heaven and all the elements had <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Tripudium Creaturarum ob nuptias.</font></span>trimmed themselves against this wedding. Even the birds chanted more pleasantly then before, and the young fawns skipped so merrily that they rejoiced my old heart, and moved me also to sing with such a loud voice throughout <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Per Sylvam.</font></span>the whole forrest, that it resounded from all parts, the hills repeating my last words, until at length I espyed a <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">In campam.</font></span>curious green heath, whither I betook myself out of the <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">3 Cedri.</font></span>forrest. Upon this heath stood three tall cedars, which <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">3 Templa.</font></span>afforded an excellent shade, whereat I greatly rejoyced, for, although I had not gone far, my earnest longing made me <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Tabella mercurialis. 1.</font></span>faint. As soon as I came somewhat nigh, I espyed a tablet fastened to one of them, on which the following words were written in curious letters:--</p>  
 <p><a name="img_10800"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/10800.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>God save thee, Stranger! If thou hast heard anything concerning the nuptials of the King, consider these words. By us doth the Bridegroom offer thee a choice between foure ways, all of which, if thou dost not sink down in the way, can bring thee to his royal court. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1.</font></span>The first is short but dangerous, and one which will lead thee into rocky places, through which it will be scarcely possible to pass. <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">2.</font></span>The second is longer, and takes thee circuitously; it is plain and easy, if by the help of the Magnet, thou turnest neither to left nor right. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">3.</font></span>The third is that truly royal way which through various pleasures and pageants of our  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> King, affords thee a joyful journey; but this so far has scarcely been allotted to one in a thousand. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">4.</font></span> By the fourth shall no man reach the place, because it is a consuming way, practicable onely for incorruptible bodys. Choose now which thou wilt of the three, and persevere constantly therein, for know whichsoever thou shalt enter, that is the one destined for thee by immutable Fate, nor canst thou go back therein save at great peril to life. These are the things which we would have thee know, but, ho, beware! thou knowest not with how much danger thou dost commit thyself to this way, for if thou knowest thyself by the smallest fault to be obnoxious to the laws of our King, I beseech thee, while it is still possible, to return swiftly to thy house by the way which thou earnest.</p>  
 <p>As soon as I had read this writing all my joy vanished, and I, who before sang merrily, began inwardly to lament. For although I saw all three ways before me, and it was<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Via authoris eligenda.</font></span> vouchsafed me to make choice of one, yet it troubled me that in case I went the stony and rocky way, I might get a deadly fall; or, taking the long one, I might wander through bye-ways and be detained in the great journey. Neither durst I hope that I, amongst thousands, should be the one who should choose the Royal way. I saw likewise the fourth before me, but so invironed with fire and exhalation that I durst not draw near it, and, therefore, again and again considered whether I should turn back or take<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Dubium.</font></span> one of the ways before me. I well weighed my own unworthiness, and though the dream, that I was delivered out of the tower, still comforted me, yet I durst not confidently<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Comfirmatio.</font></span> rely upon it. I was so perplexed that, for great weariness, hunger and thirst seized me, whereupon I drew out my bread, cut a slice of it, which a snow-white dove, of whom</p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Columba alba arbori mercuriali insidens.</font></span>I was not aware, sitting upon the tree, espyed and therewith came down, betaking herself very familiarly to me, to whom I willingly imparted my food, which she received, and with her prettiness did again a little refresh me. But <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Corvus niger.</font></span>as soon as her enemy, a most black Raven, perceived it, he straight darted down upon the dove, and taking no notice of me, would needs force away her meat, who could not otherwise guard herself but by flight. Whereupon, both <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Versus Meridiem.</font></span>together flew toward the South, at which I was so hugely incensed and grieved, that without thinking, I made haste after the filthy Raven, and so, against my will, ran into one of the fore-mentioned ways a whole field's length. The Raven being thus chased away, and the Dove delivered, I first observed what I had inconsiderately done, and that I was <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Autor in cidit in 2 viam incogitanter</font></span>already entered into a way, from which, under peril of punishment, I durst not retire, and though I had still wherewith to comfort myself, yet that which was worst of all was, that I had left my bag and bread at the Tree, and could never retrieve them, for as soon as I turned myself about, a contrary wind was so strong against me that it was ready to fell me, but if I went forward, I perceived no hindrance, wherefore I patiently took up my cross, got upon my feet, and resolved I would use my utmost endeavour to get to my journey's end before night. Now, although many apparent <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Compassus.</font></span>byways showed themselves, I still proceeded with my compass, and would not budge one step from the meridian line. Howbeit, the way was oftentimes so rugged that I was in no little doubt of it. I constantly thought upon the Dove and Raven, and yet could not search out the meaning, until <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Diversorium.</font></span>upon a high hill afar off I espyed a stately Portal, to which, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Occasus.</font></span>not regarding that it was distant from the way I was in, I <a name="img_11000"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/11000.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>hasted, because the sun had already hid himself under the  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>hills, and I could elsewhere see no abiding place, which I verily ascribe only to God, Who might have permitted me to go forward, and withheld my eyes that so I might have gazed beside this gate, to which I now made mighty haste, and reached it by so much daylight as to take a competent view of it. It was an exceeding Royal, beautiful Portal, whereon were carved a multitude of most noble figures and devices, every one of which (as I afterwards learned) had its peculiar signification. Above was fixed a pretty large Tablet, with these words, "<i>Procul hinc procul ite profani</i>," and<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Tabula inscriptionis.</font></span> more that I was forbidden to relate. As soon as I was come unto the portal, there streight stepped forth one in a<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Portitor.</font></span> sky-coloured habit, whom I saluted in friendly manner. Though he thankfully returned my greeting, he instantly demanded my Letter of Invitation. O how glad was I<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Literæ convocationis.</font></span> that I had brought it with me! How easily might I have forgotten it as chanced to others, as he himself told me. I quickly presented it, wherewith he was not only satisfied, but showed me abundance of respect, saying, "Come in, my Brother, an acceptable guest you are to me," withal entreating me not to withhold my name from him.</p>  
 <p>Having replied that I was a Brother of the RED ROSIE<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Nomen authoris.</font></span> CROSS, he both wondred and seemed to rejoyce at it, and then proceeded thus:--"My brother, have you nothing about you wherewith to purchase a token?" I answered my ability was small, but if he saw anything about me he had a mind to, it was at his service. Having requested of me my bottle of<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Emitur aqua Tessera.</font></span> water, and I granting it, he gave me a golden token, whereon stood these letters, S.C., entreating me that when it stood<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Sanctitati constantia sponsus charus. Spes charitas.</font></span> me in good stead, I would remember him. After which I asked him how many were got in before me, which he also told me; and lastly, out of meer friendship, gave me a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Diploma.</font></span>sealed letter to the second Porter. Having lingered some time with him, the night grew on, whereupon a great beacon upon the gate was immediately fired, that if any were still upon the way, he might make haste thither. The road where it finished at the castle was enclosed with <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Castillum.</font></span>walls, and planted with all sorts of excellent fruit trees. On every third tree on each side lanterns were hung up, wherein all the candles were lighted with a glorious torch <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Virgo lucifera.</font></span>by a beautiful Virgin, habited in skye-colour, which was so noble and majestic a spectacle that I delayed longer then <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Lady Chamberlain</font></span>was requisite. At length, after an advantageous instruction, I departed from the first porter, and so went on the way, until I came to the second gate, which was adorned <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Porta secunda.<br> Tabella.</font></span>with images and mystick significations. In the affixed Tablet stood--<i>Date et dabitur volis</i>. Under this gate lay a <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Custos Leo.</font></span>terrible Lyon, chained, who, as soon as he espied me, arose and made at me with great roaring, whereupon the second <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">2 Portitor.</font></span>porter, who lay upon a stone of marble, awaked, and wishing me not to be troubled nor affrighted, drove back the lyon, and having received the letter, which I reached him with trembling hand, he read it, and with great respect spake thus to me:--"Now well-come in God's name unto me the man whom of long time I would gladly have seen!" Meanwhile, he also drew out a token, and asked me whether <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Tessera empta sale.</font></span>I could purchase it. But I, having nothing else left but my salt, presented it to him, which he thankfully accepted. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Studio merentis<br> Sal humor<br> Sponso mittendus<br> Sal mineralis<br> Sal menstrualis.</font></span>Upon this token again stood two letters, namely, S.M. Being just about to discourse with him, it began to ring in the castle, whereupon the porter counselled me to run apace, or all the paines I had taken would serve to no purpose, for the lights above began already to be extinguished, whereupon I dispatched with much haste</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>that I heeded not the porter; the virgin, after whom all the lights were put out, was at my heels, and I should never have found the way, had not she with her torch afforded me some light. I was more-over constrained to enter the<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Porta clauditur.</font></span> very next to her, and the gates were so suddenly clapt to that a part of my coate was locked out, which I was forced to leave behind me, for neither I nor they who stood ready without and called at the gate could prevail with the porter to open it again. He delivered the keys to the virgin, who took them with her into the court. I again surveyed the gate, which now appeared so rich that the world could not equal it. Just by the door were two columns, on one of which<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Pyramides portæ.</font></span> stood a pleasant figure with this inscription, <i>Congratulor</i>. On the other side was a statue with countenance veiled, and beneath was written, <i>Condoleo</i>. In brief, the inscriptions and figures thereon were so dark and mysterious that the most dexterous man could not have expounded them, yet all these I shall e’er long publish and explain. Under<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Promissum authoris.</font></span> this gate I was again to give my name, which was written down in a little vellum-book, and immediately with the rest dispatched to the Lord Bridegroom. Here I first received the true guest-token, which was somewhat less than the former, but much heavier; upon this stood the letters S. P. N. Besides this, a new pair of shoes were given. me, for the floor of the castle was pure shining marble. My<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Salus per naturam sponsi præ sentandus nuptiis.</font></span> old ones I was to give to one of the poor who sate in throngs under the gate. I bestowed them on an old man, after which two pages with as many torches conducted me<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Comes puer.</font></span> into a little room, where they willed me to sit down upon a form, and, sticking their torches in two holes made in the pavement, they departed, and left me sitting alone. Soon after I heard a noise but saw nothing; it proved to be certain</p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>men who stumbled in upon me, but since I could see nothing I was fain to suffer and attend what they would do <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Balneatores.</font></span>with me. Presently finding that they were barbers I intreated them not to jostle me, for I was content to do what they desired, whereupon one of them, whom I yet could not see, gently cut away the hair from the crown of <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Capillus detonsus asservatus.</font></span>my head, but on my forehead, ears, and eyes he permitted my ice-grey locks to hang. In this first encounter I was ready to despair, for, inasmuch as some of them shoved me so forceably, and were still invisible, I could onely think that God for my curiosity had suffered me to miscarry. The unseen barbers carefully gathered up the hair which <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Pueri bini.</font></span>was cut off, and carried it away. Then the two pages reentered and heartily laughed at me for being so terrified. They had scarce spoken a few words with me when again a little bell began to ring, which (as the pages informed me) was to give notice for assembling, whereupon they willed me to rise, and through many walks, doors, and winding <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Triclinium.</font></span>stairs lighted me into a spacious hall, where there was a great multitude of guests--emperors, kings, princes, and lords, noble and ignoble, rich and poor, and all sorts of people, at which I hugely marvelled, and thought to myself, "Ah! how gross a fool hast thou been to ingage upon this journey with so much bitterness and toil, when here are fellows whom thou well knowest, and yet hadst never any reason to esteem, while thou, with all thy prayers and supplications, art hardly got in at last."</p>  
 <p>This and more the devil at that time injected. Meantime one or other of my acquaintance spake to me:--"Oh! Brother Rosencreutz, art thou here too?" "Yea, my brethren," I replied, "The grace of God hath helped me in also," at which they raised a mighty laughter, looking upon</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>it as ridiculous that there should be need of God in so slight an occasion. Having demanded each of them <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Impictas hostum non recta via ingressorum.</font></span>concerning his way, and finding most of them were forced to clamber over the rocks, certain invisible trumpets began to sound to the table, whereupon all seated themselves, every one as he judged himself above the rest, so that for me and some other sorry fellows there was hardly a little nook left at the lowermost table. Presently the two pages entred, and one of them said grace in so handsom and excellent a manner as rejoyced the very heart in my body. <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Quidam preces negligunt.</font></span> Howbeit, some made but little reckoning of them, but fleired and winked one at another, biting their lips within their hats, and using like unseemly gestures. After this, meat was brought in, and, albeit none could be seen, everything<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Commessatio.</font></span> was so orderly managed that it seemed as if every guest had his proper attendant. Now my Artists having<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Ministri invisibles.</font></span> somewhat recruted themselves, and the wine having a little removed shame from their hearts, they presently began to<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Inebriatorum gloriatio vana</font></span> vaunt of their abilities. One would prove this, another that, and commonly the most sorry idiots made the loudest noise. When I call to mind what preternatural and impossible enterprises I then heard, I am still ready to vomit at it. In fine, they never kept in their order, but whenever possible a rascal would insinuate himself among the nobles. Every man had his own prate, and yet the great lords were so simple that they believed their pretences, and the rogues became so audacious, that although some of them were rapped .over the fingers with a knife, yet they flinched not at it, but when any one perchance had filched a gold-chain, then would all hazard for the like. I saw one who heard the movements of the Heavens, the second could see Plato's Ideas, a third could number the atoms of Democritus.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> There were not a few pretenders to perpetual motion. Many an one (in my opinion) had good understanding, but assumed too much to himself to his own destruction. Lastly, there was one who would needs persuade us that he saw the servitors who attended, and would have pursued his contention, had not one of those invisible <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Ministri invisibles.</font></span>waiters reached him so handsom a cuff upon his lying muzzle, that not only he, but many who were by him, became mute as mice. It best of all pleased me that those of whom I had any esteem were very quiet in their business, <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Modestia proborum hospitum.</font></span>acknowledging themselves to be misunderstanding men for whom the mysteries of nature were too high. In this tumult I had almost cursed the day wherein I came hither, for I could not but with anguish behold that those lewd people were above at the board, but I in my sorry place could not even rest in quiet, one of these rascals scornfully reproaching me for a motley fool. I dreamed not that there was one gate behind through which we must pass, but imagined during the whole wedding I was to continue in this scorn and indignity which I had at no time deserved, either of the Lord Bride-groom or the Bride. And, therefore, I opined he would have done well to seek <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Impatientia ex iniquitate hominum.</font></span>some other fool than me for his wedding. To such impatience doth the iniquity of this world reduce simple hearts. But this was really one part of the lameness whereof I had dreamed.</p>  
 <p>The longer all this clamour lasted, the more it increased. <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Assessor modestus.</font></span>Howbeit, there sate by me a very fine, quiet man, who discoursed of excellent matters, and at length said:--"My Brother, if any one should come now who were willing to instruct these blockish people in the right way, would he be heard?" "No, verily," I replyed. "The world," said</p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p>he, "is now resolved to be cheated, and will give no ear to<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mundus valt decipi.</font></span> those who intend its good. Seest thou that Cock's-comb, with what whimsical figures and foolish conceits he allures others. There one makes mouths at the people with unheard-of mysterious words. Yet the time is now coming when those shameful vizards shall be plucked off, and the world shall know what vagabond imposters were concealed behind them. Then perhaps that will be valued which at present is not esteemed."</p>  
 <p>While he was thus speaking, and the clamour was still increasing, all on a sudden there began in the hall such excellent and stately musick of which, all the days of my life, I<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Musica.</font></span> never heard the like. Every one held his peace, and attended what would come of it. There were all stringed instruments imaginable, sounding together in such harmony that I forgot myself, and sate so unmovably that those by me were amazed. This lasted nearly half an hour, wherein none of us spake one word, for as soon as anyone was about to open his mouth, he got an unexpected blow. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mulctæ ab attendentium</font></span> After that space this musick ceased suddenly, and presently before the door of the hall began a great sounding and beating of trumpets, shalms, and kettle-drums, all so master-like as if the Emperor of Rome had been entring. The door opened of itself, and then the noise of the trumpets was so loud that we were hardly able to indure it. Meanwhile, many thousand small tapers came into the hall, <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Faculæ ad lectum.</font></span> marching of themselves in so exact an order as amazed us, till at last the two fore-mentioned pages with bright torches entred lighting in a most beautiful Virgin, drawn<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Virgo lucifera.</font></span> on a gloriously gilded, triumphant self-moving throne. She seemed to me the same who on the way kindled and<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Lady Chamberlain</font></span> put out the lights, and that these her attendants were the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Albedo.</font></span>very ones whom she formerly placed at the trees. She was not now in skye-colour, but in a snow-white, glittering robe, which sparkled of pure gold, and cast such a lustre that we durst not steadily behold it. Both the pages were after the same manner habited, albeit somewhat more slightly. As soon as they were come into the middle of the hall, and were descended from the throne, all the small tapers made obeisance, before her, whereupon we all stood up, and she having to us, as we again to her, shewed all <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Salutatoria hospitum.</font></span>respect and reverence, in a most pleasant tone she began thus to speak:--</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"The King my Lord most gracious,<br> Who now 's not very far from us,<br> As also his most lovely Bride,<br> To him in troth and honour tied,<br> Already, with great joy indued,<br> Have your arrival hither view’d;<br> And do to every one and all<br> Promise their grace in special;<br> And from their very heart's desire<br> You may the same in time acquire,<br> That so their future nuptial joy<br> May mixed he with none's annoy."</small></div>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Hereupon, with all her small tapers, she again courteously bowed, and presently began thus:--</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"In th’ Invitation writ you know<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Propositio actionis.</font></span><br> That no man called was hereto<br> Who of God's rarest gifts good store<br> Had not received long before.<br> Although we cannot well conceit<br> That any man's so desperate,<br> Under conditions so hard,<br> Here to intrude without regard,<br> Unless he have been first of all<br> Prepared for this Nuptial,<br> And, therefore, in good hopes do dwell<br> That with all you it will be well; <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a><br> Yet men are grown so bold and rude,<br> Not weighing their ineptitude,<br> As still to thrust themselves in place<br> Whereto none of them called was.<br> No cock's-comb here himself may sell,<br> No rascal in with others steal,<br> For we resolve without all let<br> A Wedding pure to celebrate.<br> So, then, the artists for to weigh,<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Probatio artificum</font></span><br> Scales shall be fixt th’ ensuing day;<br> Whereby each one may lightly find<br> What he hath left at home behind.<br> If here be any of that rout,<br> Who have good cause themselves to doubt,<br> Let him pack quickly hence aside,<br> Because in case he longer bide,<br> Of grace forelorn, and quite undone,<br> Betimes he must the gantlet run.<br> If any now his conscience gall,<br> He shall to-night be left in th’ hall,<br> And be again releast by morn,<br> Yet so he hither ne’er return.<br> If any man have confidence,<br> He with his waiter may go hence,<br> Who shall him to his chamber light,<br> Where he may rest in peace to-night."</small></div>  
 <p>As soon as she had done speaking, she again made reverence, and sprung chearfully into her throne, after which the trumpets began again to sound, and conducted her invisibly away, but the most part of the small tapers remained, and still one of them accompanied each of us. In our perturbation, ’tis scarcely possible to express what pensive thoughts and gestures were amongst us, yet most part resolved to await the scale, and in case things sorted not well to depart (as they hoped) in peace. I had soon<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Autor humiliat se.</font></span> cast up my reckoning, and seeing my conscience convinced me of all ignorance and unworthiness, I purposed to stay with the rest in the hall, and chose rather to content myself</p>  
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the meal I had taken than to run the risk of a future repulse. After every one by his small taper had been severally conducted to a chamber (each, as I since understood, into a peculiar one), there staid nine of us, including he who discoursed with me at the table. Although our small tapers left us not, yet within an hour's time one of the pages came in, and, bringing a great bundle of cords with him, first demanded whether we had concluded to stay there, which when we had with sighs affirmed, he bound each of us in a several place, and so went away with our tapers, leaving us poor wretches in darkness. Then first began some to perceive the imminent danger, and myself could not refrain tears, for, although we were not forbidden to speak, anguish and affliction suffered none of us to utter one word. The cords were so wonderfully made that none could cut them, much less get them off his feet, yet this comforted me, that the future gain of many an one who had now betaken himself to rest would prove little to his satisfaction, but we by one night's pennance might expiate all our presumption. At length in my sorrowful thoughts I fell asleep, during which I had a <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Somnium typicum.</font></span>dream which I esteem not impertinent to recount. Methought I was upon an high mountain, and saw before me <span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">What will be the issue of the probatory beam?

In such discourse we spent the remaining part of the night, and with longing expected the day.</p>
