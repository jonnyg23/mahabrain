 <p>The following pages were originally intended to form the basis of a separate work, entitled "<i>A Key to the Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians</i>." As the idea of bringing out such a book has been abandoned for the present, they have been added as a suitable appendix to the foregoing historical notes.</p>  
 <p>It will be found that the doctrines presented herein contain the most profound secrets, especially in regard to the "resurrection of the flesh." They go to show that the physical body is neither a useless nor a despicable thing, and that Matter is as necessary to Spirit, as Spirit to Matter. Without the presence of a living body no resurrection could take place; neither could the Spirit have any relative existence without the presence of a material form. The state of Nirvana is not to be attained by merely dreaming about it, and before Man can rise superior to anything he must have attained that to which he desires to become superior. Only from the soul resurrected within the body of flesh arises the glorified spirit.</p>

 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Our salvation is the life of Christ in us.</font></p>  
 <p>THE place or state wherein the true Rosicrucian lives is far too exalted and glorious to be described in words. When we enter the vestibule of the temple of the true Rosy Cross, we enter into a region of unalloyed bliss and happiness. There is an effulgence of super-terrestrial light, where all <a href="errata.htm#17">laborious</a> thinking and exercise of the imagination for the purpose of drawing logical inferences about the unknown, ceases, for in that light is the realm of pure knowledge; to live there is to perceive, and to perceive is to know. Into .that paradise of celestial consciousness nothing impure can enter. No room is there for terrestrial flesh and blood; but the spiritual beings which inhabit that realm are made of the flesh and body of "Christ," in other words, of the substance of the spiritual soul.</p>  
 <p>H. P. Blavatsky, in her "Key to Theosophy," says that there are beings having attained a state of spiritual consciousness which would entitle them to enter the state of Nirvana; nevertheless, out of compassion for mankind, they still remain residents of this earth, inhabiting invisibly for mortal eyes the astral plane of our planet. In that, she describes the true order of the <i>Golden and Rosy Cross</i> as a spiritual</p>  
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Brotherhood, and if one of these superior beings, for some purpose or other, reincarnates in a human body upon this planet, then will there be a real Rosicrucian in a visible form upon this earth.</p>  
 <p>The "history" of that "brotherhood" is the history of the evolution of the world, and that of the spiritual regeneration of the soul and the body of man; for although each of these individual beings had its own <a href="errata.htm#18">terrestrial</a> history and experiences in passing through many incarnations upon this planet, nevertheless, in its essential points the history of all is alike, and consisted in the conquering of the low and the unfoldment of the high. They all had to bear the Cross of suffering before they could become crowned with victory; they all had to crucify their selfish and personal will, and die in regard to all that attracts the soul to the sphere of earthly desires and illusions before they could have the spiritual faculties of their souls unfolded like the Rose whose leaves are unfolded by the rays of the rising sun.</p>  
 <p align="center">________________</p>  <h4 align="center">ROSICRUCIAN RULES.</h4>  
 <p>1. <i>Love God above all</i>.</p>  
 <p>To "love God" means to love wisdom and truth. We can love God in no other way than in being obedient to Divine law; and to enable us to exercise that obedience conscientiously requires knowledge of the law, which can only be gained by practice.</p>  
 <p>2. <i>Devote your time to your spiritual advancement</i>.</p>  
 <p>As the sun without leaving his place in the sky sends his rays upon the earth to shine upon the pure and the impure, and to illuminate even the most minute material objects with his light; likewise the spirit of man may send his mental rays into matter to obtain knowledge of all terrestrial things; but there is no need that the spirit should thereby lose its own divine self-consciousness, and be itself absorbed by the objects of its perception.</p>  
 <p>3. <i>Be entirely unselfish</i>.</p>  
 <p>Spiritual knowledge begins only where all sense of self ceases. Where the delusion which causes man to imagine himself to be a being separated and isolated from others ends, there he begins to realize his true state as an all-embracing universal and divine self-conscious power.</p>  
 <p>4. <i>Be</i> <a href="errata.htm#19"><i>temperate</i></a>, <i>modest, energetic, and silent</i>.</p>  
 <p>The door to the inner temple is called "Contentment"; but no animal can enter therein, only he who walks uprightly, being conscious of his true dignity as a human being. Without energy, nothing can be accomplished; and only in the silence, when all thoughts and desires are at rest, can the Divine harmonies penetrate to the internal ear.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>Learn to know the origin of the</i> METALS <i>contained within thyself</i>.</p>  
 <p>Ignorance is the cause of suffering. That which is material must be crucified and die, so that that which is spiritual may be resurrected and live.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. <i>Beware of quacks and pretenders</i>.</p>  
 <p>He who claims to be in possession of knowledge knows nothing; only he through whom the Word of wisdom speaks is wise.</p>  
 <p>7. <i>Live in constant adoration of the highest good</i>.</p>  
 <p>The worm seeks for pleasure among abomination and filth; but the free eagle spreads his wings and rises up towards the sun.</p>  
 <p>8. <i>Learn the theory before you attempt the practice</i>.</p>  
 <p>He who travels with a trustworthy guide will be safer than he who refuses to profit by the experience of another.</p>  
 <p>9. <i>Exercise charity towards all beings</i>.</p>  
 <p>All beings are one in the spirit; divided from each other merely by the illusion of form. He who is charitable towards another form in which the universal One Life is manifest, saves suffering to his own self.</p>  
 <p>10. <i>Read the ancient books of wisdom</i>.</p>  
 <p>Books are to the unripe mind that which the mother's milk is to the nursling. We must receive drink from others until we have gained sufficient strength and experience to descend to the living fountain within ourselves, and to draw from there the water of truth.</p>  
 <p>11. <i>Try to understand their secret meaning</i>.</p>  
 <p>That which is external may be seen with the external eye; but that which is spiritual can only be seen with the eye of the spirit.</p>  
 <p>These are the eleven rules which ought to be followed by those who desire to enter the temple of the Rosy Cross; but the Rosicrucians have a twelfth rule, an <i>Arcanum</i>, in which great powers reside, but of which it is not lawful to speak. This Arcanum will be given to those who deserve it, and by its aid they will find light in the darkness, and a guiding hand through the labyrinth. This Arcanum is inexpressible in the language of mortals, and it can, therefore, only be communicated from <i>heart to heart</i>. There is no torture strong enough to extract it from the true Rosicrucian; for even if he were willing to reveal it, those who are unworthy of it are not capable of receiving it.</p>  
 <p align="center">________________</p>  <h4 align="center">THE DUTIES OF A ROSICRUCIAN.</h4>  
 <p>Those who are dead in the flesh will read the following with the external understanding; those who live in the spirit will see its internal meaning, and act accordingly.</p>  
 <p>The duties of a true Rosicrucian are:</p>  
 <p>1. <i>To alleviate suffering and to cure the sick without accepting any remuneration</i>.</p>  
 <p>The medicine which they give is more valuable than gold; it is of an invisible kind, and can be had for nothing everywhere.</p>  
 <p>2. <i>To adopt the style of their clothing to the costumes of the country wherein they reside for the time being</i>.</p>  
 <p>The clothing of the spirit is the form which he inhabits, and must be adapted to the conditions of the planet whereon he resides.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. <i>To meet once a year in a certain place</i>.</p>  
 <p>Those who do not meet at that place, when their terrestrial career is over will have their names taken out of the book of life.</p>  
 <p>4. <i>Each member has to select a proper person to be his successor</i>.</p>  
 <p>Each man is himself the creator of that being whose personality he adopts on the next step on the ladder of evolution.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>The letters R.C. are the emblem of the order</i>.</p>  
 <p>Those who have truly entered the order will bear the marks upon their body, which cannot be mistaken by him who is capable of recognising them.</p>  
 <p>6. <i>The existence of the Brotherhood is to be kept secret for one hundred years, beginning from the time when it was first established</i>.</p>  
 <p>Nor will the "hundred years" be over until man has awakened to the consciousness of his own divine nature.</p>  
 <p align="center">________________</p>  <h4 align="center">THE SECRET SIGNS OF THE ROSICRUCIANS.</h4>  
 <p>There are sixteen signs by which a member of the order of the Rosicrucians may be known. He who possesses only a few of those signs is not a member of a very high degree, for the true Rosicrucian possesses them all.</p>  
 <p>1. <i>The Rosicrucian is Patient</i>.</p>  
 <p>His first and most important victory is the conquest of his own self. It is the victory over the LION, who has bitterly injured some of the best followers of the Holy Cross. He is not to be vanquished by a fierce and inconsiderate attack made upon him; but he must be made to surrender to patience and fortitude. The true Rosicrucian tries to overcome his enemies by kindness, and those who hate him by gifts. He heaps not curses, but the burning fire of love upon their heads. He does not persecute his enemies with the sword, or with faggots, but he suffers the weeds to grow with the wheat until they are both matured, when they will be separated by Nature.</p>  
 <p>2. <i>The Rosicrucian is Kind</i>.</p>  
 <p>He never appears gloomy or melancholy, or with a scowl or sneer upon his face. He acts kindly and politely towards everybody, and is always ready to render assistance to others. Although he is different from the majority of other people, still he tries to accommodate himself to their ways, habits and manners, as much as his dignity will permit. He is, therefore, an agreeable companion, and knows how to converse with the rich as well as with the poor, and to move among all classes of society so as to command their respect; for he has conquered the bear of vulgarity.</p>  
 <p>3. <i>The Rosicrucian knows no Envy</i>.</p>  
 <p>Before he is accepted into the order he must go through the terrible ordeal of cutting off the head of the snake of envy; which is a very difficult labour, because the snake is sly, and easily hides itself in some corner. The true Rosicrucian is always content with his lot, knowing that it is such as he deserves it to be. He never worries about</p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>the advantages or riches which others possess, but wishes always the best to everybody. He knows that he will obtain all he deserves, and he cares not if any other person possesses more than he. He expects no favours, but he distributes his favours without any partiality.</p>  
 <p>4. <i>The Rosicrucian does not Boast</i>.</p>  
 <p>He knows that man is nothing but an instrument in the hands of GOD, and that he can accomplish nothing useful by his own will; the latter being nothing but the will of GOD perverted in man. To GOD he gives all the praise, and to that which is mortal he gives all the blame. He is in no inordinate haste to accomplish a thing, but he waits until he receives his orders from the Master who resides above and within. He is careful what he speaks about, and uses no unhallowed language.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>The Rosicrucian is not Vain</i>.</p>  
 <p>He proves thereby that there is something real in him, and that he is not like a blown-up bag filled with air. Applause or blame leaves him unaffected, nor does he feel aggrieved if he is contradicted or encounters contempt. He lives within himself, and enjoys the beauties of his own inner world, but he never desires to show off his possessions, nor to pride himself on any spiritual gifts which he may have attained. The greater his gifts, the greater will be his modesty, and the more will he be willing to be obedient to the law.</p>  
 <p>6. <i>The Rosicrucian is not Disorderly</i>.</p>  
 <p>He always strives to do his duty, and to act according to the order established by the law. He cares nothing for externalities, nor for ceremonies. The law is written within his heart, and therefore all his thoughts and acts are ruled by it. His respectability is not centred in his external appearance, but in his real being, which may be compared to a root from which all his actions spring. The interior beauty of his soul is reflected upon his exterior, and stamps all his acts with its seal; the light existing in his heart may be perceived in his eye by an expert; it is the mirror of the Divine image within.</p>  
 <p>7. <i>The Rosicrucian is not Ambitious</i>.</p>  
 <p>There is nothing more injurious to spiritual development and expansion of the soul than a narrow mind and a selfish character. The true Rosicrucian always cares much more for the welfare of others than for his own. He has no private or personal interest to defend or foster. He always seeks to do good, and he never avoids any opportunity which may present itself for that purpose.</p>  
 <p>8. <i>The Rosicrucian is not Irritable</i>.</p>  
 <p>It is evident that a person who works for the benefit of the whole will be hated by those whose personal advantages are not benefited thereby; because selfishness is opposed to magnanimity, and the claims of the few are not always compatible with the interests of the community. The Rosicrucian will therefore be often resisted by narrow-minded and short-sighted people; he will be slandered by calumniators, his motives will be misrepresented, he will be misjudged by the ignorant,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>ridiculed by the would-be wise, and taunted by the fool. All such proceedings, however, cannot excite or irritate the mind of the true Rosicrucian, nor disturb the divine harmony of his soul; for his faith rests in the perception and knowledge of the truth within himself. The opposition of a thousand ignorant people will not induce him to desist from doing that which he knows to be noble and good, and he will do it even if it should involve the loss of his fortune or of his life. Being able and accustomed to direct his spiritual sight towards the divine, he cannot be deluded by the illusions of matter, but clings to the eternal reality. Being surrounded by angelic influences, and listening to their voices, he is not affected by the noise made by the animals. He lives in the company of those noble beings, who were once men like others, but who have become transfigured, and who are now beyond the reach of the vulgar and low.</p>  
 <p>9. <i>The Rosicrucian does not think evil of others</i>.</p>  
 <p>Those who think evil of others see merely the evil which exists within themselves reflected and mirrored forth in others. The Rosicrucian is always willing to recognise in everything that which is good. Tolerance is a virtue by which the Rosicrucian is eminently distinguished from others; and by which he may be known. If a thing appears to be ambiguous, he suspends his judgment about it until he has investigated its nature; but as long as his judgment is not perfect, he is more inclined to form a good opinion than an evil one about everything.</p>  
 <p>10. <i>The Rosicrucian loves justice</i>.</p>  
 <p>He, however, never sets himself up as a judge over the faults of others, nor does he wish to appear to be wise by censuring the mistakes of others. He does not enjoy gossip, and cares no more about the foolishness committed by others, than he would about the buzzing of a fly or the capers of a monkey. He finds no pleasure in listening to political or personal quarrels, disputations, or mutual recriminations. He cares nothing for the cunningness of a fox, the dissimulation of a crocodile, or the rapacity of a wolf, and is not amused by the stirring up of mud. His nobility of character lifts him up into a sphere far beyond all such trifles and absurdities, and being above the sensual plane, wherein ordinary mortals find their happiness and enjoyment, he lives with those who do not think evil of each other, who do not rejoice about an injustice done to their brother, or make merry about his ignorance, and enjoy his misfortunes. He enjoys the company of those who love the truth, and who are surrounded by the peace and harmony of the spirit.</p>  
 <p>11. <i>The Rosicrucian loves the truth</i>.</p>  
 <p>There is no devil worse than falsehood and calumny. Ignorance is a nonentity, but falsehood is the substance of evil. The calumniator rejoices whenever he has found something upon which to base his lies and to make them grow like mountains. Opposed to it is the truth, it being a ray of light from the eternal fountain of GOOD, which has</p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p>the power to transform man into a divine being. The ROSICRUCIAN seeks, therefore, no other light but the light of truth, and this light he does not enjoy alone, but in company of all who are good and filled with its divine majesty, whether they live on this earth or in the spiritual state; and he enjoys it above all with those who are persecuted, oppressed, and innocent, but who will be saved by the truth.</p>  
 <p>12. <i>The Rosicrucian knows how to be silent</i>.</p>  
 <p>Those who are false do not love the truth. Those who are foolish do not love wisdom. The true Rosicrucian prefers to enjoy the company of those who can appreciate truth to that of those who would trample it with their feet. He will keep that which he knows locked up within his heart, for in silence is power. As a minister of state does not go about telling to everybody the secrets of the king; so the Rosicrucian does not parade before the public the revelations made to him by the king within, who is nobler and wiser than all the earthly kings and princes; for they only rule by the authority and power derived from Him. His secrecy ceases only when the king commands him to speak, for it is then not he who speaks, but the truth that is speaking through him.</p>  
 <p>13. <i>The Rosicrucian believes that which he knows</i>.</p>  
 <p>He believes in the immutability of eternal law, and that every cause has a certain effect. He knows that the truth cannot lie, and that the promises made to him by the king will be fulfilled, if he does not himself hinder their fulfilment. He is, therefore, inaccessible to doubt or fear, and puts implicit confidence in the divine principle of truth, which has become alive and conscious within his heart.</p>  
 <p>14. <i>The Rosicrucian's hope is firm</i>.</p>  
 <p>Spiritual hope is the certain conviction resulting from a knowledge of the law, that the truths recognised by faith will grow and be fulfilled; it is the knowledge of the heart, and very different from the intellectual speculation of the reasoning brain. His faith rests upon the rock of direct perception and cannot be overthrown. He knows that in everything, however evil it may appear to he, there is a germ of good, and he hopes that in the course of evolution that germ will become developed, and thus evil be transformed into good.</p>  
 <p>15. <i>The Rosicrucian cannot be vanquished by suffering</i>.</p>  
 <p>He knows that there is no light without shadow, no evil without some good, and that strength only grows by resistance. Having once recognised the existence of the Divine principle within everything, external changes are to him of little importance, and do not deserve great attention. His main object is to hold on to his spiritual possessions, and not to lose the crown which he has gained in the battle of life.</p>  
 <p>16. <i>The Rosicrucian will</i> <a href="errata.htm#20"><i>always</i></a> <i>remain a member of his society</i>.</p>  
 <p>Names are of little importance. The principle which presides over the Rosicrucian Society is the truth; and he who knows the truth, and follows it in practice, is a member of the society over which the truth</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>practises. If all names were changed and all languages altered, the truth would remain the same; and he who lives in the truth will live even if all nations should pass away.</p>  
 <p>These are the sixteen signs of the true Rosicrucians, which have been revealed to a pilgrim by an angel who took away the heart of the pilgrim, leaving in its place a fiery coal, which is now incessantly burning and glowing with love of the universal brotherhood of humanity.</p>  
 <p align="center">________________</p>  <h4 align="center">ROSICRUCIAN JEWELS.</h4>  
 <p>The most valuable jewel of the Rosicrucians is WISDOM, which is represented by a pure DIAMOND in the centre of the ROSE, but the CROSS is adorned with twelve jewels of priceless value, in all of which the power that resides in the truth is manifested. These jewels are:</p>  
 <p>1. <i>Jasper</i> (dark green). The power of active light, multiplying itself to a sevenfold degree, and evolving seven states of the one light, by which the seven states of darkness may be consumed.</p>  
 <p>2. <i>Hyacinth</i> (yellow). LOVE, born from the matrix of Light, manifesting itself as it grows, and emitting red rays. Its power overcomes the spirit of anger and violence.</p>  
 <p>3. <i>Chrysolite</i> (white). Princely wisdom. It confounds that which is foolish and vain, subdues it, and comes out of the battle victorious.</p>  
 <p>4. <i>Sapphire</i> (blue). Truth; originating and growing out of its own essence. It overcomes doubt and vacillation.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>Smaragd</i> (green). The blooming spring in its eternal justice, destroying the unjust attributes of a perverted and degenerate nature, and opening the fountain of infinite treasures.</p>  
 <p>6. <i>Topaz</i> (golden). The symbol of peace, mild and pleasant. It suffers no impurity or division to exist, neither does it admit that which causes separation and quarrels. It heals ruptures and cures wounds.</p>  
 <p>7. <i>Amethyst</i> (violet). Impartiality, equilibrium of justice and judgment. It cannot be falsified, bent, or counterfeited. It weighs all things in the scales of justice, and is opposed to fraud, cruelty, or tyranny.</p>  
 <p>8. <i>Beryl</i> (diverse colours). Meekness, humility; the equal temperature of the spirit, being kind and good, and overcoming wrath, stubbornness, and bitterness.</p>  
 <p>9. <i>Sardis</i> (light red). The high magical FAITH, growing into power, and destroying fear, scepticism, and superstition,</p>  
 <p>10. <i>Chrysoprase</i> (light green). Invisible power and strength, overcoming all opposition, allowing nothing to remain which could possibly resist the law.</p>  
 <p>11. <i>Sardonyx</i> (striped). Triumphant JOY and gladness, flowing from the eternal fountain of happiness, destroying all sorrow and sadness. (May it bless you!).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. <i>Chalcedony</i> (striped). The crown of Victory, dominion, glory. The keystone and the greatest of all miracles, turning everything to the glorification of GOD.</p>

 <p>It is, beyond any doubt, most certain and true, that the Below is like the Above, and thereby can be accomplished the miracle of one only thing. As all things are derived from only one thing, by the will and the word of the One who created it in his mind; likewise all things result from this unity by the order of nature. Its father is the sun, its mother the moon; the air carries it in its womb; its nurse is the earth. This thing is the origin of all perfections that exist throughout the world. Its power is most perfect when it has again been reduced to earth.</p>  
 <p>Separate the earth from the fire, and the subtle from that which is gross; act with prudence, understanding, and modesty. It rises up from the earth to the heavens, and returns again to the earth, taking unto itself the power of the Above and the Below. Thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world. Therefore discard all ignorance and impotency. This is the strongest of all powers, for it overcomes all subtle things, and can penetrate through all that is gross. Thus was the world created, and from this originate rare combinations, and are wrought miracles of various kinds. Therefore have I been called Hermes Trismegistus, having obtained <a href="errata.htm#21">three-parts</a> of the wisdom of the whole world. This is what is to be said about the masterwork of the alchymical art.</p>
