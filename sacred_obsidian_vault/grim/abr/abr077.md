   <h3 align="center">NOTES TO CHAPTER XVI.</h3>  
 <p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels or by the Guardian Angel.</p>  
 <p>(<i>b</i>) ASTAROT and ARITON both execute the Operations hereof by their Ministers, yet not together, but each separately.</p>  
 <p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
 <p>(<i>d</i>) Select the Symbol of the Treasure desired, and the Spirit will then shew it to you. Then place the Symbol at once upon the Treasure, and it will no longer be possible for it to disappear into the ground, nor for it to be carried away. Furthermore any Spirits which may be guarding it will thus be put to flight, and you can then dispose of the Treasure as you wish.</p>  
 <p>(<i>e</i>) No. 1 is a species of border of 28 Squares of which 18 are occupied by letters, taken from a Square of 64 Squares.--TIPHARAH means "Glory, beauty, a shining thing". ITI is the Chaldaic for "is, are".</p>
