 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 22.--The Fifth Pentacle of Jupiter.--This hath great power. It serveth for assured visions. Jacob being armed with this Pentacle beheld the ladder which reached unto heaven.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The Hebrew letters within the Pentacle are taken from the five last words of the versicle which surrounds it, each of which contains five letters. These are, then, recombined so as to form certain Mystical Names. The versicle is taken from Ezekiel i. 1:--' As I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of Elohim.' In my opinion the versicle should only consist of the five last words thereof, when the anachronism of Jacob using a Pentacle with a sentence from Ezekiel will no longer exist.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 23.--The Sixth Pentacle of Jupiter.--It serveth for protection against all earthly dangers, by regarding it each day devoutedly, and repeating the versicle which surroundeth it. Thus shalt thou never perish.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The four Names in the Arms of the Cross are Seraph, Kerub, Ariel, and Tharsis; the four Rulers of the Elements. The versicle is from Psalm xxii. 16, 17:-' They pierced my hands and my feet, I may tell all my bones.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 24.--The Seventh and last Pentacle of Jupiter.--It hath great power against poverty, if thou considerest it with devotion, repeating the versicle. It serveth furthermore to drive away those Spirits who guard treasures, and to discover the same.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--Mystical Characters of Jupiter with the verse:--'Lifting up the poor out of the mire, and raising the needy from the dunghill, that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.'--Psalm cxiii, 7.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">MARS.</h3>
 <p>Figure 25.--The first Pentacle of Mars.--It is proper for invoking Spirits of the Nature of Mars, especially those which are written in the Pentacle.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--Mystical Characters of Mars, and the Names of the four Angels:--Madimiel, Bartzachiah, Eschiel, and Ithuriel written in Hebrew around the Pentacle.</p>
