 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">KINO TSURAYUKI</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Poet, and Editor of the "Kokinshiu"</span></p>  
 <p><small>He was a Court noble, and of royal descent; he died in A.D. 946. His preface to the "Kokinshiu" is full of poetic thoughts and bas much beauty of style. One of its passages runs as follows: "The Poetry of Yamato has the human heart for its seed, and grows therefrom into the manifold forms of speech." For further extracts see W. G. Aston's "History of Japanese Literature."</small></p>  
 <p>Another work of Tsurayuki—the "Tosa Nikki"—is in the form of a diary written on his return to Kioto after completing his term of office as prefect there; it is dated the beginning of the year 935 A.D. During his stay at Tosa he lost his little daughter of nine years, and the Tanks following probably has reference to his bereavement.</p>  <h3 align="center">TANKA FROM THE "TOSA NIKKI"</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kino Tsurayuki</span></p>  
 <p>Drive us toward the glistening shell-strewn sand,<br> I would descend from out my ship, O waves!<br> "Shell of forgetfulness" <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">*</font></a> clasped in my hand,<br> Then shall my soul obtain the peace it craves—<br> Forgetfulness of all the longing vain<br> For her whose face I may not see again!</p>

 <p>It is the dawning of the Spring,<br> Yet does it seem to me<br> The brown leaves of the Fall<br> Scattered beyond recall<br> Float on the jewelled sea!</p>  <h3 align="center">THE WILD GEESE</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kino Tsurayuki</span></p>  
 <p>Unseen above me in the night,<br> Dark autumn night, they swiftly fly,<br> The wild geese on their southward flight.<br> While listening to their plaintive cry,<br> I think of old friends far away,<br> And muse if, as in olden days,<br> These birds some message might convey<br> From those who dwell in distant ways!</p>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kino Tsurayuki</span></p>  
 <p>Were but the plum-flowers scentless as the snow,<br> That softly falls upon the budding spray,<br> How could we tell the pure white blooms that blow<br> From the cold snowflakes, all alike as they,<br> Starring the brown boughs’ tracery to-day?</p>  <h3 align="center">TANKA FROM THE "KOKINSHIU"</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Compiled</span> A.D. 905-922</p>  <h3 align="center">REMEMBRANCE</h3>  
 <p>Shall I forget thee?<br> Not for that instant brief,<br> In which the lightning's blade<br> Lights up each ear of grain,<br> Each swaying stem and leaf,<br> When Autumn decks the plain<br>   In rare brocade</p>  <h3 align="center">PLUM-BLOSSOM</h3>  
 <p>  In this Spring night<br> Of all-pervading grey,<br>   No ray of light<br> Reveals the plum-tree's spray,<br> But viewless to the skies<br> Its perfumes still arise.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">VANISHING</h3>  
 <p>Even as this passing life of ours,<br> The cherry-blossoms fair display!<br> Scarce have we gazed, in fragrant showers<br> Of petals, from the wind-tossed spray,<br> The blossoms’ beauties pass away!</p>  <h3 align="center">THE LEAVES</h3>  
 <p>See the red maple-leaves that swirl<br> In Autumn storm-winds t brief their span,<br> Into the outer dark they whirl!<br> More fleeting still the life of man.</p>  <h3 align="center">THE TOMB</h3>  
 <p>An ancient tomb, with withered shikimi,<br> Where the red dragon-flies flit to and fro!</p>  <h3 align="center">THE DREAM</h3>  
 <p>Before I slept, I thought of thee,<br> Then fell asleep, and sought for thee,<br>      And found thee:<br> Had I but known ’twas only seeming,<br> I had not waked, but lain for ever dreaming!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">SONG OF MIONOSEKI</h3>  
 <p>Seki is a fair place and a lovely,<br> With glorious morning sun.<br> There, from the holy mountains<br> Softly the winds blow, softly!</p>  <h3 align="center">PASSING</h3>  
 <p>What of our life! ’Tis imaged by a boat:<br> The wide dawn sees it on the sea afloat;<br>     Swiftly it rows away,<br> And on the dancing waves no trace is seen<br>     That it has ever been!</p>  <h3 align="center">ILLUSION</h3>  
 <p>That which we see in sleep,<br> Is that alone a dream?<br> To me the world itself<br> Is not what it may seem,<br> But just a phantasy!</p>
