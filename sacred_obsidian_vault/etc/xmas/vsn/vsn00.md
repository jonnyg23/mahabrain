 <p>Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br>   Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br>   The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>   In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br>   The children were nestled all snug in their beds;<br>   While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br>   And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>   Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap;<br>   When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>   I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>   Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>   Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br>   The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br>   Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br>   When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>   But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer,<br>   With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br>   I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>   More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>   And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br>   "Now, <u>Dasher</u>! now, <u>Dancer</u>! now, <u>Prancer</u>   and <u>Vixen</u>!<br>   On <u>Comet</u>! on, <u>Cupid</u>! on <u>Donder</u>   and <u>Blitzen</u>!<br>   To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br>   Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  </div>

 <p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>   When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br>   So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>   With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br>   And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>   The prancing and pawing of each little hoof<br>   As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br>   Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br>   He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>   And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>   A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br>   And he lookd like a pedlar   just opening his pack.<br>   His eyeshow they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br>   His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>   His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow<br>   And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br>   The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>   And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>   He had a broad face and a little round belly<br>   That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.<br>   He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf.<br>   And I laughed, when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>   A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>   Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  </div>

 <p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>   And filld all the stockings; then turned with a   jerk,<br>   And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>   And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br>   He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>   And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>   But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br>   "<u>Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night</u>."</p>
