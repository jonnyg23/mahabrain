 The full meaning of this sloka can be fully comprehended only
 after reading the detailed additional explanations in the "Anthropogenesis"
 and its commentaries, in Book II. Between this Sloka and the last,
 Sloka 4 in this same Stanza, extend long ages; and there now gleams
 the dawn and sunrise of another aeon. The drama enacted on our
 planet is at the beginning of its fourth act, but for a clearer
 comprehension of the whole play the reader will have to turn back
 before he can proceed onward. For this verse belongs to the general
 Cosmogony given in the archaic volumes, whereas Book II. will
 give a detailed account of the "Creation" or rather
 the formation, of the first human beings, followed by the second
 humanity, and then by the third; or, as they are called, "the
 first, second, and the third Root-Races." As the solid Earth
 began by being a ball of liquid fire, of fiery dust and its protoplasmic
 phantom, so did man.</p><hr>

 (<em>a</em>) That which is meant by the qualification the "Fourth"
 is explained as the "fourth Round" only on the authority
 of the Commentaries. It can equally mean fourth "Eternity"
 as "Fourth Round," or even the fourth (our) Globe. For,
 as will repeatedly be shown, it is the fourth Sphere on the fourth
 or lowest plane of material life. And it so happens that we are
 in the Fourth Round, at the middle point of which the perfect
 equilibrium between Spirit and Matter had to take place.* Says
 the Commentary explaining the verse: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>The holy youths </em>(<em>the gods</em>)<em> refused
 to multiply and create species after their likeness</em>,<em>
 after their kind. They are not fit forms </em>(<em>rupas</em>)<em>
 for us. They have to grow. They refuse to enter the chhayas </em>(<em>shadows
 or images</em>)<em> of their inferiors. Thus had selfish feeling
 prevailed from the beginning</em>,<em> even among the gods</em>,<em>
 and they fell under the eye of the Karmic Lipikas.</em>"
 </p><p>
 They had to suffer for it in later births. How the punishment
 reached the gods will be seen in the second volume.

 WILL BE BORN IN THE FOURTH (<em>Race</em>),<em> </em>SUFFER AND
 CAUSE SUFFERING (<em>b</em>). <strong>T</strong>HIS IS THE FIRST
 WAR (<em>c</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>It is a universal tradition that, before
 the physiological "Fall," propagation of one's kind,
 whether human or animal, took place through the WILL of the Creators,
 or of their progeny. It was the Fall of Spirit into generation,
 not the Fall of mortal man. It has already been stated that, to
 become a Self-Conscious Spirit, the latter must pass through every
 cycle of being, culminating in its highest point on earth in Man.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * It was, as we shall see, at this period -- during the highest
 point of civilization and knowledge, as also of human intellectuality,
 of the fourth, Atlantean Race -- that, owing to the final crisis
 of physiologico-spiritual adjustment of the races, humanity branched
 off into its two diametrically opposite paths: the RIGHT- and
 the LEFT-hand paths of knowledge or of Vidya. "<em>Thus were
 the germs of the White and the Black Magic sown in those days.
 The seeds lay latent for some time</em>,<em> to sprout only during
 the early period of the Fifth </em>(<em>our Race</em>)<em>.</em>"<em>
 </em>(<em>Commentary.</em>) </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 193 THE FIRST CAUSE OF SIN.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Spirit <em>per se </em>is an unconscious negative ABSTRACTION.
 Its purity is inherent, not acquired by merit; hence, as already
 shown, to become the highest Dhyan Chohan it is necessary for
 each Ego to attain to full self-consciousness as a human, <em>i.e.</em>,
 conscious Being, which is synthesized for us in Man. The Jewish
 Kabalists arguing that no Spirit could belong to the divine hierarchy
 unless Ruach (Spirit) was united to Nephesh (living Soul), only
 repeat the Eastern Esoteric teaching. "A Dhyani has to be
 an Atma-Buddhi; once the Buddhi-Manas breaks loose from its immortal
 Atma of which it (Buddhi) is the vehicle, Atman passes into NON-BEING,
 which is absolute Being." This means that the purely Nirvanic
 state is a passage of Spirit back to the ideal abstraction of
 Be-ness which has no relation to the plane on which our Universe
 is accomplishing its cycle.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>"The curse is pronounced" does
 not mean, in this instance, that any personal Being, god, or superior
 Spirit, pronounced it, but simply that the cause which could but
 create bad results had been generated, and that the effects of
 a Karmic cause could lead the "Beings" that counteracted
 the laws of Nature, and thus impeded her legitimate progress,
 only to bad incarnations, hence to suffering.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) "There were many wars" refers to several
 struggles of adjustment, spiritual, cosmical, and astronomical,
 but chiefly to the mystery of the evolution of man as he is now.
 Powers -- pure Essences -- "that were told to create"
 is a sentence that relates to a mystery explained, as already
 said, elsewhere. It is not only one of the most hidden secrets
 of Nature -- that of generation, over whose solution the Embryologists
 have vainly put their heads together -- but likewise a divine
 function that involves that other religious, or rather dogmatic,
 mystery, the "Fall" of the Angels, as it is called.
 Satan and his rebellious host would thus prove, when the meaning
 of the allegory is explained, to have refused to create physical
 man, only to become the direct Saviours and the Creators of "<em>divine
 </em>Man." The symbolical teaching is more than mystical
 and religious, it is purely scientific, as will be seen later
 on. For, instead of remaining a mere blind, functioning medium,
 impelled and guided by fathomless LAW, the "rebellious"
 Angel claimed and enforced his right of independent judgment and
 will, his</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 194 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 right of free-agency and responsibility, since man and angel are
 alike under Karmic Law.*
 </p><p>
 "And there was war in Heaven. . . . Michael and his angels
 fought against the Dragon; and the Dragon fought and his angels,
 and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in Heaven.
 And the Dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil
 and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world."
 </p><p>
 The Kabalistic version of the same story is given in the Codex
 Nazareus, the scripture of the Nazarenes, the real mystic Christians
 of John the Baptist and the Initiates of Christos. Bahak-Zivo,
 the "Father of the Genii," is ordered to construct creatures
 (to create). But, as he is "ignorant of Orcus," he fails
 to do so, and calls in Fetahil, a still purer spirit, to his aid,
 who fails still worse. This is a repetition of the failure of
 the "Fathers," the lords of light who fail one after
 the other. (Book II, Sloka 17.)
 </p><p>
 We will now quote from our earlier Volumes: --
 </p><p>
 "Then steps on the stage of creation the spirit** (of the
 Earth so-called, or the Soul, Psyche, which St. James calls 'devilish')
 the lower portion the <em>Anima Mundi </em>or Astral Light. (See
 the close of this Sloka). With the Nazarenes and the Gnostics
 this Spirit was
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Explaining Kabalistic views, the author of the "<em>New
 Aspects of Life</em>"<em> </em>says of the Fallen Angels
 that, "According to the symbolical teaching, Spirit, from
 being simply a functionary agent of God, became volitional in
 its developed and developing action; and, substituting its own
 will for the Divine desire in its regard, so fell. Hence the Kingdom
 and reign of Spirits and spiritual action, which flow from and
 are the product of Spirit-volition, are outside, and contrasted
 with, and in contradiction to the Kingdom of Souls and Divine
 action." So far, so good; but what does the Author mean by
 saying, "When man was created, he was human in constitution,
 with human affections, human hopes and aspirations. From this
 state he fell -- into the brute and savage"? This is diametrically
 opposite to our Eastern teaching, and even to the Kabalistic notion
 so far as we understand it, and to the Bible itself. This looks
 like Corporealism and Substantialism colouring positive philosophy,
 though it is rather hard to feel quite sure of the Author's meaning
 (see p. 235). A FALL, however, "from the natural into the
 supernatural and the animal" -- supernatural meaning the
 purely spiritual in this case -- means what we suggest.
 </p><p>
 ** On the authority of Irenaeus, of Justin Martyr and the "Codex"
 itself, Dunlap shows that the Nazarenes regarded "Spirit"
 as a female and <em>Evil Power </em>in its connection with our
 Earth. (Dunlap: "Sod," the Son of the Man, p. 52).</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 195 THE CODEX REPEATS THE ALLEGORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>feminine. </em>Thus the spirit of the Earth perceiving that
 for Fetahil,* the <em>newest man </em>(the latest), the splendour
 was 'changed,' and that for splendour existed 'decrease and damage,'
 she awakes Karabtanos,** 'who was frantic and <em>without sense
 and judgment</em>,'<em> </em>and says to him: -- 'Arise, see,
 the splendour (light) of the <em>newest </em>man (Fetahil) has
 failed (to produce or create men), the decrease of this splendour
 is visible. Rise up, come with thy MOTHER (the Spiritus) and free
 thee from limits by which thou art held, and those more ample
 than the whole world.' After which follows the union of the frantic
 and blind matter, guided by the insinuations of the spirit (not
 the <em>Divine </em>breath but the <em>Astral </em>spirit, which
 by its double essence is already tainted with matter); and the
 offer of the MOTHER being accepted, the Spiritus conceives "Seven
 Figures," and the seven <em>stellars </em>(planets) which
 represent also the <em>seven capital sins</em>,<em> </em>the<em>
 </em>progeny of an astral soul separated from its divine source
 (spirit) and <em>matter</em>,<em> </em>the blind demon of concupiscence.
 Seeing this, Fetahil extends his hand towards the abyss of matter,
 and says: -- 'Let the Earth exist, just as the abode of the powers
 has existed.' Dipping his hand in the chaos, which he condenses,
 he creates our planet.***"
 </p><p>
 "Then the Codex proceeds to tell how Bahak-Zivo was separated
 from the Spiritus, and the Genii or angels from the rebels.****
 Then Mano***** (the greatest), who dwells with the greatest FERHO,

 * Fetahil is identical with the host of the Pitris who "created
 Man" as only a "shell." He was, with the Nazarenes,
 the king of light, and the creator; but in this instance he is
 the unlucky Prometheus, who fails to get hold of the Living Fire
 necessary for the formation of the divine Soul, as he is ignorant
 of the secret name, the ineffable or incommunicable name of the
 Kabalists.

 say, 'Let us call for the world, and let us call the 'powers'
 into existence." The Genii are the <em>Principes</em>,<em>
 </em>the "Sons of Light," but thou art the "<em>Messenger

 </p><p>
 And in order to counteract the influence of the seven "badly
 disposed" principles, the progeny of <em>Spiritus</em>,<em>
 </em>CABAR-ZIO, the mighty Lord of Splendor, produces <em>seven
 other lives </em>(the cardinal virtues) who shine in their own
 form and light "from on high"*** and thus re-establish
 the balance between good and evil, light and darkness.
 </p><p>
 Here one finds a repetition of the early <em>allegorical</em>,<em>
 </em>dual systems, as the Zoroastrian, and detects a germ of the
 dogmatic and dualistic religions of the future, a germ which has
 grown into such a luxuriant tree in ecclesiastical Christianity.
 It is already the outline of the two "Supremes" -- God
 and Satan. But in the Stanzas no such idea exists.
 </p><p>
 Most of the Western Christian Kabalists -- pre-eminently Eliphas
 Levi -- in their desire to reconcile the Occult Sciences with
 Church dogmas, did their best to make of the "Astral Light"
 only and preeminently the <em>Pleroma </em>of early Church Fathers,
 the abode of the Hosts of the Fallen Angels, of the "Archons"
 and "Powers." But the Astral Light, while only the lower
 aspect of the Absolute, is yet dual. It is the <em>Anima Mundi</em>,<em>
 </em>and ought never to be viewed otherwise, except for Kabalistic
 purposes. The difference which exists between its "light"
 and its "Living Fire" ought to be ever present in the
 mind of the Seer and the "Psychic." The higher aspect,
 without which only creatures of matter from that Astral Light
 can be produced, is this Living Fire, and it is the Seventh Principle.
 It is said in "Isis Unveiled," in a complete description
 of it: --
 </p><p>
 "The Astral Light or <em>Anima Mundi </em>is dual and bisexual.
 The (ideal) male part of it is purely divine and spiritual, it
 is the <em>Wisdom</em>,<em> </em>it is Spirit or Purusha; while
 the female portion (the Spiritus of the Nazarenes) is tainted,
 in one sense, with matter, <em>is </em>indeed matter, and therefore
 is evil already. It is the life-principle of every living creature,
 and furnishes the astral soul, the fluidic <em>perisprit</em>,<em>
 </em>to men, animals, fowls of the air, and everything living.
 Animals have only the latent germ of the highest immortal soul
 in them. . . . . This latter will develop

 only after a series of countless evolutions; the doctrine of which
 evolution is contained in the Kabalistic axiom: 'A stone becomes
 a plant; a plant, a beast; a beast, a man; a man, a spirit; and
 the spirit, a god.'" (Vol. I., p. 301, note.)
 </p><p>
 The seven principles of the Eastern Initiates had not been explained
 when "Isis" was written, but only the three <em>Kabalistic
 Faces </em>of the semi-exoteric Kabala.* But these contain the
 description of the mystic natures of the first group of Dhyan
 Chohans in the <em>regimen ignis</em>,<em> </em>the region and
 "rule (or government) of fire," which group is divided
 into three classes, synthesized by the first, which makes <em>four
 </em>or the "Tetraktis." (<em>See Comments on Stanza
 VII. Book I.</em>)<em> </em>If one studies the Comments attentively
 he will find the same progression in the angelic natures, viz.,
 from the <em>passive </em>down to the <em>active</em>,<em> </em>the
 last of these Beings being as near to the <em>Ahamkara </em>element
 (the region or plane wherein <em>Egoship </em>or<em> </em>the
 feeling of <em>I-am-ness </em>is beginning to be defined) as the
 first ones are near to the undifferentiated essence. The former
 are Arupa, incorporeal; the latter, Rupa, corporeal.
 </p><p>
 In Volume II. of <em>Isis </em>(<em>p. </em>183<em> et seq.</em>)<em>
 </em>the philosophical systems of the Gnostics and the primitive
 Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, are fully
 considered. They show the views held in those days -- outside
 the circle of Mosaic Jews -- about Jehovah. He was identified
 by all the Gnostics with the evil, rather than with the good principle.
 For them, he was <em>Ilda-Baoth</em>,<em> </em>"the son of
 Darkness," whose mother, Sophia Achamoth, was the daughter
 of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom (the female Holy Ghost of the early
 Christians) -- Akasa;** while Sophia Achamoth personified the
 lower Astral Light or <em>Ether. </em>Ilda-Baoth,*** or Jehovah,
 is simply one of the Elohim, the seven

 </p><p>
 ** The astral light stands in the same relation to Akasa and <em>Anima
 Mundi</em>,<em> </em>as Satan stands to the Deity. They are one
 and the same thing <em>seen from two aspects: </em>the<em> </em>spiritual
 and the psychic -- the super-ethereal or connecting link between
 matter and pure spirit, and the physical. See for the difference
 between <em>nous</em>,<em> </em>the higher divine wisdom, and
 <em>psyche</em>,<em> </em>the lower and terrestrial (<em>St. James
 </em>iii. v. 15-17). <em>Vide</em> "Demon est Deus inversus,"

 creative Spirits, and one of the lower Sephiroth. He produces
 from himself seven other Gods, "Stellar Spirits" (or
 the lunar ancestors*), for they are all the same.** They are all
 <em>in his own image </em>(the "Spirits of the Face"),
 and the reflections one of the other, and have become darker and
 more material as they successively receded from their originator.
 They also inhabit seven regions disposed like a ladder, as its
 rungs slope up and down the scale of spirit and matter.*** With
 Pagans and Christians, with Hindus and Chaldeans, with the Greek
 as with the Roman Catholics -- with a slight variation of the
 texts in their interpretations -- they all were the Genii of the
 seven planets, as of the seven planetary spheres of our septenary
 chain, of which Earth is the lowest. (See<em> Isis</em>,<em> Vol.
 II. p. </em>186.) This connects the "Stellar" and "Lunar"
 Spirits with the higher planetary Angels and the <em>Saptarishis
 </em>(the seven Rishis of the Stars) of the Hindus -- as subordinate
 Angels (Messengers) to these "Rishis," the emanations,
 on the descending scale, of the former. Such, in the opinion of
 the philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now
 worshipped by the Christians! The "Fallen Angels" and
 the legend of the "War in Heaven" is thus purely pagan
 in its origin and comes from India <em>via</em> Persia and Chaldea.
 The only reference to it in the Christian canon is found in Revelations
 xii., as quoted a few pages back.
 </p><p>
 Thus "<strong>S</strong>ATAN," once he ceases to be
 viewed in the superstitious, dogmatic, unphilosophical spirit
 of the Churches, grows into the grandiose image of one who made
 of <em>terrestrial a divine </em>MAN; who gave him, throughout
 the long cycle of Maha-kalpa the law of the Spirit of Life, and
 made him free from the Sin of Ignorance, hence of death. (See
 the Section <em>On Satan </em>in Part II. Vol. II.)

 (<em>a</em>) Here, having finished for the time being with our
 side-issues -- which, however they may break the flow of the narrative,
 are necessary for the elucidation of the whole scheme -- the reader
 must return once more to Cosmogony. The phrase "Older wheels"
 refers to the worlds or Globes of our chain as they were during
 the "previous Rounds." The present Stanza, when explained
 esoterically, is found embodied entirely in the Kabalistic works.
 Therein will be found the very history of the evolution of those
 countless Globes which evolve after a periodical Pralaya, rebuilt
 from old material into new forms. The previous Globes disintegrate
 and reappear transformed and perfected for a new phase of life.
 In the Kabala, worlds are compared to sparks which fly from under
 the hammer of the great Architect -- LAW, the law which rules
 all the smaller Creators.
 </p><p>
 The following comparative diagram shows the identity between the
 two systems, the Kabalistic and the Eastern. The three upper are
 the three higher planes of consciousness, revealed and explained
 in both schools only to the Initiates, the lower ones represent
 the four lower planes -- the lowest being our plane, or the visible
 Universe.
 </p><p>
 These seven <em>planes </em>correspond to the seven <em>states
 </em>of consciousness in man. It remains with him to attune the
 three higher states in himself to the three higher planes in Kosmos.
 But before he can attempt to attune, he must awaken the three
 "seats" to life and activity. And how many are capable
 of bringing themselves to even a superficial comprehension of

 in the sense that the Platonists gave to it, <em>i.e.</em>,<em>
 </em>the world as it existed <em>in the Mind </em>of the Deity;
 but in that of a world made as a first model, to be followed and
 improved upon by the worlds which succeed it physically -- though
 deteriorating in purity.

 Here "Seed" stands for "the World-germ," viewed
 by Science as material particles in a highly attenuated condition,

 differentiation.* In theogony, every Seed is an ethereal organism,
 from which evolves later on a celestial being, a God.
 </p><p>
 In the "beginning," that which is called in mystic phraseology
 "Cosmic <em>Desire</em>"<em> </em>evolves into absolute
 Light. Now light without any shadow would be absolute light --
 in other words, absolute darkness -- as physical science seeks
 to prove. That shadow appears under the form of primordial matter,
 allegorized -- if one likes -- in the shape of the Spirit of Creative
 Fire or Heat. If, rejecting the poetical form and allegory, science
 chooses to see in this the primordial Fire-Mist, it is welcome
 to do so. Whether one way or the other, whether Fohat or the famous
 FORCE of Science, nameless, and as difficult of definition as
 our Fohat himself, that Something "caused the Universe to
 move with circular motion," as Plato has it; or, as the Occult
 teaching expresses it:
 </p><p>
 "<em>The Central Sun causes Fohat to collect primordial dust
 in the form of balls</em>,<em> to impel them to move in converging
 lines and finally to approach each other and aggregate.</em>"<em>
 </em>(<em>Book of Dzyan</em>) . . . . . "<em>Being scattered
 in Space</em>,<em> without order or system</em>,<em> the world-germs
 come into frequent collision until their final aggregation</em>,<em>
 after which they become wanderers </em>(<em>Comets</em>)<em>.
 Then the battles and struggles begin. The older </em>(<em>bodies</em>)<em>
 attract the younger</em>,<em> while others repel them. Many perish</em>,<em>
 devoured by their stronger companions. Those that escape become
 worlds.</em>"<em>**</em>

 * To see and appreciate the difference -- the immense gulf that
 separates terrestrial matter from the finer grades of supersensuous
 matter -- every astronomer, every chemist and <em>physicist </em>ought
 to be a <em>psychometer</em>,<em> </em>to say the least; he ought
 to be able to sense for himself that difference in which he now
 refuses to believe. Mrs. Elizabeth Denton, one of the most learned,
 and also one of the most materialistic and sceptical women of
 her age -- the wife of Professor Denton, the well-known American
 geologist and the author of "The Soul of Things" --
 was, nevertheless, one of the most wonderful psychometers some
 years ago. This is what she described in one of her experiments;
 with a particle of a meteorite placed on her forehead, in an envelope,
 the lady, not being aware of what it contained, said:
 </p><p>
 "What a difference between that which we recognise as matter
 here and that which seems like matter there! In the one, the <em>elements
 are so coarse and so angular</em>,<em> </em>I wonder that we can
 endure it all, much more that we can desire to continue our present
 relations to it; in the other, all the elements are so refined,
 they are so free from those great, rough angularities, which characterize
 the elements here, that I can but regard that as by so much the
 more than this, the real existence." (<em>Vol. III. p.</em>
 345-6.)

 ** When carefully analysed and reflected upon, this will be found
 as scientific as Science could make it, even at our late period.

 <p>
 We have been assured that there exist several modern works of
 speculative fancy upon such struggles for life in sidereal heaven,
 especially in the German language. We rejoice to hear it, for
 ours is an Occult teaching lost in the darkness of archaic ages.
 We have treated of it fully in "<em>Isis Unveiled</em>,"<em>
 </em>and the idea of Darwinian-like evolution, of struggle for
 life and supremacy, and of the "survival of the fittest"
 among the Hosts above as the Hosts below, runs throughout both
 the volumes of our earlier work, written in 1876 (<em>See Index
 in </em>"<em>Isis</em> <em>Unveiled</em>"<em> at the
 words </em>"<em>Evolution</em>" --<em> </em>"<em>Darwin</em>"
 --<em> </em>"<em>Kapila</em>"<em> </em>--<em> </em>"<em>Battle
 of</em> <em>Life</em>,"<em> etc. etc.</em>) But the idea
 was not ours, it is that of antiquity.
 </p><p>
 Even the Puranic writers have ingeniously interwoven allegory
 with Cosmic facts and human events. Any symbologist may discern
 the astro-cosmical allusion even though he be unable to grasp
 the whole meaning. The great "Wars in Heaven," in the
 Puranas; the wars of the Titans, in Hesiod and other classical
 writers; the "struggles," also in the Egyptian legend
 between Osiris and Typhon, and even those in the Scandinavian
 legends, all refer to the same subject. Northern Mythology refers
 to it as the battle of the Flames, the sons of Muspel who fought
 on the field of Wigred. All these relate to Heaven and Earth,
 and have a double and often even a triple meaning, and esoteric
 application to things above as to things below. They relate severally
 to astronomical, theogonical and human struggles; to the adjustment
 of orbs, and the supremacy among nations and tribes. The "Struggle
 for Existence" and the "Survival of the Fittest"
 reigned supreme from the moment that Kosmos manifested into being,
 and could hardly escape the observant eye of the ancient Sages.
 Hence the incessant fights of Indra, the god of the Firmament,
 with the Asuras -- degraded from high gods into Cosmic demons;
 and with Vritri or Ah-hi; the battles fought between stars and
 constellations, between Moon and planets -- later on incarnated
 as kings and mortals. Hence also the War in Heaven of Michael
 and his Host against the Dragon (Jupiter and Lucifer-Venus), when
 a third of the stars of the rebellious host was hurled down into
 Space, and "its place was found no more in Heaven."
 As said long ago -- "This is the basic and fundamental stone
 of the secret cycles. It shows that the Brahmins and Tanaim .
 . . speculated on the creation and development of the world quite
 in a Darwinian way, both anticipating him and his school in the
 natural selection of species, the survival of the fittest,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 203 THE BIRTH OF THE WORLDS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 and transformation. . . . There were old worlds that perished
 conquered by the new," etc., etc. ("<em>Isis Unveiled</em>,"<em>
 Vol. II.</em>,<em> p. </em>260.) The assertion that all the worlds
 (Stars, planets, etc.) -- as soon as a nucleus of primordial substance
 in the <em>laya</em> (undifferentiated) state is informed by the
 freed principles, of a just <em>deceased </em>sidereal body --
 become first comets, and then Suns to cool down to inhabitable
 worlds, is a teaching as old as the Rishis.
 </p><p>
 Thus the Secret Books distinctly teach, as we see, an astronomy
 that would not be rejected even by modern speculation could the
 latter thoroughly understand its teachings.
 </p><p>
 For, archaic astronomy, and the ancient, physical and mathematical
 sciences, expressed views identical with those of modern science,
 and many of far more momentous import. A "struggle for life"
 as a "survival of the fittest" in the worlds above,
 as on our planet here below, are distinctly taught. This teaching,
 however, although it would not be "entirely rejected"
 by Science, is sure to be repudiated as an integral whole. For
 it avers that there are only seven Self-born primordial "gods"
 emanated from the trinitarian ONE. In other words, it means that
 all the worlds or sidereal bodies (always on strict analogy) are
 formed one from the other, after the primordial manifestation
 at the beginning of the "Great Age" is accomplished.
 The birth of the celestial bodies in Space is compared to a crowd
 or multitude of "pilgrims" at the festival of the "Fires."
 Seven ascetics appear on the threshold of the temple with seven
 lighted sticks of incense. At the light of these the first row
 of pilgrims light their incense sticks. After which every ascetic
 begins whirling his stick around his head in space, and furnishes
 the rest with fire. Thus with the heavenly bodies. A laya-centre
 is lighted and awakened into life by the fires of another "pilgrim,"
 after which the new "centre" rushes into space and becomes
 a comet. It is only after losing its velocity, and hence its fiery
 tail, that the "Fiery Dragon" settles down into quiet
 and steady life as a regular respectable citizen of the sidereal
 family. Therefore it is said: --
 </p><p>
 Born in the unfathomable depths of Space, out of the homogeneous
 Element called the World-Soul, every nucleus of Cosmic matter,
 suddenly launched into being, begins life under the most hostile
 circumstances. Through a series of countless ages, it has to conquer
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 204 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 for itself a place in the infinitudes. It circles round and round
 between denser and already fixed bodies, moving by jerks, and
 pulling towards some given point or centre that attracts it, trying
 to avoid, like a ship drawn into a channel dotted with reefs and
 sunken rocks, other bodies that draw and repel it in turn; many
 perish, their mass disintegrating through stronger masses, and,
 when born within a system, chiefly within the insatiable stomachs
 of various Suns. (<em>See Comm. to Stanza IV</em>)<em>. </em>Those
 which move slower and are propelled into an elliptic course are
 doomed to annihilation sooner or later. Others moving in parabolic
 curves generally escape destruction, owing to their velocity.
 </p><p>
 Some very critical readers will perhaps imagine that this teaching,
 as to the cometary stage passed through by all heavenly bodies,
 is in contradiction with the statements just made as to the moon
 being the mother of the earth. They will perhaps fancy that intuition
 is needed to harmonize the two. But no intuition is in truth required.
 What does Science know of Comets, their genesis, growth, and ultimate
 behaviour? Nothing -- absolutely nothing! And what is there so
 impossible that a laya centre -- a lump of cosmic protoplasm,
 homogeneous and latent, when suddenly animated or fired up --
 should rush from its bed in Space and whirl throughout the abysmal
 depths in order to strengthen its homogeneous organism by an accumulation
 and addition of differentiated elements? And why should not such
 a comet settle in life, live, and become an inhabited globe!
 </p><p>
 "The abodes of Fohat are many," it is said. "He
 places his four fiery (electro-positive) Sons in the "Four
 circles"; these <em>Circles </em>are the Equator, the Ecliptic,
 and the two parallels of declination, or the tropics -- to preside
 over the <em>climates </em>of which are placed the Four mystical
 Entities. Then again: "Other seven (sons) are commissioned
 to preside over the seven hot, and seven cold <em>lokas </em>(the
 hells of the orthodox Brahmins) at the two ends of the Egg of
 Matter (our Earth and its poles). The seven <em>lokas </em>are
 also called the "Rings," elsewhere, and the "Circles."
 The ancients made the polar circles <em>seven </em>instead of
 two, as Europeans do; for Mount Meru, which is the North Pole,
 is said to have seven gold and seven silver steps leading to it.
 </p><p>
 The strange statement made in one of the Stanzas: "The Songs
 of Fohat and his Sons were <em>radiant </em>as the noon-tide Sun
 and the Moon combined;" and that the four Sons on the <em>middle
 </em>four-fold</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 205 SEEING SOUND, HEARING COLOURS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Circle "<em>saw </em>their father's songs and <em>heard </em>his
 Solar-selenic radiance;" is explained in the Commentary in
 these words: "The agitation of <em>the Fohatic </em>Forces
 at the two cold ends (North and South Poles) of the Earth which
 resulted in a multicoloured radiance at night, have in them several
 of the properties of Akasa (Ether) <em>colour </em>and sound as
 well." . . . . . . "Sound is the characteristic of Akasa
 (Ether): it generates air, the property of which is Touch; which
 (by friction) becomes productive of Colour and Light." .
 . . . . . (Vishnu Purana.)
 </p><p>
 Perhaps the above will be regarded as archaic nonsense, but it
 will be better comprehended, if the reader remembers the Aurora
 Borealis and Australis, both of which take place at the very centres
 of terrestrial electric and magnetic forces. The two poles are
 said to be the store-houses, the receptacles and liberators, at
 the same time, of Cosmic and terrestrial Vitality (Electricity);
 from the surplus of which the Earth, had it not been for these
 two natural "safety-valves," would have been rent to
 pieces long ago. At the same time it is now a theory that has
 lately become an axiom, that the phenomenon of polar lights is
 accompanied by, and productive of, strong sounds, like whistling,
 hissing, and cracking. (But see Professor Trumholdt's works on
 the Aurora Borealis, and his correspondence regarding this moot
 question.)

 To calculate its age, however, as the pupil is asked to do in
 the Stanza, is rather difficult, since we are not given the figures
 of the Great Kalpa, and are not allowed to publish those of our
 small Yugas, except as to the approximate duration of these. "The
 older wheels rotated for one Eternity and one half of an Eternity,"
 it says. We know that by "Eternity" the seventh part
 of 311,040,000,000,000 years, or an age of Brahma is meant. But
 what of that? We also know that, to begin with, if we take for
 our basis the above figures, we have first of all to eliminate
 from the 100 years of Brahma (or 311,040,000,000,000 years) two
 <em>years </em>taken up by the Sandhyas (twilights), which leaves
 98, as we have to bring it to the mystical combination 14 x 7.
 But <i>we </i>have no knowledge at what time precisely the evolution
 and formation of our little earth began. Therefore it is impossible
 to calculate its age, unless the time of its birth is given --
 which the TEACHERS refuse to do, so far. At the close of this
 Book and in Book II., however, some chronological hints will be
 given. We must remember, moreover, that the law of Analogy holds
 good for the worlds, as it does for man; and that as "The
 ONE (Deity) becomes Two (Deva or Angel) and <em>Two</em> becomes<em>
 Three </em>(or man)," etc., etc., so we are taught that the
 <em>Curds </em>(world-stuff) become wanderers, (Comets), these
 become stars, and the stars (the centres of vortices) <em>our
 sun and planets</em> -- to put it briefly.*
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) There are four grades of initiation mentioned in
 exoteric works, which are known respectively in Sanskrit as "Srotapanna,"
 "Sagardagan," "Anagamin," and "Arhan"
 -- the four paths to Nirvana, in this, our fourth Round, bearing
 the same appellations. The Arhan, though he can see the Past,
 the Present, and the Future, is not yet the highest Initiate;
 for the Adept himself, the <em>initiated </em>candidate, becomes
 chela (pupil) to a higher Initiate. Three further higher grades
 have to be conquered by the Arhan who would reach the apex of
 the ladder of Arhatship. There are those who have reached it even
 in this fifth race of ours, but the faculties necessary for the
 attainment of these higher

 grades will be fully developed in the average ascetic only at
 the end of this Root-Race, and in the Sixth and Seventh. Thus
 there will always be Initiates and the Profane till the end of
 this minor Manvantara, the present <em>life-cycle. </em>The<em>
 Arhats </em>of the "fire-mist" of the 7th rung are but
 one remove from the Root-Base of their Hierarchy -- the highest
 on Earth, and our Terrestrial chain. This "Root-Base"
 has a name which can only be translated by several compound words
 into English" -- "the ever-living-human-Banyan."
 This "Wondrous Being" descended from a "high region,"
 they say, in the early part of the Third Age, before the separation
 of the sexes of the Third Race.
 </p><p>
 This Third Race is sometimes called collectively "the Sons
 of <em>Passive Yoga</em>,"<em> i.e.</em>, it was produced
 unconsciously by the second Race, which, as it was intellectually
 inactive, is supposed to have been constantly plunged in a kind
 of blank or abstract contemplation, as required by the conditions
 of the Yoga state. In the first or earlier portion of the existence
 of this third race, while it was yet in its state of purity, the
 "Sons of Wisdom," who, as will be seen, incarnated in
 this Third Race, produced by <em>Kriyasakti </em>a progeny called
 the "Sons of Ad" or "of the Fire-Mist," the
 "Sons of Will and Yoga," etc. They were a conscious
 production, as a portion of the race was already animated with
 the divine spark of spiritual, superior intelligence. It was not
 a Race, this progeny. It was at first a wondrous Being, called
 the "Initiator," and after him a group of semi-divine
 and semi-human beings. "<em>Set apart</em>"<em> </em>in
 Archaic <em>genesis </em>for certain purposes, they are those
 in whom are said to have incarnated the highest Dhyanis, "Munis
 and Rishis from previous Manvantaras" -- <em>to</em> <em>form
 the nursery for future human adepts</em>,<em> </em>on this earth
 and during the present cycle. These "Sons of Will and Yoga"
 born, so to speak, in an immaculate way, remained, it is explained,
 entirely apart from the rest of mankind.
 </p><p>
 The "<strong>B</strong>EING" just referred to, which
 has to remain nameless, is the <em>Tree </em>from which, in subsequent
 ages, all the great <em>historically </em>known Sages and Hierophants,
 such as the Rishi Kapila, Hermes, Enoch, Orpheus, etc., etc.,
 have branched off. As objective <em>man</em>,<em> </em>he is the
 mysterious (to the profane -- the ever invisible) yet ever present
 Personage about whom legends are rife in the East, especially
 among the Occultists and the students of the Sacred Science. It
 is he who changes form, yet remains ever the same. And it is he
 again who holds spiritual sway over the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 208 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>initiated </em>Adepts throughout the whole world. He is, as
 said, the "Nameless One" who has so many names, and
 yet whose names and whose very nature are unknown. He is <i>the
 </i>"Initiator," called the "GREAT SACRIFICE."
 For, sitting at the threshold of LIGHT, he looks into it from
 within the circle of Darkness, which he will not cross; nor will
 he quit his post till the last day of this life-cycle. Why does
 the solitary Watcher remain at his self-chosen post? Why does
 he sit by the fountain of primeval Wisdom, of which he drinks
 no longer, as he has naught to learn which he does not know --
 aye, neither on this Earth, nor in its heaven? Because the lonely,
 sore-footed pilgrims on their way back to their <em>home </em>are
 never sure to the last moment of not losing their way in this
 limitless desert of illusion and matter called Earth-Life. Because
 he would fain show the way to that region of freedom and light,
 from which he is a voluntary exile himself, to every prisoner
 who has succeeded in liberating himself from the bonds of flesh
 and illusion. Because, in short, he has sacrificed himself for
 the sake of mankind, though but a few Elect may profit by the
 GREAT SACRIFICE.
 </p><p>
 It is under the direct, silent guidance of this <strong>M</strong>AHA
 -- (great) -- <strong>G</strong>URU that all the other less divine
 Teachers and instructors of mankind became, from the first awakening
 of human consciousness, the guides of early Humanity. It is through
 these "Sons of God" that infant humanity got its first
 notions of all the arts and sciences, as well as of spiritual
 knowledge; and it is they who have laid the first foundation-stone
 of those ancient civilizations that puzzle so sorely our modern
 generation of students and scholars.*

 * Let those who doubt this statement explain the mystery of the
 extraordinary knowledge possessed by the ancients -- alleged to
 have developed from lower and animal-like savages, the <em>cave-men
 </em>of the Palaeolithic age -- on any other equally reasonable
 grounds. Let them turn to such works as those of Vitruvius Pollio
 of the Augustan age, on architecture, for instance, in which all
 the rules of proportion are those <em>taught anciently at initiations</em>,<em>
 </em>if he would acquaint himself with the truly divine art, and
 understand the <em>deep esoteric significance hidden in every
 rule and law of proportion. </em>No man descended from a Palaeolithic
 cave-dweller could ever evolve such a science unaided, even in
 millenniums of thought and intellectual evolution. It is the pupils
 of those incarnated Rishis and Devas of the third Root Race, who
 handed their knowledge from one generation to another, to Egypt
 and Greece with its now lost <em>canon of proportion; </em>as
 it is the Disciples of the Initiates of the 4th, the Atlanteans,
 who handed it over to their <em>Cyclopes</em>,<em> </em>the "Sons
 of Cycles" or of the "Infinite," from whom the
 name passed to the still later generations of Gnostic priests.
 "It is owing to the divine perfection [[Footnote continued

 <p>
 Although these matters were barely hinted at in "<em>Isis
 Unveiled</em>," it<em> </em>will be well to remind the reader
 of what was said in Vol. I., pp. 587 to 593, concerning a certain
 Sacred Island in Central Asia, and to refer him for further details
 to the chapter in Book II. on "The Sons of God and the Sacred
 Island." A few more explanations, however, though thrown
 out in a fragmentary form, may help the student to obtain a glimpse
 into the present mystery.

 To state at least one detail concerning these mysterious "Sons
 of God" in plain words. It is from them, these Brahmaputras,
 that the high Dwijas, the initiated Brahmins of old justly claimed
 descent, while the modern Brahmin would have the lowest castes
 believe literally that they issued direct from the mouth of Brahma.
 This is the esoteric teaching, which adds moreover that, although
 these descendants (spiritually of course) from the "sons
 of Will and Yoga," became in time divided into opposite sexes,
 as their "<em>Kriyasakti</em>"<em> </em>progenitors
 did themselves, later on; yet even their degenerate descendants
 have down to the present day retained a veneration and respect
 for the creative

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] of those architectural
 proportions that the Ancients could build those wonders of all
 the subsequent ages, their Fanes, Pyramids, Cave-Temples, Cromlechs,
 Cairns, Altars, proving they had the powers of machinery and a
 knowledge of mechanics to which modern skill is like a child's
 play, and which that <em>skill </em>refers to itself as the 'works
 of hundred-handed giants.'" (<em>See </em>"<em>Book
 of God</em>,"<em> Kenealy.</em>)<em> </em>Modern architects
 may not altogether have neglected those rules, but they have superadded
 enough empirical innovations to destroy those just proportions.
 It is Vitruvius who gave to posterity the rules of construction
 of the Grecian temples erected to the immortal gods; and the ten
 books of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio on Architecture, of one, in short,
 <em>who was an initiate</em>,<em> </em>can only be studied esoterically.
 The Druidical circles, the Dolmen, the Temples of India, Egypt
 and Greece, the Towers and the 127 towns in Europe which were
 found "Cyclopean in origin" by the French Institute,
 are all the work of initiated Priest-Architects, the descendants
 of those primarily taught by the "Sons of God," justly
 called "The Builders." This is what appreciative posterity
 says of those descendants. "They used neither mortar nor
 cement, nor steel nor iron to cut the stones with; and yet they
 were so artfully wrought that in many places the joints are not
 seen, though many of the stones, as in Peru, are 18 ft. thick,
 and in the walls of the fortress of Cuzco there are stones of
 a still greater size." (<em>Acosta</em>,<em> </em>vi., 14.)
 "Again, the walls of Syene, built 5,400 years ago, when that
 spot was exactly under the tropic, which it has now ceased to
 be, were so constructed that at noon, at the precise moment of
 the solar solstice, the entire disc of the Sun was seen reflected
 on their surface -- a work which the united skill of all the astronomers
 of Europe would not now be able to effect." -- (Kenealy,
 "<em>Book of God.</em>") </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 210 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 function, and still regard it in the light of a religious ceremony,
 whereas the more civilized nations consider it as a mere animal
 function. Compare the western views and practice in these matters
 with the Institutions of Manu in regard to the laws of Grihasta
 and married life. The true Brahmin is thus indeed "he whose
 seven forefathers have drunk the juice of the moon-plant (Soma),"
 and who is a "Trisuparna," for he has understood the
 secret of the Vedas.
 </p><p>
 And, to this day, such Brahmins know that, during its early beginnings,
 psychic and physical intellect being dormant and consciousness
 still undeveloped, the spiritual conceptions of that race were
 quite unconnected with its physical surroundings. That <em>divine
 </em>man dwelt in his animal -- though externally human -- form;
 and, if there was instinct in him, no self-consciousness came
 to enlighten the darkness of the latent fifth principle. When,
 moved by the law of Evolution, the Lords of Wisdom infused into
 him the spark of consciousness, the first feeling it awoke to
 life and activity was a sense of solidarity, of one-ness with
 his spiritual creators. As the child's first feeling is for its
 mother and nurse, so the first aspirations of the awakening consciousness
 in primitive man were for those whose element he felt within himself,
 and who yet were outside, and independent of him. <strong>D</strong>EVOTION
 arose out of that feeling, and became the first and foremost motor
 in his nature; for it is the only one which is natural in our
 heart, which is innate in us, and which we find alike in human
 babe and the young of the animal. This feeling of irrepressible,
 instinctive aspiration in primitive man is beautifully, and one
 may say intuitionally, described by Carlyle. "The great antique
 heart," he exclaims, "how like a child's in its simplicity,
 like a man's in its earnest solemnity and depth! heaven lies over
 him wheresoever he goes or stands on the earth; making all the
 earth a mystic temple to him, the earth's business all a kind
 of worship. Glimpses of bright creatures flash in the common sunlight;
 angels yet hover, doing God's messages among men . . . . . Wonder,
 miracle, encompass the man; he lives in an element of miracle*
 . . . . A great law of duty, high as these two infinitudes (heaven
 and hell), dwarfing all else, annihilating all else -- it was
 a reality, and it is one: the garment

 only of it is dead; the essence of it lives through all times
 and all eternity!"
 </p><p>
 It lives undeniably, and has settled in all its ineradicable strength
 and power in the Asiatic Aryan heart from the Third Race direct
 through its first "mind-born" sons, -- the fruits of
 <em>Kriyasakti. </em>As time rolled on the holy caste of Initiates
 produced but rarely, and from age to age, such perfect creatures:
 beings apart, inwardly, though the same as those who produced
 them, outwardly.
 </p><p>
 While in the infancy of the third primitive race: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "A creature of a more exalted kind<br>
 Was wanting yet, and therefore was designed;<br>
 Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast<br>
 For empire formed and fit to rule the rest. . . . ."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 It was called into being, a ready and perfect vehicle for the
 incarnating denizens of higher spheres, who took forthwith their
 abodes in these forms born of <em>Spiritual </em>WILL and the
 natural divine power in man. It was a child of pure Spirit, mentally
 unalloyed with any tincture of earthly element. Its physical frame
 alone was of time and of life, as it drew its intelligence direct
 from above. It was the living tree of divine wisdom; and may therefore
 be likened to the Mundane Tree of the Norse Legend, which cannot
 wither and die until the last battle of life shall be fought,
 while its roots are gnawed all the time by the dragon Nidhogg;
 for even so, the first and holy Son of Kriyasakti had his body
 gnawed by the tooth of time, but the roots of his inner being
 remained for ever undecaying and strong, because they grew and
 expanded in heaven not on earth. He was the first of the <strong>F</strong>IRST,
 and he was the seed of all the others. There were other "Sons
 of Kriyasakti" produced by a second Spiritual effort, but
 the first one has remained to this day the Seed of divine Knowledge,
 the One and the Supreme among the terrestrial "Sons of Wisdom."
 Of this subject we can say no more, except to add that in every
 age -- aye, even in our own -- there have been great intellects
 who have understood the problem correctly.
 </p><p>
 How comes our physical body to the state of perfection it is found
 in now? Through millions of years of evolution, of course, yet
 never through, or from, animals, as taught by materialism. For,
 as Carlyle says: -- ". . . The essence of our being, the
 mystery in us that calls itself 'I,' -- what words have we for
 such things? -- it is a breath of Heaven,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 212 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 the highest Being reveals himself in man. This body, these faculties,
 this life of ours, is it not all as a vesture for the UNNAMED?"
 </p><p>
 The<em> breath </em>of heaven, or rather the breath of life, called
 in the Bible <em>Nephesh</em>,<em> </em>is in every animal, in
 every animate speck as in every mineral atom. But none of these
 has, like man, the consciousness of the nature of that highest
 Being,* as none has that divine harmony in its form which man
 possesses. It is, as Novalis said, and no one since has said it
 better, as repeated by Carlyle: --
 </p><p>
 "There is but one temple in the universe, and that is the
 body of man. Nothing is holier than that high form . . . . We
 touch heaven when we lay our hand on a human body!" "This
 sounds like a mere flourish of rhetoric," adds Carlyle, "but
 it is not so. If well meditated it will turn out to be a scientific
 fact; the expression . . . of the actual truth of the thing. We
 are the miracle of miracles, -- the great inscrutable Mystery."
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * There is no nation in the world in which the feeling of devotion
 or of religious mysticism is more developed and prominent than
 in the Hindu people. See what Max Muller says of this idiosyncracy
 and national feature in his works. This is direct inheritance
 from the primitive <em>conscious </em>men of the Third Race.
