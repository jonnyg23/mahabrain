 <p>
 <strong>S</strong>INCE the appearance of Theosophical literature
 in England, it has become customary to call its teachings "Esoteric
 Buddhism." And, having become a habit -- as an old proverb
 based on daily experience has it -- "Error runs down an inclined
 plane, while Truth has to laboriously climb its way up hill."
 </p><p>
 Old truisms are often the wisest. The human mind can hardly remain
 entirely free from bias, and decisive opinions are often formed
 before a thorough examination of a subject from all its aspects
 has been made. This is said with reference to the prevailing double
 mistake (<em>a</em>) of limiting Theosophy to Buddhism: and (<em>b</em>)
 of confounding the tenets of the religious philosophy preached
 by Gautama, the Buddha, with the doctrines broadly outlined in
 "Esoteric Buddhism." Any thing more erroneous than this
 could be hardly imagined. It has enabled our enemies to find an
 effective weapon against theosophy; because, as an eminent Pali
 scholar very pointedly expressed it, there was in the volume named
 "neither esotericism nor Buddhism." The esoteric truths,
 presented in Mr. Sinnett's work, had ceased to be esoteric from
 the moment they were made public; nor did it contain the religion
 of Buddha, but simply a few tenets from a hitherto hidden teaching
 which are now supplemented by many more, enlarged and explained
 in the present volumes. But even the latter, though giving out
 many fundamental tenets <em>from the </em><strong>S</strong>ECRET
 <strong>D</strong>OCTRINE <em>of the East, </em>raise but a small
 corner of the dark veil. For no one, not even the greatest living
 adept, would be permitted to, or could -- even if he would --
 give out promiscuously, to a mocking, unbelieving world, that
 which has been so effectually concealed from it for long aeons
 and ages.
 </p><p>
 "Esoteric Buddhism" was an excellent work with a very
 unfortunate</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xviii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 title, though it meant no more than does the title of this work,
 the "<strong>S</strong>ECRET <strong>D</strong>OCTRINE."
 It proved unfortunate, because people are always in the habit
 of judging things by their appearance, rather than their meaning;
 and because the error has now become so universal, that even most
 of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society have fallen victims
 to the same misconception. From the first, however, protests were
 raised by Brahmins and others against the title; and, in justice
 to myself, I must add that "Esoteric Buddhism" was presented
 to me as a completed volume, and that I was entirely unaware of
 the manner in which the author intended to spell the word "Budh-ism."
 </p><p>
 This has to be laid directly at the door of those who, having
 been the first to bring the subject under public notice, neglected
 to point out the difference between "Buddhism" -- the
 religious system of ethics preached by the Lord Gautama, and named
 after his title of Buddha, "the Enlightened" -- and
 <em>Budha, </em>"Wisdom," or knowledge (<em>Vidya</em>),
 the<em> </em>faculty of cognizing, from the Sanskrit root "Budh,"
 <em>to know. </em>We theosophists of India are ourselves the real
 culprits, although, at the time, we did our best to correct the
 mistake. (See <em>Theosophist, </em>June, 1883.) To avoid this
 deplorable misnomer was easy; the spelling of the word had only
 to be altered, and by common consent both pronounced and written
 "Budhism," instead of "Buddhism." Nor is the
 latter term correctly spelt and pronounced, as it ought to be
 called, in English, Buddhaism, and its votaries "Buddhaists."
 </p><p>
 This explanation is absolutely necessary at the beginning of a
 work like this one. The "Wisdom Religion" is the inheritance
 of all the nations, the world over, though the statement was made
 in "Esoteric Buddhism" (<em>Preface </em>to the original
 Edition) that "two years ago (<em>i.e.</em> 1883), neither
 I <em>nor any other European living</em>,<em> </em>knew the alphabet
 of the Science, here for the first time put into a scientific
 shape," etc. This error must have crept in through inadvertence.
 For the present writer knew all that which is "divulged"
 in "Esoteric Buddhism" -- and much more -- <em>many
 years </em>before it became her duty (in 1880) to impart a small
 portion of the Secret Doctrine to two <em>European </em>gentlemen,
 one of whom was the author of "Esoteric Buddhism"; and
 surely the present writer has the undoubted, though to her, rather
 equivocal, privilege of being a European, by birth and education.
 Moreover, a considerable part of the philosophy</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xix INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 expounded by Mr. Sinnett was taught in America, even before <em>Isis
 Unveiled </em>was published, to two Europeans and to my colleague,
 Colonel H. S. Olcott. Of the three teachers the latter gentleman
 has had, the first was a Hungarian Initiate, the second an Egyptian,
 the third a Hindu. As permitted, Colonel Olcott has given out
 some of this teaching in various ways; if the other two have not,
 it has been simply because they were not allowed: their time for
 public work having not yet come. But for others it has, and the
 appearance of Mr. Sinnett's several interesting books is a visible
 proof of the fact. It is above everything important to keep in
 mind that no theosophical book acquires the least additional value
 from pretended authority.
 </p><p>
 In etymology <em>Adi</em>, and<em> Adhi</em> Budha, the <em>one
 </em>(or the First) and "Supreme Wisdom" is a term used
 by Aryasanga in his Secret treatises, and now by all the mystic
 Northern Buddhists. It is a Sanskrit term, and an appellation
 given by the earliest Aryans to the Unknown deity; the word "Brahma"
 not being found in the Vedas and the early works. It means the
 absolute Wisdom, and "Adi-bhuta" is translated "the
 primeval uncreated cause of all" by Fitzedward Hall. AEons
 of untold duration must have elapsed, before the epithet of Buddha
 was so humanized, so to speak, as to allow of the term being applied
 to mortals and finally appropriated to one whose unparalleled
 virtues and knowledge caused him to receive the title of the "Buddha
 of Wisdom unmoved." <em>Bodha </em>means the innate possession
 of divine intellect or "understanding"; "Buddha,"
 the acquirement of it by personal efforts and merit; while <em>Buddhi
 </em>is the faculty of cognizing the channel through which divine
 knowledge reaches the "Ego," the discernment of good
 and evil, "divine conscience" also; and "Spiritual
 Soul," which is the vehicle of <em>Atma. </em>"When<em>
 Buddhi </em>absorbs our <strong>E</strong>GOtism (destroys it)
 with all its <em>Vikaras, </em>Avalokiteshvara becomes manifested
 to us, and Nirvana, or <em>Mukti, </em>is reached," "Mukti"
 being the same as Nirvana, <em>i.e.</em>, freedom from the trammels
 of "Maya" or <em>illusion. </em>"Bodhi" is
 likewise the name of a particular state of trance condition, called<em>
 Samadhi, </em>during which the subject reaches the culmination
 of spiritual knowledge.
 </p><p>
 Unwise are those who, in their blind and, in our age, untimely
 hatred of Buddhism, and, by re-action, of "Budhism,"
 deny its esoteric teachings (which are those also of the Brahmins),
 simply because the name</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xx INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 suggests what to them, as Monotheists, are noxious doctrines.
 <em>Unwise </em>is the correct term to use in their case. For
 the Esoteric philosophy is alone calculated to withstand, in this
 age of crass and illogical materialism, the repeated attacks on
 all and everything man holds most dear and sacred, in his inner
 spiritual life. The true philosopher, the student of the Esoteric
 Wisdom, entirely loses sight of personalities, dogmatic beliefs
 and special religions. Moreover, Esoteric philosophy reconciles
 all religions, strips every one of its outward, human garments,
 and shows the root of each to be identical with that of every
 other great religion. It proves the necessity of an absolute Divine
 Principle in nature. It denies Deity no more than it does the
 Sun. Esoteric philosophy has never rejected God in Nature, nor
 Deity as the absolute and abstract <em>Ens. </em>It only refuses
 to accept any of the gods of the so-called monotheistic religions,
 gods created by man in his own image and likeness, a blasphemous
 and sorry caricature of the Ever Unknowable. Furthermore, the
 records we mean to place before the reader embrace the esoteric
 tenets of the whole world since the beginning of our humanity,
 and Buddhistic occultism occupies therein only its legitimate
 place, and no more. Indeed, the secret portions of the "<em>Dan</em>"<em>
 or Jan-na</em>"<em>* </em>("<em>Dhyan</em>")<em>
 </em>of Gautama's metaphysics -- grand as they appear to one unacquainted
 with the tenets of the Wisdom Religion of antiquity -- are but
 a very small portion of the whole. The Hindu Reformer limited
 his public teachings to the purely moral and physiological aspect
 of the Wisdom Religion, to Ethics and MAN alone. Things "unseen
 and incorporeal," the mystery of Being outside our terrestrial
 sphere, the great Teacher left entirely untouched in his public
 lectures, reserving the hidden Truths for a select circle of his
 Arhats. The latter received their Initiation at the famous Saptaparna
 cave (the <em>Sattapanni </em>of Mahavansa) near Mount Baibhar
 (the Webhara of the Pali MSS.). This cave was in Rajagriha, the
 ancient capital of Mogadha, and was the <em>Cheta </em>cave of
 Fa-hian, as rightly suspected by some archaeologists.**

 <p>
 *<em> Dan</em>, now become in modern Chinese and Tibetan phonetics
 <em>ch</em>'<em>an</em>, is the general term for the esoteric
 schools, and their literature. In the old books, the word Janna
 is defined as "to reform one's self by meditation and knowledge,"
 a second <i>inner </i>birth. Hence Dzan, <em>Djan</em> phonetically,
 the "Book of <em>Dzyan</em>."
 </p><p>
 ** Mr. Beglor, the chief engineer at Buddhagaya, and a distinguished
 archaeologist, was the first, we believe, to discover it.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxi INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 sophy of these teachings, once that they were transplanted from
 the secret and sacred circle of the Arhats, during the course
 of their work of proselytism, into a soil less prepared for metaphysical
 conceptions than India; <em>i.e.</em>, once they were transferred
 into China, Japan, Siam, and Burmah. How the pristine purity of
 these grand revelations was dealt with may be seen in studying
 some of the so-called "esoteric" Buddhist schools of
 antiquity in their modern garb, not only in China and other Buddhist
 countries in general, but even in not a few schools in Thibet,
 left to the care of uninitiated Lamas and Mongolian innovators.
 </p><p>
 Thus the reader is asked to bear in mind the very important difference
 between <em>orthodox </em>Buddhism -- <em>i.e.</em>, the public
 teachings of Gautama the Buddha, and his esoteric <em>Budhism.
 </em>His Secret Doctrine, however, differed in no wise from that
 of the initiated Brahmins of his day. The Buddha was a child of
 the Aryan soil; a born Hindu, a Kshatrya and a disciple of the
 "twice born" (the initiated Brahmins) or Dwijas. His
 teachings, therefore, could not be different from their doctrines,
 for the whole Buddhist reform merely consisted in giving out a
 portion of that which had been kept secret from every man outside
 of the "enchanted" circle of Temple-Initiates and ascetics.
 Unable to teach <i>all </i>that had been imparted to him -- owing
 to his pledges -- though he taught a philosophy built upon the
 ground-work of the true esoteric knowledge, the Buddha gave to
 the world only its <em>outward </em>material body and kept its
 <em>soul </em>for his Elect. (See also Volume II.) Many Chinese
 scholars among Orientalists have heard of the "Soul Doctrine."
 None seem to have understood its real meaning and importance.
 </p><p>
 That doctrine was preserved secretly -- too secretly, perhaps
 -- within the sanctuary. The mystery that shrouded its chief dogma
 and aspirations -- Nirvana -- has so tried and irritated the curiosity
 of those scholars who have studied it, that, unable to solve it
 logically and satisfactorily by untying the Gordian knot, they
 cut it through, by declaring that Nirvana meant <em>absolute annihilation.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Toward the end of the first quarter of this century, a distinct
 class of literature appeared in the world, which became with every
 year more defined in its tendency. Being based, <em>soi-disant,
 </em>on the scholarly researches of Sanskritists and Orientalists
 in general, it was held scientific. Hindu, Egyptian, and other
 ancient religions, myths, and emblems were made to yield anything
 the symbologist wanted them to</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 yield, thus often giving out the rude <em>outward </em>form in
 place of the <em>inner </em>meaning. Works, most remarkable for
 their ingenious deductions and speculations, in <em>circulo vicioso,
 </em>foregone conclusions generally changing places with premisses
 as in the syllogisms of more than one Sanskrit and Pali scholar,
 appeared rapidly in succession, over-flooding the libraries with
 dissertations rather on phallic and sexual worship than on real
 symbology, and each contradicting the other.
 </p><p>
 This is the true reason, perhaps, why the outline of a few fundamental
 truths from the Secret Doctrine of the Archaic ages is now permitted
 to see the light, after long millenniums of the most profound
 silence and secrecy. I say "a <em>few </em>truths,"
 advisedly, because that which must remain unsaid could not be
 contained in a hundred such volumes, nor could it be imparted
 to the present generation of Sadducees. But, even the little that
 is now given is better than complete silence upon those vital
 truths. The world of to-day, in its mad career towards the unknown
 -- which it is too ready to confound with the unknowable, whenever
 the problem eludes the grasp of the physicist -- is rapidly progressing
 on the reverse, material plane of spirituality. It has now become
 a vast arena -- a true valley of discord and of eternal strife
 -- a necropolis, wherein lie buried the highest and the most holy
 aspirations of our Spirit-Soul. That soul becomes with every new
 generation more paralyzed and atrophied. The "amiable infidels
 and accomplished profligates" of Society, spoken of by Greeley,
 care little for the revival of the <em>dead </em>sciences of the
 past; but there is a fair minority of earnest students who are
 entitled to learn the few truths that may be given to them now;
 and <i>now</i> much more than ten years ago, when "Isis Unveiled,"
 or even the later attempts to explain the mysteries of esoteric
 science, were published.
 </p><p>
 One of the greatest, and, withal, the most serious objection to
 the correctness and reliability of the whole work will be the
 preliminary <strong>S</strong>TANZAS: "How can the statements
 contained in them be verified?" True, if a great portion
 of the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Mongolian works quoted in the present
 volumes are known to some Orientalists, the chief work -- that
 one from which the Stanzas are given -- is not in the possession
 of European Libraries. The Book of Dzyan (or "Dzan")
 is utterly unknown to our Philologists, or at any rate was never
 heard of by them under its present name. This is, of course, a
 great drawback </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxiii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 to those who follow the methods of research prescribed by official
 Science; but to the students of Occultism, and to every genuine
 Occultist, this will be of little moment. The main body of the
 Doctrines given is found scattered throughout hundreds and thousands
 of Sanskrit <strong>MSS</strong>., some already translated --
 disfigured in their interpretations, as usual, -- others still
 awaiting their turn. Every scholar, therefore, has an opportunity
 of verifying the statements herein made, and of checking most
 of the quotations. A few new facts (<i>new</i> to the profane
 Orientalist, only) and passages quoted from the Commentaries will
 be found difficult to trace. Several of the teachings, also, have
 hitherto been transmitted orally: yet even those are in every
 instance hinted at in the almost countless volumes of Brahminical,
 Chinese and Tibetan temple-literature.
 </p><p>
 However it may be, and whatsoever is in store for the writer through
 malevolent criticism, one fact is quite certain. The members of
 several esoteric schools -- the seat of which is beyond the Himalayas,
 and whose ramifications may be found in China, Japan, India, Tibet,
 and even in Syria, besides South America -- claim to have in their
 possession the <em>sum total </em>of sacred and philosophical
 works in <strong>MSS</strong>. and type: all the works, in fact,
 that have ever been written, in whatever language or characters,
 since the art of writing began; from the ideographic hieroglyphs
 down to the alphabet of Cadmus and the Devanagari.
 </p><p>
 It has been claimed in all ages that ever since the destruction
 of the Alexandrian Library (see <em>Isis Unveiled, </em>Vol. II.,
 p. 27), every work of a character that might have led the profane
 to the ultimate discovery and comprehension of some of the mysteries
 of the Secret Science, was, owing to the combined efforts of the
 members of the Brotherhoods, diligently searched for. It is added,
 moreover, by those who know, that once found, save three copies
 left and stored safely away, such works were all destroyed. In
 India, the last of the precious manuscripts were secured and hidden
 during the reign of the Emperor Akbar.*
 </p><p>
 It is maintained, furthermore, that every sacred book of that
 kind, whose text was not sufficiently veiled in symbolism, or
 which had any
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Prof. Max Muller shows that no bribes or threats of Akbar could
 extort from the Brahmans the original text of the Veda; and boasts
 that European Orientalists have it (<em>Lecture on the </em>"<em>Science
 of Religion,</em>"<em> </em>p. 23). Whether Europe has the
 <em>complete text </em>is very doubtful, and the future may have
 very disagreeable surprises in store for the Orientalists.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxiv INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 direct references to the ancient mysteries, after having been
 carefully copied in cryptographic characters, such as to defy
 the art of the best and cleverest palaeographer, was also destroyed
 to the last copy. During Akbar's reign, some fanatical courtiers,
 displeased at the Emperor's sinful prying into the religions of
 the infidels, themselves helped the Brahmans to conceal their
 <strong>MSS.</strong> Such was Badaoni, who had an <em>undisguised
 horror </em>for Akbar's mania for idolatrous religions.*
 </p><p>
 Moreover in all the large and wealthy lamasaries, there are subterranean
 crypts and <em>cave-libraries, </em>cut in the rock, whenever
 the <em>gonpa </em>and the <em>lhakhang </em>are situated in the
 mountains. Beyond the Western Tsay-dam, in the solitary passes
 of <em>Kuen-lun** </em>there are several such hiding places. Along
 the ridge of Altyn-Toga, whose soil no European foot has ever
 trodden so far, there exists a certain hamlet, lost in a deep
 gorge. It is a small cluster of houses, a hamlet rather than a
 monastery, with a poor-looking temple in it, with one old lama,
 a hermit, living near by to watch it. Pilgrims say that the subterranean
 galleries and halls under it contain a collection of books, the
 number of which, according to the accounts given, is too large
 to find room even in the British Museum.***
 </p><p>
 All this is very likely to provoke a smile of doubt. But then,

 * Badaoni wrote in his <em>Muntakhab at Tawarikh: </em>"His
 Majesty relished inquiries into the sects of these infidels (who
 cannot be counted, so numerous they are, and who have no end of
 <em>revealed books</em>) . . . As they (the Sramana and Brahmins)
 surpass other learned men in their treatises on morals, on physical
 and religious sciences, and reach a high degree <em>in their knowledge
 of the future</em>,<em> </em>in spiritual power, and human perfection,
 they brought proofs based on reason and testimony, and inculcated
 their doctrines so firmly that no man could now raise a doubt
 in his Majesty even if mountains were to crumble to dust, or the
 heavens were to tear asunder." This work "was kept secret,
 and was not published till the reign of Jahangir." (Ain i
 Akbari, translated by Dr. Blochmann, p. 104, note.)

 *** According to the same tradition the now desolate regions of
 the waterless land of Tarim -- a true wilderness in the heart
 of Turkestan -- were in the days of old covered with flourishing
 and wealthy cities. At present, hardly a few verdant oases relieve
 its dead solitude. One such, sprung on the sepulchre of a vast
 city swallowed by and buried under the sandy soil of the desert,
 belongs to no one, but is often visited by Mongolians and Buddhists.
 The same tradition speaks of immense subterranean abodes, of large
 corridors filled with tiles and cylinders. It may be an idle rumour,
 and it may be an actual fact.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxv INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the reader rejects the truthfulness of the reports, let him pause
 and reflect over the following well known facts. The collective
 researches of the Orientalists, and especially the labours of
 late years of the students of comparative Philology and the Science
 of Religions have led them to ascertain as follows: An immense,
 incalculable number of <strong>MSS</strong>., and even printed
 works <em>known to have existed</em>,<em> are now to be found
 no more. </em>They have disappeared without leaving the slightest
 trace behind them. Were they works of no importance they might,
 in the natural course of time, have been left to perish, and their
 very names would have been obliterated from human memory. But
 it is not so; for, as now ascertained, most of them contained
 the true keys to works still extant, and <em>entirely incomprehensible,
 </em>for the greater portion of their readers, <em>without those
 additional volumes of Commentaries and explanations. </em>Such
 are, for instance, the works of Lao-tse, the predecessor of Confucius.*
 </p><p>
 He is said to have written 930 books on Ethics and religions,
 and <em>seventy </em>on magic, <em>one thousand in all. </em>His
 great work, however, the <em>heart </em>of his doctrine, the "Tao-te-King,"
 or the sacred scriptures of the <em>Taosse, </em>has in it, as
 Stanislas Julien shows, only "about 5,000 words" (<em>Tao-te-King,
 </em>p. xxvii.), hardly a dozen of pages, yet Professor Max Muller
 finds that "the text is unintelligible without commentaries,
 so that Mr. Julien had to consult more than sixty commentators
 for the purpose of his translation," the earliest going back
 as far as the year 163 <strong>B.C</strong>., <em>not earlier,
 </em>as we see. During the four centuries and a half that preceded
 this <em>earliest </em>of the commentators there was ample time
 to veil the true Lao-tse doctrine from all but his initiated priests.
 The Japanese, among whom are now to be found the most learned
 of the priests and followers of Lao-tse, simply laugh at the blunders
 and hypotheses of the European Chinese scholars; and tradition
 affirms that the commentaries to which our Western Sinologues
 have access are not the <em>real occult </em>records, but intentional
 veils, and that the true commentaries, as well as almost all the
 texts, have long since <em>disappeared </em>from the eyes of the
 profane.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * "If we turn to China, we find that the religion of Confucius
 is founded on the Five <em>King </em>and the Four <em>Shu</em>-books,
 in themselves of considerable extent and surrounded by voluminous
 Commentaries, without which even the most learned scholars would
 not venture to fathom <em>the depth of their sacred canon.</em>"
 (<em>Lectures on the </em>"<em>Science of Religion,</em>"<em>
 </em>p. 185. Max Muller.) But they have not fathomed it -- and
 this is the complaint of the Confucianists, as a very learned
 member of that body, in Paris, complained in 1881.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxvi INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 If one turns to the ancient literature of the Semitic religions,
 to the Chaldean Scriptures, the elder sister and instructress,
 if not the fountain-head of the Mosaic Bible, the basis and starting-point
 of Christianity, what do the scholars find? To perpetuate the
 memory of the ancient religions of Babylon; to record the vast
 cycle of astronomical observations of the Chaldean Magi; to justify
 the tradition of their splendid and eminently occult literature,
 what now remains? -- only a few fragments, <em>said to be by </em>Berosus.
 </p><p>
 These, however, are almost valueless, even as a clue to the character
 of what has disappeared. For they passed through the hands of
 his Reverence the Bishop of Caesarea -- that self-constituted
 censor and editor of the sacred records of other men's religions
 -- and they doubtless bear to this day the mark of his eminently
 veracious and trustworthy hand. For what is the history of this
 treatise on the once grand religion of Babylon?
 </p><p>
 Written in Greek by Berosus, a priest of the temple of Belus,
 for Alexander the Great, from the astronomical and chronological
 records preserved by the priests of that temple, and covering
 a period of 200,000 years, it is now lost. In the first century
 <strong>B.C</strong>. Alexander Polyhistor made a series of extracts
 from it -- <em>also lost. </em>Eusebius used these extracts in
 writing his <em>Chronicon</em> (270-340 <strong>A.D</strong>.).
 The points of resemblance -- almost of identity -- between the
 Jewish and the Chaldean Scriptures,* made the latter most dangerous
 to Eusebius, in his <em>role</em> of defender and champion of
 the new faith which had adopted the Jewish Scriptures, and with
 them an absurd chronology. It is pretty certain that Eusebius
 did not spare the Egyptian Synchronistic tables of Manetho --
 so much so that Bunsen** charges him with mutilating history most
 unscrupulously. And Socrates, a historian of the fifth century,
 and Syncellus, vice-patriarch of Constantinople (eighth century),
 both denounce him as the most daring and desperate forger.
 </p><p>
 Is it likely, then, that he dealt more tenderly with the Chaldean
 records, which were already menacing the new religion, so rashly
 accepted?
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Found out and proven only now, through the discoveries made
 by George Smith (<em>vide </em>his "Chaldean account of Genesis"),
 and which, thanks to this Armenian forger, have misled all the
 <em>civilized nations </em>for over 1,500 years into accepting
 Jewish derivations <em>for direct Divine Revelation!</em>

 So that, with the exception of these more than doubtful fragments,
 the entire Chaldean sacred literature has disappeared from the
 eyes of the profane as completely as the lost Atlantis. A few
 facts that were contained in the Berosian History are given in
 Part II. of Vol. II., and may throw a great light on the true
 origin of the Fallen Angels, personified by Bel and the Dragon.
 </p><p>
 Turning now to the oldest Aryan literature, the Rig-Veda, the
 student will find, following strictly in this the data furnished
 by the said Orientalists themselves, that, although the Rig-Veda
 contains only "about 10,580 verses, or 1,028 hymns,"
 in spite of the Brahmanas and the mass of glosses and commentaries,
 it is not understood correctly to this day. Why is this so? Evidently
 because the Brahmanas, "the scholastic and oldest treatises
 on the primitive hymns," <em>themselves require a key, </em>which
 the Orientalists have failed to secure.
 </p><p>
 What do the scholars say of Buddhist literature? Have they got
 it in its completeness? Assuredly not. Notwithstanding the 325
 volumes of the <em>Kanjur </em>and the <em>Tanjur </em>of the
 Northern Buddhists, each volume we are told, "weighing from
 four to five pounds," nothing, in truth, is known of Lamaism.
 Yet, the sacred canon of the Southern Church is said to contain
 29,368,000 letters in the Saddharma alankara,* or, exclusive of
 treatises and commentaries, "five or six times the amount
 of the matter contained in the Bible," the latter, in the
 words of Professor Max Muller, rejoicing only in 3,567,180 letters.
 Notwithstanding, then, these "325 volumes" (<em>in reality
 </em>there are 333,<em> Kanjur </em>comprising 108, and <em>Tanjur
 </em>225 volumes), "the translators, instead of supplying
 us with correct versions, have interwoven them <em>with their
 own commentaries</em>,<em> </em>for the purpose of justifying
 the dogmas of their several schools."** Moreover, "according
 to a tradition preserved by the Buddhist schools, both of the
 South and of the North, the sacred Buddhist Canon comprised originally
 80,000 or 84,000 tracts, <em>but most of them were lost</em>,
 so that there remained but 6,000," the professor tells his
 audiences. "Lost" as usual for Europeans. But who can
 be quite sure that they are likewise lost for Buddhists and Brahmins?

 would subscribe to the statement that, of these 76,000, five or
 six thousand treatises <em>might have been </em>destroyed during
 the persecutions in, and emigrations from, India. But as it is
 well ascertained that Buddhist Arhats began their religious exodus,
 for the purpose of propagating the new faith beyond Kashmir and
 the Himalayas, as early as the year 300 before our era,* and reached
 China in the year 61 <strong>A.D</strong>.** when Kashyapa, at
 the invitation of the Emperor Ming-ti, went there to acquaint
 the "Son of Heaven" with the tenets of Buddhism, it
 does seem strange to hear the Orientalists speaking of such a
 loss as though it were really possible. They do not seem to allow
 for one moment the possibility that the texts may be <em>lost
 </em>only for West and <em>for themselves</em>;<em> </em>or, that
 the Asiatic people should have the unparalleled boldness to keep
 their most sacred records out of the reach of foreigners, thus
 refusing to deliver them to the profanation and misuse of races
 even so "vastly superior" to themselves.
 </p><p>
 Owing to the expressed regrets and numerous confessions of almost
 every one of the Orientalists (See Max Muller's <em>Lectures </em>for
 example) the public may feel sufficiently sure (<em>a</em>) that
 the students of ancient religions have indeed very few data upon
 which to build such final conclusions as they generally do about
 the old religions, and (<em>b</em>) that such lack of data does
 not prevent them in the least from dogmatising. One would imagine
 that, thanks to the numerous records of the Egyptian theogony
 and mysteries preserved in the classics, and in a number of ancient
 writers, the rites and dogmas of Pharaonic Egypt ought to be well
 understood at least; better, at any rate, than the too abstruse
 philosophies and Pantheism of India, of whose religion and language
 Europe had hardly any idea before the beginning of the present
 century. Along the Nile and on the face of the whole country,
 there stand to this hour, exhumed yearly and daily, fresh relics
 which eloquently tell their own history. Still it is not so. The
 learned Oxford philologist himself confesses the truth by saying
 that "Though . . . we see still standing the Pyramids, and
 the ruins of temples and labyrinths, their walls

 covered with hieroglyphic inscriptions, and with the strange pictures
 of gods and goddesses. . . . . . . . On rolls of papyrus, which
 seem to defy the ravages of time, we have even fragments of what
 may be called the sacred books of the Egyptians; yet, though much
 has been deciphered in the ancient records of that mysterious
 race, the mainspring of the religion of Egypt and the original
 intention of its ceremonial worship <i>are </i><em>far from being
 fully </em>disclosed to us."* Here again the mysterious hieroglyphic
 documents remain, but the keys by which alone they become intelligible
 have disappeared.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, having found that "there is a natural connection
 between language and religion"; and, secondly, that there
 was a <em>common </em>Aryan religion before the separation of
 the Aryan race; a <em>common </em>Semitic religion before the
 separation of the Semitic race; and a <em>common </em>Turanian
 religion before the separation of the Chinese and the other tribes
 belonging to the Turanian class; having, in fact, only discovered
 "three ancient centres of religion" and "three
 centres of language," and though as entirely ignorant of
 those primitive religions and languages, as of their origin, the
 professor does not hesitate to declare "that a truly <em>historical
 basis </em>for a scientific treatment of those principal religions
 of the world has been gained!"
 </p><p>
 A "scientific treatment" of a subject is no guarantee
 for its "historical basis"; and with such scarcity of
 data on hand, no philologist, even among the most eminent, is
 justified in giving out his own conclusions for<em> historical
 </em>facts<em>. </em>No doubt, the eminent Orientalist has proved
 thoroughly to the world's satisfaction, that according to Grimm's
 law of phonetic rules, Odin and Buddha are two different personages,
 quite distinct from each other, and he has shown it <em>scientifically.
 </em>When, however, he takes the opportunity of saying in the
 same breath that Odin "was worshipped as the supreme deity
 <em>during a period long anterior to the age of the Veda </em>and
 of Homer" (<em>Compar. Theol., </em>p. 318), he has not the
 slightest "<em>historical </em>basis" for it. He makes
 <em>history </em>and<em> fact</em> subservient to his

 <p>
 own conclusions, which may be very "scientific," in
 the sight of Oriental scholars, but yet very wide of the mark
 of actual truth. The conflicting views on the subject of chronology,
 in the case of the Vedas, of the various eminent philologists
 and Orientalists, from Martin Haug down to Mr. Max Muller himself,
 are an evident proof that the statement has no <em>historical
 </em>basis to stand upon, "internal evidence" being
 very often a jack-o'lantern, instead of a safe beacon to follow.
 Nor has the Science of modern Comparative Mythology any better
 proof to show, that those learned writers, who have insisted for
 the last century or so that there must have been "fragments
 of a primeval revelation, granted to the ancestors of the whole
 race of mankind . . . . preserved in the temples of Greece and
 Italy," were entirely wrong. For this is what all the Eastern
 Initiates and Pundits have been proclaiming to the world from
 time to time. While a prominent Cinghalese priest assured the
 writer that it was well known that the most important Buddhist
 tracts belonging to the sacred canon were stored away in <em>countries
 and places inaccessible to the European pundits</em>, the late
 Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, the greatest Sanskritist of his day
 in India, assured some members of the Theosophical Society of
 the same fact with regard to ancient Brahmanical works. When told
 that Professor Max Muller had declared to the audiences of his
 "Lectures" that the theory . . . . "that <em>there
 was a primeval preternatural revelation </em>granted to the fathers
 of the human race, finds but few supporters at present,"
 -- the holy and learned man laughed. His answer was suggestive.
 "If Mr. <em>Moksh Mooller</em>, as<em> </em>he pronounced
 the name, were a Brahmin, and came with me, I might take him to
 a <em>gupta </em>cave (a secret crypt) near Okhee Math, in the
 Himalayas, where he would soon find out that what crossed the
 <em>Kalapani </em>(the black waters of the ocean) from India to
 Europe were only the <em>bits of rejected copies of some passages
 from our sacred books. </em>There <em>was </em>a "primeval
 revelation," and it still exists; nor will it ever be lost
 to the world, but will reappear; though the Mlechchhas will of
 course have to wait."
 </p><p>
 Questioned further on this point, he would say no more. This was
 at Meerut, in 1880.
 </p><p>
 No doubt the mystification played, in the last century at Calcutta,
 by the Brahmins upon Colonel Wilford and Sir William Jones was
 a cruel one. But it had been well deserved, and no one was more
 to be blamed</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxi INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 in that affair than the Missionaries and Colonel Wilford themselves.
 The former, on the testimony of Sir William Jones himself (see
 Asiat. Res., Vol. I., p. 272), were silly enough to maintain that
 "the Hindus were even now almost Christians, because their
 Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesa were no other than the Christian trinity."*
 It was a good lesson. It made the Oriental scholars doubly cautious;
 but perchance it has also made some of them too shy, and caused,
 in its reaction, the pendulum of foregone conclusions to swing
 too much the other way. For "that first supply on the Brahmanical
 market," made for Colonel Wilford, has now created an evident
 necessity and desire in the Orientalists to declare nearly every
 archaic Sanskrit manuscript so modern as to give to the missionaries
 full justification for availing themselves of the opportunity.
 That they do so and to the full extent of their mental powers,
 is shown by the absurd attempts of late to prove that the whole
 Puranic story about Chrishna was <em>plagiarized by the Brahmins
 from the Bible! </em>But the facts cited by the Oxford Professor
 in his Lectures on the "<em>Science of Religion</em>,"<em>
 </em>concerning the now famous interpolations, for the benefit,
 and later on to the sorrow, of Col. Wilford, do not at all interfere
 with the conclusions to which one who studies the Secret Doctrine
 must unavoidably come. For, if the results show that neither the
 <em>New </em>nor even the <em>Old</em> Testament borrowed anything
 from the more ancient religion of the Brahmans and Buddhists,
 it does not follow that the Jews have not borrowed all they knew
 from the Chaldean records, the latter being mutilated later on
 by Eusebius. As to the Chaldeans, they assuredly got their primitive
 learning from the Brahmans, for Rawlinson shows an undeniably
 Vedic influence in the early mythology of Babylon; and Col. Vans
 Kennedy has long since justly declared that Babylonia was, from
 her origin, the seat of Sanskrit and Brahman learning. But all
 such proofs must lose their value, in the presence of the latest
 theory worked out by Prof. Max Muller. What it is everyone knows.
 The code of phonetic laws has now become a universal solvent for
 every identification and "connection" between

 the gods of many nations. Thus, though the Mother of Mercury (Budha,
 Thot-Hermes, etc.), was Maia, the mother of Buddha (Gautama),
 also Maya, and the mother of Jesus, likewise Maya (illusion, for
 Mary is <em>Mare, </em>the Sea, the great illusion symbolically)
 -- yet these three characters have no connection, nor can they
 have any, since Bopp, has "laid down his code of phonetic
 laws."
 </p><p>
 In their efforts to collect together the many skeins of unwritten
 history, it is a bold step for our Orientalists to take, to deny,
 <em>a priori, </em>everything that does not dovetail with their
 special conclusions. Thus, while new discoveries are daily made
 of great arts and sciences having existed far back in the night
 of time, even the knowledge of writing is refused to some of the
 most ancient nations, and they are credited with barbarism instead
 of culture. Yet the traces of an immense civilization, even in
 Central Asia, are still to be found. This civilization is undeniably
 <em>prehistoric. </em>And how can there be civilization without
 a literature, in some form, without annals or chronicles? Common
 sense alone ought to supplement the broken links in the history
 of departed nations. The gigantic, unbroken wall of the mountains
 that hem in the whole table-land of Tibet, from the upper course
 of the river Khuan-Khe down to the Kara-Korum hills, witnessed
 a civilization during millenniums of years, and would have strange
 secrets to tell mankind. The Eastern and Central portions of those
 regions -- the Nan-Schayn and the Altyne-taga -- were once upon
 a time covered with cities that could well vie with Babylon. A
 whole geological period has swept over the land, since those cities
 breathed their last, as the mounds of shifting sand, and the sterile
 and now dead soil of the immense central plains of the basin of
 Tarim testify. The borderlands alone are superficially known to
 the traveller. Within those table-lands of sand there is water,
 and fresh oases are found blooming there, wherein no European
 foot has ever yet ventured, or trodden the now treacherous soil.
 Among these verdant oases there are some which are entirely inaccessible
 even to the native profane traveller. Hurricanes may "tear
 up the sands and sweep whole plains away," they are powerless
 to destroy that which is beyond their reach. Built deep in the
 bowels of the earth, the subterranean stores are secure; and as
 their entrances are concealed in such oases, there is little fear
 that any one should discover them, even should several armies
 invade the sandy wastes where --</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxiii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 "Not a pool, not a bush, not a house is seen,<br>
 And the mountain-range forms a rugged screen<br>
 Round the parch'd flats of the dry, dry desert. . . . ."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 But there is no need to send the reader across the desert, when
 the same proofs of ancient civilization are found even in comparatively
 populated regions of the same country. The oasis of Tchertchen,
 for instance, situated about 4,000 feet above the level of the
 river Tchertchen-D'arya, is surrounded with the ruins of archaic
 towns and cities in every direction. There, some 3,000 human beings
 represent the relics of about a hundred extinct nations and races
 -- the very names of which are now unknown to our ethnologists.
 An anthropologist would feel more than embarrassed to class, divide
 and subdivide them; the more so, as the respective descendants
 of all these <em>antediluvian </em>races and tribes know as little
 of their own forefathers themselves, as if they had fallen from
 the moon. When questioned about their origin, they reply that
 they know not whence their fathers had come, but had heard that
 their <em>first </em>(or earliest) men were ruled by the great
 genii of these deserts. This may be put down to ignorance and
 superstition, yet in view of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine,
 the answer may be based upon primeval tradition. Alone, the tribe
 of Khoorassan claims to have come from what is now known as Afghanistan,
 long before the days of Alexander, and brings legendary lore to
 that effect as corroboration. The Russian traveller, Colonel (now
 General) Prjevalsky, found quite close to the oasis of Tchertchen,
 the ruins of two enormous cities, the oldest of which was, according
 to local tradition, ruined 3,000 years ago by a hero and giant;
 and the other by the Mongolians in the tenth century of our era.
 "The emplacement of the two cities is now covered, owing
 to shifting sands and the desert wind, with strange and heterogeneous
 relics; with broken china and kitchen utensils and human bones.
 The natives often find copper and gold coins, melted silver, ingots,
 diamonds, and turquoises, and what is the most remarkable -- broken
 glass. . . . ." "Coffins of some undecaying wood, or
 material, also, within which beautifully preserved embalmed bodies
 are found. . . . . The male mummies are all extremely tall powerfully
 built men with long waving hair. . . . . A vault was found with
 twelve dead men <em>sitting </em>in it. Another time, in a separate
 coffin, a young girl was discovered by us. Her eyes were closed
 with golden discs, and the jaws held firm by a golden circlet
 running from under the chin across the top of the head. Clad in
 a narrow</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxiv INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 woollen garment, her bosom was covered with golden stars, the
 feet being left naked." (From a lecture by N. M. Prjevalsky.)
 To this, the famous traveller adds that all along their way on
 the river Tchertchen they heard legends about twenty-three towns
 buried ages ago by the shifting sands of the deserts. The same
 tradition exists on the Lob-nor and in the oasis of Kerya.
 </p><p>
 The traces of such civilization, and these and like traditions,
 give us the right to credit other legendary lore warranted by
 well educated and learned natives of India and Mongolia, when
 they speak of immense libraries reclaimed from the sand, together
 with various reliques of ancient <strong>MAGIC</strong> lore,
 which have all been safely stowed away.
 </p><p>
 To recapitulate. The Secret Doctrine was the universally diffused
 religion of the ancient and prehistoric world. Proofs of its diffusion,
 authentic records of its history, a complete chain of documents,
 showing its character and presence in every land, together with
 the teaching of all its great adepts, exist to this day in the
 secret crypts of libraries belonging to the Occult Fraternity.
 </p><p>
 This statement is rendered more credible by a consideration of
 the following facts: the tradition of the thousands of ancient
 parchments saved when the Alexandrian library was destroyed; the
 thousands of Sanskrit works which disappeared in India in the
 reign of Akbar; the universal tradition in China and Japan that
 the true old texts with the commentaries, which alone make them
 comprehensible -- amounting to many thousands of volumes -- have
 long passed out of the reach of profane hands; the disappearance
 of the vast sacred and occult literature of Babylon; the loss
 of those keys which alone could solve the thousand riddles of
 the Egyptian hieroglyphic records; the tradition in India that
 the real secret commentaries which alone make the Veda intelligible,
 though no longer visible to profane eyes, still remain for the
 initiate, hidden in secret caves and crypts; and an identical
 belief among the Buddhists, with regard to their secret books.
 </p><p>
 The Occultists assert that all these exist, safe from Western
 spoliating hands, to re-appear in some more enlightened age, for
 which in the words of the late Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, "the
 Mlechchhas (outcasts, savages, those beyond the pale of Aryan
 civilization) will have to wait."
 </p><p>
 For it is not the fault of the initiates that these documents
 are now "lost" to the profane; nor was their policy
 dictated by selfishness, or</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxv INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 any desire to monopolise the life-giving sacred lore. There were
 portions of the Secret Science that for incalculable ages had
 to remain concealed from the profane gaze. But this was because
 to impart to the unprepared multitude secrets of such tremendous
 importance, was equivalent to giving a child a lighted candle
 in a powder magazine.
 </p><p>
 The answer to a question which has frequently arisen in the minds
 of students, when meeting with statements such as this, may be
 outlined here.
 </p><p>
 "We can understand," they say, "the necessity for
 concealing from the herd such secrets as the Vril, or the rock-destroying
 force, discovered by J. W. Keely, of Philadelphia, but we cannot
 understand how any danger could arise from the revelation of such
 a purely philosophic doctrine, as, <em>e.g</em>., the evolution
 of the planetary chains."
 </p><p>
 The danger was this: Doctrines such as the planetary chain, or
 the seven races, at once give a clue to the seven-fold nature
 of man, for each principle is correlated to a plane, a planet,
 and a race; and the human principles are, on every plane, correlated
 to seven-fold occult forces -- those of the higher planes being
 of tremendous power. So that any septenary division at once gives
 a clue to tremendous occult powers, the abuse of which would cause
 incalculable evil to humanity. A clue, which is, perhaps, no clue
 to the present generation -- especially the Westerns -- protected
 as they are by their very blindness and ignorant materialistic
 disbelief in the occult; but a clue which would, nevertheless,
 have been very real in the early centuries of the Christian era,
 to people fully convinced of the reality of occultism, and entering
 a cycle of degradation, which made them rife for abuse of occult
 powers and sorcery of the worst description.
 </p><p>
 The documents were concealed, it is true, but the knowledge itself
 and its actual existence had never been made a secret of by the
 Hierophants of the Temple, wherein <strong>M</strong>YSTERIES
 have ever been made a discipline and stimulus to virtue. This
 is very old news, and was repeatedly made known by the great adepts,
 from Pythagoras and Plato down to the Neoplatonists. It was the
 new religion of the Nazarenes that wrought a change for the worse
 -- in the policy of centuries.
 </p><p>
 Moreover, there is a well-known fact, a very curious one, corroborated
 to the writer by a reverend gentleman attached for years to a
 Russian Embassy -- namely, that there are several documents in
 the St. Peters-</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxvi INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 burg Imperial Libraries to show that, even so late as during the
 days when Freemasonry, and Secret Societies of Mystics flourished
 unimpeded in Russia, <em>i.e.</em>, at the end of the last and
 the beginning of the present century, more than one Russian Mystic
 travelled to Tibet <i>via</i> the Ural mountains in search of
 knowledge and initiation <em>in the unknown crypts of Central
 Asia. </em>And more than one returned years later, with a rich
 store of such information as could never have been given him anywhere
 in Europe. Several cases could be cited, and well-known names
 brought forward, but for the fact that such publicity might annoy
 the surviving relatives of the said late Initiates. Let any one
 look over the Annals and History of Freemasonry in the archives
 of the Russian metropolis, and he will assure himself of the fact
 stated.
 </p><p>
 This is a corroboration of that which has been stated many times
 before, and, unfortunately, too indiscreetly. Instead of benefiting
 humanity, the virulent charges of deliberate invention and imposture
 with a purpose thrown at those who asserted but a truthful, if
 even a little known fact, have only generated bad Karma for the
 slanderers. But now the mischief is done, and truth should no
 longer be denied, whatever the consequences. Is it a new religion,
 we are asked? By no means; it is not a <em>religion, </em>nor
 is its philosophy <i>new</i>; for, as already stated, it is as
 old as thinking man. Its tenets are not now published for the
 first time, but have been cautiously given out to, and taught
 by, more than one European Initiate -- especially by the late
 Ragon.
 </p><p>
 More than one great scholar has stated that there never was a
 religious founder, whether Aryan, Semitic or Turanian, who had
 <em>invented </em>a new religion, or revealed a new truth. These
 founders were all <em>transmitters, </em>not original teachers.
 They were the authors of new forms and interpretations, while
 the truths upon which the latter were based were as old as mankind.
 Selecting one or more of those grand verities -- actualities visible
 only to the eye of the real Sage and Seer -- out of the many orally
 revealed to man in the beginning, preserved and perpetuated in
 the <em>adyta </em>of the temples through initiation, during the
 <strong>M</strong>YSTERIES and by personal transmission -- they
 revealed these truths to the masses. Thus every nation received
 in its turn some of the said truths, under the veil of its own
 local and special symbolism; which, as time went on, developed
 into a more or less philosophical cultus, a Pantheon in mythical
 disguise. Therefore is Confucius, a very ancient</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxvii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 legislator in historical chronology, though a very modern Sage
 in the World's History, shown by Dr. Legge* -- who calls him "emphatically
 <em>a transmitter, </em>not a maker" -- as saying: "I
 only hand on: I cannot create new things. I believe in the ancients
 and therefore I love them."** (Quoted in "Science of
 Religions" by Max Muller.)
 </p><p>
 The writer loves them too, and therefore believes in the ancients,
 and the modern heirs to their Wisdom. And believing in both, she
 now transmits that which she has received and learnt herself to
 all those who will accept it. As to those who may reject her testimony,
 -- <em>i.e.</em>, the great majority -- she will bear them no
 malice, for they will be as right in their way in denying, as
 she is right in hers in affirming, since they look at <strong>TRUTH</strong>
 from two entirely different stand-points. Agreeably with the rules
 of critical scholarship, the Orientalist has to reject <em>a priori
 </em>whatever evidence he cannot fully verify for himself. And
 how can a Western scholar accept on hearsay that which he knows
 nothing about? Indeed, that which is given in these volumes is
 selected from <em>oral, </em>as much as from written teachings.
 This first instalment of the esoteric doctrines is based upon
 Stanzas, which are the records of a people unknown to ethnology;
 it is claimed that they are written in a tongue absent from the
 nomenclature of languages and dialects with which philology is
 acquainted; they are said to emanate from a source (Occultism)
 repudiated by science; and, finally, they are offered through
 an agency, incessantly discredited before the world by all those
 who hate unwelcome truths, or have some special hobby of their
 own to defend. Therefore, the rejection of these teachings may
 be expected, and must be accepted beforehand. No one styling himself
 a "scholar," in whatever department of exact science,
 will be permitted to regard these teachings seriously. They will
 be derided and rejected <em>a priori </em>in this century; but
 only in this one. For in the twentieth century of our era scholars
 will begin to recognize that the <em>Secret Doctrine </em>has
 neither been invented nor exaggerated, but, on the contrary, simply
 outlined; and finally, that its teachings antedate the Vedas.***
 Have not the latter been derided, rejected, and

 <p>
 called "a modern forgery" even so recently as fifty
 years ago? Was not Sanskrit proclaimed at one time the progeny
 of, and a dialect derived from, the Greek, according to Lempriere
 and other scholars? About 1820, Prof. Max Muller tells us, the
 sacred books of the Brahmans, of the Magians, and of the Buddhists,
 "were all but unknown, their very existence was doubted,
 and there was not a single scholar who could have translated a
 line of the Veda . . . of the Zend Avesta, or . . . of the Buddhist
 Tripitaka, and now the Vedas are proved to be the work of the
 highest antiquity whose 'preservation amounts almost to a marvel'
 (Lecture on the Vedas).
 </p><p>
 The same will be said of the Secret Archaic Doctrine, when proofs
 are given of its undeniable existence and records. But it will
 take centuries before much more is given from it. Speaking of
 the keys to the Zodiacal mysteries as being almost lost to the
 world, it was remarked by the writer in "Isis Unveiled"
 some ten years ago that: "The said key must be turned <em>seven
 </em>times before the whole system is divulged. We will give it
 but <em>one </em>turn, and thereby allow the profane one glimpse
 into the mystery. Happy he, who understands the whole!"
 </p><p>
 The same may be said of the whole Esoteric system. One turn of
 the key, and no more, was given in "Isis." Much more
 is explained in these volumes. In those days the writer hardly
 knew the language in which the work was written, and the disclosure
 of many things, freely spoken about now, was forbidden. In Century
 the Twentieth some disciple more informed, and far better fitted,
 may be sent by the Masters of Wisdom to give final and irrefutable
 proofs that there exists a Science called<em> Gupta-Vidya; </em>and
 that, like the once-mysterious sources of the Nile, the source
 of all religions and philosophies now known to the world has been
 for many ages forgotten and lost to men, but is at last found.
 </p><p>
 Such a work as this has to be introduced with no simple <em>Preface,
 </em>but with a volume rather; one that would give <em>facts,
 </em>not mere disquisitions, since the <strong>S</strong>ECRET
 <strong>D</strong>OCTRINE is not a treatise, or a series of vague
 theories, but contains all that can be given out to the world
 in this century.

 <p>
 portions of the esoteric teachings that have now escaped from
 confinement, unless the genuineness and authenticity -- at any
 rate, the <em>probability</em> -- of the existence of such teachings
 was first established. Such statements as will now be made, have
 to be shown warranted by various authorities: those of ancient
 philosophers, classics and even certain learned Church Fathers,
 some of whom knew these doctrines because they had studied them,
 had seen and read works written upon them; and some of whom had
 even been personally initiated into the ancient Mysteries, during
 the performance of which the arcane doctrines were allegorically
 enacted. The writer will have to give historical and trustworthy
 names, and to cite well-known authors, ancient and modern, of
 recognized ability, good judgment, and truthfulness, as also to
 name some of the famous proficients in the secret arts and science,
 along with the mysteries of the latter, as they are divulged,
 or, rather, <em>partially </em>presented before the public in
 their strange archaic form.
 </p><p>
 How is this to be done? What is the best way for achieving such
 an object? was the ever-recurring question. To make our plan clearer,
 an illustration may be attempted. When a tourist coming from a
 well-explored country, suddenly reaches the borderland of a <em>terra
 incognita, </em>hedged in, and shut out from view by a formidable
 barrier of impassable rocks, he may still refuse to acknowledge
 himself baffled in his exploratory plans. Ingress beyond is forbidden.
 But, if he cannot visit the mysterious region personally, he may
 still find a means of examining it from as short a distance as
 can be arrived at. Helped by his knowledge of landscapes left
 behind him, he can get a general and pretty correct idea of the
 transmural view, if he will only climb to the loftiest summit
 of the altitudes in front of him. Once there, he can gaze at it,
 at his leisure, comparing that which he dimly perceives with that
 which he has just left below, now that he is, thanks to his efforts,
 beyond the line of the mists and the cloud-capped cliffs.
 </p><p>
 Such a point of preliminary observation, for those who would like
 to get a more correct understanding of the mysteries of the pre-archaic
 periods given in the texts, cannot be offered to them in these
 two volumes. But if the reader has patience, and would glance
 at the present state of beliefs and creeds in Europe, compare
 and check it with what is known to history of the ages directly
 preceding and</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xl INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 following the Christian era, then he will find all this in Volume
 III. of this work.
 </p><p>
 In that volume a brief recapitulation will be made of all the
 principal adepts known to history, and the downfall of the mysteries
 will be described; after which began the disappearance and final
 and systematic elimination from the memory of men of the real
 nature of initiation and the Sacred Science. From that time its
 teachings became Occult, and Magic sailed but too often under
 the venerable but frequently misleading name of Hermetic philosophy.
 As real Occultism had been prevalent among the Mystics during
 the centuries that preceded our era, so Magic, or rather Sorcery,
 with its Occult Arts, followed the beginning of Christianity.
 </p><p>
 However great and zealous the fanatical efforts, during those
 early centuries, to obliterate every trace of the mental and intellectual
 labour of the Pagans, it was a failure; but the same spirit of
 the dark demon of bigotry and intolerance has perverted systematically
 and ever since, every bright page written in the pre-Christian
 periods. Even in her uncertain records, history has preserved
 enough of that which has survived to throw an impartial light
 upon the whole. Let, then, the reader tarry a little while with
 the writer, on the spot of observation selected. He is asked to
 give all his attention to that millennium which divided the pre-Christian
 and the <em>post</em>-Christian periods, by the year <strong>O</strong>NE
 of the Nativity. This event -- whether historically correct or
 not -- has nevertheless been made to serve as a first signal for
 the erection of manifold bulwarks against any possible return
 of, or even a glimpse into, the hated religions of the Past; hated
 and <em>dreaded -- </em>because throwing such a vivid light on
 the new and intentionally veiled interpretation of what is now
 known as the "New Dispensation."
 </p><p>
 However superhuman the efforts of the early Christian fathers
 to obliterate the Secret Doctrine from the very memory of man,
 they all failed. Truth can never be killed; hence the failure
 to sweep away entirely from the face of the earth every vestige
 of that ancient Wisdom, and to shackle and gag every witness who
 testified to it. Let one only think of the thousands, and perhaps
 millions, of <strong>MSS</strong>. burnt; of monuments, with their
 too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols, pulverised
 to dust; of the bands of early hermits and ascetics roaming about
 among the ruined cities of Upper and Lower Egypt, in desert and

 <p>
 mountain, valleys and highlands, seeking for and eager to destroy
 every obelisk and pillar, scroll or parchment they could lay their
 hands on, if it only bore the symbol of the <em>tau, </em>or any
 other sign borrowed and appropriated by the new faith; and he
 will then see plainly how it is that so little has remained of
 the records of the Past. Verily, the fiendish spirits of fanaticism,
 of early and mediaeval Christianity and of Islam, have from the
 first loved to dwell in darkness and ignorance; and both have
 made
 </p><blockquote>
 "-------------- the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,<br>
 The tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom!"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Both creeds have won their proselytes at the point of the sword;
 both have built their churches on <em>heaven-kissing hecatombs
 of human victims. </em>Over the gateway of Century I. of our era,
 the ominous words "the <strong>K</strong>ARMA OF <strong>I</strong>SRAEL,"
 fatally glowed. Over the portals of our own, the future seer may
 discern other words, that will point to the Karma for cunningly
 made-up <strong>H</strong>ISTORY, for events purposely perverted,
 and for great characters slandered by posterity, mangled out of
 recognition, between the two cars of Jagannatha -- Bigotry and
 Materialism; one accepting too much, the other denying all. Wise
 is he who holds to the golden mid-point, who believes in the eternal
 justice of things. Says Faigi Diwan, the "witness to the
 wonderful speeches of a free-thinker who belongs to a thousand
 sects": "In the assembly of the day of resurrection,
 when past things shall be forgiven, the sins of the Ka'bah will
 be forgiven for the sake of the dust of Christian churches."
 To this, Professor Max Muller replies: "The sins of Islam
 are <em>as worthless as the dust of Christianity. On the day of
 resurrection both Muhammadans and Christians will see the vanity
 of their religious doctrines. </em>Men fight about religion on
 earth -- in heaven they shall find out that there is only one
 true religion -- the worship of God's <strong>S</strong>PIRIT."*
 </p><p>
 In other words -- "<strong>T</strong>HERE IS NO RELIGION
 (OR LAW) HIGHER THAN TRUTH" -- "<strong>SATYAT NASTI
 PARO DHARMAH</strong>" -- the motto of the Maharajah of Benares,
 adopted by the Theosophical Society.
 </p><p>
 As already said in the <em>Preface, </em>the Secret Doctrine is
 not a version of "Isis Unveiled" -- as originally intended.
 It is a volume explanatory of

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 it rather, and, though entirely independent of the earlier work,
 an indispensable corollary to it. Much of what was in Isis could
 hardly be understood by theosophists in those days. The Secret
 Doctrine will now throw light on many a problem left unsolved
 in the first work, especially on the opening pages, which have
 never been understood.
 </p><p>
 Concerned simply with the philosophies within our historical times
 and the respective symbolism of the fallen nations, only a hurried
 glance could be thrown at the panorama of Occultism in the two
 volumes of Isis. In the present work, detailed Cosmogony and the
 evolution of the four races that preceded our Fifth race Humanity
 are given, and now two large volumes explain that which was stated
 on the first page of <strong>I</strong>SIS <strong>U</strong>NVEILED
 alone, and in a few allusions scattered hither and thither throughout
 that work. Nor could the vast catalogue of the Archaic Sciences
 be attempted in the present volumes, before we have disposed of
 such tremendous problems as Cosmic and Planetary Evolution, and
 the gradual development of the mysterious Humanities and races
 that preceded our "Adamic" Humanity. Therefore, the
 present attempt to elucidate some mysteries of the Esoteric philosophy
 has, in truth, nothing to do with the earlier work. As an instance,
 the writer must be allowed to illustrate what is said.
 </p><p>
 Volume I. of "Isis" begins with a reference to "an
 old book" --
 </p><blockquote>
 "So very old that our modern antiquarians might ponder over
 its pages an indefinite time, and still not quite agree as to
 the nature of the fabric upon which it is written. It is the only
 original copy now in existence. The most ancient Hebrew document
 on occult learning -- the<em> Siphrah Dzeniouta</em> --<em> </em>was
 compiled from it, and that at a time when the former was already
 considered in the light of a literary relic. One of its illustrations
 represents the Divine Essence emanating from <strong>A</strong>DAM*
 like a luminous arc proceeding to form a circle; and then, having
 attained the highest point of its circumference, the ineffable
 glory bends back again, and returns to earth, bringing a higher
 type of humanity in its vortex. As it approaches nearer and nearer
 to our planet, the Emanation becomes more and more shadowy, until
 upon touching the ground it is as black as night."
 </blockquote>

 <p>
 The "very old Book" is the original work from which
 the many volumes of <em>Kiu-ti </em>were compiled. Not only this
 latter and the <em>Siphrah Dzeniouta </em>but even the <em>Sepher
 Jezirah,* </em>the work attributed by the Hebrew Kabalists to
 their Patriarch Abraham (!), the book of <em>Shu-king, </em>China's
 primitive Bible, the sacred volumes of the Egyptian Thoth-Hermes,
 the Puranas in India, and the Chaldean <em>Book of Numbers </em>and<em>
 </em>the<em> Pentateuch </em>itself, are all derived from that
 one small parent volume. Tradition says, that it was taken down
 in <em>Senzar, </em>the secret sacerdotal tongue, from the words
 of the Divine Beings, who dictated it to the sons of Light, in
 Central Asia, at the very beginning of the 5th (our) race; for
 there was a time when its language (the <em>Sen-zar</em>)<em>
 </em>was known to the Initiates of every nation, when the forefathers
 of the Toltec understood it as easily as the inhabitants of the
 lost Atlantis, who inherited it, in their turn, from the sages
 of the 3rd Race, the <em>Manushis, </em>who learnt it direct from
 the <em>Devas </em>of the 2nd and 1st Races. The "illustration"
 spoken of in "Isis" relates to the evolution of these
 Races and of our 4th and 5th Race Humanity in the Vaivasvata Manvantara
 or "Round"; each Round being composed of the Yugas of
 the seven periods of Humanity; four of which are now passed in
 <em>our </em>life cycle, the middle point of the 5th being nearly
 reached. The illustration is symbolical, as every one can well
 understand, and covers the ground from the beginning. The old
 book, having described Cosmic Evolution and explained the origin
 of everything on earth, including physical man, after giving the
 true history of the races from the <em>First </em>down to the
 Fifth (our) race, goes no further. It stops short at the beginning
 of the <em>Kali Yuga </em>just 4989 years ago at the death of
 Krishna, the bright "Sun-god," the once living hero
 and reformer.
 </p><p>
 But there exists another book. None of its possessors regard it
 as very ancient, as it was born with, and is only as old as the
 Black Age,

 <p>
 * Rabbi Jehoshua Ben Chananea, who died about <strong>A.D</strong>.
 72, openly declared that he had performed "miracles"
 by means of the <em>Book of Sepher Jezireh, </em>and challenged
 every sceptic. Franck, quoting from the Babylonian Talmud, names
 two other thaumaturgists, Rabbis Chanina and Oshoi. (See "<em>Jerusalem
 Talmud, Sanhedrin," </em>c. 7, etc.; and "<em>Franck,</em>"<em>
 pp. </em>55, 56.) Many of the Mediaeval Occultists, Alchemists,
 and Kabalists claimed the same; and even the late modern <em>Magus,
 </em>Eliphas Levi, publicly asserts it in print in his books on
 Magic.</p><hr>

 <p>
 namely, about 5,000 years. In about nine years hence, the first
 cycle of the first five millenniums, that began with the great
 cycle of the Kali-Yuga, will end. And then the last prophecy contained
 in that book (the first volume of the prophetic record for the
 Black Age) will be accomplished. We have not long to wait, and
 many of us will witness the Dawn of the New Cycle, at the end
 of which not a few accounts will be settled and squared between
 the races. Volume II. of the Prophecies is nearly ready, having
 been in preparation since the time of Buddha's grand successor,
 Sankaracharya.
 </p><p>
 One more important point must be noticed, one that stands foremost
 in the series of proofs given of the existence of one primeval,
 universal Wisdom -- at any rate for the Christian Kabalists and
 students. The teachings were, at least, partially known to several
 of the Fathers of the Church. It is maintained, on purely historical
 grounds, that Origen, Synesius, and even Clemens Alexandrinus,
 had been themselves initiated into the mysteries before adding
 to the Neo-Platonism of the Alexandrian school, that of the Gnostics,
 under the Christian veil. More than this, some of the doctrines
 of the Secret schools -- though by no means all -- were preserved
 in the Vatican, and have since become part and parcel of the mysteries,
 in the shape of disfigured additions made to the original Christian
 programme by the Latin Church. Such is the now materialised dogma
 of the Immaculate Conception. This accounts for the great persecutions
 set on foot by the Roman Catholic Church against Occultism, Masonry,
 and <em>heterodox </em>mysticism generally.
 </p><p>
 The days of Constantine were the last turning-point in history,
 the period of the Supreme struggle that ended in the Western world
 throttling the old religions in favour of the new one, built on
 their bodies. From thence the vista into the far distant Past,
 beyond the "Deluge" and the Garden of Eden, began to
 be forcibly and relentlessly closed by every fair and unfair means
 against the indiscreet gaze of posterity. Every issue was blocked
 up, every record that hands could be laid upon, destroyed. Yet
 there remains enough, even among such mutilated records, to warrant
 us in saying that there is in them every possible evidence of
 the actual existence of a Parent Doctrine. Fragments have survived
 geological and political cataclysms to tell the story; and every
 survival shows evidence that the now <em>Secret </em>Wisdom was
 once the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlv INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 one fountain head, the ever-flowing perennial source, at which
 were fed all its streamlets -- the later religions of all nations
 -- from the first down to the last. This period, beginning with
 Buddha and Pythagoras at the one end and the Neo-Platonists and
 Gnostics at the other, is the only focus left in History wherein
 converge for the last time the bright rays of light streaming
 from the aeons of time gone by, unobscured by the hand of bigotry
 and fanaticism.
 </p><p>
 This accounts for the necessity under which the writer has laboured
 to be ever explaining the facts given from the hoariest Past by
 evidence gathered from the historical period. No other means was
 at hand, at the risk even of being once more charged with a lack
 of method and system. The public must be made acquainted with
 the efforts of many World-adepts, of initiated poets, writers,
 and classics of every age, to preserve in the records of Humanity
 the Knowledge of the existence, at least, of such a philosophy,
 if not actually of its tenets. The Initiates of 1888 would indeed
 remain incomprehensible and ever a seemingly impossible myth,
 were not like Initiates shown to have lived in every other age
 of history. This could be done only by naming Chapter and Verse
 where may be found mention of these great characters, who were
 preceded and followed by a long and interminable line of other
 famous Antediluvian and Post-diluvian Masters in the arts. Thus
 only could be shown, on semi-traditional and semi-historical authority,
 that knowledge of the Occult and the powers it confers on man,
 are not altogether fictions, but that they are as old as the world
 itself.
 </p><p>
 To my judges, past and future, therefore -- whether they are serious
 literary critics, or those howling dervishes in literature who
 judge a book according to the popularity or unpopularity of the
 author's name, who, hardly glancing at its contents, fasten like
 lethal <em>bacilli </em>on the weakest points of the body -- I
 have nothing to say. Nor shall I condescend to notice those crack-brained
 slanderers -- fortunately very few in number -- who, hoping to
 attract public attention by throwing discredit on every writer
 whose name is better known than their own, foam and bark at their
 very shadows. These, having first maintained for years that the
 doctrines taught in the <em>Theosophist, </em>and which culminated
 in "Esoteric Buddhism," <em>had been all invented by
 the present writer</em>, have finally turned round, and denounced
 "Isis Unveiled" and the rest as a plagiarism from Eliphas
 Levi (!), Paracelsus (!!), and, <em>mirabile</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlvi INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>dictu, </em>Buddhism and Brahmanism (!!!) As well charge Renan
 with having stolen his <em>Vie de Jesus </em>from the Gospels,
 and Max Muller his "Sacred Books of the East" or his
 "Chips" from the philosophies of the Brahmins and Gautama,
 the Buddha. But to the public in general and the readers of the
 "Secret Doctrine" I may repeat what I have stated all
 along, and which I now clothe in the words of Montaigne: Gentlemen,
 "<strong>I</strong> HAVE HERE MADE ONLY A NOSEGAY OF CULLED
 FLOWERS, AND HAVE BROUGHT NOTHING OF MY OWN BUT THE STRING THAT
 TIES THEM."
 </p><p>
 Pull the "string" to pieces and cut it up in shreds,
 if you will. As for the nosegay of FACTS -- you will never be
 able to make away with these. You can only ignore them, and no
 more.
 </p><p>
 We may close with a parting word concerning this Volume I. In
 an <strong>I</strong>NTRODUCTION prefacing a Part dealing chiefly
 with Cosmogony, certain subjects brought forward might be deemed
 out of place, but one more consideration added to those already
 given have led me to touch upon them. Every reader will inevitably
 judge the statements made from the stand-point of his own knowledge,
 experience, and consciousness, based on what he has already learnt.
 This fact the writer is constantly obliged to bear in mind: hence,
 also the frequent references in this first Book to matters which,
 properly speaking, belong to a later part of the work, but which
 could not be passed by in silence, lest the reader should look
 down on this work as a fairy tale indeed -- a fiction of some
 modern brain.
 </p><p>
 Thus, the <em>Past </em>shall help to realise the <strong>P</strong>RESENT,
 and the latter to better appreciate the <strong>P</strong>AST.
 The errors of the day must be explained and swept away, yet it
 is more than probable -- and in the present case it amounts to
 certitude -- that once more the testimony of long ages and of
 history will fail to impress anyone but the very intuitional --
 which is equal to saying the very few. But in this as in all like
 cases, the <em>true </em>and the <em>faithful </em>may console
 themselves by presenting the sceptical modern Sadducee with the
 mathematical proof and memorial of his obdurate obstinacy and
 bigotry. There still exists somewhere in the archives of the French
 Academy, the famous law of probabilities worked out by an algebraical
 process for the benefit of sceptics by certain mathematicians.
 It runs thus: If two persons give their evidence to</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlvii INTRODUCTORY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 a fact, and thus impart to it each of them 5/6 of certitude; that
 fact will have then 35/36 of certitude; <em>i.e.</em>, its probability
 will bear to its improbability the ratio of 35 to 1. If three
 such evidences are joined together the certitude will become 215/216.
 The agreement of ten persons giving each 1/2 of certitude will
 produce 1023/1024 , etc., etc. The Occultist may remain satisfied,
 and care for no more.</p><hr>
