 </p><h4>COMMENTARY.</h4>
 
 <p>
 (<em>a</em>) This is, perhaps, the most difficult of all the Stanzas
 to explain. Its language is comprehensible only to him who is
 thoroughly versed in Eastern allegory and its purposely obscure
 phraseology. The question will surely be asked, "Do the Occultists
 believe in all these 'Builders,' 'Lipika,' and 'Sons of Light'
 as Entities, or are they merely imageries?" To this the answer
 is given as plainly: "After due allowance for the imagery
 of personified Powers, we must admit the existence of these Entities,
 if we would not reject the existence of spiritual humanity within
 physical mankind. For the hosts of these Sons of Light and 'Mind-born
 Sons' of the first manifested Ray of the <strong>U</strong>NKNOWN
 <strong>A</strong>LL, are the very root of spiritual man."
 Unless we want to believe the unphilosophical dogma of a specially
 created soul for every human birth -- a fresh supply of these
 pouring in daily, since "Adam" -- we have to admit the
 occult teachings. This will be explained in its place. Let us
 see, now, what may be the occult meaning of this Stanza.
 </p><p>
 The Doctrine teaches that, in order to become a divine, fully
 conscious god, -- aye, even the highest -- the Spiritual primeval
 <strong>I</strong>NTELLIGENCES must pass through the human stage.
 And when we say human, this does not apply merely to our terrestrial
 humanity, but to the mortals that inhabit any world, <em>i.e.</em>,
 to those Intelligences that have reached the appropriate equilibrium
 between matter and spirit, as <i>we </i>have now, since the middle
 point of the Fourth Root Race of the Fourth Round was passed.
 Each Entity must have won for itself the right of becoming divine,
 through self-experience. Hegel, the great German thinker, must
 have known or sensed intuitionally this truth when saying, as
 he did, that the Unconscious evolved the Universe only "in
 the hope of attaining clear self-consciousness," of becoming,
 in other words, MAN; for this is also the secret meaning of the
 usual Puranic phrase about</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 107 NO MAN -- NO GOD.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Brahma being constantly "moved by the desire to create."
 This explains also the hidden Kabalistic meaning of the saying:
 "The <em>Breath </em>becomes a stone; the stone, a plant;
 the plant, an animal; the animal, a man; the man, a spirit; and
 the spirit, a god." The Mind-born Sons, the Rishis, the Builders,
 etc., were all men -- of whatever forms and shapes -- in other
 worlds and the preceding Manvantaras.
 </p><p>
 This subject, being so very mystical, is therefore the most difficult
 to explain in all its details and bearings; since the whole mystery
 of evolutionary creation is contained in it. A sentence or two
 in it vividly recalls to mind similar ones in the Kabala and the
 phraseology of the King Psalmist (civ.), as both, when speaking
 of God, show him making the wind his messenger and his "ministers
 a flaming fire." But in the Esoteric doctrine it is used
 figuratively. The "fiery Wind" is the incandescent Cosmic
 dust which only follows magnetically, as the iron filings follow
 the magnet, the directing thought of the "Creative Forces."
 Yet, this cosmic dust is something more; for every atom in the
 Universe has the potentiality of self-consciousness in it, and
 is, like the Monads of Leibnitz, a Universe in itself, and <em>for
 </em>itself.<em> It is an atom and an angel.</em> 
 </p><p>
 In this connection it should be noted that one of the luminaries
 of the modern Evolutionist School, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussing
 the inadequacy of "natural selection" as the sole factor
 in the development of physical man, practically concedes the whole
 point here discussed. He holds that the evolution of man was directed
 and furthered by superior Intelligences, whose agency is a necessary
 factor in the scheme of Nature. But once the operation of these
 Intelligences is admitted in one place, it is only a logical deduction
 to extend it still further. No hard and fast line can be drawn.

 LIFTS HIS VOICE, AND CALLS THE INNUMERABLE SPARKS (<em>atoms</em>)<em>
 </em>AND<em> </em>JOINS THEM TOGETHER (<em>c</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) This shows the "Primordial Seven" using
 for their <em>Vahan </em>(vehicle, or the manifested subject which
 becomes the symbol of the Power directing it), Fohat, called in
 consequence, the "Messenger of their will" -- the fiery
 whirlwind.
 </p><p>
 "Dzyu becomes Fohat" -- the expression itself shows
 it. Dzyu is the one real (magical) knowledge, or Occult Wisdom;
 which, dealing with eternal truths and primal causes, becomes
 almost omnipotence when applied in the right direction. Its antithesis
 is Dzyu-mi, that which deals with illusions and false appearances
 only, as in our exoteric modern sciences. In this case, Dzyu is
 the expression of the collective Wisdom of the Dhyani-Buddhas.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>As the reader is supposed not to be acquainted
 with the Dhyani-Buddhas, it is as well to say at once that, <em>according
 to the Orientalists</em>,<em> </em>there are five Dhyanis who
 are the "celestial" Buddhas, of whom the human Buddhas
 are the manifestations in the world of form and matter. Esoterically,
 however, the Dhyani-Buddhas are seven, of whom five only have
 hitherto manifested,* and two are to come in the sixth and seventh
 Root-races. They are, so to speak, the eternal prototypes of the
 Buddhas who appear on this earth, each of whom has his particular
 divine prototype. So, for instance, Amitabha is the Dhyani-Buddha
 of Gautama Sakyamuni, manifesting through him whenever this great
 Soul incarnates on earth as He did in Tzon-kha-pa.** As the synthesis
 of the seven Dhyani-Buddhas, Avalokiteswara was the first Buddha
 (the Logos), so Amitabha is the inner "God" of Gautama,
 who, in China, is called Amita(-Buddha). They are, as Mr. Rhys
 Davids

 <p>
 correctly states, "the glorious counterparts in the mystic
 world, free from the debasing conditions of this material life"
 of every earthly mortal Buddha -- the liberated Manushi-Buddhas
 appointed to govern the Earth in this Round. They are the "Buddhas
 of Contemplation," and are all Anupadaka (parentless), <em>i.e.</em>,
 self-born of divine essence. The exoteric teaching which says
 that every Dhyani-Buddha has the faculty of creating from himself,
 an equally celestial son -- a Dhyani-Bodhisattva -- who, after
 the decease of the Manushi (human) Buddha, has to carry out the
 work of the latter, rests on the fact that owing to the highest
 initiation performed by one overshadowed by the "Spirit of
 Buddha" -- (who is credited by the Orientalists with having
 created the five Dhyani-Buddhas!), -- a candidate becomes virtually
 a Bodhisattva, created such by the High Initiator.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) Fohat, being one of the most, if not the most important
 character in esoteric Cosmogony, should be minutely described.
 As in the oldest Grecian Cosmogony, differing widely from the
 later mythology, Eros is the third person in the primeval trinity:
 Chaos, Gaea, Eros: answering to the Kabalistic En-Soph (for Chaos
 is SPACE, [[<em><b>C</b>haino</em>]], "void") the Boundless
 <strong>A</strong>LL, Shekinah and the Ancient of Days, or the
 Holy Ghost; so Fohat is one thing in the yet unmanifested Universe
 and another in the phenomenal and Cosmic World. In the latter,
 he is that Occult, electric, vital power, which, under the Will
 of the Creative Logos, unites and brings together all forms, giving
 them the first impulse which becomes in time law. But in the unmanifested
 Universe, Fohat is no more this, than Eros is the later brilliant
 winged Cupid, or <strong>L</strong>OVE. Fohat has naught to do
 with Kosmos yet, since Kosmos is not born, and the gods still
 sleep in the bosom of "Father-Mother." He is an abstract
 philosophical idea. He produces nothing yet by himself; he is
 simply that potential creative power in virtue of whose action
 the <strong>N</strong>OUMENON of all future phenomena divides,
 so to speak, but to reunite in a mystic supersensuous act, and
 emit the creative ray. When the "Divine Son" breaks
 forth, then Fohat becomes the propelling force, the active Power
 which causes the <strong>O</strong>NE to become <strong>T</strong>WO
 and <strong>T</strong>HREE -- on the Cosmic plane of manifestation.
 The triple One differentiates into the many, and then Fohat is
 transformed into that force which brings together the elemental
 atoms and makes them aggregate and combine. We find an echo of
 this primeval teaching</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 110 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 in early Greek mythology. Erebos and Nux are born out of Chaos,
 and, under the action of Eros, give birth in their turn to Ether
 and Hemera, the light of the superior and the light of the inferior
 or terrestrial regions. Darkness generates light. See in the Puranas
 Brahma's "Will" or desire to create; and in the Phoenician
 Cosmogony of Sanchoniathon the doctrine that Desire, [[<em>pothos</em>]],
 is the principle of creation.
 </p><p>
 Fohat is closely related to the "ONE LIFE." From the
 Unknown One, the Infinite TOTALITY, the manifested ONE, or the
 periodical, Manvantaric Deity, emanates; and this is the Universal
 Mind, which, separated from its Fountain-Source, is the Demiurgos
 or the creative Logos of the Western Kabalists, and the four-faced
 Brahma of the Hindu religion. In its totality, viewed from the
 standpoint of manifested Divine Thought in the esoteric doctrine,
 it represents the Hosts of the higher creative Dhyan Chohans.
 Simultaneously with the evolution of the Universal Mind, the concealed
 Wisdom of Adi-Buddha -- the One Supreme and eternal -- manifests
 itself as Avalokiteshwara (or manifested Iswara), which is the
 Osiris of the Egyptians, the Ahura-Mazda of the Zoroastrians,
 the Heavenly Man of the Hermetic philosopher, the Logos of the
 Platonists, and the Atman of the Vedantins.* By the action of
 the manifested Wisdom, or Mahat, represented by these innumerable
 centres of spiritual Energy in the Kosmos, the reflection of the
 Universal Mind, which is Cosmic Ideation and the intellectual
 Force accompanying such ideation, becomes objectively the Fohat
 of the Buddhist esoteric philosopher. Fohat, running along the
 seven principles of <strong>A</strong>KASA, acts upon manifested
 substance or the One Element, as declared above, and by differentiating
 it into various centres of Energy, sets in motion the law of Cosmic
 Evolution, which, in obedience to the Ideation of the Universal
 Mind, brings into existence all the various states of being in
 the manifested Solar System.
 </p><p>
 The Solar System, brought into existence by these agencies, consists
 of Seven Principles, like everything else within these centres.
 Such is the teaching of the trans-Himalayan Esotericism. Every
 philosophy, however, has its own way of dividing these principles.

 <p>
 Fohat, then, is the personified electric vital power, the transcendental
 binding Unity of all Cosmic Energies, on the unseen as on the
 manifested planes, the action of which resembles -- on an immense
 scale -- that of a living Force created by WILL, in those phenomena
 where the seemingly subjective acts on the seemingly objective
 and propels it to action. Fohat is not only the living Symbol
 and Container of that Force, but is looked upon by the Occultists
 as an Entity -- the forces he acts upon being cosmic, human and
 terrestrial, and exercising their influence on all those planes
 respectively. On the earthly plane his influence is felt in the
 magnetic and active force generated by the strong desire of the
 magnetizer. On the Cosmic, it is present in the constructive power
 that carries out, in the formation of things -- from the planetary
 system down to the glow-worm and simple daisy -- the plan in the
 mind of nature, or in the Divine Thought, with regard to the development
 and growth of that special thing. He is, metaphysically, the objectivised
 thought of the gods; the "Word made flesh," on a lower
 scale, and the messenger of Cosmic and human ideations: the active
 force in Universal Life. In his secondary aspect, Fohat is the
 Solar Energy, the electric vital fluid,* and the preserving fourth

 * In 1882 the President of the Theosophical Society, Col. Olcott,
 was taken to task for asserting in one of his lectures that Electricity
 is matter. Such, nevertheless, is the teaching of the Occult Doctrine.
 "Force," "Energy," may be a better name for
 it, so long as European Science knows so little about its true
 nature; yet matter it is, as much as Ether is matter, since it
 is as atomic, though several removes from the latter. It seems
 ridiculous to argue that because a thing is imponderable to Science,
 therefore it cannot be called matter. Electricity is "immaterial"
 in the sense that its molecules are not subject to perception
 and experiment; yet it may be -- and Occultism says it is -- atomic;
 therefore it is matter. But even supposing it were unscientific
 to speak of it in such terms, once Electricity is called in Science
 a source of Energy, Energy simply, and a Force -- where is that
 Force or that Energy which can be thought of without thinking
 of matter? Maxwell, a mathematician and one of the greatest authorities
 upon Electricity and its phenomena, said, years ago, that Electricity
 was matter, not motion merely. "If we accept the hypothesis
 that the elementary substances are composed of atoms we cannot
 avoid concluding that electricity also, positive as well as negative,
 is divided into definite elementary portions, which behave like
 atoms of electricity." (Helmholtz, <em>Faraday Lecture, </em>1881).
 We will go further than that, and assert that Electricity is not
 only Substance but that it is an emanation from an Entity, which
 is neither God nor Devil, but one of the numberless Entities that
 rule and guide our world according to the eternal Law of <strong>K</strong>ARMA.

 principle, the animal Soul of Nature, so to say, or -- Electricity.
 In India, Fohat is connected with Vishnu and Surya in the early
 character of the (first) God; for Vishnu is not a high god in
 the Rig Veda. The name Vishnu is from the root <em>vish</em>,<em>
 </em>"to pervade," and Fohat is called the "Pervader"
 and the Manufacturer, because he shapes the atoms from crude material.*
 In the sacred texts of the Rig Veda, Vishnu, also, is "a
 manifestation of the Solar Energy," and he is described as
 striding through the Seven regions of the Universe in three steps,
 the Vedic God having little in common with the Vishnu of later
 times. Therefore the two are identical in this particular feature,
 and one is the copy of the other.
 </p><p>
 The "three and seven" strides refer to the Seven spheres
 inhabited by man, of the esoteric Doctrine, as well as to the
 Seven regions of the Earth. Notwithstanding the frequent objections
 made by would-be Orientalists, the Seven Worlds or spheres of
 our planetary chain are distinctly referred to in the exoteric
 Hindu scriptures. But how strangely all these numbers are connected
 with like numbers in other Cosmogonies and with their symbols,
 can be seen from comparisons and parallelisms made by students
 of old religions. The "three strides of Vishnu" through
 the "seven regions of the Universe," of the Rig Veda,
 have been variously explained by commentators as meaning "fire,
 lightning and the Sun" cosmically; and as having been taken
 in the Earth, the atmosphere, and the sky; also as the "three
 steps" of the dwarf (Vishnu's incarnation), though more philosophically
 -- and in the astronomical sense, very correctly -- they are explained
 by Aurnavabha as being the various positions of the sun, rising,
 noon, and setting. Esoteric philosophy alone explains it clearly,
 and the Zohar laid it down very philosophically and comprehensively.
 It is said and plainly demonstrated therein that in the beginning
 the Elohim (Elhim) were called Echod, "one," or the
 "Deity is one in many," a very simple idea in a pantheistic
 conception (in its philosophical sense, of course). Then came
 the change, "Jehovah is Elohim," thus unifying the multiplicity
 and taking the first step towards Monotheism. Now to the query,
 "How is Jehovah Elohim?" the answer is, "By three
 Steps" from below.

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 113 THE CORRELATION OF THE GODS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The meaning is plain.* They are all symbols, and emblematic, mutually
 and correlatively, of Spirit, Soul and Body (MAN); of the circle
 transformed into Spirit, the Soul of the World, and its body (or
 Earth). Stepping out of the Circle of Infinity, that no man comprehendeth,
 Ain-Soph (the Kabalistic synonym for Parabrahm, for the Zeroana
 Akerne, of the Mazdeans, or for any other "<strong>U</strong>NKNOWABLE")
 becomes "One" -- the <strong>E</strong>CHOD, the <strong>E</strong>KA,
 the <strong>A</strong>HU -- then he (or it) is transformed by
 evolution into the One in many, the Dhyani-Buddhas or the Elohim,
 or again the Amshaspends, his third Step being taken into generation
 of the flesh, or "Man." And from man, or Jah-Hova, "male
 female," the <em>inner </em>divine entity becomes, on the
 metaphysical plane, once more the Elohim.
 </p><p>
 The Kabalistic idea is identical with the Esotericism of the Archaic
 period. This esotericism is the common property of all, and belongs
 neither to the Aryan 5th Race, nor to any of its numerous Sub-races.
 It cannot be claimed by the Turanians, so-called, the Egyptians,
 Chinese, Chaldeans, nor any of the Seven divisions of the Fifth
 Root Race, but really belongs to the Third and Fourth Root Races,
 whose descendants we find in the Seed of the Fifth, the earliest
 Aryans. The Circle was with every nation the symbol of the Unknown
 -- "Boundless Space," the abstract garb of an ever present
 abstraction -- the Incognisable Deity. It represents limitless
 Time in Eternity. The Zeroana Akerne is also the "Boundless
 Circle of the Unknown Time," from which Circle issues the
 radiant light -- the Universal <strong>S</strong>UN, or Ormazd**
 -- and the latter

 * The numbers 3, 5, and 7 are prominent in speculative masonry,
 as shown in "Isis." A mason writes: -- "There are
 the 3, 5,<em> </em>and 7 steps to show a circular walk. The three
 faces of 3, 3; 5,<em> </em>3; and 7, 3; etc., etc. Sometimes it
 comes in this form -- 753/2 = 376.5 and 7635/2 = 3817.5 and the
 ratio of 20612/6561 feet for cubit measure gives the Great Pyramid
 measures," etc., etc. Three, five and seven are mystical
 numbers, and the last and the first are as greatly honoured by
 Masons as by the Parsis -- the triangle being a symbol of Deity
 everywhere. (See the <em>Masonic Cyclopedia</em>, and<em> </em>"<em>Pythagorean
 Triangle</em>,"<em> </em>Oliver.) As a matter of course,
 doctors of divinity (Cassel, for instance) show the Zohar explaining
 and supporting the Christian trinity (!). It is the latter, however,
 that had its origin from the <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="MIDDLE">
 of the Heathen, in the Archaic Occultism and Symbology. The three
 strides relate metaphysically to the descent of Spirit into matter,
 of the Logos falling as a ray into the Spirit, then into the Soul,
 and finally into the human physical form of man, in which it becomes
 <strong>L</strong>IFE.

 is identical with Kronos, in his AEolian form, that of a Circle.
 For the circle is Sar, and Saros, or cycle, and was the Babylonian
 god whose circular horizon was the visible symbol of the invisible,
 while the sun was the ONE Circle from which proceeded the Cosmic
 orbs, and of which he was considered the leader. Zero-ana, is
 the Chakra or circle of Vishnu, the mysterious emblem which is,
 according to the definition of a mystic, "a curve of such
 a nature that as to any, the least possible part thereof, if the
 curve be protracted either way it will proceed and finally re-enter
 upon itself, and form one and the same curve -- or that which
 we call the circle." No better definition could thus be given
 of the natural symbol and the evident nature of Deity, which having
 its circumference everywhere (the boundless) has, therefore, its
 central point also everywhere; in other words, is in every point
 of the Universe. The invisible Deity is thus also the Dhyan Chohans,
 or the Rishis, the primitive seven, and the nine, without, and
 ten, including, their synthetical unit; from which IT steps into
 Man. Returning to the Commentary (4) of Stanza IV. the reader
 will understand why, while the trans-Himalayan Chakra has inscribed
 within it <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="MIDDLE"> | <img src="sd1-114a.jpg" align="MIDDLE">
 | <img src="sd1-114b.jpg" align="MIDDLE"> (triangle, first line,
 cube second line, and a pentacle with a dot in the centre thus:
 <img src="sd1-114b.jpg" align="MIDDLE">, and some other variations),
 the Kabalistic circle of the Elohim reveals, when the letters
 of the word <img src="sd1-144c.gif" align="MIDDLE"> (Alhim or
 Elohim) are numerically read, the famous numerals 13514, or by
 anagram 31415 -- the astronomical <i> </i>(pi) number, or the
 hidden meaning of Dhyani-Buddhas, of the Gebers, the Geborim,
 the Kabeiri, and the Elohim, all signifying "great men,"
 "Titans," "Heavenly Men," and, on earth, "the
 giants."
 </p><p>
 The Seven was a Sacred Number with every nation; but none applied
 it to more physiologically materialistic uses than the Hebrews.
 With these it was pre-eminently the generative number and 9 the
 male causative one, forming as shown by the Kabalists the <img src="sd1-144d.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 or <em>otz</em> -- "the Tree of the Garden of Eden,"*
 the "double hermaphrodite rod" of the fourth race. Whereas

 <p>
 and astronomical truths.* Their Rishis and gods, their Demons
 and Heroes, have historical and ethical meanings, and the Aryans
 never made their religion rest solely on physiological symbols,
 as the old Hebrews have done. This is found in the exoteric Hindu
 Scriptures. That these accounts are blinds is shown by their contradicting
 each other, a different construction being found in almost every
 Purana and epic poem. Read esoterically -- they will all yield
 the same meaning. Thus one account enumerates Seven worlds, exclusive
 of the nether worlds, also seven in number; these fourteen upper
 and nether worlds have

 * We are told by a Kabalist, who in a work not yet published contrasts
 the Kabala and Zohar with Aryan Esotericism, that "The Hebrew
 clear, short, terse and exact modes far and beyond measure surpass
 the toddling word-talk of the Hindus -- just as by parallelisms
 the Psalmist says, 'My mouth speaks with my tongue, I know not
 thy numbers' (lxxi., 15). <em>. </em>. . The Hindu Glyph shows
 by its insufficiency in the large admixture of adventitious sides
 the same borrowed plumage that the Greeks (the lying Greeks) had,
 and that Masonry has: which in the rough monosyllabic (and apparent)
 poverty of the Hebrew, shows the latter to have come down from
 a far more remote antiquity than any of these, and to have been
 the source (!?), or nearer the old original source than any of
 them." This is entirely erroneous. Our learned brother and
 correspondent judges apparently the Hindu religious systems by
 their Shastras and Puranas, probably the latter, and in their
 modern translation moreover, which is disfigured out of all recognition,
 by the Orientalists. It is to their philosophical systems that
 one has to turn, to their esoteric teaching, if he would make
 a point of comparison. No doubt the symbology of the Pentateuch
 and even of the New Testament, comes from the same source. But
 surely the Pyramid of Cheops, whose measurements are all found
 repeated by Professor Piazzi Smythe in Solomon's alleged and mythical
 temple, is not of a later date than the Mosaic books? Hence, if
 there is any such great identity as claimed, it must be due to
 servile copying on the part of the Jews, not on that of the Egyptians.
 The Jewish glyphs -- and even their language, the Hebrew -- are
 not original. They are borrowed from the Egyptians, from whom
 Moses got his Wisdom; from the Coptic, the probable kinsman, if
 not parent, of the old Phoenician and from the Hyksos, their (alleged)
 ancestors, as Josephus shows in his "<em>Against Apion</em>,"<em>
 </em>I.<em>, </em>25. Aye; but who are the Hyksos shepherds? And
 who the Egyptians? History knows nothing of the question, and
 speculates and theorizes out of the depths of the respective consciousnesses
 of her historians. (<em>See Isis Unveiled</em>,<em> </em>vol.
 II., p. 430-438.) "Khamism, or old Coptic," says Bunsen,
 "is from Western Asia, and contains some germ of the Semitic,
 thus bearing witness to the primitive cognate unity of the Aryan
 and Semitic races"; and he places the great events in Egypt
 9,000 years <strong>B.C</strong>. The fact is that in archaic
 Esotericism and Aryan thought we find a grand philosophy, whereas
 in the Hebrew records we find only the most surprising ingenuity
 in inventing apotheoses for phallic worship and sexual theogony.

 nothing to do with the classification of the septenary chain and
 belong to the purely aethereal, invisible worlds. These will be
 noticed elsewhere. Suffice for the present to show that they are
 purposely referred to as though they belonged to the chain. "Another
 enumeration calls the Seven worlds -- earth, sky, heaven, middle
 region, place of birth, mansion of the blest, and abode of truth;
 placing the 'Sons of Brahma' in the sixth division, and stating
 the fifth, or Jana Loka, to be that where animals destroyed in
 the general conflagration are born again." (see<em> Hindu
 Classical Dictionary.</em>)<em> </em>Some real esoteric teaching
 is given in the "Symbolism." He who is prepared for
 it will understand the hidden meaning.

 (<em>a</em>) "Wheels," as already explained, are the
 centres of force, around which primordial Cosmic matter expands,
 and, passing through all the six stages of consolidation, becomes
 spheroidal and ends by being transformed into globes or spheres.
 It is one of the fundamental dogmas of Esoteric Cosmogony, that
 during the Kalpas (or aeons) of life, MOTION, which, during the
 periods of Rest "pulsates and thrills through every slumbering
 atom"* (Commentary on Dzyan), assumes an evergrowing

 *It may be asked, as also the writer has not failed to ask, "Who
 is there to ascertain the difference in that motion, since all
 nature is reduced to its primal essence, and there can be no one
 -- not even one of the Dhyani-Chohans, who are all in Nirvana
 -- to see it?" The answer to this is: "Everything in
 Nature has to be judged by analogy. Though the highest Deities
 (Archangels or Dhyani-Buddhas) are unable to penetrate the mysteries
 too far beyond our planetary system and the visible Kosmos, yet
 there were great seers and prophets in olden times who were enabled
 to perceive the mystery of Breath and Motion retrospectively,
 when the systems of worlds were at rest and plunged in their periodic
 sleep."</p><hr>

 tendency, from the first awakening of Kosmos to a new "Day,"
 to circular movement. The "Deity becomes a WHIRLWIND."
 They are also called Rotae -- the moving wheels of the celestial
 orbs participating in the world's creation -- when the meaning
 refers to the animating principle of the stars and planets; for
 in the Kabala, they are represented by the Ophanim, the Angels
 of the Spheres and stars, of which they are the informing Souls.

 This law of vortical movement in primordial matter, is one of
 the oldest conceptions of Greek philosophy, whose first historical
 Sages were nearly all Initiates of the Mysteries. The Greeks had
 it from the Egyptians, and the latter from the Chaldeans, who
 had been the pupils of Brahmins of the esoteric school. Leucippus,
 and Democritus of Abdera -- the pupil of the Magi -- taught that
 this gyratory movement of the atoms and spheres existed from eternity.*
 Hicetas, Heraclides, Ecphantus, Pythagoras, and all his pupils,
 taught the rotation of the earth; and Aryabhata of India, Aristarchus,
 Seleucus, and Archimedes calculated its revolution as scientifically
 as the astronomers do now; while the theory of the Elemental Vortices
 was known to Anaxagoras, and maintained by him 500 years B.C.,
 or nearly 2,000 before it was taken up by Galileo, Descartes,
 Swedenborg, and finally, with slight modifications, by Sir W.
 Thomson. (See his<em> </em>"<em>Vortical Atoms.</em>")<em>
 </em>All such knowledge, if justice be only done to it, is an
 echo of the archaic doctrine, an attempt to explain which is now
 being made. How men of the last few centuries have come to the
 same ideas and conclusions that were taught as axiomatic truths
 in the secrecy of the Adyta dozens of

 *"The doctrine of the rotation of the earth about an axis
 is taught by the Pythagorean Hicetas, probably as early as 500
 <strong>B.C</strong>. It was also taught by his pupil Ecphantus,
 and by Heraclides, a pupil of Plato. The immobility of the Sun
 and the orbital rotation of the earth were shown by Aristarchus
 of Samos as early as 281 <strong>B.C</strong>. to be suppositions
 accordant with facts of observation. The Heliocentric theory was
 taught about 150 <strong>B.C</strong>., by Seleucus of Seleucia
 on the Tigris. -- [It was taught 500 <strong>B.C</strong>. by
 Pythagoras. -- <strong>H. P. B</strong>.] It is said also that
 Archimedes, in a work entitled Psammites, inculcated the Heliocentric
 theory. The sphericity of the earth was distinctly taught by Aristotle,
 who appealed for proof to the figure of the Earth's shadow on
 the moon in eclipses (Aristotle, De Coelo, lib. II, cap. XIV.).
 The same idea was defended by Pliny (Nat. Hist., II., 65). These
 views seem to have been lost from knowledge for more than a thousand
 years. . . <em>.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Comparative Geology</em>,

 millenniums ago, is a question that is treated separately. Some
 were led to it by the natural progress in physical science and
 by independent observation; others -- such as Copernicus, Swedenborg,

 knowledge far more to intuitive than to acquired ideas, developed
 in the usual way by a course of study.* (See "A Mystery about

 is Solomon's seal, and the Sri-Antara of the Brahmins.

 * That Swedenborg, who could not possibly have known anything
 of the esoteric ideas of Buddhism, came independently near the
 Occult teaching in his general conceptions, is shown by his essay
 on the Vortical Theory. In Clissold's translation of it, quoted
 by Prof. Winchell, we find the following <em>resume</em>: -- "The
 first Cause is the Infinite or Unlimited. This gives existence
 to the First Finite or Limited." (The Logos in His manifestation
 and the Universe.) "That which produces a limit is analogous
 to motion. (See first Stanza, <em>supra</em>.) The limit produced
 is a point, the Essence of which is Motion; but being without
 parts, this Essence is not actual Motion, but only a connatus
 to it." (In our Doctrine it is not a "connatus,"
 but a change from eternal vibration in the unmanifested, to Vortical
 Motion in the phenomenal or manifested World). . . "From
 this first proceed Extension, Space, Figure, and Succession, or
 Time. As in Geometry a point generates a line, a line a surface,
 and a surface a solid, so here the connatus of a point tends towards
 lines, surfaces and solids. In other words, the Universe is contained
 <em>in ovo </em>in the first natural point . . . the Motion toward
 which the connatus tends, is circular, since the circle is the
 most perfect of all figures . . . The most perfect figure of a
 Motion <em>. . </em>. must be the perpetually circular, that is
 to say, it must proceed from the centre to the periphery and from
 the periphery to the centre." (Quoted from <em>Principia
 Rerum Naturalia.</em>)<em> </em>This is Occultism pure and simple.

 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) This tracing of "Spiral lines" refers to
 the evolution of man's as well as Nature's principles; an evolution
 which takes place gradually (as will be seen in Book II., on "The
 origin of the Human Races"), as does everything else in nature.
 The Sixth principle in Man (Buddhi, the Divine Soul) though a
 mere breath, in our conceptions, is still something material when
 compared with divine "Spirit" (Atma) of which it is
 the carrier or vehicle. Fohat, in his capacity of <strong>D</strong>IVINE
 <strong>L</strong>OVE (<em>Eros</em>), the electric Power of affinity
 and sympathy, is shown allegorically as trying to bring the pure
 Spirit, the Ray inseparable from the ONE absolute, into union
 with the Soul, the two constituting in Man the <strong>M</strong>ONAD,
 and in Nature the first link between the ever unconditioned and
 the manifested. "The first is now the second" (world)
 -- of the Lipikas -- has reference to the same.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>The "Army" at each angle is the
 Host of angelic Beings (Dhyan-Chohans) appointed to guide and
 watch over each respective region from the beginning to the end
 of Manvantara. They are the "Mystic Watchers" of the
 Christian Kabalists and Alchemists, and relate, symbolically as
 well as cosmogonically, to the numerical system of the Universe.
 The numbers with which these celestial Beings are connected are
 extremely difficult to explain, as each number refers to several
 groups of distinct ideas, according to the particular group of
 "Angels" which it is intended to represent. Herein lies
 the <em>nodus </em>in the study of symbology, with which, unable
 to untie by disentangling it, so many scholars have preferred
 dealing as Alexander dealt with the Gordian knot; hence erroneous
 conceptions and teachings, as a direct result.
 </p><p>
 The "First is the Second," because the "First"
 cannot really be numbered or regarded as the First, as that is
 the realm of noumena in its primary manifestation: the threshold
 to the World of Truth, or <strong>S</strong>AT, through which
 the direct energy that radiates from the ONE REALITY -- the Nameless
 Deity -- reaches us. Here again, the untranslateable term <strong>S</strong>AT
 (<em>Be-ness</em>)<em> </em>is likely to lead into an erroneous
 conception, since that which is manifested cannot be <strong>S</strong>AT,
 but is something phenomenal, not everlasting, nor, in truth, even
 sempiternal. It is coeval and </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 120 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 coexistent with the One Life, "Secondless," but as a
 manifestation it is still a Maya -- like the rest. This "World
 of Truth" can be described only in the words of the Commentary
 as "A bright star dropped from the heart of Eternity; the
 beacon of hope on whose Seven Rays hang the Seven Worlds of Being."
 Truly so; since those are the Seven Lights whose reflections are
 the human immortal Monads -- the Atma, or the irradiating Spirit
 of every creature of the human family. First, this septenary Light;
 then: --
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) The "Divine World" -- the countless Lights
 lit at the primeval Light -- the Buddhis, or formless divine Souls,
 of the last Arupa (formless) world; the "Sum Total,"
 in the mysterious language of the old Stanza. In the Catechism,
 the Master is made to ask the pupil: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>Lift thy head, oh Lanoo; dost thou see one, or countless
 lights above thee, burning in the dark midnight sky?</em>"
 </p><p>
 "<em>I sense one Flame, oh Gurudeva, I see countless undetached
 sparks shining in it.</em>"
 </p><p>
 "<em>Thou sayest well. And now look around and into thyself.
 That light which burns inside thee, dost thou feel it different
 in anywise from the light that shines in thy Brother-men?</em>"
 </p><p>
 "<em>It is in no way different, though the prisoner is held
 in bondage by Karma, and though its outer garments delude the
 ignorant into saying, </em>'<em>Thy Soul and My Soul.</em>' "
 </p><p>
 The radical unity of the ultimate essence of each constituent
 part of compounds in Nature -- from Star to mineral Atom, from
 the highest Dhyan Chohan to the smallest infusoria, in the fullest
 acceptation of the term, and whether applied to the spiritual,
 intellectual, or physical worlds -- this is the one fundamental
 law in Occult Science. "The Deity is boundless and infinite
 expansion," says an Occult axiom; and hence, as remarked,
 the name of Brahma.* There is a deep philosophy underlying the
 earliest worship in the world, that of the Sun and of Fire. Of
 all the Elements known to physical science, Fire is the one that
 has ever eluded definite analysis. It is confidently asserted
 that

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 121 THE MYSTERY OF THE FIRE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Air is a mixture containing the gases Oxygen and Nitrogen. We
 view the Universe and the Earth as matter composed of definite
 chemical molecules. We speak of the primitive ten Earths, endowing
 each with a Greek or Latin name. We say that water is, chemically,
 a compound of Oxygen and Hydrogen. But what is <strong>F</strong>IRE?
 It is the effect of combustion, we are gravely answered. It is
 heat and light and motion, and a correlation of physical and chemical
 forces in general. And this scientific definition is philosophically
 supplemented by the theological one in Webster's Dictionary, which
 explains fire as "the instrument of punishment, or the punishment
 of the impenitent in another state" -- the "state,"
 by the bye, being supposed to be spiritual; but, alas! the presence
 of fire would seem to be a convincing proof of its material nature.
 Yet, speaking of the illusion of regarding phenomena as simple,
 because they are familiar, Professor Bain says (<em>Logic. </em>Part
 II.): "Very familiar facts seem to stand in no need of explanation
 themselves and to be the means of explaining whatever can be assimilated
 to them. Thus, the boiling and evaporation of a liquid is supposed
 to be a very simple phenomenon requiring no explanation, and a
 satisfactory explanation of rarer phenomena. That water should
 dry up is, to the uninstructed mind, a thing wholly intelligible;
 whereas to the man acquainted with physical science the liquid
 state is anomalous and inexplicable. The lighting of a fire by
 a flame is a GREAT SCIENTIFIC DIFFICULTY, yet few people think
 so" (p. 125).
 </p><p>
 What says the esoteric teaching with regard to fire? "Fire,"
 it says, "is the most perfect and unadulterated reflection,
 in Heaven as on Earth, of the <strong>O</strong>NE <strong>F</strong>LAME.
 It is Life and Death, the origin and the end of every material
 thing. It is divine '<strong>S</strong>UBSTANCE.' " Thus,
 not only the <strong>F</strong>IRE-<strong>W</strong>ORSHIPPER,
 the Parsee, but even the wandering savage tribes of America, which
 proclaim themselves "born of fire," show more science
 in their creeds and truth in their superstitions, than all the
 speculations of modern physics and learning. The Christian who
 says: "God is a living Fire," and speaks of the Pentecostal
 "Tongues of Fire" and of the "burning bush"
 of Moses, is as much a fire-worshipper as any other "heathen."
 The Rosicrucians, among all the mystics and Kabalists, were those
 who defined Fire in the right and most correct way. Procure a
 sixpenny lamp, keep it only supplied with oil, and you will be
 able to light at its flame the lamps, candles,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 122 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 and fires of the whole globe without diminishing that flame. If
 the Deity, the radical One, is eternal and an infinite substance
 ("the Lord thy God is a consuming fire") and never consumed,
 then it does not seem reasonable that the Occult teaching should
 be held as unphilosophical when it says: "Thus were the Arupa
 and Rupa worlds formed: from <strong>O</strong>NE light seven
 lights; from each of the seven, seven times seven," etc.,
 etc.

 5. <strong>F</strong>OHAT TAKES FIVE STRIDES (<em>having already

 BUILDS A WINGED WHEEL AT EACH CORNER OF THE SQUARE FOR THE FOUR
 HOLY ONES . . . . . AND THEIR ARMIES (<em>hosts</em>)<em> </em>(<em>b</em>)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) The "strides," as already explained (see
 Commentary on Stanza <strong>IV</strong>.), refer to both the
 Cosmic and the Human principles -- the latter of which consist,
 in the exoteric division, of three (Spirit, Soul, and Body), and,
 in the esoteric calculation, of seven principles -- three rays
 of the Essence and four aspects.* Those who have studied Mr. Sinnett's
 "<em>Esoteric Buddhism</em>"<em> </em>can easily grasp
 the nomenclature. There are two esoteric schools -- or rather
 one school, divided into two parts -- one for the inner Lanoos,
 the other for the outer or semi-lay chelas beyond the Himalayas;
 the first teaching a septenary, the other a six-fold division
 of human principles.
 </p><p>
 From a Cosmic point of view, Fohat taking "five strides"
 refers here to the five upper planes of Consciousness and Being,
 the sixth and the seventh (counting downwards) being the astral
 and the terrestrial, or the two lower planes.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) "Four winged wheels at each corner . . . . .
 for the four holy ones and their armies (hosts)" . . . .
 . These are the "four Maharajahs" or great Kings of
 the Dhyan-Chohans, the Devas who preside, each over one of the
 four cardinal points. They are the Regents or Angels who rule
 over the Cosmical Forces of North, South,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The four aspects are the body, its life or vitality, and the
 "Double" of the body, the triad which disappears with
 the death of the person, and the Kama-rupa which disintegrates
 in <em>Kama-loka.</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 123 THE SECRET OF THE ELEMENTS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 East and West, Forces having each a distinct occult property.
 These BEINGS are also connected with Karma, as the latter needs
 physical and material agents to carry out her decrees, such as
 the four kinds of winds, for instance, professedly admitted by
 Science to have their respective evil and beneficent influences
 upon the health of Mankind and every living thing. There is occult
 philosophy in that Roman Catholic doctrine which traces the various
 public calamities, such as epidemics of disease, and wars, and
 so on, to the invisible "Messengers" from North and
 West. "The glory of God comes from the way of the East"
 says Ezekiel; while Jeremiah, Isaiah, and the Psalmist assure
 their readers that all the evil under the Sun comes from the North
 and the West -- which proposition, when applied to the Jewish
 nation, sounds like an undeniable prophecy for themselves. And
 this accounts also for St. Ambrose (On Amos, ch. iv.) declaring
 that it is precisely for that reason that "we curse the North-Wind,
 and that during the ceremony of baptism we begin by turning towards
 the West (Sidereal), to renounce the better him who inhabits it;
 after which we turn to the East."
 </p><p>
 Belief in the "Four Maharajahs" -- the Regents of the
 Four cardinal points -- was universal and is now that of Christians,*
 who call them, after St. Augustine, "Angelic Virtues,"
 and "Spirits" when enumerated by themselves, and "Devils"
 when named by Pagans. But where is the difference between the
 Pagans and the Christians in this cause? Following Plato, Aristotle
 explained that the term [[<em>stoicheia</em>]] was understood
 only as meaning the incorporeal principles placed at each of the
 four great divisions of our Cosmical world to supervise them.
 Thus, no more than the Christians did, do they <em>adore </em>and<em>
 worship </em>the Elements and the cardinal (imaginary) points,
 but the "gods" that ruled these respectively. For the
 Church there are two kinds of Sidereal beings, the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Says the scholarly Vossius, in his Theol. Cir. I. VII.: "Though
 St. Augustine has said that every visible thing in this world
 had an angelic virtue as an overseer near it, it is not individuals
 but entire species of things that must be understood, each such
 species having indeed its particular angel to watch it. He is
 at one in this with all the philosophers . . . For us these angels
 are spirits separated from the objects . . . whereas for the philosophers
 (pagan) they were gods." Considering the Ritual established
 by the Roman Catholic Church for "Spirits of the Stars,"
 the latter look suspiciously like "Gods," and were no
 more honoured and prayed to by the ancient and modern pagan rabble
 than they are now at Rome by the highly cultured Catholic Christians.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 124 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 Angels and the Devils. For the Kabalist and Occultist there is
 but one; and neither of them makes any difference between "the
 Rectors of Light" and the Cosmocratores, or "Rectores
 tenebrarum harum," whom the Roman Church imagines and discovers
 in a "Rector of Light" as soon as he is called by another
 name than the one she addresses him by. It is not the "Rector"
 or "Maharajah" who punishes or rewards, with or without
 "God's" permission or order, but man himself -- his
 deeds or Karma, attracting individually and collectively (as in
 the case of whole nations sometimes), every kind of evil and calamity.
 We produce CAUSES, and these awaken the corresponding powers in
 the sidereal world; which powers are magnetically and irresistibly
 attracted to -- and react upon -- those who produced these causes;
 whether such persons are practically the evil-doers, or simply
 Thinkers who brood mischief. Thought is matter,* we are taught
 by modern Science; and "every particle of the existing matter
 must be a register of all that has happened," as in their
 "<em>Principles of Science</em>"<em> </em>Messrs. Jevons
 and Babbage tell the profane. Modern Science is drawn more every
 day into the maelstrom of Occultism; unconsciously, no doubt,
 still very sensibly. The two main theories of science -- <em>re</em>
 the relations between Mind and Matter -- are Monism and Materialism.
 These two cover the whole ground of negative psychology with the
 exception of the quasi-occult views of the pantheistic German
 schools.**
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Not of course in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott,
 who assures us that "Thought is the movement of matter,"
 a statement of almost unequalled absurdity. Mental states and
 bodily states are utterly contrasted as such. But that does not
 affect the position that every thought, in addition to its physical
 accompaniment (brain-change), exhibits an objective -- though
 to us supersensuously objective -- aspect on the astral plane.
 (See "The Occult World," pp. 89, 90.)
 </p><p>
 ** The views of our present-day scientific thinkers as to the
 relations between mind and matter may be reduced to two hypotheses.
 These show that both views equally exclude the possibility of
 an independent Soul, distinct from the physical brain through
 which it functions. They are: --
 </p><p>
 (1.) <strong>M</strong>ATERIALISM, the theory which regards mental
 phenomena as the product of molecular change in the brain; <em>i.e.</em>,
 as the outcome of a transformation of motion into feeling (!).
 The cruder school once went so far as to identify mind with a
 "peculiar mode of motion" (!!), but this view is now
 happily regarded as absurd by most of the men of science themselves.
 </p><p>
 (2.) <strong>M</strong>ONISM, or the Single Substance Doctrine,
 is the more subtle form of negative psychology, which one of its
 advocates, Professor Bain, ably terms "guarded [[Footnote

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 125 THE REAL MEANING OF THE TABERNACLE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 In the Egyptian temples, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, an
 immense curtain separated the tabernacle from the place for the
 congregation. The Jews had the same. In both, the curtain was
 drawn over five pillars (the Pentacle) symbolising our five senses
 and five Root-races esoterically, while the four colours of the
 curtain represented the four cardinal points and the four terrestrial
 elements. The whole was an allegorical symbol. It is through the
 four high Rulers over the four points and Elements that our five
 senses may become cognisant of the hidden truths of Nature; and
 not at all, as Clemens would have it, that it is the elements
 <em>per se </em>that furnished the Pagans with divine Knowledge
 or the knowledge of God.* While the Egyptian emblem was spiritual,
 that of the Jews was purely materialistic, and, indeed, honoured
 only the blind Elements and the imaginary "Points."
 For what was the meaning of the square tabernacle raised by Moses
 in the wilderness, if it had not the same cosmical significance?
 "Thou shalt make an hanging . . . of blue, purple, and scarlet"
 and "five pillars of shittim wood for the hanging . . . four
 brazen rings in the four corners thereof . . . boards of fine
 wood for the four sides, North, South, West, and East . . . of
 the Tabernacle . . . with Cherubims of cunning work." (Exodus,
 ch. xxvi., xxvii.) The Tabernacle and the square courtyard, Cherubim
 and all, were precisely the same as those in the Egyptian temples.
 The square form of the Tabernacle meant just the same thing as
 it still means, to this day, in the exoteric worship of the Chinese
 and Tibetans -- the four cardinal points signifying that which
 the four sides of the pyramids, obelisks, and other such square
 erections mean. Josephus takes care to explain the whole thing.
 He declares that the Tabernacle pillars are the same

 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] Materialism." This
 doctrine, which commands a very wide assent, counting among its
 upholders such men as Lewis, Spencer, Ferrier, and others, while
 positing thought and mental phenomena generally as radically contrasted
 with matter, regards both as equal to the two sides, or aspects,
 of one and the same substance in some of its conditions. Thought
 as thought, they say, is utterly contrasted with material phenomena,
 but it must be also regarded as only "the subjective side
 of nervous motion" whatever our learned men may mean by this.
 </p><p>
 * Thus the sentence, "Natura Elementorum obtinet revelationem
 Dei," (In Clemens's <em>Stromata</em>, R. <strong>IV</strong>.,
 para. 6), is applicable to both or neither. Consult the Zends,
 vol II., p. 228, and Plutarch <em>De Iside</em>,<em> </em>as compared
 by Layard, <em>Academie des Inscriptions</em>,<em> </em>1854,

 <p>
 as those raised at Tyre to the four Elements, which were placed
 on pedestals whose four angles faced the four cardinal points:
 adding that "the angles of the pedestals had equally the
 four figures of the Zodiac" on them, which represented the
 same orientation (<em>Antiquities I., </em>VIII., ch. xxii.).
 </p><p>
 The idea may be traced in the Zoroastrian caves, in the rock-cut
 temples of India, as in all the sacred square buildings of antiquity
 that have survived to this day. This is shown definitely by Layard,
 who finds the four cardinal points, and the four primitive elements,
 in the religion of every country, under the shape of square obelisks,
 the four sides of the pyramids, etc., etc. Of these elements and
 their points the four Maharajahs were the regents and the directors.
 </p><p>
 If the student would know more of them, he has but to compare
 the Vision of Ezekiel (chap. i.) with what is known of Chinese
 Buddhism (even in its exoteric teachings); and examine the outward
 shape of these "Great Kings." In the opinion of the
 Rev. Joseph Edkins, they are "the Devas who preside each
 over one of the four continents into which the Hindus divide the
 world."* Each leads an army of spiritual beings to protect
 mankind and Buddhism. With the exception of favouritism towards
 Buddhism, the four celestial beings are precisely this. They are
 the protectors of mankind and also the Agents of Karma on Earth,
 whereas the Lipika are concerned with Humanity's hereafter. At
 the same time they are the four living creatures "who have
 the likeness of a man" of Ezekiel's visions, called by the
 translators of the Bible, "Cherubim," "Seraphim,"
 etc.; and by the Occultists, "the winged Globes," the
 "Fiery Wheels," and in the Hindu Pantheon by a number
 of different names. All these Gandharvas, the "Sweet Songsters,"
 the Asuras, Kinnaras, and Nagas, are the allegorical descriptions
 of the "four Maharajahs." The Seraphim are the fiery
 Serpents of Heaven which we find in a passage describing Mount
 Meru as: "the exalted mass of glory, the venerable haunt
 of gods and heavenly choristers . . . . not to be reached by sinful
 men . . . . because guarded by Serpents." They are called
 the Avengers, and the "Winged Wheels."

 Christian Bible-interpreters say of the Cherubim: -- "The
 word signifies in Hebrew, fullness of knowledge; these angels
 are so called from their exquisite Knowledge, and were therefore
 used for the punishment of men who affected divine Knowledge."
 (Interpreted by Cruden in his Concordance, from Genesis iii.,
 24.) Very well; and vague as the information is, it shows that
 the Cherub placed at the gate of the garden of Eden after the
 "Fall," suggested to the venerable Interpreters the
 idea of punishment connected with forbidden Science or divine
 Knowledge -- one that generally leads to another "Fall,"
 that of the gods, or "God," in man's estimation. But
 as the good old Cruden knew nought of Karma, he may be forgiven.
 Yet the allegory is suggestive. From Meru, the abode of gods,
 to Eden, the distance is very small, and from the Hindu Serpents
 to the Ophite Cherubim, the third out of the seven of which was
 the Dragon, the separation is still smaller, for both watched
 the entrance to the realm of Secret Knowledge. But Ezekiel plainly
 describes the four Cosmic Angels: "I looked, and behold,
 a whirlwind, a cloud and fire infolding it . . . also out of the
 midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . . .
 they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces and
 four wings . . . the face of a man, and the face of a lion, the
 face of an ox, and the face of an eagle . . . " ("Man"
 was here substituted for "Dragon." Compare the "<em>Ophite
 Spirits.</em>"<em>*</em>) . . . "Now as I beheld the
 living creatures behold one wheel upon the Earth with his four
 faces . . . as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel . . .
 for the support of the living creature was in the wheel . . .
 their appearance was like coals of fire . . ." etc. (Ezekiel,
 ch. i.)

 There are three chief groups of Builders and as many of the Planetary
 Spirits and the Lipika, each group being again divided into Seven
 sub-groups. It is impossible, even in such a large work as this,
 to enter into a minute examination of even the three principal
 groups, as it would demand an extra volume. The "Builders"
 are the representatives of the first "Mind-Born" Entities,
 therefore of the primeval Rishi-Prajapati: also of the Seven great
 Gods of Egypt, of which Osiris is the chief: of the Seven Amshaspends
 of the Zoroastrians, with

 to these "Faces" were with the Ophites: -- Dragon --

 The four keep company with the four Evangelists, and preface the
 Gospels.</p><hr>

 Ormazd at their head: or the "Seven Spirits of the Face":
 the Seven Sephiroth separated from the first Triad, etc., etc.*
 </p><p>
 They build or rather rebuild every "System" after the
 "Night." The Second group of the Builders is the Architect
 of our planetary chain exclusively; and the third, the progenitor
 of our Humanity -- the Macrocosmic prototype of the microcosm.
 </p><p>
 The Planetary Spirits are the informing spirits of the Stars in
 general, and of the Planets especially. They rule the destinies
 of men who are all born under one or other of their constellations;
 the second and third groups pertaining to other systems have the
 same functions, and all rule various departments in Nature. In
 the Hindu exoteric Pantheon they are the guardian deities who
 preside over the eight points of the compass -- the four cardinal
 and the four intermediate points -- and are called <em>Loka-Palas</em>,
 "Supporters or guardians of the World" (in our visible
 Kosmos), of which Indra (East), Yama (South), Varuna (West), and
 Kuvera (North) are the chief; their elephants and their spouses
 pertaining of course to fancy and afterthought, though all of
 them have an occult significance.
 </p><p>
 The Lipika (a description of whom is given in the Commentary on
 Stanza <strong>IV</strong>. No. 6) are the Spirits of the Universe,
 whereas the Builders are only our own planetary deities. The former
 belong to the most occult portion of Cosmogenesis, which cannot
 be given here. Whether the Adepts (even the highest) know this
 angelic order in the completeness of its triple degrees, or only
 the lower one connected with the records of our world, is something
 which the writer is unprepared to say, and she would incline rather
 to the latter supposition. Of its highest grade one thing only
 is taught: the Lipika are connected with Karma -- being its direct
 Recorders.**

 * The Jews, save the Kabalists, having no names for East, West,
 South, and North, expressed the idea by words signifying before,
 behind, right and left, and very often confounded the terms exoterically,
 thus making the blinds in the Bible more confused and difficult
 to interpret. Add to this the fact that out of the forty-seven
 translators of King James I. of England's Bible "only three
 understood Hebrew, and of these two died before the Psalms were
 translated" (<em>Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia</em>),<em> </em>and
 one may easily understand what reliance can be placed on the English
 version of the Bible. In this work the Douay Roman Catholic version
 is generally followed.

 The Stanza proceeds with a minute classification of the Orders
 of Angelic Hierarchy. From the group of Four and Seven emanates
 the "mind-born" group of Ten, of Twelve, of Twenty-one,
 etc., all these divided again into sub-groups of septenaries,
 novenaries, duodecimals, and so on, until the mind is lost in
 this endless enumeration of celestial hosts and Beings, each having
 its distinct task in the ruling of the visible Kosmos during its
 existence.
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) The esoteric meaning of the first sentence of the
 Sloka is, that those who have been called Lipikas, the Recorders
 of the Karmic ledger, make an impassible barrier between the personal
 <strong>E</strong>GO and the impersonal <strong>S</strong>ELF,
 the Noumenon and Parent-Source of the former. Hence the allegory.
 They circumscribe the manifested world of matter within the <strong>R</strong>ING
 "Pass-Not." This world is the symbol (objective) of
 the <strong>O</strong>NE divided into the many, on the planes
 of Illusion, of Adi (the "First") or of Eka (the "One");
 and this One is the collective aggregate, or totality, of the
 principal Creators or Architects of this visible universe. In
 Hebrew Occultism their name is both Achath, feminine, "One,"
 and Achod, "One" again, but masculine. The monotheists
 have taken (and are still taking) advantage of the profound esotericism
 of the Kabala to apply the name by which the One Supreme Essence
 is known to ITS manifestation, the Sephiroth-Elohim, and call
 it Jehovah. But this is

 or scribes; the "Dragons," symbols of wisdom, who guard
 the Trees of Knowledge; the "golden" apple Tree of the
 Hesperides; the "Luxuriant Trees" and vegetation of
 Mount Meru guarded by a Serpent. Juno giving to Jupiter, on her
 marriage with him, a Tree with golden fruit is another form of
 Eve offering Adam the apple from the Tree of Knowledge.</p><hr>

 <p>
 quite arbitrary and against all reason and logic, as the term
 Elohim is a plural noun, identical with the plural word <em>Chiim,
 </em>often compounded with the Elohim.* Moreover, in Occult metaphysics
 there are, properly speaking, two "<strong>O</strong>NES"
 -- the One on the unreachable plane of Absoluteness and Infinity,
 on which no speculation is possible, and the Second "One"
 on the plane of Emanations. The former can neither emanate nor
 be divided, as it is eternal, absolute, and immutable. The Second,
 being, so to speak, the reflection of the first One (for it is
 the Logos, or Iswara, in the Universe of Illusion), can do all
 this.** It emanates from itself -- as the upper Sephirothal Triad
 emanates the lower seven Sephiroth -- the seven Rays or Dhyan
 Chohans; in other words, the Homogeneous becomes the Heterogeneous,
 the "Protyle" differentiates into the Elements. But
 these, unless they return into their primal Element, can never
 cross beyond the Laya, or zero-point.
 </p><p>
 Hence the allegory. The Lipika separate the world (or plane) of
 pure spirit from that of Matter. Those who "descend and ascend"
 -- the incarnating Monads, and men striving towards purification
 and "ascending," but still not having quite reached
 the goal -- may cross the "circle of the Pass-Not,"
 only on the day "Be-With-Us"; that day when man, freeing
 himself from the trammels of ignorance, and recog-

 * The sentence in the Sepher Jezirah and elsewhere: "Achath-Ruach-Elohim-Chiim"
 denotes the Elohim as androgynous at best, the feminine element
 almost predominating, as it would read: "<strong>O</strong>NE
 is She the Spirit of the Elohim of Life." As said above,
 Echath (or Achath) is feminine, and Echod (or Achod) masculine,
 both meaning <strong>O</strong>NE.
 </p><p>
 ** This metaphysical tenet can hardly be better described than
 Mr. Subba Row's in "Bhagavadgita" lectures: "Mulaprakriti
 (the veil of Parabrahmam) acts as the one energy through the Logos
 (or 'Eswara'). Now Parabrahmam, is the one essence from which
 starts into existence a centre of energy, which I shall for the
 present call the Logos. . . . It is called the Verbum . . . by
 the Christians, and it is the divine Christos who is eternal in
 the bosom of his father. It is called Avalokiteshwara by the Buddhists.
 . . . In almost every doctrine, they have formulated the existence
 of a centre of spiritual energy which is unborn and eternal, and
 which exists in the bosom of Parabrahmam at the time of Pralaya,
 and starts as a centre of conscious energy at the time of Cosmic
 activity. . . ." For, as the lecturer premised by saying,
 Parabraham is not this or that, it is not even consciousness,
 as it cannot be related to matter or anything conditioned. It
 is not Ego nor is it Non-ego, not even Atma, but verily the one
 source of all manifestations and modes of existence.</p><hr>

 <p>
 nising fully the non-separateness of the Ego within his personality
 -- erroneously regarded as his own -- from the <strong>U</strong>NIVERSAL
 <strong>E</strong>GO (Anima Supra-Mundi), merges thereby into
 the One Essence to become not only one "with us" (the
 manifested universal lives which are "ONE" LIFE), but
 that very life itself.
 </p><p>
 Astronomically, the "Ring <strong>P</strong>ASS-<strong>N</strong>OT"
 that the Lipika trace around the Triangle, the First One, the
 Cube, the Second One, and the Pentacle to circumscribe these figures,
 is thus shown to contain the symbol of 31415 again, or the coefficient
 constantly used in mathematical tables (the value of <i>, </i>pi),
 the geometrical figures standing here for numerical figures. According
 to the general philosophical teachings, this ring is beyond the
 region of what are called nebulae in astronomy. But this is as
 erroneous a conception as that of the topography and the descriptions,
 given in Puranic and other exoteric Scriptures, about the 1008
 worlds of the Devaloka worlds and firmaments. There are worlds,
 of course, in the esoteric as well as in the profane scientific
 teachings, at such incalculable distances that the light of the
 nearest of them which has just reached our modern Chaldees, had
 left its luminary long before the day on which the words "Let
 there be Light" were pronounced; but these are no worlds
 on the Devaloka plane, but in our Kosmos.
 </p><p>
 The chemist goes to the <em>laya </em>or zero point of the plane
 of matter with which he deals, and then stops short. The physicist
 or the astronomer counts by billions of miles beyond the nebulae,
 and then they also stop short; the semi-initiated Occultist will
 represent this laya-point to himself as existing on some plane
 which, if not physical, is still conceivable to the human intellect.
 But the full Initiate <em>knows </em>that the ring "Pass-Not"
 is neither a locality nor can it be measured by distance, but
 that it exists in the absoluteness of infinity. In this "Infinity"
 of the full Initiate there is neither height, breadth nor thickness,
 but all is fathomless profundity, reaching down from the physical
 to the "para-para-metaphysical." In using the word "down,"
 essential depth -- "nowhere and everywhere" -- is meant,
 not depth of physical matter.
 </p><p>
 If one searches carefully through the exoteric and grossly anthropomorphic
 allegories of popular religions, even in these the doctrine embodied
 in the circle of "Pass-Not" thus guarded by the Lipika,
 may be dimly perceived. Thus one finds it even in the teachings
 of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 132 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 the Vedantin sect of the Visishtadwaita, the most tenaciously
 anthropomorphic in all India. For we read of the released soul
 that: --
 </p><p>
 After reaching Moksha (a state of bliss meaning "release
 from Bandha" or bondage), bliss is enjoyed by it in a place
 called <strong>P</strong>ARAMAPADHA, which place is not material,
 but made of Suddasatwa (the essence, of which the body of Iswara
 -- "the Lord" -- is formed). There, Muktas or Jivatmas
 (Monads) who have attained Moksha, are never again subject to
 the qualities of either matter or Karma. "But if they choose,
 <em>for the sake of doing good to the world</em>, they may incarnate
 on Earth."* The way to Paramapadha, or the immaterial worlds,
 from this world, is called Devayana. When a person has attained
 Moksha and the body dies: --
 </p><p>
 "The Jiva (Soul) goes with Sukshma Sarira** from the heart
 of the body, to the Brahmarandra in the crown of the head, traversing
 Sushumna, a nerve connecting the heart with the Brahmarandra.
 The Jiva breaks through the Brahmarandra and goes to the region
 of the Sun (Suryamandala) through the solar Rays. Then it goes,
 through a dark spot in the Sun, to Paramapadha. The Jiva is directed
 on its way by the Supreme Wisdom acquired by Yoga.*** The Jiva
 thus proceeds to Paramapadha by the aid of Athivahikas (bearers
 in transit), known by the names of Archi-Ahas . . . Aditya, Prajapati,
 etc. The Archis here mentioned are certain pure Souls, etc., etc."
 (Visishtadwaita Catechism, by Pundit Bhashyacharya, <strong>F.T.S</strong>.)
 </p><p>
 No Spirit except the "Recorders" (Lipika) has ever crossed
 its forbidden line, nor will any do so until the day of the next
 Pralaya, for it is the boundary that separates the finite -- however
 infinite in man's sight -- from the truly <strong>I</strong>NFINITE.
 The Spirits referred to, therefore, as those who "ascend
 and descend" are the "Hosts" of what we loosely
 call "celestial Beings." But they are, in fact, nothing
 of the kind.

 in "Pistis-Sophia" (Knowledge = Wisdom), in which treatise
 Sophia Achamoth is shown lost in the waters of Chaos (matter),
 on her way to Supreme Light, and Christos delivering and helping
 her on the right Path. Note well, "Christos" with the
 Gnostics meant the impersonal principal, the Atman of the Universe,
 and the Atma within every man's soul -- not Jesus; though in the
 old Coptic <strong>MSS</strong>. in the British Museum "Christos"
 is almost constantly replaced by "Jesus."</p><hr>

 They are Entities of the higher worlds in the hierarchy of Being,
 so immeasurably high that, to us, they must appear as Gods, and
 collectively -- <strong>G</strong>OD. But so we, mortal men, must
 appear to the ant, which reasons on the scale of its special capacities.
 The ant may also, for all we know, see the avenging finger of
 a personal God in the hand of the urchin who, in one moment, under
 the impulse of mischief, destroys its anthill, the labour of many
 weeks -- long years in the chronology of insects. The ant, feeling
 it acutely, and attributing the undeserved calamity to a combination
 of Providence and sin, may also, like man, see in it the result
 of the sin of its first parent. Who knows and who can affirm or
 deny? The refusal to admit in the whole Solar system of any other
 reasonable and intellectual beings on the human plane, than ourselves,
 is the greatest conceit of our age. All that science has a right
 to affirm, is that there are no invisible Intelligences living
 under the same conditions as we do. It cannot deny point-blank
 the possibility of there being worlds within worlds, under totally
 different conditions to those that constitute the nature of our
 world; nor can it deny that there may be a certain limited communication*
 between some of those worlds and our own. To the highest, we are
 taught, belong the seven orders of the purely divine Spirits;
 to the six lower ones belong hierarchies that can occasionally
 be seen and heard by men, and who do communicate with their progeny
 of the Earth; which progeny is indissolubly linked with them,
 each principle in man having its direct source in the nature of
 those great Beings, who furnish us with the respective invisible
 elements in us. Physical Science is welcome to speculate upon
 the physiological mechanism of living beings, and to continue
 her fruitless efforts in trying to resolve our feelings, our sensations,
 mental and spiritual, into functions of their inorganic vehicles.
 Nevertheless, all that will ever be accomplished in this direction
 has already been done, and Science will go no farther.

 * The greatest philosopher of European birth, Imanuel Kant, assures
 us that such a communication is in no way improbable. "I
 confess I am much disposed to assert the existence of Immaterial
 natures in the world, and to place my own soul in the class of
 these beings. It will hereafter, I know not where, or when, yet
 be proved that the human soul stands even in this life in indissoluble
 connection with all immaterial natures in the spirit-world, that
 it reciprocally acts upon these and receives impressions from
 them." (Traume eines Geistersehers, quoted by C. C. Massey,
 in his preface to Von Hartmann's "Spiritismus.")</p><hr>

 She is before a dead wall, on the face of which she traces, as
 she imagines, great physiological and psychic discoveries, but
 every one of which will be shown later on to be no better than
 the cobwebs spun by her scientific fancies and illusions. The
 tissues of our objective framework alone are subservient to the
 analysis and researches of physiological science.* The six higher
 principles in them will evade for ever the hand that is guided
 by an animus that purposely ignores and rejects the Occult Sciences.

 The "Great Day of <strong>B</strong>E-WITH-US," then,
 is an expression the only merit of which lies in its literal translation.
 Its significance is not so easily revealed to a public, unacquainted
 with the mystic tenets of Occultism, or rather of Esoteric Wisdom
 or "Budhism." It is an expression peculiar to the latter,
 and as hazy for the profane as that of the Egyptians who called
 the same the "Day of <strong>C</strong>OME-TO-US,"**

 * <em>E.g.</em>,<em> </em>all that modern physiological research
 in connection with psychological problems has, and owing to the
 nature of things, could have shown, is, that every thought, sensation,
 and emotion is attended with a re-marshalling of the molecules
 of certain nerves. The inference drawn by scientists of the type
 of Buchner, Vogt, and others, that thought is molecular motion,
 necessitates a complete abstraction being made of the fact of
 our subjective consciousness.

 ** See "Le Livre des Morts," by Paul Pierret; "Le
 Jour de 'Viens a nous' . . . c'est le jour ou Osiris a dit au
 Soleil: Viens! Je le vois rencontrant le Soleil dans l'Amenti."
 (Chap. xvii., p. 61.) The Sun here stands for the Logos (or Christos,
 or Horus) as central Essence synthetically, and as a diffused
 essence of radiated Entities, different in substance, but not
 in essence. As expressed by the <em>Bhagavadgita </em>lecturer,
 "it must not be supposed that the Logos is but a single centre
 of energy manifested from Parabrahmam; there are innumerable other
 centres . . . and their number is almost infinite in the bosom
 of Parabrahmam." Hence the expressions, "The Day of
 Come to us" and "The Day of Be with us," etc. Just
 as the square is the Symbol of the Four sacred Forces or Powers
 -- Tetraktis -- so the Circle shows the boundary within the Infinity
 that no man can cross, even in spirit, nor Deva nor Dhyan Chohan.
 The Spirits of those who "descend and ascend" during
 the course of cyclic evolution shall cross the "iron-bound
 world" only on the day of their approach to the threshold
 of Paranirvana. If they reach it -- they will rest in the bosom
 of Parabrahmam, or the "Unknown Darkness," which shall
 then become for all of them Light -- during the whole period of
 Mahapralaya, the "Great <strong>N</strong>IGHT," namely,
 311,040,000,000,000 years of absorption in Brahm. The day of "Be-With-Us"
 is this period of rest or Paranirvana. See also for other data
 on this peculiar expression, the day of "Come-To-Us,"
 <em>The Funerary Ritual of the Egyptians</em>,<em> </em>by Viscount
 de Rouge. It corresponds to the Day of the Last Judgment of the
 Christians, which has been sorely materialised by their religion.

 is identical with the former, though the verb "be" in
 this sense, might be still better replaced with either of the
 two words "Remain" or "Rest-with-us," as it
 refers to that long period of <strong>R</strong>EST which is called
 Paranirvana. As in the exoteric interpretation of the Egyptian
 rites the soul of every defunct person -- from the Hierophant
 down to the sacred bull Apis -- became an Osiris, was Osirified,
 though the Secret Doctrine had always taught, that the real Osirification
 was the lot of every Monad only after 3,000 cycles of Existences;
 so in the present case. The "Monad," born of the nature
 and the very Essence of the "Seven" (its highest principle
 becoming immediately enshrined in the Seventh Cosmic Element),
 has to perform its septenary gyration throughout the Cycle of
 Being and forms, from the highest to the lowest; and then again
 from man to God. At the threshold of Paranirvana it reassumes
 its primeval Essence and becomes the Absolute once more.
