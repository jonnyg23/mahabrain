 COMMENTARY.
 </p><p>
 1. <strong>T</strong>HE LAST VIBRATION OF THE SEVENTH ETERNITY
 THRILLS THROUGH INFINITUDE (<em>a</em>). <strong>T</strong>HE
 MOTHER SWELLS, EXPANDING FROM WITHIN WITHOUT LIKE THE BUD OF THE
 LOTUS (<em>b</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) The seemingly paradoxical use of the sentence "Seventh
 Eternity," thus dividing the indivisible, is sanctified in
 esoteric philosophy. The latter divides boundless duration into
 unconditionally eternal and universal Time and a conditioned one
 (<em>Khandakala</em>)<em>. </em>One is the abstraction or noumenon
 of infinite time (Kala); the other its phenomenon appearing periodically,
 as the effect of <em>Mahat </em>(the Universal Intelligence limited
 by Manvantaric duration). With some schools, Mahat is "the
 first-born" of Pradhana (undifferentiated substance, or the
 periodical aspect of Mulaprakriti, the root of Nature), which
 (Pradhana) is called Maya, the Illusion. In this respect, I believe,
 esoteric teaching differs from the Vedantin doctrines of both
 the Adwaita and the Visishtadwaita schools. For it says that,
 while Mulaprakriti, the noumenon, is self-existing and without
 any origin -- is, in short, parentless, Anupadaka (as one with
 Brahmam) -- Prakriti, its phenomenon, is periodical and no better
 than a phantasm of the former, so Mahat, with the Occultists,
 the first-born of Gnana (or <em>gnosis</em>)<em> </em>knowledge,
 wisdom or the Logos -- is a phantasm reflected from the Absolute
 NIRGUNA (Parabrahm, the one reality, "devoid of attributes
 and qualities"; see Upanishads); while with some Vedantins
 Mahat is a manifestation of Prakriti, or Matter.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) Therefore, the "last vibration of the Seventh
 Eternity" was "fore-ordained" -- by no God in particular,
 but occurred in virtue of the eternal and changeless <strong>L</strong>AW
 which causes the great periods of Activity and Rest, called so
 graphically, and at the same time so poetically, the "Days
 and Nights of Brahma." The expansion "from within without"
 of the Mother, called elsewhere the "Waters of Space,"
 "Universal Matrix," etc., does not allude to an expansion
 from a small centre or focus, but, without reference to size or
 limitation or area, means the development of limitless subjectivity
 into as limitless objectivity. "The ever (to us) invisible
 and immaterial Substance present in eternity, threw its periodical
 shadow from its own plane into the lap</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 63 THE UNIVERSE, A FLITTING SHADOW.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of Maya." It implies that this expansion, not being an increase
 in size -- for infinite extension admits of no enlargement --
 was a change of condition. It "expanded like the bud of the
 Lotus"; for the Lotus plant exists not only as a miniature
 embryo in its seed (a physical characteristic), but its prototype
 is present in an ideal form in the Astral Light from "Dawn"
 to "Night" during the Manvantaric period, like everything
 else, as a matter of fact, in this objective Universe; from man
 down to mite, from giant trees down to the tiniest blades of grass.
 </p><p>
 All this, teaches the hidden Science, is but the temporary reflection,
 the shadow of the eternal ideal prototype in Divine Thought --
 the word "Eternal," note well again, standing here only
 in the sense of "AEon," as lasting throughout the seemingly
 interminable, but still limited cycle of activity, called by us
 Manvantara. For what is the real esoteric meaning of Manvantara,
 or rather a Manu-Antara? It means, esoterically, "between
 two Manus," of whom there are fourteen in every "Day
 of Brahma," such a "Day" consisting of 1,000 aggregates
 of four ages, or 1,000 "Great Ages," Mahayugas. Let
 us now analyse the word or name Manu. Orientalists and their Dictionaries
 tell us that the term "Manu" is from the root <em>Man,
 </em>"to think"; hence "the thinking man."
 But, esoterically, every Manu, as an anthropomorphized patron
 of his special cycle (or Round), is but the personified idea of
 the "Thought Divine" (as the Hermetic "Pymander");
 each of the Manus, therefore, being the special god, the creator
 and fashioner of all that appears during his own respective cycle
 of being or Manvantara. Fohat runs the Manus' (or Dhyan-Chohans')
 errands, and causes the ideal prototypes to expand from within
 without -- viz., to cross gradually, on a descending scale, all
 the planes from the noumenon to the lowest phenomenon, to bloom
 finally on the last into full objectivity -- the acme of illusion,
 or the grossest matter.

 2. <strong>T</strong>HE VIBRATION SWEEPS ALONG, TOUCHING WITH
 ITS SWIFT WING (<em>simultaneously</em>)<em> </em>THE WHOLE UNIVERSE,
 AND THE GERM THAT DWELLETH IN DARKNESS: THE DARKNESS THAT BREATHES
 (<em>moves</em>)<em> </em>OVER THE SLUMBERING WATERS OF LIFE (<em>a</em>).
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 64 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 (<em>a</em>) The Pythagorean Monad is also said to dwell in solitude
 and darkness like the "germ." The idea of the "breath"
 of Darkness moving over "the slumbering Waters of life,"
 which is primordial matter with the latent Spirit in it, recalls
 the first chapter of Genesis. Its original is the Brahminical
 Narayana (the mover on the Waters), who is the personification
 of the eternal Breath of the unconscious All (or Parabrahm) of
 the Eastern Occultists. The Waters of Life, or Chaos -- the female
 principle in symbolism -- are the vacuum (to our mental sight)
 in which lie the latent Spirit and Matter. This it was that made
 Democritus assert, after his instructor Leucippus, that the primordial
 principles of all were atoms and a vacuum, in the sense of space,
 but not of empty space, as "Nature abhors a vacuum"
 according to the Peripatetics, and every ancient philosopher.
 </p><p>
 In all Cosmogonies "Water" plays the same important
 part. It is the base and source of material existence. Scientists,
 mistaking the word for the thing, understood by water the definite
 chemical combination of oxygen and hydrogen, thus giving a specific
 meaning to a term used by Occultists in a generic sense, and which
 is used in Cosmogony with a metaphysical and mystical meaning.
 Ice is not water, neither is steam, although all three have precisely
 the same chemical composition.

 2.[[3.]] "<strong>D</strong>ARKNESS" RADIATES LIGHT,
 AND LIGHT DROPS ONE SOLITARY RAY INTO THE WATERS, INTO THE MOTHER
 DEEP. <strong>T</strong>HE RAY SHOOTS THROUGH THE VIRGIN-EGG;
 THE RAY CAUSES THE ETERNAL EGG TO THRILL, AND DROP THE NON-ETERNAL
 (<em>periodical</em>)<em> </em>GERM, WHICH CONDENSES INTO THE
 WORLD EGG (<em>a</em>)<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>The solitary ray dropping into the mother
 deep may be taken as meaning Divine Thought or Intelligence, impregnating
 chaos. This, however, occurs on the plane of metaphysical abstraction,
 or rather the plane whereon that which we call a metaphysical
 abstraction is a reality. The Virgin-egg being in one sense abstract
 Egg-ness, or the power of becoming developed through fecundation,
 is eternal and for ever the same. And just as the fecundation
 of an egg takes place before it is dropped; so the non-eternal
 periodical germ which becomes later in</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 65 NATURE'S SYMBOLS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 symbolism the mundane egg, contains in itself, when it emerges
 from the said symbol, "the promise and potency" of all
 the Universe. Though the idea <em>per se </em>is, of course, an
 abstraction, a symbolical mode of expression, it is a symbol truly,
 as it suggests the idea of infinity as an endless circle. It brings
 before the mind's eye the picture of Kosmos emerging from and
 in boundless space, a Universe as shoreless in magnitude if not
 as endless in its objective manifestation. The simile of an egg
 also expresses the fact taught in Occultism that the primordial
 form of everything manifested, from atom to globe, from man to
 angel, is spheroidal, the sphere having been with all nations
 the emblem of eternity and infinity -- a serpent swallowing its
 tail. To realize the meaning, however, the sphere must be thought
 of as seen from its centre. The field of vision or of thought
 is like a sphere whose radii proceed from one's self in every
 direction, and extend out into space, opening up boundless vistas
 all around. It is the symbolical circle of Pascal and the Kabalists,
 "whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere,"
 a conception which enters into the compound idea of this emblem.
 </p><p>
 The "Mundane Egg" is, perhaps, one of the most universally
 adopted symbols, highly suggestive as it is, equally in the spiritual,
 physiological, and cosmological sense. Therefore, it is found
 in every world-theogony, where it is largely associated with the
 serpent symbol; the latter being everywhere, in philosophy as
 in religious symbolism, an emblem of eternity, infinitude, regeneration,
 and rejuvenation, as well as of wisdom. (See Part II. "Tree
 and Serpent and Crocodile Worship.") The mystery of apparent
 self-generation and evolution through its own creative power repeating
 in miniature the process of Cosmic evolution in the egg, both
 being due to heat and moisture under the efflux of the unseen
 creative spirit, justified fully the selection of this graphic
 symbol. The "Virgin Egg" is the microcosmic symbol of
 the macrocosmic prototype -- the "Virgin Mother" --
 Chaos or the Primeval Deep. The male Creator (under whatever name)
 springs forth from the Virgin female, the immaculate root fructified
 by the Ray. Who, if versed in astronomy and natural sciences,
 can fail to see its suggestiveness? Cosmos as receptive Nature
 is an Egg fructified -- yet left immaculate; once regarded as
 boundless, it could have no other representation than a spheroid.
 The Golden Egg was surrounded by seven natural elements (ether,
 fire, air, water), "four ready, three secret." It may
 be found</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 66 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 stated in Vishnu Purana, where elements are translated "Envelopes"
 and a <em>secret </em>one is added: "Aham-kara" (see
 Wilson's Vishnu Purana, Book I., p. 40). The original text has
 no "Aham-kara;" it mentions seven Elements without specifying
 the last three (see Part II. on "The Mundane Egg").

 </em>FALL INTO THE FOUR (<em>quaternary</em>)<em>. </em><strong>T</strong>HE
 RADIANT ESSENCE BECOMES SEVEN INSIDE, SEVEN OUTSIDE (<em>a</em>).

 </em>IN ITSELF IS THREE (<em>the triple hypostases of Brahma</em>,<em>
 or Vishnu</em>,<em> the three</em> "<em>Avasthas</em>"),<em>
 </em>CURDLES AND SPREADS IN MILK-WHITE CURDS THROUGHOUT THE DEPTHS
 OF MOTHER, THE ROOT THAT GROWS IN THE OCEAN OF LIFE (<em>b</em>)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 The use of geometrical figures and the frequent allusions to figures
 in all ancient scriptures (see Puranas, Egyptian papyri, the "Book
 of the Dead" and even the Bible) must be explained. In the
 "Book of Dzyan," as in the Kabala, there are two kinds
 of numerals to be studied -- the figures, often simple blinds,
 and the Sacred Numbers, the values of which are all known to the
 Occultists through Initiation. The former is but a conventional
 glyph, the latter is the basic symbol of all. That is to say,
 that one is purely physical, the other purely metaphysical, the
 two standing in relation to each other as matter stands to spirit
 -- the extreme poles of the ONE Substance.
 </p><p>
 As Balzac, the unconscious Occultist of French literature, says
 somewhere, the Number is to Mind the same as it is to matter:
 "an incomprehensible agent;" (perhaps so to the profane,
 never to the Initiated mind). Number is, as the great writer thought,
 an Entity, and, at the same time, a Breath emanating from what
 he called God and what we call the ALL; the breath which alone
 could organize the physical Kosmos, "where naught obtains
 its form but through the Deity, which is an effect of Number."
 It is instructive to quote Balzac's words upon this subject: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "The smallest as the most immense creations, are they not
 to be distinguished from each other by their quantities, their
 qualities, their dimensions, their forces and attributes, all
 begotten by the <strong>N</strong>UMBER? The infinitude of the
 Numbers is a fact proven to our mind, but of which no proof can
 be physically 
 </blockquote>
 <hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 67 THE POWER OF NUMBERS.</h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 given. The mathematician will tell us that the infinitude of the
 numbers exists but is not to be demonstrated. God is a Number
 endowed with motion, which is felt but not demonstrated. <em>As
 Unity</em>,<em> it begins the Numbers</em>, <em>with which it
 has nothing in common</em>. . . . . The existence of the Number
 depends on Unity, which, without a single Number, begets them
 all. . . . . What! unable either to measure the first abstraction
 yielded to you by the Deity, or to get hold of it, you still hope
 to subject to your measurements the mystery of the Secret Sciences
 which emanate from that Deity? . . . . And what would you feel,
 were I to plunge you into the abysses of <strong>M</strong>OTION,
 the Force which organizes the Number? What would you think, were
 I to add that <em>Motion </em>and <em>Number* </em>are begotten
 by the WORD, the Supreme Reason of the Seers and Prophets, who,
 in days of old, sensed the mighty Breath of God, a witness to
 which is the Apocalypse?"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 (<em>b</em>) "The radiant essence curdled and spread throughout
 the depths" of Space. From an astronomical point of view
 this is easy of explanation: it is the "milky way,"
 the world-stuff, or primordial matter in its first form. It is
 more difficult, however, to explain it in a few words or even
 lines, from the standpoint of Occult Science and Symbolism, as
 it is the most complicated of glyphs. Herein are enshrined more
 than a dozen symbols. To begin with, the whole pantheon of mysterious
 objects,** every one of them having some definite Occult meaning,
 extracted from the allegorical "churning of the ocean"
 by the Hindu gods. Besides <em>Amrita</em>,<em> </em>the water
 of life or immortality, "<em>Surabhi</em>" the "cow
 of plenty," called "the fountain of milk and curds,"
 was extracted from this "Sea of Milk." Hence the universal
 adoration of the cow and bull, one the productive, the other the
 generative power in Nature: symbols connected with both the Solar
 and the Cosmic deities. The specific properties, for occult purposes,
 of the "fourteen precious things," being explained only
 at the fourth Initiation, cannot be given here; but the following
 may be remarked. In the "Satapatha Brahmana" it is stated
 that the churning of the "Ocean of Milk" took place
 in the Satya Yug, the first age which immediately followed the
 "Deluge." As, however, neither the Rig-Veda nor
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * Number, truly; but never <strong>M</strong>OTION. It is <em>Motion
 </em>which begets the Logos, the Word, in occultism.
 </p><p>
 ** The "Fourteen precious things." The narrative or
 allegory is found in the Satapatha Brahmana and others. The Japanese
 Secret Science of the Buddhist Mystics, the<em> Yamabooshi</em>,<em>
 </em>has "seven precious things." We will speak of them,
 hereafter. </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 68 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Manu -- both preceding Vaivasvata's "deluge," that of
 the bulk of the Fourth Race -- mention this deluge, it is evident
 that it is not the "great" deluge, nor that which carried
 away Atlantis, nor even the deluge of Noah, which is meant here.
 This "churning" relates to a period before the earth's
 formation, and is in direct connection with that other universal
 legend, the various and contradictory versions of which culminated
 in the Christian dogma of the "War in Heaven," and the
 fall of the Angels (see Book II., also Revelations chap. xii.).
 The Brahmanas, reproached by the Orientalists with their versions
 on the same subjects, often clashing with each other, <em>are
 pre-eminently occult works</em>,<em> </em>hence used purposely
 as blinds. They were allowed to survive for public use and property
 only because they were and are absolutely unintelligible to the
 masses. Otherwise they would have disappeared from circulation
 as long ago as the days of Akbar.

 5. <strong>T</strong>HE ROOT REMAINS, THE LIGHT REMAINS, THE CURDS
 REMAIN, AND STILL <strong>O</strong>EAOHOO (<em>a</em>) IS ONE
 (<em>b</em>)<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em><strong>O</strong>EAOHOO is rendered <em>"Father-Mother
 of the Gods" </em>in the Commentaries, or the SIX IN ONE,<em>
 </em><i>or the septenary root from which all proceeds</i>. All
 depends upon the accent given to these seven vowels, which may
 be pronounced as <em>one</em>,<em> </em>three, or even seven syllables
 by adding an <em>e</em> after the letter "o." This mystic
 name is given out, because without a thorough mastery of the triple
 pronunciation it remains for ever ineffectual.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>This refers to the Non-Separateness of all
 that lives and has its being, whether in active or passive state.
 In one sense, Oeaohoo is the "Rootless Root of All";
 hence, one with Parabrahmam; in another sense it is a name for
 the manifested ONE LIFE, the Eternal living Unity. The "Root"
 means, as already explained, pure knowledge (Sattva),*

 <p>
 * The original for Understanding is <em>Sattva</em>,<em> </em>which
 Sankara (acharya) renders anta<em>h</em>karana. "Refined,"
 he says, "by sacrifices and other sanctifying operations."
 In the <em>Katha, </em>at p. 148, Sattva is said by Sankara to
 mean <em>buddhi</em> --<em> </em>a common use of the word. ("The

 <p>
 eternal (<em>Nitya</em>) unconditioned reality or SAT (<em>Satya</em>)<em>,
 </em>whether we call it Parabrahmam or Mulaprakriti, for these
 are the two aspects of the ONE. The "Light" is the same
 Omnipresent Spiritual Ray, which has entered and now fecundated
 the Divine Egg, and calls cosmic matter to begin its long series
 of differentiations. The curds are the first differentiation,
 and probably refer also to that cosmic matter which is supposed
 to be the origin of the "Milky Way" -- the matter we
 know. This "matter," which, according to the revelation
 received from the primeval Dhyani-Buddhas, is, during the periodical
 sleep of the Universe, of the ultimate tenuity conceivable to
 the eye of the perfect Bodhisatva -- this matter, radical and
 cool, becomes, at the first reawakening of cosmic motion, scattered
 through Space; appearing, when seen from the Earth, in clusters
 and lumps, like curds in thin milk. These are the seeds of the
 future worlds, the "Star-stuff."

 (<em>a</em>) The essence of darkness being absolute light, Darkness
 is taken as the appropriate allegorical representation of the
 condition of the Universe during Pralaya, or the term of absolute
 rest, or non-being, as it appears to our finite minds. The "fire,"
 "heat," and "motion" here spoken of, are,
 of course, not the fire, heat, and motion of physical science,
 but the underlying abstractions, the noumena, or the soul, of
 the essence of these material manifestations -- the "things

 <p>
 ments of the laboratory, and which even the mind cannot grasp,
 although it can equally little avoid the conclusion that these
 underlying essences of things must exist. Fire and Water, or Father*
 and Mother, may be taken here to mean the divine Ray and Chaos.
 "Chaos, from this union with Spirit obtaining sense, shone
 with pleasure, and thus was produced the Protogonos (the first-born
 light)," says a fragment of Hermas. Damascius calls it Dis
 in "Theogony" -- "The disposer of all things."
 (See Cory's "<em>Ancient Fragments</em>,"<em> </em>p.
 314.)
 </p><p>
 According to the Rosicrucian tenets, as handled and explained
 by the profane for once correctly, if only partially, so "Light
 and Darkness are identical in themselves, being only divisible
 in the human mind"; and according to Robert Fludd, "Darkness
 adopted illumination in order to make itself visible" (<em>On
 Rosenkranz</em>)<em>. </em>According to the tenets of Eastern
 Occultism, <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS is the one true actuality,
 the basis and the root of light, without which the latter could
 never manifest itself, nor even exist. Light is matter, and <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS
 pure Spirit. Darkness, in its radical, metaphysical basis, is
 subjective and absolute light; while the latter in all its seeming
 effulgence and glory, is merely a mass of shadows, as it can never
 be eternal, and is simply an illusion, or Maya.
 </p><p>
 Even in the mind-baffling and science-harassing Genesis, light
 is created out of darkness "and darkness was upon the face
 of the deep" (ch. i. v. 2.) -- and not <em>vice versa. </em>"In
 him (in darkness) was life; and the life <em>was the light of
 men</em>"<em> </em>(John i. 4). A day may come when the eyes
 of men will be opened; and then they may comprehend better than
 they do now, that verse in the Gospel of John that says "And
 the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth
 it not." They will see then that the word "darkness"
 does not apply to man's spiritual eyesight, but indeed to "Darkness,"
 the absolute, that comprehendeth not (cannot cognize) transient
 light, however transcendent to human eyes. <em>Demon est Deus
 inversus. </em>The devil is now called Darkness by the Church,
 whereas, in the Bible he is called the "Son of God"
 (see Job), the bright star of the early morning, Lucifer (see
 Isaiah). There is a whole philosophy of dogmatic craft in the
 reason why the first Archangel, who sprang from the depths of
 Chaos, was called Lux (Lucifer), the "Luminous Son of the
 Morning," or man-

 the Vedic deities, in round numbers, or more accurately 33 --
 a sacred number. They are the 12 Adityas, the 8 Vasus, the 11

 This is the root-number of the Hindu Pantheon, which enumerates

 because, firstly, he is that which the Greek philosophers called
 the Logos, the Verbum of the Thought Divine; and secondly, because
 in Esoteric philosophy this first manifestation, being the synthesis
 or the aggregate of Universal Wisdom, Oeaohoo, "the Son of
 the Son," contains in himself the Seven Creative Hosts (The
 Sephiroth), and is thus the essence of manifested Wisdom. "He
 who bathes in the light of Oeaohoo will never be deceived by the

 Kwan-Shai-Yin is identical with, and an equivalent of the Sanskrit
 <em>Avalokiteshwara</em>, and as such he is an androgynous deity,
 like the Tetragrammaton and all the Logoi* of antiquity. It is
 only by some sects in China that he is anthropomorphized and represented
 with female attributes,** when, under his female aspect, he becomes
 Kwan-Yin, the goddess of mercy, called the "Divine Voice."***
 The latter is the patron deity of Thibet and of the island of
 Puto in China, where both deities have a number of monasteries.****
 (See Part II. Kwan-Shai-Yin and Kwan-yin.)

 <p>
 * Hence all the higher gods of antiquity are all "Sons of
 the Mother" before they become those of the "Father."
 The Logoi, like Jupiter or Zeus, Son of Kronos-Saturn, "Infinite
 Time" (or Kala), in their origin were represented as male-female.
 Zeus is said to be the "beautiful Virgin," and Venus
 is made bearded. Apollo is originally bisexual, so is Brahma-Vach
 in Manu and the Puranas. Osiris is interchangeable with Isis,
 and Horus is of both sexes. Finally St. John's vision in Revelation,
 that of the Logos, who is now connected with Jesus -- is hermaphrodite,
 for he is described as having female breasts. So is the Tetragrammaton
 = Jehovah. But there are two Avalokiteshwaras in Esotericism;
 the first and the second <em>Logos.</em>

 nose. When asking the meaning of the masquerade we were answered
 that it was Jesu-Maria blended in one, and that it was done by
 the permission of the Padri, as the zealous convert had no money
 to purchase two statues or "idols" as they, very properly,
 were called by a witness -- another but a non-converted Hindu.
 Blasphemous this will appear to a dogmatic Christian, but the
 Theosophist and the Occultist must award the palm of logic to
 the converted Hindu. The esoteric Christos in the <em>gnosis </em>is,
 of course, sexless, but in exoteric <em>theology </em>he is male
 and female.

 of the Ogdoad (Aditi, in a certain sense, with her eight sons),
 is the Holy Ghost and the Creator of all, as in the ancient systems.
 The "father" is a far later invention. The earliest
 manifested Logos was female everywhere -- the mother of the seven
 planetary powers.

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 73 THE DRAGON AND THE LOGOI.</h6>
 
 <p>
 (<em>b</em>) "The "Dragon of Wisdom" is the One,
 the "Eka" (Sanskrit) or Saka. It is curious that Jehovah's
 name in Hebrew should also be One, Echod. "His name is Echod":
 say the Rabbins. The philologists ought to decide which of the
 two is derived from the other -- linguistically and symbolically:
 surely, not the Sanskrit? The "One" and the Dragon are
 expressions used by the ancients in connection with their respective
 Logoi. Jehovah -- esoterically (as Elohim) -- is also the Serpent
 or Dragon that tempted Eve, and the "Dragon" is an old
 glyph for "Astral Light" (Primordial Principle), "which
 is the Wisdom of Chaos." Archaic philosophy, recognizing
 neither Good nor Evil as a fundamental or independent power, but
 starting from the Absolute ALL (Universal Perfection eternally),
 traced both through the course of natural evolution to pure Light
 condensing gradually into form, hence becoming Matter or Evil.
 It was left with the early and ignorant Christian fathers to degrade
 the philosophical and highly scientific idea of this emblem (the
 Dragon) into the absurd superstition called the "Devil."
 They took it from the later Zoroastrians, who saw devils or the
 Evil in the Hindu Devas<em>, </em>and the word Evil thus became
 by a double transmutation D'Evil in every tongue (Diabolos, Diable,
 Diavolo, Teufel). But the Pagans have always shown a philosophical
 discrimination in their symbols. The primitive symbol of the serpent
 symbolised divine Wisdom and Perfection, and had always stood
 for psychical Regeneration and Immortality. Hence -- Hermes, calling
 the serpent the most spiritual of all beings; Moses, initiated
 in the wisdom of Hermes, following suit in Genesis; the Gnostic's
 Serpent with the seven vowels over its head, being the emblem
 of the seven hierarchies of the Septenary or Planetary Creators.
 Hence, also, the Hindu serpent Sesha or Ananta, "the Infinite,"
 a name of Vishnu, whose first Vahan or vehicle on the primordial
 waters is this serpent.* Yet they all made a difference between
 the good and the bad Serpent (the Astral Light of
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Like the <em>logoi </em>and the Hierarchies of Powers, however,
 the "Serpents" have to be distinguished one from the
 other. Sesha or Ananta, "the couch of Vishnu," is an
 allegorical abstraction, symbolizing infinite Time in Space, which
 contains the germ and throws off periodically the efflorescence
 of this germ, the <em>manifested </em>Universe; whereas, the gnostic
 <em>Ophis </em>contained the same triple symbolism in its seven
 vowels as the One, Three and Seven-syllabled <em>Oeaohoo </em>of
 the Archaic doctrine; <em>i.e.</em>, the One Unmanifested Logos,
 the Second manifested, the triangle concreting into the Quaternary
 or Tetragrammaton, and the rays of the latter on the material
 plane.</p><hr>

 <p>
 the Kabalists) -- between the former, the embodiment of divine
 Wisdom in the region of the Spiritual, and the latter, Evil, on
 the plane of matter.* Jesus accepted the serpent as a synonym
 of Wisdom, and this formed part of his teaching: "Be ye wise
 as serpents," he says. "In the beginning, before Mother
 became Father-Mother, the fiery Dragon moved in the infinitudes
 alone" (<em>Book of Sarparajni.</em>)<em> </em>The Aitareya
 Brahmana calls the Earth Sarparajni, "the Serpent Queen,"
 and "the Mother of all that moves." Before our globe
 became egg-shaped (and the Universe also) "a long trail of
 Cosmic dust (or fire mist) moved and writhed like a serpent in
 Space." The "Spirit of God moving on Chaos" was
 symbolized by every nation in the shape of a fiery serpent breathing
 fire and light upon the primordial waters, until it had incubated
 cosmic matter and made it assume the annular shape of a serpent
 with its tail in its mouth -- which symbolises not only Eternity
 and Infinitude, but also the globular shape of all the bodies
 formed within the Universe from that fiery mist. The Universe,
 as well as the Earth and Man, cast off periodically, serpent-like,
 their old skins, to assume new ones after a time of rest. The
 serpent is, surely, a not less graceful or a more unpoetical image
 than the caterpillar and chrysalis from which springs the butterfly,
 the Greek emblem of Psyche, the human soul. The "Dragon"
 was also the symbol of the Logos with the Egyptians, as with the
 Gnostics. In the "Book of Hermes," Pymander, the oldest
 and the most spiritual of the Logoi of the Western Continent,
 appears to Hermes in the shape of a Fiery Dragon of "Light,
 Fire, and Flame." Pymander, the "Thought Divine"
 personified, says: The Light is me, I am the Nous (the mind or
 Manu), I am thy God, and I am far older than the human principle
 which escapes from the shadow ("<em>Darkness</em>,"<em>
 </em>or the concealed Deity). I am the germ of thought, the resplendent
 <em>Word, </em>the <em>Son </em>of God. All that thus sees and
 hears in thee is the <em>Verbum </em>of the Master, it is the
 Thought (<em>Mahat</em>)<em> </em>which is God, the Father.**

 *The Astral Light, or the AEther, of the ancient pagans (for the
 name of Astral Light is quite modern) is Spirit . . . . Matter.
 Beginning with the pure spiritual plane, it becomes grosser as
 it descends until it becomes the <em>Maya </em>or the tempting
 and deceitful serpent on our plane.
 </p><p>
 ** By "God, the Father," the seventh principle in Man
 and Kosmos are here unmistakeably meant, this principle being
 inseparable in its Esse and Nature from the seventh Cosmic principle.
 In one sense it is the Logos of the Greeks and the Avalokiteswara

 The celestial Ocean, the 'Ether . . . . is the <em>Breath </em>of
 the Father, the life-giving principle, the <em>Mother</em>, the
 Holy Spirit, for these are not separated, and their union is LIFE."
 </p><p>
 Here we find the unmistakeable echo of the Archaic Secret Doctrine,
 as now expounded. Only the latter does not place at the head and
 Evolution of Life "the Father," who comes third and
 is the "Son of the Mother," but the "Eternal and
 Ceaseless Breath of the ALL." The <em>Mahat </em>(Understanding,
 Universal Mind, Thought, etc.), before it manifests itself as
 Brahma or Siva, appears as Vishnu, says <em>Sankhya Sara </em>(p.
 16); hence <em>Mahat </em>has several aspects, just as the <em>logos</em>
 has.<em> Mahat </em>is called the Lord, in the <em>Primary </em>Creation,
 and is, in this sense, Universal Cognition or <em>Thought Divine</em>;<em>
 </em>but, "That Mahat which was first produced is (afterwards)
 called <em>Ego-ism</em>, when it is born as "I," that
 is said to be the <em>second </em>Creation"<em> </em>(<em>Anugita</em>,
 ch. xxvi.). And the translator (an able and learned Brahmin, not
 a European Orientalist) explains in a foot-note (6), "<em>i.e.</em>,
 when Mahat develops into the feeling of Self-Consciousness --
 I -- then it assumes the name of Egoism," which, translated
 into our esoteric phraseology, means when <em>Mahat </em>is transformed
 into the human <em>Manas </em>(or even that of the finite gods),
 and becomes <em>Aham</em>-ship.<em> </em>Why it is called the
 <em>Mahat </em>of the <em>Second </em>creation (or the <em>ninth</em>,
 that of the <em>Kumara </em>in<em> Vishnu Purana</em>)<em> </em>will
 be explained in Book II. The "Sea of Fire" is then the
 Super-Astral (<em>i.e.</em>, noumenal) Light, the first radiation
 from the <em>Root, </em>the Mulaprakriti, the undifferentiated
 Cosmic Substance, which becomes <em>Astral </em>Matter. It is
 also called the "Fiery Serpent," as above described.
 If the student bears in mind that there is but One Universal Element,
 which is infinite, unborn, and undying, and that all the rest
 -- as in the world of phenomena -- are but so many various differentiated
 aspects and transformations (correlations, they are now called)
 of that One, from Cosmical down to microcosmical effects, from
 super-human down to human and sub-human beings, the totality,
 in short, of objective existence -- then the first and chief difficulty
 will disappear and Occult Cosmology may be mastered.* All the
 Kabalists and Occultists, Eastern and Western, recognise (<i>a</i>)

 the identity of "Father-Mother" with primordial <em>AEther</em>

 before the evolution of the "Son," cosmically <em>Fohat,
 </em>for it is Cosmic Electricity. "Fohat hardens and scatters
 the seven brothers" (Book III. Dzyan); which means that the
 primordial Electric Entity -- for the Eastern Occultists insist
 that Electricity is an Entity -- electrifies into life, and separates
 primordial stuff or pregenetic matter into atoms, themselves the
 source of all life and consciousness. "There exists an universal
 <em>agent unique </em>of all forms and of life, that is called
 Od,** Ob, and Aour, active and passive, positive and negative,
 like day and night: it is the first light in Creation" (Eliphas
 Levi's Kabala): --- the first Light of the primordial Elohim --
 the Adam, "male and female" -- or (scientifically) ELECTRICITY
 AND LIFE.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) The ancients represented it by a serpent, for "Fohat
 hisses as he glides hither and thither" (in zigzags). The
 Kabala figures it with the Hebrew letter Teth <img src="sd1-76.gif" align="MIDDLE">,
 whose symbol is the serpent which played such a prominent part
 in the Mysteries. Its universal value is nine, for it is the ninth
 letter of the alphabet and the ninth door of the fifty portals
 or gateways that lead to the concealed mysteries of being. It
 is the magical agent <em>par excellence</em>, and designates in
 Hermetic philosophy "Life infused into primordial matter,"
 the essence that composes all things, and the spirit that determines
 their form. But there are two secret Hermetical operations, one
 spiritual, the other material-correlative, and for ever united.
 "Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtile
 from the solid . . . that which ascends from earth to heaven and
 descends again from heaven to earth. It (the subtile light), is
 the strong force of every force, for it conquers every subtile
 thing and penetrates into every solid. Thus was the world formed"

 Universe evolves, when its primary substance is transformed from
 the state of fire into that of air, then into water, etc. Heracleitus
 of Ephesus maintained that the one principle that underlies all
 phenomena in Nature is fire. The intelligence that moves the Universe
 is fire, and fires is intelligence. And while Anaximenes said
 the same of air, and Thales of Miletus (600 years B.C.) of water,
 the Esoteric Doctrine reconciles all those philosophers by showing
 that though each was right the system of none was complete.

 <strong>W</strong>HERE IS THE SPIRIT OF THE FLAME THAT BURNS IN

 IS THAT, AND THAT IS LIGHT; THE WHITE BRILLIANT SON OF THE DARK
 HIDDEN FATHER (<em>a</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>The answer to the first question, suggested
 by the second, which is the reply of the teacher to the pupil,
 contains in a single phrase one of the most essential truths of
 occult philosophy. It indicates the existence of things imperceptible
 to our physical senses which are of far greater importance, more
 real and more permanent, than those that appeal to these senses
 themselves. Before the Lanoo can hope to understand the transcendentally
 metaphysical problem contained in the first question he must be
 able to answer the second, while the very answer he gives to the
 second will furnish him with the clue to the correct reply to
 the first.
 </p><p>
 In the Sanscrit Commentary on this Stanza, the terms used for
 the concealed and the unrevealed Principle are many. In the earliest
 MSS. of Indian literature this Unrevealed, Abstract Deity has
 no name. It is called generally "<em>That</em>" (<em>Tad
 </em>in Sanskrit), and means all that is, was, and will be, or
 that can be so received by the human mind.
 </p><p>
 Among such appellations, given, of course, only in esoteric philosophy,
 as the "Unfathomable Darkness," the "Whirlwind,"
 etc. -- it is also called the "It of the Kalahansa, the Kala-ham-sa,"
 and even the "Kali Hamsa," (Black swan). Here the <em>m</em>
 and the <em>n</em> are convertible, and</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 78 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 both sound like the nasal French <em>an</em> or<em> am, </em>or,
 again, <em>en</em> or<em> em </em>(<em>Ennui</em>,<em> Embarras</em>,<em>
 </em>etc.) As in the Hebrew Bible, many a mysterious sacred name
 in Sanscrit conveys to the profane ear no more than some ordinary,
 and often vulgar word, because it is concealed anagrammatically
 or otherwise. This word of Hansa or esoterically "hamsa"
 is just such a case. Hamsa is equal to a-ham-sa, three words meaning
 "I am he" (in English), while divided in still another
 way it will read "So-ham," "he (is) I" --
 Soham being equal to Sah, "he," and aham, "I,"
 or "I am he." In this alone is contained the universal
 mystery, the doctrine of the identity of man's essence with god-essence,
 for him who understands the language of wisdom. Hence the glyph
 of, and the allegory about, Kalahansa (or hamsa), and the name
 given to Brahma neuter (later on, to the male Brahma) of "Hansa-Vahana,"
 he who uses the Hansa as his vehicle." The same word may
 be read "Kalaham-sa" or "I am I" in the eternity
 of Time, answering to the Biblical, or rather Zoroastrian "I
 am that I am." The same doctrine is found in the Kabala,
 as witness the following extract from an unpublished MS. by Mr.
 S. Liddell McGregor Mathers, the learned Kabalist: "The three
 pronouns <img src="sd1-78a.gif" align="MIDDLE">, <em> </em>Hoa,
 Atah, Ani; He, Thou, I; are used to symbolize the ideas of Macroprosopus
 and Microprosopus in the Hebrew Qabalah. Hoa, "He,"
 is applied to the hidden and concealed Macroprosopus; Atah, "Thou,"
 to Microprosopus; and Ani, "I," to the latter when He
 is represented as speaking. (See <em>Lesser Holy Assembly</em>,
 204<em> et seq.</em>) It is to be noted that each of these names
 consists of three letters, of which the letter Aleph <img src="sd1-78b.gif" align="MIDDLE">,
 A, forms the conclusion of the first word Hoa, and the commencement
 of Atah and Ani, as if it were the connecting link between them.
 But <img src="sd1-78b.gif" align="MIDDLE"> is the symbol of the
 Unity and consequently of the unvarying Idea of the Divine operating
 through all these. But behind the <img src="sd1-78b.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 in the name Hoa are the letters <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 and <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="MIDDLE">, the symbols of the
 numbers Six and Five, the Male and the Female, the Hexagram and
 the Pentagram. And the numbers of these three words, Hoa Atah
 Ani, are 12, 406, and 61, which are resumed in the key numbers
 of 3, 10, and 7, by the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers, which is
 a form of the exegetical rule of Temura."
 </p><p>
 It is useless to attempt to explain the mystery in full. Materialists
 and the men of modern Science will never understand it, since,
 in order</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 79 PRIMEVAL RADIATIONS FROM THE UNITY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 to obtain clear perception of it, one has first of all to admit
 the postulate of a universally diffused, omnipresent, eternal
 Deity in Nature; secondly, to have fathomed the mystery of electricity
 in its true essence; and thirdly, to credit man with being the
 septenary symbol, on the terrestrial plane, of the One Great <strong>U</strong>NIT
 (the Logos), which is Itself the Seven-vowelled sign, the Breath
 crystallized into the <strong>W</strong>ORD.* He who believes
 in all this, has also to believe in the multiple combination of
 the seven planets of Occultism and of the Kabala, with the twelve
 zodiacal signs; to attribute, as we do, to each planet and to
 each constellation an influence which, in the words of Ely Star
 (a French Occultist), "is proper to it, beneficent or maleficent,
 and this, after the planetary Spirit which rules it, who, in his
 turn, is capable of influencing men and things which are found
 in harmony with him and with which he has any affinity."
 For these reasons, and since few believe in the foregoing, all
 that can now be given is that in both cases the symbol of Hansa
 (whether "I," "He," Goose or Swan) is an important
 symbol, representing, for instance, Divine Wisdom, Wisdom in darkness
 beyond the reach of men. For all exoteric purposes, Hansa, as
 every Hindu knows, is a fabulous bird, which, when given milk
 mixed with water for its food (in the allegory) separated the
 two, drinking the milk and leaving the water; thus showing inherent
 wisdom -- milk standing symbolically for spirit, and water for
 matter.
 </p><p>
 That this allegory is very ancient and dates from the very earliest
 archaic period, is shown by the mention (in Bhagavata Purana)
 of a certain caste named "Hamsa" or "Hansa,"
 which was the "one caste" <em>par excellence</em>; when
 far back in the mists of a forgotten past there was among the
 Hindus only "One Veda, One Deity, One Caste." There
 is also a range in the Himalayas, described in the old books as
 being situated north of Mount Meru, called "Hamsa,"
 and connected with episodes pertaining to the history of religious
 mysteries and initiations. As to the name of Kala-Hansa being
 the supposed vehicle of Brahma-Prajapati, in the exoteric texts
 and translations of the

 * This is again similar to the doctrine of Fichte and German Pantheists.
 The former reveres Jesus as the great teacher who inculcated the
 unity of the spirit of man with the God-Spirit (the Adwaita doctrine)
 or universal Principle. It is difficult to find a single speculation
 in Western metaphysics which has not been anticipated by Archaic
 Eastern philosophy. From Kant to Herbert Spencer, it is all a
 more or less distorted echo of the Dwaita, Adwaita, and Vedantic
 doctrines generally.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 80 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Orientalists, it is quite a mistake. Brahma, the neuter, is called
 by them Kala-Hansa and Brahma, the male, Hansa-Vahana, because
 forsooth "his vehicle or Vahan is a swan or goose" (vide
 "the Hindu Classical Dictionary.") This is a purely
 exoteric gloss. Esoterically and logically, if Brahma, the infinite,
 is all that is described by the Orientalists, namely, agreeably
 with the Vedantic texts, an abstract deity in no way characterised
 by the description of any human attributes, and it is still maintained
 that he or it is called Kala-Hansa -- then how can it ever become
 the Vahan of Brahma, the manifested finite god? It is quite the
 reverse. The "Swan or goose" (Hansa) is the symbol of
 that male or temporary deity, as he, the emanation of the primordial
 Ray, is made to serve as a Vahan or vehicle for that divine Ray,
 which otherwise could not manifest itself in the Universe, being,
 antiphrastically, itself an emanation of "Darkness"
 -- for our human intellect, at any rate. It is Brahma, then, who
 is Kala-Hansa, and the Ray, the Hansa-Vahana.
 </p><p>
 As to the strange symbol chosen, it is equally suggestive; the
 true mystic significance being the idea of a universal matrix,
 figured by the primordial waters of the "deep," or the
 opening for the reception, and subsequently for the issue, of
 that one ray (the Logos), which contains in itself the other seven
 procreative rays or powers (the logoi or builders). Hence the
 choice by the Rosecroix of the aquatic fowl -- whether swan or
 pelican,* with seven young ones for a symbol, modified and adapted
 to the religion of every country. En-Soph is called the "Fiery
 Soul of the Pelican" in the Book of Numbers.** (See Part
 II. "The Hidden Deity and its Symbols and Glyphs.")

 or<em> pelecanus</em>, it is no matter, as it is an aquatic bird
 floating or moving on the waters like the Spirit, and then issuing
 from those waters to give birth to other beings. The true significance
 of the symbol of the Eighteenth Degree of the Rose-Croix is precisely
 this, though poetised later on into the motherly feeling of the
 Pelican rending its bosom to feed its seven little ones with its
 blood.
 </p><p>
 ** The reason why Moses forbids eating the pelican and swan, classing
 the two among the unclean fowls, and permits eating "bald
 locusts, beetles, and the grasshopper after his kind" (Leviticus
 xi. and Deuteronomy xiv.) is a purely physiological one, and has
 to do with mystic symbology only in so far as the word "unclean,"
 like every other word, ought not to be read and understood literally,

 from it at the end of the divine incubation as Brahma or Prajapati,
 a progenitor of the future Universe into which he expands. He
 is Purusha (spirit), but he is also Prakriti (matter). Therefore
 it is only after separating himself into two halves -- Brahma-vach
 (the female) and Brahma-Viraj (the male), that the Prajapati becomes

 <p>
 Now, why is Light called in the Stanzas "cold flame"?
 Because in the order of Cosmic evolution (as taught by the Occultist),
 the energy that actuates matter after its first formation into
 atoms is generated on our plane by Cosmic heat; and because Kosmos,
 in the sense of dissociated matter, was not, before that period.
 The first primordial matter, eternal and coeval with Space, "which
 has neither a beginning nor an end," is "neither hot
 nor cold, but is of its own special nature," says the Commentary
 (Book II). Heat and cold are relative qualities and pertain to
 the realms of the manifested worlds, which all proceed from the
 manifested <em>Hyle</em>, which, in its absolutely latent aspect,
 is referred to as the "cold Virgin," and when awakened
 to life, as the "Mother." The ancient Western Cosmogonic
 myths state that at first there was but cold mist which was the
 Father, and the prolific slime (the Mother, Ilus or Hyle), from
 which crept forth the Mundane snake-matter, (<em>Isis, </em>vol.
 i., p. 146). Primordial matter, then, before it emerges from the
 plane of the never-manifesting, and awakens to the thrill of action
 under the impulse of Fohat, is but "a cool Radiance, colourless,
 formless, tasteless, and devoid of every quality and aspect."
 Even such are her first-born, the "four sons," who "are
 One, and become Seven," -- the entities, by whose qualifications
 and names the ancient Eastern Occultists called the four of the
 seven primal "centres of Forces," or atoms, that develop
 later into the great Cosmic "Elements," now divided
 into the seventy or so sub-elements, known to science. The four
 primal natures of the first Dhyan Chohans, are the so-called (for
 want of better terms) "Akasic," "Ethereal,"
 "Watery," and "Fiery," answering, in the terminology
 of practical occultism, to scientific definitions of gases, which,
 to convey a clear idea to both Occultists and laymen, must be
 defined as Parahydrogenic,* Paraoxygenic, Oxyhydrogenic, and Ozonic,
 or perhaps Nitr-ozonic; the latter forces or gases (in Occultism,
 supersensuous, yet atomic substances) being the most effective
 and active when energising on the plane of more grossly differentiated
 matter.** These are both electro-positive and electro-negative.

 and recombining in a certain way (or dissociating) the "Elements"
 by means of astral fire that the greatest phenomena are produced.

 10. <strong>F</strong>ATHER-<strong>M</strong>OTHER SPIN A WEB
 WHOSE UPPER END IS FASTENED TO SPIRIT<em> </em>(<em>Purusha</em>)<em>,
 </em>THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DARKNESS, AND THE LOWER ONE TO MATTER
 (<em>Prakriti</em>)<em> </em>ITS<em> </em>(<em>the Spirit's</em>)<em>
 </em>SHADOWY END; AND THIS WEB IS THE UNIVERSE SPUN OUT OF THE
 TWO SUBSTANCES MADE IN ONE, WHICH IS SWABHAVAT (<em>a</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) In the Mandukya (Mundaka) Upanishad it is written,
 "As a spider throws out and retracts its web, as herbs spring
 up in the ground . . . so is the Universe derived from the undecaying
 one" (I. 1. 7). Brahma, as "the germ of unknown Darkness,"
 is the material from which all evolves and develops "as the
 web from the spider, as foam from the water," etc. This is
 only graphic and true, if Brahma the "Creator" is, as
 a term, derived from the root <em>brih, </em>to increase or expand.
 Brahma "expands" and becomes the Universe woven out
 of his own substance.
 </p><p>
 The same idea has been beautifully expressed by Goethe, who says:
 </p><blockquote>
 "Thus at the roaring loom of Time I ply,<br>
 And weave for God the garment thou see'st Him by."

 The expanding of the Universe under the breath of <strong>F</strong>IRE
 is very suggestive in the light of the "Fire mist" period
 of which modern science speaks so much, and knows in reality so
 little.

 heavenly bodies into their primeval one element, explains the
 commentary. "Once disintegrated into its primal constituent
 by getting within the attraction and reach of a focus, or centre
 of heat (energy), of which many are carried about to and fro in
 space, a body, whether alive or dead, will be vapourised and held
 in "the bosom of the Mother" until Fohat, gathering
 a few of the clusters of Cosmic matter (nebulae) will, by giving
 it an impulse, set it in motion anew, develop the required heat,
 and then leave it to follow its own new growth.
 </p><p>
 The expanding and contracting of the Web -- <em>i.e., </em>the
 world stuff or atoms -- expresses here the pulsatory movement;
 for it is the regular contraction and expansion of the infinite
 and shoreless Ocean of that which we may call the noumenon of
 matter emanated by Swabhavat, which causes the universal vibration
 of atoms. But it is also suggestive of something else. It shows
 that the ancients were acquainted with that which is now the puzzle
 of many scientists and especially of astronomers: the cause of
 the first ignition of matter or the world-stuff, the paradox of
 the heat produced by the refrigerative contraction and other such
 Cosmic riddles. For it points unmistakeably to a knowledge by
 the ancients of such phenomena. "There is heat internal and
 heat external in every atom," say the manuscript Commentaries,
 to which the writer has had access; "the breath of the Father
 (or Spirit) and the breath (or heat) of the Mother (matter);"
 and they give explanations which show that the modern theory of
 the extinction of the solar fires by loss of heat through radiation,
 is erroneous. The assumption is false even on the Scientists'
 own admission. For as Professor Newcomb points out (Popular Astronomy,
 pp. 506-508), "by losing heat, a gaseous body contracts,
 and the heat generated by the contraction exceeds that which it
 had to lose in order to produce the contraction." This paradox,
 that a body gets hotter as the shrinking produced by its getting
 colder is greater, led to long disputes. The surplus of heat,
 it was argued, was lost by radiation, and to assume that the temperature
 is not lowered <i>pari</i> <em>passu </em>with a decrease of volume
 under a constant pressure, is to set at nought the law of Charles
 (Nebular Theory, Winchell). Contraction develops heat, it is true;
 but contraction (from cooling) is incapable of developing the
 whole amount of heat at any time existing in the mass, or even
 of maintaining a body at a constant temperature, etc. Professor
 Winchell tries to reconcile the paradox -- only a seeming one
 in fact, as</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 85 CONSCIOUS ELECTRICITY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Homer Lanes proved, -- by suggesting "something besides heat."
 "May it not be," he asks, "simply a repulsion among
 the molecules, which varies according to some law of the distance?"
 But even this will be found irreconcileable, unless this "something
 besides heat" is ticketed "Causeless Heat," the
 "Breath of Fire," the all-creative Force Plus ABSOLUTE
 INTELLIGENCE, which physical science is not likely to accept.
 </p><p>
 However it may be, the reading of this Stanza shows it, notwithstanding
 its archaic phraseology, to be more scientific than even modern
 science.

 It is through Fohat that the ideas of the Universal Mind are impressed
 upon matter. Some faint idea of the nature of Fohat may be gathered
 from the appellation "Cosmic Electricity" sometimes
 applied to it; but to the commonly known properties of electricity
 must, in this case, be added others, including intelligence. It
 is of interest to note that modern science has come to the conclusion,
 that all cerebration and brain-activity are attended by electrical
 phenomena. (<em>For further details as to </em>"<em>Fohat</em>"<em>
