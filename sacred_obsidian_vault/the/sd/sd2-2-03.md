 <h4>THE "HOLY OF HOLIES."<br>
 ITS DEGRADATION.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE<em> Sanctum Sanctorum </em>of the Ancients,<em>
 i.e</em>., that recess on the Western side of the Temple which
 was enclosed on three sides by blank walls and had its only aperture
 or door hung over with a curtain -- also called the <em>Adytum
 </em>-- was common to all ancient nations.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, a great difference is found between the secret meanings
 of this symbolical place, in the esotericism of the Pagans and
 that of later Jews; though the symbology of it was originally
 identical throughout the ancient Races and Nations. The <em>Gentiles,
 </em>by placing in the Adytum a <em>sarcophagus, </em>or a tomb
 (<em>taphos</em>)<em>, </em>and the solar-god to whom the temple
 was consecrated, held it, as Pantheists, in the greatest veneration.
 They regarded it -- in its esoteric meaning -- as the symbol <em>of
 resurrection, </em>cosmic, solar (or diurnal), and human. It embraced
 the wide range of periodical and (in time) punctual, Manvantaras,
 or the re-awakenings of Kosmos, Earth, and Man to new existences;
 the sun being the most poetical and also the most grandiose symbol
 of the same in heaven, and man -- in his re-incarnations -- on
 Earth. The Jews -- whose realism, if judged by the dead letter,
 was as practical and gross in the days of Moses as it is now*
 -- in the course of their estrangement from the gods of their
 pagan neighbours, consummated a national and levitical polity,
 by the device of setting forth their Holy of Holies as the most
 solemn sign of their Monotheism -- exoterically; while seeing
 in it but a universal phallic symbol -- esoterically. While the
 Kabalists knew but Ain-Soph and the "gods" of the Mysteries,
 the Levites had no tomb, no god in their adytum but the "Sacred"
 Ark of the Covenant -- their "Holy of Holies."
 </p><p>
 When the esoteric meaning of this recess is made clear, however,
 the profane will be better able to understand why David danced
 "uncovered" before the <em>ark </em>of the Covenant,
 and was so anxious to appear <em>vile</em> for the sake of his
 "Lord," and <em>base </em>in his own sight. (<em>See</em>
 2<em> Samuel vi. </em>16-22.)

 <p>
 a long dissertation upon it in his Greek dictionary, and who never
 breathes a word about it in the Hebrew lexicon, explains it thus:
 -- "[[<em>Arche</em>]] in this application answers to the
 Hebrew <em>rasit </em>or wisdom . . . . a word which had the meaning
 of the emblem of the female generative power, the Arg or <em>Arca,
 </em>in which the germ of all nature was supposed to float or
 brood on the great abyss during the interval which took place
 after every mundane cycle." Quite so; and the Jewish <em>ark
 of the</em> <em>Covenant had precisely the same significance;
 </em>with the supplementary addition that, instead of a beautiful
 and chaste <em>sarcophagus </em>(the symbol of the matrix of Nature
 and resurrection) as in the <em>Sanctum sanctorum of</em> the
 pagans, they had the ark made still more <em>realistic </em>in
 its construction by the two cherubs set up on the coffer or ark
 of the covenant, facing each other, with their wings spread in
 such a manner as to form a perfect <em>yoni </em>(as now seen
 in India). Besides which, this generative symbol had its significance
 enforced by the four mystic letters of Jehovah's name, namely,
 <img src="sd1-355b.gif" align="BOTTOM">; or <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 meaning <em>Jod </em>(<em>membrum Virile, </em>see Kabala); <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 (the<em> womb</em>); <img src="sd1-90.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (Vau,
 a crook or a hook, a nail), and <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 again, meaning also "an opening"; the whole forming
 the perfect <em>bisexual</em> emblem or symbol or Y (e) H (o)
 V (a) H, the male and female symbol.
 </p><p>
 Perhaps also, when people realise the true meaning of the office
 and title of the <em>Kadesh Kadeshim, </em>"the holy ones,"
 or "the consecrated to <em>the temple of the Lord,</em>"<em>
 </em>-- the "Holy of Holies" of the latter may assume
 an aspect far from edifying.
 </p><p>
 Iacchus again is Iao or Jehovah; and Baal or Adon, like Bacchus,
 was a phallic god. "Who shall ascend into the hill (the high
 place) of the Lord?" asks the holy king David, "who
 shall stand in the place of his <em>Kadushu <img src="sd2-460.gif" align="BOTTOM">?"
 (Psalms xxiv. 3). Kadesh may mean in one sense to devote, hallow,
 sanctify, </em>and even to initiate or to set apart; but it also
 means the ministry of lascivious rites (the Venus-worship) and
 the true interpretation of the word Kadesh is bluntly rendered
 <em>in Deuteronomy </em>xxiii. 17; <em>Hosea </em>iv. 14; and
 <em>Genesis </em>xxxvii. from verses 15 to 22. The "holy"
 Kadeshuth of the <em>Bible </em>were identical, as to the duties
 of their office, with the Nautch-girls of the later Hindu pagodas.
 The Hebrew <em>Kadeshim</em>, or galli, lived "by the house
 of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove,"
 or the bust of Venus-Astarte, says verse the seventh in the twenty-third
 chapter of 2 Kings.

 The dance performed by David round the ark was the "circle-dance."
 said to have been prescribed by the Amazons for the Mysteries.
 Such was the dance of the daughters of Shiloh (<em>Judges </em>xxi<em>.
 </em>21, 23 <em>et passim</em>)<em>,</em> and the leaping of the
 prophets of Baal (I<em> Kings </em>xviii. 26). It was simply a
 characteristic of the Sabean worship, for it denoted the motion
 of the planets round the sun. That the dance was a Bacchic frenzy

 apparent. Sistra were used on the occasion, and the taunt of Michal
 and the King's reply are very expressive. <em>Isis Unveiled, Vol.
 II., p. </em>49.
 </p><p>
 "The Ark, in which are preserved the germs of all living
 things necessary to repeople the earth, represents the survival
 of life, and the supremacy of spirit over matter, through the
 conflict of the opposing powers of nature. In the Astro-Theosophic
 chart of the Western Rite, the Ark corresponds with the navel,
 and is placed at the sinister side, the side of the woman (the
 moon), one of whose symbols is the left pillar of Solomon's temple
 -- <strong>B</strong>OAZ. The umbilicus is connected through the
 placenta with the receptacle in which are fructified the embryos
 of the race. . . The Ark is the sacred <em>Argha </em>of the Hindus,
 and thus the relation in which it stands to Noah's ark may be
 easily inferred when we learn that the Argha was an oblong vessel,
 used by the high priests as a sacrificial chalice in the worship
 of Isis, Astarte, and Venus-Aphrodite, all of whom were goddesses
 of the generative powers of nature, or of matter -- hence representing
 symbolically the Ark containing the germs of all living things."
 ("<em>Isis Unveiled,</em>"<em> </em>Vol. <strong>II</strong>.,
 p. 444.) Mistaken is he who accepts the Kabalistic works of to-day,
 and the interpretations of the Zohar by the Rabbis, for the genuine
 Kabalistic lore of old!* For no more to-day than in the day of
 Frederick von Schelling does the Kabala accessible to Europe and
 America, contain much more than "ruins and fragments, much
 distorted remnants still of that <em>primitive system which is
 the key to all religious systems</em>" (See Kabbala, by Prof.
 Franck, <em>Preface</em>)<em>. </em>The oldest system and the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * The author of the "Qabbalah" makes several attempts
 to prove conclusively the antiquity of the Zohar. Thus he shows
 that Moses de Leon could not be the author or the forger of the
 Zoharic works in the <strong>XIII</strong>th century, as he is
 accused of being, since Ibn Gebirol gave out the same philosophical
 teaching 225 years before the day of Moses de Leon. No true Kabalist
 or scholar will ever deny the fact. It is certain that Ibn Gebirol
 based his doctrines upon the oldest Kabalistic sources, namely,
 the "Chaldean Book of Numbers," as well as some no longer
 extant Midrashim, the same, no doubt, as those used by Moses de
 Leon. But it is just the difference between the two ways of treating
 the same esoteric subjects, which, while proving the enormous
 antiquity of the esoteric system, points to a decided ring of
 Talmudistic and even Christian sectarianism in the compilation
 and glossaries of the Zoharic system by Rabbi Moses. Ibn Gebirol
 <em>never</em> <em>quoted from the Scriptures </em>to enforce
 the teachings (<em>vide </em>I. Myer's <em>Qabbalah, </em>p. 7).
 Moses de Leon has made of the Zohar that which it has remained
 to this day, "a running commentary on the . . . Books of
 the Pentateuch" (<em>ibid</em>.), with a few later additions
 made by Christian hands. One follows the archaic esoteric philosophy;
 the other, only that portion which was adapted to the <em>lost
 </em>Books of Moses restored by Ezra. Thus, while the system,
 or the trunk on which the primitive original Zohar was engrafted,
 is of an immense antiquity many of the (later) Zoharic offshoots
 are strongly coloured by the peculiar views held by Christian
 Gnostics (Syrian and Chaldean), the friends and co-workers of
 Moses de Leon who, as shown by Munk, accepted their interpretations.

 <em>Chaldean </em>Kabala were identical. The latest renderings
 of the <em>Zohar </em>are those of the Synagogue in the early
 centuries -- <em>i.e</em>., the<em> Thorah, </em>dogmatic and
 uncompromising.
 </p><p>
 The "King's Chamber" in <em>Cheops</em>'<em> Pyramid
 </em>is thus an Egyptian "Holy of Holies." On the days
 of the Mysteries of Initiation, the candidate, representing the
 solar god, had to descend into the Sarcophagus, and represent
 the energizing ray, entering into the fecund womb of Nature. Emerging
 from it on the following morning, he typified the resurrection
 of life after the change called Death. In the great <strong>M</strong>YSTERIES
 his figurative death lasted two days, when with the Sun he arose
 on third morning, after a last night of the most cruel trials.
 While the postulant represented the Sun -- the all-vivifying Orb
 that "resurrects" every morning but to impart life to
 all -- the Sarcophagus was symbolic of the female principle. This,
 in Egypt; its form and shape changed with every country, provided
 it remained a vessel, a symbolic <em>navis </em>or boat-shaped
 vehicle, and a <em>container,</em> symbolically, of germs or the
 germ of life. In India, it is the "golden" Cow through
 which the candidate for Brahminism has to pass if he desires to
 be a Brahmin, and to become <strong>D</strong>WIJA ("reborn
 a <em>second </em>time"). The crescent-form <em>Argha</em>
 of the Greeks was the type of the Queen of Heaven -- Diana, or
 the Moon. She was the great Mother of all Existences, as the Sun
 was the Father. The Jews, previous to, as well as after their
 metamorphosis of Jehovah into a <em>male </em>god, worshipped
 Astoreth, which made Isaiah declare: "<em>Your new moons
 and feasts my</em><i> </i>soul hateth," (<em>i</em>. 14);
 saying which, he was evidently unjust. Astoreth and the New-moon
 (the crescent <em>argha</em>)<em> </em>festivals, had no worse
 significance as a form of public worship than had the hidden meaning
 of the moon in general, which was Kabalistically connected directly
 with, and sacred to, Jehovah, as is well known; with the sole
 difference that one was the female and the other the male aspect
 of the moon, and of the star Venus.
 </p><p>
 The Sun (the Father), the Moon (the Mother), and Mercury-Thoth
 (the Son), were the earliest Trinity of the Egyptians, who personified
 them in Osiris, Isis, and Thoth (Hermes). In [[<em>PISTIS SOPHIA</em>]],
 the seven great gods, divided into two triads and the highest
 God (the Sun) are: the lower [[<em>Tridunameis</em>]], whose powers
 reside respectively in Mars, Mercury and Venus; and the higher
 Triad ("the three unseen gods") who dwell in the Moon,
 Jupiter and Saturn; (<em>vide</em> §§ 359 and 361 <em>et
 seq</em>)<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 This requires no proof. Astoreth was in one sense an impersonal
 symbol of nature, the ship of Life carrying throughout the boundless
 Sidereal Ocean the germs of all being. And when she was not identified
 with Venus, like every other "Queen of Heaven" to whom
 cakes and buns were offered in sacrifice, Astoreth became the
 reflection of the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 463 CHRISTIAN SYMBOLISM</h6>
 
 <p>
 Chaldean "Nuah, the Universal Mother" (female Noah,
 considered as one with the ark), and of the female triad, Ana,
 Belita and Davikina; called, when blended into one, "Sovereign
 goddess, lady of the Nether Abyss, Mother of gods, Queen of the
 Earth, and Queen of fecundity." Later, Belita or <em>Damti
 </em>(the sea), the Mother of <em>the City</em> <em>of Erech </em>(the
 great Chaldean Necropolis) became Eve; and now she is Mary the
 Virgin, in the Latin Church, represented as standing on the crescent-moon,
 and, at times on the Globe, to vary the programme. The <em>navi</em>,
 or ship-like form of the crescent, which blends in itself all
 those common symbols of the ship of life, such as Noah's ark,
 the Yoni of the Hindus, and the ark of the Covenant, is the female
 symbol of the Universal "Mothers of the gods," and is
 now found under its Christian <em>symbol</em> in every Church,
 as the nave (from<em> navis, </em>the ship).* The <em>navis </em>--
 the Sidereal vessel -- is fructified by the Spirit of Life --
 the male God; or, as the learned Kenealy (in his <em>Apocalypsis</em>)<em>
 </em>calls it very appropriately -- the Holy Spirit. In Western
 religious symbology the Crescent was the male, the full moon,
 the female aspect of that universal Spirit. "The mystic word
 <em>Alm</em>, which the prophet Mahomet prefixed to many chapters
 of the Koran, alludes to <em>her </em>as the <em>Alm, </em>the
 immaculate Virgin of the heavens. And -- the sublime ever falling
 into the ridiculous -- it is from this root <em>Alm</em> that
 we have to derive the word <em>Almeh </em>-- the Egyptian dancing-girls.
 The latter are "Virgins" of the same type as the <em>Nautchnis
 </em>in India, and the (female) <em>Kadeshim, </em>the Holy Ones
 of the Jewish temples (those consecrated to Jehovah, who represented
 both sexes), whose holy functions in the Israelite fanes were
 <em>identical </em>with those of the Nautchnis.
 </p><p>
 Now Eustathius declares that ([<em>IO</em>]) <strong>IO </strong>means
 the <em>moon, </em>in the dialect of the <em>Argians; </em>and
 it was one of the names of the same in Egypt. Says Jablonski,
 "[[<em>IO</em>]], Ioh<em>, AEgyptiis </em><strong>L</strong>UNAM<em>
 significat neque</em> <em>habent illi in communi sermonis usu,
 aliud nomen quo Lunam, designent</em> <em>praeter IO.</em>"<em>
 </em>The pillar and Circle (<strong>IO</strong>), now constituting
 the first decimal number, and which with Pythagoras was the perfect
 number contained in the <em>Tetractis,** </em>became later a <em>pre</em>-<em>eminently
 phallic Number</em> -- amongst the Jews, foremost of all, with
 whom it is the male and female Jehovah.
 </p><p>
 This is how a scholar explains it: --

 * Timaeus, the Locrian, speaking of <em>Arka, </em>calls her "the
 Principle of best things." The word <em>arcane</em>, "hidden,"
 or secret, is derived from <em>Arka</em>. "To no one is the
 <em>Arcane </em>shown except to the most High" (<em>Codex
 Nazareus</em>)<em>, </em>alluding to nature the female, and Spirit,
 the male Power. All the Sun-Gods were called <em>Archagetos</em>

 "I find, on the Rosetta stone of Uhlemann, the word <em>mouth,
 </em>also in Seiffarth, viz., the name of <em>the Moon </em>used
 as a cycle of Time, hence the <em>lunar month </em>from the hieroglyph

 and <img src="sd1-4b.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> as determinatives given,

 The Hebrew <img src="sd2-464c.gif" align="BOTTOM"> may also be
 used as <strong>I O H</strong>, for the letter <em>yau, </em>or
 <img src="sd1-90.gif" align="BOTTOM">, was used for <em>o </em>and
 for <em>u</em>, and for<em> v</em> or <em>w</em>. This, before
 the <em>Massora, </em>of which the <strong>.</strong> was used
 as <img src="sd2-464d.gif" align="BOTTOM"> = o, <img src="sd2-464e.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 = u, and <img src="sd1-90.gif" align="BOTTOM"> = v or w. Now I
 had worked it out by original search that the great distinctive
 function of the god-name Jehovah was designative of the influence
 of the moon as the <em>causative </em>of<em> generation, </em>and
 as of its exact value as a lunar year in the natural <em>measure
 of days, </em>as you will fully see, . . . . And here comes this
 linguistic same word from a source far more ancient; viz., the
 Coptic, or rather from the old Egyptian in time of the Coptic.".
 . . . (From a <strong>MS</strong>.)
 </p><p>
 This is the more remarkable when Egyptology compares this with
 the little which it knows about the Theban triad -- composed of
 <em>Ammon, Mouth, </em>(or<em> Mout</em>) and their son <em>Khonsoo.
 </em>This triad was, when united, contained in the moon as their
 common symbol; and when separated, it was <em>Khonsoo </em>who
 was the god, <strong>L</strong>UNUS, being thus confounded with
 Thot and Phtah. His mother Mout(<em>h</em>) -- the name signifying
 <em>Mother, </em>by the bye, not the <em>moon, </em>which was
 only her Symbol -- is called the "Queen of Heaven";
 the "Virgin," etc., etc., as she is an aspect of Isis,
 Hathor, and other mother goddesses. She was less the wife than
 the mother of Ammon, whose distinct title is "the husband
 of his Mother." In a <em>statuette </em>at Boulaq, Cairo,
 this triad is represented (<em>Number </em>1981 <em>Serapeum,
 Greek Period</em>)<em> </em>as a mummy-god holding in his hand
 three different sceptres, and bearing the lunar disc on his head,
 the characteristic tress of hair showing the design of representing
 it as that of <em>an infant </em>god, or "the Sun,"
 in the triad. He was the god of Destinies in Thebes, and appears
 under two aspects (1) as "Khonsoo, the Lunar god, and Lord
 of Thebes, <em>Nofir</em>-<em>hotpoo </em>--<em> </em><i>'</i><em>he</em><i>
 </i>who is in absolute repose'; and (2) as Khonsoo <em>Iri</em>-<em>sokhroo,
 </em>or 'Khonsoo, who executes Destiny': the former preparing
 the events and conceiving them for those born under his generative
 influence; the latter putting them into action." (<em>See
 Maspero</em>'<em>s Definitions</em>)<em>. </em>Under theogonic
 permutations Ammon becomes Horus, <strong>HOR-AMMON</strong>,
 and Mout(h)-Isis is seen suckling him in a statuette of the Saitic
 period. (<em>Abydos.</em>) In his turn, in this transformed triad,
 Khonsoo becomes <em>Thot</em>-<em>Lunus,</em> "he who operates
 salvation." His brow is crowned with the head of an <em>ibis</em>
 decorated with the<i> lunar </i>disc and the diadem called IO-<i>tef</i>.
 </p><p>
 Now all these symbols are certainly found reflected in (some believe
 them identical with) the <em>Yave, </em>or Jehovah of the Bible.
 This will be</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 465 THE "FOUR-FACED" BRAHMA. </h6>
 
 <p>
 made plain to any one who reads "<em>The Source of Measures,</em>"<em>
 or </em>"<em>Hebrew</em> <em>Egyptian Mystery,</em>"<em>
 </em>and understands the undeniable, clear, and mathematical proofs
 that the <em>esoteric foundations, </em>or the system used in
 the building of the Great Pyramid, and the architectural measurements
 in the Temple of Solomon (whether the latter be mythical or real),
 Noah's ark, and the ark of the Covenant, are the same. If anything
 in the world can settle the dispute that the old, as much as the
 later, Jews (post-Babylonian), and especially the former, built
 their theogony and religion on the very same foundation as all
 Pagans did, it is the work in question.
 </p><p>
 And now it may be as well to remind the reader of that which was
 said of <strong>I A O</strong>, in our work, "<em>Isis Unveiled.</em>"
 </p><blockquote>
 "No other deity affords such a variety of etymologies as
 Jaho, nor is there any name which can be so variously pronounced.
 It is only by associating it with the Masoretic points that the
 later Rabbins succeeded in making Jehovah read 'Adonai' -- or
 Lord, as Philo Byblus spells it in Greek letters [[IEUO]] -- <strong>IEVO</strong>.
 Theodoret says that the Samaritans pronounced it Jahe (yahra),
 and the Jews Yaho; which would make it as we have shown, I --
 Ah -- O. Diodorus states that 'among the Jews they relate that
 Moses called the god Iao.' It is on the authority of the <em>Bible
 </em>itself, therefore, that we maintain that before his initiation
 by Jethro, his father-in-law, Moses had never known the word Jaho."*
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 The above receives corroboration in a private letter from a very
 learned Kabalist. In <strong>S</strong>TANZA <strong>IV</strong>.
 and elsewhere it is stated that exoterically Brahma (neuter),
 so flippantly and so often confused by the Orientalists with Brahma
 -- the male, is sometimes called <em>Kala</em>-<em>hansa </em>(Swan
 in the eternity), and the esoteric meaning of <em>A</em>-<em>ham</em>-<em>sa,
 </em>is given. (I -- <em> am</em> -- he,<em> so ham </em>being
 equal to <em>sah </em>"he," and <em>aham</em> "I"<em>
 </em>-- a mystic anagram and permutation). It is also the "four-faced"
 Brahma, the <em>Chatur mukha </em>(the perfect cube) forming itself
 <em>within,</em> and<em> from </em>the infinite circle; and again
 the use of the 1, 3, 5, and <img src="sd2-465.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 = 14, as the esoteric hierarchy of the Dhyan Chohans is explained.
 On this, the said correspondent comments in this way: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Of the 1, 3, 5,<em> </em>and twice 7, intending and very
 especially 13,514, which on a circle may be read as 31415 (or
 [[<em>pi</em>]] value), I think there cannot be a possibility
 of doubting; and especially when considered with symbol marks
 on <em>sacr</em>,** 'Chakra,' or Circle of Vishnu.

 * The student must be aware that Jethro is called the "father-in-law"
 of Moses; not because Moses was really married to one of his seven
 daughters. Moses was an Initiate, if he ever existed, and as such
 an ascetic, a nazar, and could never be married. It is an allegory
 like everything else. Zipporah (the shining) is one of the personified
 Occult Sciences given by Revel-Jethro, the Midian priest Initiator,

 <p>
 <em>Maimonides </em>(<em>More Nevochim, </em>"The Guide of
 the Perplexed" -- truly!) in two aspects; as a man, like
 all others born of a man and a woman, and -- as the <em>prophet
 of the Moon; </em>the reason of which is now made apparent, and
 has to be explained.
 </p><p>
 Adam, as the supposed great "Progenitor of the human race,"
 is, as Adam Kadmon, made in the <em>image </em>of God -- a priapic
 image, therefore. The Hebrew words <em>sacr </em>and<em> n</em>'<em>cabvah
 </em>are, literally translated, <em>lingham </em>(phallus) and
 <em>yoni</em>, notwithstanding their translation in th<em>e</em><i>
 </i>Bible (<em>Genesis i. v</em>. 27.) "male and female."
 As said there "God creates '<em>Man in his own image'</em>.
 . . . . in the image of God<em> </em>created he him, <em>male
 and female </em>created he them," the androgyne Adam-Kadmon.
 Now this Kabalistic name is not that of a living man, nor even
 of a human or divine Being, but of the two sexes or organs of
 procreation, called in Hebrew with that usual sincerity of language
 pre-eminently Biblical, <em>sacr </em>and<em> n</em>'<em>cabvah</em>*;
 these two being, therefore<em>,</em> the <em>image </em>under
 which the "Lord God" appeared usually to his chosen
 people. That this is so, is now undeniably proven by almost all
 the symbologists and Hebrew scholars as well as by the Kabala.
 Therefore Adam is in one sense Jehovah. This makes plain another
 general tradition in the East mentioned in <em>Gregorie</em>'<em>s
 </em>"<em>Notes and Observations upon several</em> <em>passages
 in Scripture</em>"<em> </em>(1684. <em>Vol. </em>1 <em> pp.
 </em>120-21)<em> </em>and quoted b<em>y</em><i> </i>Hargrave Jennings
 in his <em>Phallicism: </em>"That Adam was commanded by God
 that his dead body should be kept above ground till committed
 t<em>o</em> the <em>middle of the earth </em>by a priest of the
 most High God." Therefor<em>e,</em><i> </i>"Noah daily
 prayed in the ark before the BODY OF <strong>A</strong>DAM,"
 or before the Phallus in the <em>ark, </em>or Holy of Holies,
 again. He who is a Kabalist and accustomed to the incessant permutation
 of Biblical names, once they are interpreted numerically and symbolically,
 will understand what is meant. Jehovah, from the two words of
 which his name is composed, "makes up the original idea of
 male-female as birth-originator, for the <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 was the <em>membrum virile </em>and<em> Houak </em>was<em> Eve</em>."
 So . . . "the<em> perfect one, </em>as originator of measures,
 takes also the form of <em>birth </em>origin, as <em>hermaphrodite
 one; </em>hence the phallic use of form." ("<em>Source
 of Measures,</em>"<em> </em>159). Besides the same author
 shows and demonstrates numerically and geometrically that (<em>a</em>)<em>
 Arets, </em>earth, <em>Adam, man,</em> and<em> H</em>'<em>Adam
 </em>are cognate with each other, and are <em>personified </em>in
 the Bible under one form, as the Egyptian and Hebrew Mars, <em>god
 of the generation;</em> and<em> </em>(<em>b</em>) that Jehovah,
 or <em>Jah,</em> is

 <p>
 *Jehovah says to Moses "the Summation of my name is <em>Sacr,
 </em>the carrier of the germ" -- phallus. "It is the
 vehicle of the annunciation, and the <em>sacr </em>has passed
 down through ages to the <em>sacr</em>-<em>factum </em>of the
 Roman priest, and the <em>sacr</em>-<em>fice, </em>and <i>sacra</i>ment
 of the English speaking race." (<em>Source of Measures, p</em>.
 236) Thence marriage is a <em>sacrament </em>in the Greek and
 Roman Churches. </p><hr>

 <p>
 Noah, or <em>Jehovah is Noah </em>in Hebrew would be <img src="sd2-468a.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 or literally in English, <em>Inch.</em>"
 </p><p>
 The above affords, then, a key to the said traditions. Noah, a
 divine permutation, the supposed saviour of Humanity, who carries
 in his ark or <em>argha </em>(the moon), the germs of all living
 things, worships before the "body of Adam," which body
 is the image of, and a<em> Creator </em>itself. Hence Adam is
 called the "Prophet of the Moon," the <em>Argha </em>or
 "Holy of Holies" of the <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 (Yodh). This also shows the origin of the Jewish popular belief
 that the face of Moses <em>is in the moon</em> -- <em>i.e., </em>the
 spots in the Moon. For Moses and Jehovah are once more permutations,
 as has been shown Kabalistically. Says the author of the "Source
 of Measures" (<em>p</em>. 271): "There is one fact in
 regard to Moses and his works too important to be omitted. When
 he is instructed by the Lord as to his mission, the <em>power</em>
 name assumed by the Deity is, <em>I am that I am, </em>the Hebrew
 words being: --
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-468b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 a variety reading of <img src="sd1-355b.gif" align="BOTTOM">.
 Now, Moses is <img src="sd2-468c.gif" align="BOTTOM">, and equals
 345. Add the values of the <em>new form</em> of the name Jehovah,
 21 + 501 + 21 = 543, or, by a reverse reading, 345; thus showing
 Moses to be a form of Jehovah in this combination. 21 ÷<em>
 </em>2<em> = </em>10.5, or, reversed, 501, so that the<em> asher
 </em>or the <em>that </em>in<em> I am that I am </em>is simply
 a guide to a use of 21 or 7 x 3; 501 [[squared]] = 251<em> </em>+,
 a very valuable pyramid number, etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 For a clearer explanation for the benefit of non-Kabalists we
 put it thus: "I am that I am" is in Hebrew: --
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-468d.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 Add the numbers of these separate words and you have: --
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-468e.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 (which relates to the process of descending in fire on the mount
 to make man, etc., etc.), and which is explained to be but a <em>check
 </em>and use of the numbers of the mountains; for: -- on one side
 we have 10 + 5 + 6 = 21, down the middle 501, and on the other
 side 6 + 5<em> </em>+<em> </em>10 <em>= </em>21." (From the
 same author.) (<em>Vide</em> §<em> </em><strong>XXII</strong><em>.,
 </em>"<em>The Symbolism of the Mystery Name</em> <strong>IAO</strong><em>.</em>")
 </p><p>
 The "Holy of Holies," both Kabalistic and Rabbinical,
 are thus shown as an international symbol, and common property.
 Neither has originated with the Hebrews; but owing to the too
 realistic handling of the half-initiated Levites, the symbol has
 with them acquired a significance which it hardly has with any
 other people to this day,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 469 THE OLD AND THE NEW JEHOVAH. </h6>
 
 <p>
 and which it was originally never meant to have by the true Kabalist.
 The<em> Lingham </em>and<em> Yoni </em>of the modern average Hindu
 is, on the face of it, of course, no better than the Rabbinical
 "Holy of Holies," -- but <em>it is</em> <em>no worse;
 </em>and this is a point gained on the Christian traducers of
 the Asiatic religious philosophies. For, in such religious myths,
 in the hidden symbolism of a creed and philosophy, the <em>spirit
 </em>of the tenets propounded ought to decide their relative value.
 And who will say, that, examined either way, this so-called "Wisdom,"
 applied solely to the uses and benefit of one little nation, has
 ever developed in it anything like national ethics. The Prophets
 are there, to show the walk in life, before, during, and after
 the days of Moses, of the chosen but "stiff-necked"
 people. That they have had at one time the Wisdom-Religion and
 use of the universal language and its symbols at their disposal
 and in their possession, is proved by the same esotericism existing
 to this day in India with regard to the "Holy of Holies."
 This, as said, was and still is the passage through the "golden"
 cow <em>in the</em> <em>same stooping position </em>as the one
 shown in the gallery of the pyramid, which identified man with
 Jehovah in Hebrew esotericism. The whole difference lies in the
 Spirit of Interpretation. With the Hindus as with the ancient
 Egyptians that spirit was and is entirely metaphysical and psychological;
 with the Hebrews it was <em>realistic</em> and<em> physiological.
 </em>It pointed to the first sexual separation of the human race
 (Eve giving birth to Cain-Jehovah, as shown in the "Source
 of Measures"); to the consummation of terrestrial physiological
 union and conception (as in the allegory of Cain shedding Abel's
 blood --<em> Habel, </em>the feminine principle) and -- child-bearing;
 a process shown to have begun in the Third Race, or with Adam's
 THIRD <em>son, </em>Seth, with whose son Henoch, men began to
 call themselves <em>Jehovah </em>or<em> Jah</em>-<em>hovah, </em>the
 male Jod and Havah or Eve -- to wit, <em>male and female beings</em>.*<em>
 </em>Thus the difference lies in the religious and ethical feeling,
 but the two symbols are identical. There is no doubt that, with
 the fully initiated Judaean Tanaim, the inner sense of the symbolism
 was as holy in its abstraction as with the ancient Aryan Dwijas.
 The worship of the "god in the ark" dates only from
 David; and for a thousand years Israel knew of no phallic Jehovah.
 And now the old Kabala, edited and re-edited, has become tainted
 with it.
 </p><p>
 With the ancient Aryans the hidden meaning was grandiose, sublime,
 and poetical, however much the external appearance of their symbol
 may <em>now </em>militate against the claim. The ceremony of passing

 <p>
 the Holy of Holies (now symbolized by the cow), in the beginning
 through the temple <em>Hiranya gharba </em>(the radiant Egg) --
 in itself a symbol of Universal, abstract nature -- meant spiritual
 conception and birth, or rather the <em>re</em>-<em>birth </em>of
 the individual and his regeneration: the <em>stooping</em> man
 at the entrance of the <em>Sanctum Sanctorum, </em>ready to pass
 through the matrix of mother nature, or the physical creature
 ready to re-become the original spiritual Being, pre-natal <strong>M</strong>AN.
 With the Semite, that <em>stooping </em>man meant the <em>fall
 </em>of Spirit into matter, and that <em>fall</em> and <em>degradation
 </em>were apotheosized by him with the result of dragging Deity
 down to the level of man. For the Aryan, the symbol represented
 the divorce of Spirit from matter, its merging into and return
 to its primal Source; for the Semite, the wedlock of spiritual
 man with material female nature, the physiological being taking
 pre-eminence over the psychological and the purely immaterial.
 The Aryan views of the symbolism were those of the whole Pagan
 world; the Semite interpretations emanated from, and were pre-eminently
 those of a small tribe, thus marking its national features and
 the idiosyncratic defects that characterize many of the Jews to
 this day -- gross realism, selfishness, and sensuality. They had
 made a bargain, through their father Jacob, with their tribal
 deity, self-exalted above all others, and a <em>covenant </em>that
 his "seed shall be as the dust of the earth"; and that
 deity could have no better image henceforth than that of the symbol
 of generation, and, as representation, a <em>number </em>and numbers.
 </p><p>
 Carlyle has wise words for both these nations. With the Hindu
 Aryan -- the most metaphysical and spiritual people on earth --
 religion has ever been, in his words, "an everlasting lode-star,
 that beams the brighter in the heavens the darker here on earth
 grows the night around him." The religion of the Hindu detaches
 him from this earth; therefore, even now, the cow-symbol is one
 of the grandest and most philosophical among all others in its
 inner meaning. To the "<strong>M</strong>ASTERS" and
 "Lords" of European potencies -- the Israelites -- certain
 words of Carlyle apply still more admirably; for them "religion
 is a wise prudential feeling grounded on <em>mere calculation</em>"<em>
 </em>-- and it was so from its beginnings. Having burdened themselves
 with it, Christian nations feel bound to defend and <em>poetise
 </em>it, at the expense of all other religions.
 </p><p>
 But it was not so with the ancient nations. For them the passage
 entrance and the sarcophagus in the King's chamber meant regeneration
 -- not generation. It was the most solemn symbol, a <em>Holy of
 Holies, </em>indeed, wherein were created immortal Hierophants
 and "Sons of God" -- never mortal men and Sons of lust
 and flesh -- as now in the hidden sense of the Semite Kabalist.
 The reason for the difference in the views of the two races is
 easy to account for. The Aryan Hindu belongs to the oldest races
 now on earth; the Semite Hebrew to the latest. One is nearly one

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page 471]] THE CRAFT OF THE RABBINS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 million years old; the other is a small sub-race some 8,000 years
 old and no more.*
 </p><p>
 But Phallic worship has developed only with the gradual loss of
 the keys to the inner meaning of religious symbols; and there
 was a day when the Israelites had beliefs as pure as the Aryans
 have. But now Judaism, built <em>solely </em>on Phallic worship,
 has become one of the latest creeds in Asia, and theologically
 a religion of hate and malice toward everyone and everything outside
 themselves. Philo Judaeus shows what was the genuine Hebrew faith.
 The sacred Writings, he says, prescribe what we ought to do .
 . . <em>commanding us to hate the heathen and their</em> <em>laws
 and institutions. </em>They did hate Baal or Bacchus worship publicly,
 but left its worst features to be followed secretly; and it is
 with the Talmudic Jews that the grand symbols of nature were the
 most profaned. With them, as now shown by the discovery of the
 key to the correct Bible reading -- Geometry, the <i>fifth </i>divine
 Science ("fifth" -- because it is the <em>fifth key
 </em>in the series of the Seven Keys to the Universal esoteric
 language and symbology) was desecrated, and by them applied to
 conceal the most terrestrial and grossly sexual mysteries, wherein
 both Deity and religion were degraded.
 </p><p>
 We are told that it is just the same with our Brahma-prajapati,
 with Osiris and all other <em>creative </em>gods. Quite so, when
 their rites are judged exoterically and externally; the reverse
 when their <em>inner</em> meaning is unveiled, as we see. The
 Hindu Lingham is identical with "Jacob's <em>Pillar</em>"<em>
 </em>-- most undeniably. But the difference, as said, seems to
 consist in that the esoteric significance of the <em>Lingham </em>was
 too truly sacred and metaphysical to be revealed to the profane
 and the vulgar; hence its superficial appearance was left to the
 speculations of the mob. Nor would the Aryan Hierophant and Brahmin,
 in their proud exclusiveness and the satisfaction of their knowledge,
 go to the trouble of concealing its primeval <em>nakedness </em>under
 cunningly devised fables; whereas the Rabbi, having interpreted
 the symbol to suit his own tendencies, had to veil the crude significance;
 and this served a double purpose -- that of keeping his secret
 to himself and of exalting himself

 * Strictly speaking, the Jews are an artificial Aryan race, born
 in India, and belonging to the Caucasian division. No one who
 is familiar with the Armenians and the Parsis can fail to recognize
 in the three the same Aryan, Caucasian type. From the seven primitive
 types of the Fifth Race there now remain on Earth but three. As
 Prof. W. H. Flower aptly said in 1885, "I cannot resist the
 conclusion so often arrived at by various anthropologists -- that
 the primitive man, whatever he may have been, has in the course
 of ages diverged into three extreme types, represented by the
 Caucasian of Europe, the Mongolian of Asia, and the Ethiopian
 of Africa, and that all existing individuals of the species can
 be ranged around these types. . . . " (The President's address
 at the <em>Anthrop. Inst. </em><i>of </i><em>Great Britain, </em>etc.)
 Considering that our Race has reached its Fifth Sub-race, how
 can it be otherwise? </p><hr>

 <p>
 in his supposed monotheism over the <em>heathen, </em>whom his
 <i>Law</i> commanded him to hate.* A commandment now gladly accepted
 by the Christian too, in spite of another and later commandment
 -- "love each other." Both India and Egypt had and have
 their sacred lotuses, symbolic of the same "Holy of Holies"
 -- the Lotus growing in the water, a double feminine symbol --
 the <em>bearer </em>of its own seed and root of all. Viraj and
 Horus are both male symbols, emanating from <em>androgyne Nature,</em>
 one from Brahma and his female counterpart Vach, the other, from
 Osiris and Isis -- never from the One infinite God. In the Judaeo-Christian
 systems it is different. Whereas the lotus, containing Brahma,
 the Universe, is shown growing out of Vishnu's <i>navel</i>, the<em>
 Central point</em> in the Waters of Infinite Space, and whereas
 Horus springs from the lotus of the <em>Celestial </em>Nile<em>
 </em>-- all these abstract pantheistic ideas are dwarfed and made
 terrestrially concrete in the Bible: one is almost inclined to
 say that in the <em>esoteric </em>they are <em>grosser and still
 more</em> <em>anthropomorphic, </em>than in their <em>exoteric
 </em>rendering. Take as an example the same symbol, even in its
 Christian application; the <em>lilies </em>in the hand of the
 Archangel Gabriel (<em>Luke i. </em>28). In Hinduism -- the "Holy
 of Holies" is a universal abstraction, whose <em>dramatis
 personae </em>are Infinite Spirit and Nature; in Christian Judaism,
 it is a <em>personal </em>God<em>, outside</em> of that Nature,
 and the human Womb -- Eve, Sarah, etc., etc.; hence, an anthropomorphic
 phallic god, and his image -- man.
 </p><p>
 Thus it is maintained, that with regard to the contents of the
 Bible, one of two hypotheses has to be admitted. Either behind
 the symbolic substitute -- Jehovah -- there was the unknown, incognizable
 Diety, the Kabalistic Ain-Soph; or, the Jews have been from the
 beginning, no better than the dead-letter <em>Lingham</em>-**
 worshippers of the India of to-day. We say it was the former;
 and that, therefore, the secret or esoteric worship of the Jews
 was the same Pantheism that the Vedantin philosophers are reproached
 with to-day; Jehovah was a <em>substitute </em>for purposes of
 an exoteric national faith, and had no importance or reality in
 the eyes of the erudite priests and philosophers -- the Sadducees,

 * Whenever such analogies between the Gentiles and the Jews, and
 later the Christians, were pointed out, it was the invariable
 custom of the latter to say that it was the work of the <em>Devil</em>
 who forced the Pagans to imitate the Jews for the purpose of throwing
 a slur on the religion of <em>the one, true living God. </em>To
 this Faber says very justly "Some have imagined that the
 Gentiles were servile copyists of the Israelites, and that each
 point of similitude was borrowed from the Mosaical Institutes.
 But this theory will by no means solve the problem: both because
 we find the very same resemblance in the ceremonies of nations
 far different from Palestine, as we do in the rites of those who
 are in its immediate vicinity, and because it seems incredible
 that all should have borrowed from one which was universally disliked
 and despised." (<em>Pagan Idol. I.,</em> 104.)

 most refined as the most learned of all the Israelite sects, who
 stand as a living proof with their contemptuous rejection of every
 belief, save the <strong>L</strong>AW. For how could those who
 invented the stupendous scheme now known as the Bible, or their
 successors who knew, as all Kabalists do, that it was so invented
 for a popular <em>blind</em> -- how could they, we ask, feel reverence
 for such a phallic symbol and a NUMBER, as Jehovah is shown most
 undeniably to be in the Kabalistic works? How could anyone worthy
 of the name of a philosopher, and knowing the real <em>secret
 </em>meaning of their "pillar of Jacob," their <em>Bethel,</em>
 oil-anointed <em>phalli, </em>and their "Brazen <em>Serpent,</em>"<em>
 </em>worship such a gross symbol, and minister unto it, seeing
 in it their "Covenant" -- the Lord Himself! Let the
 reader turn to <em>Gemara Sanhedrin </em>and judge. As various
 writers have shown, and as brutally stated in Hargrave Jennings'
 <em>Phallicism </em>(p. 67) "<em>We know from the Jewish
 records </em>that the Ark contained a <em>table of stone</em>.
 . . . that stone was phallic, and yet identical with the sacred
 name <em>Jehovah </em>. . . which written in unpointed Hebrew
 with four letters, is <strong>J-E-V-E</strong> or <strong>JHVH</strong>
 (the H being merely an aspirate and the same as E). This process
 leaves us the two letters I and V (in another form U); then if
 we place the I <i>in </i>the U we have the 'Holy of Holies'; we
 also have the Lingha and Yoni and Argha of the Hindus, the Isvara
 and 'supreme Lord'; and here we have the whole secret of its mystic
 and arc-celestial import, confirmed in itself by being identical
 with the Linyoni (?) of the Ark of the Covenant."
 </p><p>
 The Biblical Jews of to-day do not date from Moses but from David
 -- even admitting the identity of the old genuine with the later
 and remodelled Mosaic scrolls. Before that time their nationality
 is lost in the mists of prehistoric darkness, the veil from which
 is now withdrawn as much as we have space to do so. It is only
 to the days of the Babylonian captivity that the Old Testament
 may be referred by the most lenient criticism, as the approximately
 correct views that were current about the days of Moses. Even
 such fanatical Christians and worshippers of Jehovah as the Rev.
 Mr. Horne, have to admit the numerous changes and alterations
 made by the later compilers of the "Book of God," since
 it was <em>found </em>by Hilkiah (<em>See </em>"<em>Introduction
 to the</em> <em>Old Testament,</em>"<em> and also Bishop
 Colenso</em>'<em>s </em>"<em>Elohistic and Jehovistic</em>
 <em>writers</em>")<em>; </em>and that "<em>the Pentateuch
 arose out of the primitive or older</em> <em>documents, by means
 of a SUPPLEMENTARY One.</em>"<em> </em>The Elohistic texts
 were re-written 500 years after the date of Moses; the Jehovistic
 800, on the authority of the Bible chronology itself. Hence, it
 is maintained that the deity, represented as the organ of generation
 in his pillar form, and as a symbol of the double-sexed organ
 in the numeral value of the letters of his name, or <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 the <em>Yodh </em>(phallus), and <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="BOTTOM">

 the Womb) according to Kabalistic authority -- is of a far later
 date than the <em>Elohim </em>symbols and is borrowed from the
 Pagan <em>exoteric </em>rites; and Jehovah is thus on a par with
 the <em>Lingham and Yoni </em>found on every road-side in India.
 </p><p>
 Just as the <strong>IAO </strong>of the mysteries was distinct
 from Jehovah, so was the later Iao and Abraxas of some Gnostic
 sects identical with the god of the Hebrews, who was the same
 with the Egyptian Horus. This is undeniably proven on "heathen"
 as on the Gnostic "Christian" gems. In Matter's collection
 of such gems there is a "Horus" seated on the lotus,
 inscribed [[<em>ABRASAXIAO</em>]] (Abraxas Iao) -- an address
 exactly parallel to the so frequent [[<em>EIS ZETS SARAPI</em>]]
 (<em>Eis zets sarapi</em>)<em> </em>on the contemporary Heathen
 gems; and therefore only to be translated by "Abraxas is
 the One Jehovah" (King's <em>Gnostics, </em>p. 327). But
 who was Abraxas? As the same author shows -- "the numerical
 or Kabalistic value of the name Abraxas directly refer to the
 Persian title of the god 'Mithra,' Ruler of the year, worshipped
 from the earliest times under the appellation of Iao." Thus,
 the Sun, in one aspect, the moon or the Lunar genius, in another,
 that generative deity whom the Gnostics saluted as "Thou
 that presidest over the Mysteries of the Father and the Son, who
 shinest in the night-time, holding <em>the second rank, </em>the
 first Lord of Death."
 </p><p>
 It is only in his capacity of the genius of the moon, the latter
 being credited in the old cosmogony with being the parent of our
 Earth, that Jehovah could ever be regarded as the <em>creator
 </em>of our globe and <em>its </em>Heaven, namely, the Firmament.
 </p><p>
 The knowledge of all this will be no proof, however, to the average
 bigot. Missionaries will go on with the most virulent attacks
 on the religions of India, and Christians read with the same benighted
 smile of satisfaction as ever these preposterously unjust words
 of Coleridge, "It is highly worthy of observation that the
 inspired writings received by Christians <em>are distinguishable
 from all other books </em>PRETENDING TO INSPIRATION, from the
 Scriptures of the Brahmins, and even from the Koran, in their
 strong and frequent <em>recommendation of </em>TRUTH (! !). .
