 </p><h4>ADDITIONAL FACTS AND EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING<br>
 THE GLOBES AND THE MONADS.</h4>
 
 <p>
 Two statements made in "Esoteric Buddhism" must be noticed
 and the author's opinions quoted. On p. 47 (fifth edition) it
 is said: --
 </p><p>
 " . . . the spiritual monads . . . do not fully complete
 their mineral existence on Globe A, then complete it on Globe
 B, and so on. They pass several times round the whole circle as
 minerals, and then again several times round as vegetables, and
 several times as animals. We purposely refrain for the present
 from going into figures," etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 This was a wise course to adopt in view of the great secrecy maintained
 with regard to figures and numbers. This reticence is now partially
 relinquished; but it would perhaps have been better had the real
 numbers concerning Rounds and evolutional gyrations been either
 entirely divulged at the time, or as entirely withheld. Mr. Sinnett
 understood this difficulty well when saying (p. 140) that: "For
 reasons which are not easy for the outsider to divine, the possessors
 of occult knowledge are especially reluctant to give out facts
 relating to Cosmogony, though it is hard for the uninitiated to
 understand why they should be withheld."
 </p><p>
 That there were such reasons is evident. Nevertheless, it is to
 this reticence that most of the confused ideas of some Eastern
 as well as Western pupils are due. The difficulties in the way
 of the acceptance of the two particular tenets under consideration
 seemed great, just because of the absence of any data to go upon.
 But there it was. For the figures belonging to the Occult calculations
 cannot be given -- as the Masters have many times declared --
 outside the circle of pledged chelas, and not even these can break
 the rules.
 </p><p>
 To make things plainer, without touching upon the mathematical
 aspects of the doctrine, the teaching given may be expanded and
 some obscure </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 171 THE MYSTERY OF THE MOON, UNVEILED.</h6>
 
 <p>
 points solved. As the evolution of the Globes and that of the
 Monads are so closely interblended, we will make of the two teachings
 one. In reference to the Monads, the reader is asked to bear in
 mind that Eastern philosophy rejects the Western theological dogma
 of a newly-created soul for every baby born, as being as unphilosophical
 as it is impossible in the economy of Nature. There must be a
 limited number of Monads evolving and growing more and more perfect
 through their assimilation of many successive personalities, in
 every new Manvantara. This is absolutely necessary in view of
 the doctrines of Rebirth, Karma, and the gradual return of the
 human Monad to its source -- <em>absolute </em>Deity<em>. </em>Thus,
 although the hosts of more or less progressed Monads are almost
 incalculable, they are still finite, as is everything in this
 Universe of differentiation and finiteness.
 </p><p>
 As shown in the double diagram of the human "principles"
 and the ascending Globes of the world-chains, there is an eternal
 concatenation of causes and effects, and a perfect analogy which
 runs through, and links together, all the lines of evolution.
 One begets the other -- globes as personalities. But, let us begin
 at the beginning.
 </p><p>
 The general outline of the process by which the successive planetary
 chains are formed has just been given. To prevent future misconceptions,
 some further details may be offered which will also throw light
 on the history of humanity on our own chain, the progeny of that
 of the Moon.
 </p><p>
 In the diagrams on p. 172, Fig. 1 represents the "lunar-chain"
 of seven planets at the outset of its seventh or last Round; while
 Fig. 2 represents the "earth-chain" which will be, but
 is not yet in existence. The seven Globes of each chain are distinguished
 in their cyclic order by the letters A to G, the Globes of the
 Earth-chain being further marked by a cross -- + -- the symbol
 of the Earth.
 </p><p>
 Now, it must be remembered that the Monads cycling round any septenary
 chain are divided into seven classes or hierarchies according
 to their respective stages of evolution, consciousness, and merit.
 Let us follow, then, the order of their appearance on planet A,
 in the first Round. The time-spaces between the appearances of
 these hierarchies on any one Globe are so adjusted that when Class
 7, the last, appears on Globe A, Class 1, the first, has just
 passed on to Globe B, and so on, step by step, all round the chain.
 </p><p>
 Again, in the Seventh Round on the Lunar chain, when Class 7,
 the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 172 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 last, quits Globe A, that Globe, instead of falling asleep, as
 it had done in previous Rounds, begins to die (to go into its
 planetary pralaya);* and in dying it transfers successively, as
 just said, its "principles," or life-elements and energy,
 etc., one after the other to a new "laya-centre," which
 commences the formation of Globe A of the Earth Chain. A similar
 process takes place for each of the Globes of the "lunar
 chain" one after the other, each forming a fresh Globe of
 the "earth-chain." Our Moon was the fourth Globe of
 the series, and was
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd1-172.gif" alt="Diagram 2" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 on the same plane of perception as our Earth. But Globe A of the
 lunar chain is not fully "dead" till the first Monads
 of the first class have passed from Globe G or Z, the last of
 the "lunar chain," into the Nirvana
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Occultism divides the periods of Rest (Pralaya) into several
 kinds; there is the <em>individual</em> pralaya of each Globe,
 as humanity and life pass on to the next; seven minor Pralayas
 in each Round; the <em>planetary </em>Pralaya, when seven <em>Rounds
 </em>are completed; the <em>Solar </em>Pralaya, when the whole
 system is at an end; and finally the Universal Maha -- or Brahma
 -- Pralaya at the close of the "Age of Brahma." These
 are the three chief <em>pralayas </em>or "destruction periods."
 There are many other minor ones, but with these we are not concerned
 at present.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 173 THE EARTH, THE CHILD OF THE MOON.</h6>
 
 <p>
 which awaits them between the two chains; and similarly for all
 the other Globes as stated, each giving birth to the corresponding
 globe of the "earth-chain."
 </p><p>
 Further, when Globe A of the new chain is ready, the first class
 or Hierarchy of Monads from the Lunar chain incarnate upon it
 in the lowest kingdom, and so on successively. The result of this
 is, that it is only the first class of Monads which attains the
 human state of development during the first Round, since the second
 class, on each planet, arriving later, has not time to reach that
 stage. Thus the Monads of Class 2 reach the incipient human stage
 only in the Second Round, and so on up to the middle of the Fourth
 Round. But at this point -- and on this Fourth Round in which
 the human stage will be <em>fully </em>developed -- the "Door"
 into the human kingdom closes; and henceforward the number of
 "human" Monads, <em>i.e.</em>, Monads in the human stage
 of development, is complete. For the Monads which had not reached
 the human stage by this point will, owing to the evolution of
 humanity itself, find themselves so far behind that they will
 reach the human stage only at the close of the seventh and last
 Round. They will, therefore, not be men on this chain, but will
 form the humanity of a future Manvantara and be rewarded by becoming
 "Men" on a higher chain altogether, thus receiving their
 Karmic compensation. To this there is <em>but one solitary exception</em>,<em>
 </em>for very good reasons, of which we shall speak farther on.
 But this accounts for the difference in the races.
 </p><p>
 It thus becomes apparent how perfect is the analogy between the
 processes of Nature in the Kosmos and in the individual man. The
 latter lives through his life-cycle, and dies. His "higher
 principles," corresponding in the development of a planetary
 chain to the cycling Monads, pass into Devachan, which corresponds
 to the "Nirvana" and states of rest intervening between
 two chains. The Man's lower "principles" are disintegrated
 in time and are used by Nature again for the formation of new
 human principles, and the same process takes place in the disintegration
 and formation of Worlds. Analogy is thus the surest guide to the
 comprehension of the Occult teachings.
 </p><p>
 This is one of the "seven mysteries of the Moon," and
 it is now revealed. The seven "mysteries" are called
 by the Japanese <em>Yamaboosis</em>,<em> </em>the mystics of the
 Lao-Tze sect and the ascetic monks of Kioto, the Dzenodoo -- the
 "seven jewels." Only the Japanese and the Chinese</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 174 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 Buddhist ascetics and Initiates are, if possible, even more reticent
 in giving out their "Knowledge" than are the Hindus.
 </p><p>
 But the reader must not be allowed to lose sight of the Monads,
 and must be enlightened as to their nature, as far as permitted,
 without trespassing upon the highest mysteries, of which the writer
 does not in any way pretend to know the last or final word.
 </p><p>
 The Monadic Host may be roughly divided into three great classes:
 --
 </p><p>
 1. The most developed Monads (the Lunar Gods or "Spirits,"
 called, in India, the Pitris), whose function it is to pass in
 the first Round through the whole triple cycle of the mineral,
 vegetable, and animal kingdoms in their most ethereal, filmy,
 and rudimentary forms, in order to clothe themselves in, and assimilate,
 the nature of the newly formed chain. They are those who first
 reach the human form (if there can be any form in the realm of
 the almost subjective) on Globe A in the first Round. It is they,
 therefore, who lead and represent the human element during the
 second and third Rounds, and finally evolve their shadows at the
 beginning of the Fourth Round for the second class, or those who
 come behind them.
 </p><p>
 2. Those Monads that are the first to reach the human stage during
 the three and a half Rounds, and to become men.*
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * We are forced to use here the misleading word "Men,"
 and this is a clear proof of how little any European language
 is adapted to express these subtle distinctions.
 </p><p>
 It stands to reason that these "Men" did not resemble
 the men of to-day, either in form or nature. Why then, it may
 be asked, call them "Men" at all? Because there is no
 other term in any Western language which approximately conveys
 the idea intended. The word "Men" at least indicates
 that these beings were "MANUS," thinking entities, however
 they differed in form and intellection from ourselves. But in
 reality they were, in respect of spirituality and intellection,
 rather "gods" than "Men."
 </p><p>
 The same difficulty of language is met with in describing the
 "stages" through which the Monad passes. Metaphysically
 speaking, it is of course an absurdity to talk of the "development"
 of a Monad, or to say that <i>it </i>becomes "Man."
 But any attempt to preserve metaphysical accuracy of language
 in the use of such a tongue as the English would necessitate at
 least three extra volumes of this work, and would entail an amount
 of verbal repetition which would be wearisome in the extreme.
 It stands to reason that a <strong>MONAD</strong> cannot either
 progress or develop, or even be affected by the changes of states
 it passes through. <em>It is not of this world or plane</em>,<em>
 </em>and may be compared only to an indestructible star of divine
 light and fire, thrown down on to our [[Footnote continued on
 next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 175 THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MONADS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 3. The laggards; the Monads which are retarded, and which will
 not reach, by reason of Karmic impediments, the human stage at
 all during this cycle or Round, save one exception which will
 be spoken of elsewhere as already promised.
 </p><p>
 Now the evolution of the <em>external </em>form or body round
 the <em>astral </em>is produced by the terrestrial forces, just
 as in the case of the lower kingdoms; but the evolution of the
 internal or real MAN is purely spiritual. It is now no more a
 passage of the impersonal Monad through many and various forms
 of matter -- endowed at best with instinct and consciousness on
 quite a different plane -- as in the case of external evolution,
 but a journey of the "pilgrim-soul" through various
 <em>states </em>of<em> not only matter </em>but Self-consciousness
 and self-perception, or of <em>perception </em>from apperception.
 (See "<em>Gods</em>,<em> Monads and Atoms.</em>")
 </p><p>
 The <strong>M</strong>ONAD emerges from its state of spiritual
 and intellectual unconsciousness; and, skipping the first two
 planes -- too near the ABSOLUTE to permit of any correlation with
 anything on a lower plane -- it gets direct into the plane of
 Mentality. But there is no plane in the whole universe with a
 wider margin, or a wider field of action in its almost endless
 gradations of perceptive and apperceptive qualities, than this
 plane, which has in its turn an appropriate smaller plane for
 every "form," from the "mineral" monad up
 to the time when that monad blossoms forth by evolution into the
 DIVINE MONAD. But all the time it is still one and the same Monad,
 differing only in its incarnations, throughout its ever succeeding
 cycles of partial or total obscuration of spirit, or the partial
 or total obscuration of matter -- two polar antitheses -- as it
 ascends into the realms of mental spirituality, or descends into
 the depths of materiality.
 </p><p>
 To return to "Esoteric Buddhism." It is there stated
 with regard to the enormous period intervening between the mineral
 epoch on Globe A, and the man-epoch,* that: "The full development
 of the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] Earth as a plank of
 salvation for the personalities in which it indwells. It is for
 the latter to cling to it; and thus partaking of its divine nature,
 obtain immortality. Left to itself the Monad will cling to no
 one; but, like the "plank," be drifted away to another
 incarnation by the unresting current of evolution.
 </p><p>
 * The term "Man epoch" is here used because of the necessity
 of giving a name to that fourth kingdom which follows the animal.
 But in truth the "Man" on Globe A during the First Round
 is no Man, but only his prototype or dimensionless image from
 the astral regions.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 176 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 mineral epoch on Globe A, prepares the way for the vegetable development,
 and, as soon as this begins, the mineral life-impulse overflows
 into Globe B. Then, when the vegetable development on Globe A
 is complete and the animal development begins, the vegetable life-impulse
 overflows to Globe B, and the mineral impulse passes on to Globe
 C. Then finally comes the human life-impulse on Globe A."
 (Page 49.)
 </p><p>
 And so it goes on for three Rounds, when it slackens, and finally
 stops at the threshold of our Globe, at the Fourth Round; because
 the human period (of the true physical men to be), the seventh,
 is now reached. This is evident, for as said, " . . . there
 are processes of evolution which precede the mineral kingdom,
 and thus a wave of evolution, indeed several waves of evolution,
 precede the mineral wave in its progress round the spheres"
 (<em>ibid</em>)<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 And now we have to quote from another article, "The Mineral
 Monad" in "<em>Five Years of Theosophy</em>,"<em>
 </em>p. 273 <em>et seq.</em> 
 </p><p>
 "There are seven kingdoms. The first group comprises three
 degrees of elementals, or nascent centres of forces -- from the
 first stage of differentiation of (from) Mulaprakriti (or rather
 Pradhana, primordial homogeneous matter) to its third degree --
 <em>i.e.</em>, from full unconsciousness to semi-perception; the
 second or higher group embraces the kingdoms from vegetable to
 man; the mineral kingdom thus forming the central or turning point
 in the degrees of the "Monadic Essence," considered
 as an evoluting energy. Three stages (sub-physical) on the elemental
 side; the mineral kingdom; three stages on the objective physical*
 side -- these are the (first or preliminary) seven links of the
 evolutionary chain."
 </p><p>
 "Preliminary" because they are preparatory, and though
 belonging in fact to the natural, they yet would be more correctly
 described as sub-natural evolution. This process makes a halt
 in its stages at the Third, at the threshold of the Fourth stage,
 when it becomes, on the plane of the natural evolution, the first
 really manward stage, thus forming with the three elemental kingdoms,
 the ten, the Sephirothal number. It is at this point that begins:
 --
 </p><p>
 "A descent of spirit into matter equivalent to an ascent
 in physical
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * "Physical" here means differentiated for cosmical
 purposes and work; that "physical side," nevertheless,
 if objective to the apperception of beings from other planes,
 is yet quite subjective to us on our plane.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 177 AS ABOVE, SO BELOW, IS THE LAW.</h6>
 
 <p>
 evolution; a re-ascent from the deepest depths of materiality
 (the mineral) towards its <em>status quo ante</em>,<em> </em>with
 a corresponding dissipation of concrete organism -- up to Nirvana,
 the vanishing point of differentiated matter." ("<em>Five
 Years of Theosophy</em>,"<em> </em>p. 276.)
 </p><p>
 Therefore it becomes evident why that which is pertinently called
 in <em>Esoteric Buddhism </em>"Wave of Evolution," and
 mineral-, vegetable-, animal- and man-"impulse," stops
 at the door of our Globe, at its Fourth cycle or Round. It is
 at this point that the Cosmic Monad (Buddhi) will be wedded to
 and become the vehicle of the Atmic Ray, <em>i.e.</em>, it (Buddhi)
 will awaken to an apperception of it (Atman); and thus enter on
 the first step of a new septenary ladder of evolution, which will
 lead it eventually to the tenth (counting from the lowest upwards)
 of the Sephirothal tree, the Crown.
 </p><p>
 Everything in the Universe follows analogy. "As above, so
 below"; Man is the microcosm of the Universe. That which
 takes place on the spiritual plane repeats itself on the Cosmic
 plane. Concretion follows the lines of abstraction; corresponding
 to the highest must be the lowest; the material to the spiritual.
 Thus, corresponding to the Sephirothal Crown (or upper triad)
 there are the three elemental Kingdoms, which precede the Mineral
 (see diagram on p. 277 in <em>Five Years of Theosophy</em>),<em>
 </em>and which, using the language of the Kabalists, answer in
 the Cosmic differentiation to the worlds of Form and Matter from
 the Super-Spiritual to the Archetypal.
 </p><p>
 Now what is a "Monad?" And what relation does it bear
 to an Atom? The following reply is based upon the explanations
 given in answer to these questions in the above-cited article:
 "The Mineral Monad," written by the author.
 </p><p>
 "None whatever," is answered to the second question,
 "to the atom or molecule as existing in the scientific conception
 at present. It can neither be compared with the microscopic organism,
 once classed among polygastric infusoria, and now regarded as
 vegetable, and classed among Algae; nor is it quite the Monas
 of the Peripatetics. Physically or constitutionally the mineral
 monad differs, of course, from the human monad, which is neither
 physical nor can its constitution be rendered by chemical symbols
 and elements." In short, as the spiritual Monad is One, Universal,
 Boundless and Impartite, whose rays, nevertheless, form what we,
 in our ignorance, call the "Individual Monads" of men,
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 178 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 so the Mineral Monad -- being at the opposite point of the circle
 -- is also One -- and from it proceed the countless physical atoms,
 which Science is beginning to regard as individualized.
 </p><p>
 Otherwise how could one account for and explain mathematically
 the evolutionary and spiral progress of the Four Kingdoms? The
 "Monad" is the combination of the last two "principles"
 in man, the 6th and the 7th, and, properly speaking, the term
 "human monad" applies only to the dual soul (Atma-Buddhi),
 not to its highest spiritual vivifying Principle, Atma, alone.
 But since the Spiritual Soul, if divorced from the latter (Atma)
 could have no existence, no being, it has thus been called . .
 . . Now the Monadic, or rather Cosmic, Essence (if such a term
 be permitted) in the mineral, vegetable, and animal, though the
 same throughout the series of cycles from the lowest elemental
 up to the Deva Kingdom, yet differs in the scale of progression.
 It would be very misleading to imagine a Monad as a separate Entity
 trailing its slow way in a distinct path through the lower Kingdoms,
 and after an incalculable series of transformations flowering
 into a human being; in short, that the Monad of a Humboldt dates
 back to the Monad of an atom of horneblende. Instead of saying
 a "Mineral Monad," the more correct phraseology in physical
 Science, which differentiates every atom, would of course have
 been to call it "the Monad manifesting in that form of Prakriti
 called the Mineral Kingdom." The atom, as represented in
 the ordinary scientific hypothesis, is not a particle of something,
 animated by a psychic something, destined after aeons to blossom
 as a man. But it is a concrete manifestation of the Universal
 Energy which itself has not yet become individualized; a sequential
 manifestation of the one Universal Monas. The ocean (of matter)
 does not divide into its potential and constituent drops until
 the sweep of the life-impulse reaches the evolutionary stage of
 man-birth. The tendency towards segregation into individual Monads
 is gradual, and in the higher animals comes almost to the point.
 The Peripatetics applied the word Monas to the whole Kosmos, in
 the pantheistic sense; and the Occultists, while accepting this
 thought for convenience sake, distinguish the progressive stages
 of the evolution of the concrete from the abstract by terms of
 which the "Mineral, Vegetable, Animal, (etc.), Monad"
 are examples. The term merely means that the tidal wave of spiritual
 evolution is passing through that arc of its circuit. The "Monadic
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 179 THE LUNAR MONADS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Essence" begins to imperceptibly differentiate towards individual
 consciousness in the Vegetable Kingdom. As the Monads are uncompounded
 things, as correctly defined by Leibnitz, it is the spiritual
 essence which vivifies them in their degrees of differentiation,
 which properly constitutes the Monad -- not the atomic aggregation,
 which is only the vehicle and the substance through which thrill
 the lower and the higher degrees of intelligence.
 </p><p>
 Leibnitz conceived of the Monads as elementary and indestructible
 units endowed with the power <em>of giving and receiving </em>with
 respect to other units, and thus of determining all spiritual
 and physical phenomena. It is he who invented the term apperception,
 which together with nerve- (not perception, but rather) -- sensation,
 expresses the state of the Monadic consciousness through all the
 Kingdoms up to Man.
 </p><p>
 Thus it may be wrong on strictly metaphysical lines to call Atma-Buddhi
 a MONAD, since in the materialistic view it is dual and therefore
 compound. But as Matter is Spirit, and <em>vice versa; </em>and
 since the Universe and the Deity which informs it are unthinkable
 apart from each other; so in the case of Atma-Buddhi. The latter
 being the vehicle of the former, Buddhi stands in the same relation
 to Atma, as Adam-Kadmon, the Kabalistic Logos, does to En-Soph,
 or Mulaprakriti to Parabrahm.
 </p><p>
 A few words more of the Moon.
 </p><p>
 What, it may be asked, are the "Lunar Monads," just
 spoken of? The description of the seven classes of Pitris will
 come later, but now some general explanations may be given. It
 must be plain to everyone that they are Monads, who, having ended
 their life-cycle on the lunar chain, which is inferior to the
 terrestrial chain, have incarnated on this one. But there are
 some further details which may be added, though they border too
 closely on forbidden ground to be treated of fully. The last word
 of the mystery is divulged only to the adepts, but it may be stated
 that our satellite is only the gross body of its invisible principles.
 Seeing then that there are 7 Earths, so there are 7 Moons, the
 last one alone being visible; the same for the Sun, whose visible
 body is called a Maya, a reflection, just as man's body is. "The
 real Sun and the real Moon are as invisible as the real man,"
 says an occult maxim.
 </p><p>
 And it may be remarked <em>en passant </em>that those ancients
 were not so foolish after all who first started the idea of "the
 seven moons." For though</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 180 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 this conception is now taken solely as an astronomical measure
 of time, in a very materialised form, yet underlying the husk
 there can still be recognised the traces of a profoundly philosophical
 idea.
 </p><p>
 In reality the Moon is only the satellite of the Earth in one
 respect, viz., that physically the Moon revolves round the Earth.
 But in every other respect it is the Earth which is the satellite
 of the Moon, and not <em>vice versa. </em>Startling as the statement
 may seem it is not without confirmation from scientific knowledge.
 It is evidenced by the tides, by the cyclic changes in many forms
 of disease which coincide with the lunar phases; it can be traced
 in the growth of plants, and is very marked in the phenomena of
 human gestation and conception. The importance of the Moon and
 its influence on the Earth were recognized in every ancient religion,
 notably the Jewish, and have been remarked by many observers of
 psychical and physical phenomena. But, so far as Science knows,
 the Earth's action on the Moon is confined to the physical attraction,
 which causes her to circle in her orbit. And should an objector
 insist that this fact alone is sufficient evidence that the Moon
 is truly the Earth's satellite on other planes of action, one
 may reply by asking whether a mother, who walks round and round
 her child's cradle keeping watch over the infant, is the subordinate
 of her child or dependent upon it; though in one sense she is
 its satellite, yet she is certainly older and more fully developed
 than the child she watches.
 </p><p>
 It is, then, the Moon that plays the largest and most important
 part, as well in the formation of the Earth itself, as in the
 peopling thereof with human beings. The "Lunar Monads"
 or Pitris, the ancestors of man, become in reality man himself.
 They are the "Monads" who enter on the cycle of evolution
 on Globe A, and who, passing round the chain of planets, evolve
 the human form as has just been shown. At the beginning of the
 human stage of the Fourth Round on this Globe, they "ooze
 out" their astral doubles from the "ape-like" forms
 which they had evolved in Round III. And it is this subtle, finer
 form, which serves as the model round which Nature builds physical
 man. These "Monads" or "divine sparks" are
 thus the "Lunar" ancestors, the Pitris themselves. For
 these "Lunar Spirits" have to become "Men"
 in order that their "Monads" may reach a higher plane
 of activity and self-consciousness, <em>i.e.</em>, the plane of
 the Manasa-Putras, those who</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 181 A TRIPLE EVOLUTION IN NATURE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 endow the "senseless" shells, created and informed by
 the Pitris, with "mind" in the latter part of the Third
 Root-Race.
 </p><p>
 In the same way the "Monads" or Egos of the men of the
 seventh Round of our Earth, after our own Globes A, B, C, D, <em>et
 seq.</em>,<em> </em>parting with their life-energy, will have
 informed and thereby called to life other laya-centres destined
 to live and act on a still higher plane of being -- in the same
 way will the Terrene "Ancestors" create those who will
 become their superiors.
 </p><p>
 It now becomes plain that there exists in Nature a triple evolutionary
 scheme, for the formation of the three <em>periodical Upadhis</em>;
 or rather three separate schemes of evolution, which in our system
 are inextricably interwoven and interblended at every point. These
 are the Monadic (or spiritual), the intellectual, and the physical
 evolutions. These three are the finite aspects or the reflections
 on the field of Cosmic Illusion of ATMA, the seventh, the ONE
 REALITY.
 </p><p>
 1. The Monadic is, as the name implies, concerned with the growth
 and development into still higher phases of activity of the Monad
 in conjunction with: --
 </p><p>
 2. The Intellectual, represented by the Manasa-Dhyanis (the Solar
 Devas, or the Agnishwatta Pitris) the "givers of intelligence
 and consciousness"* to man and: --
 </p><p>
 3. The Physical, represented by the Chhayas of the lunar Pitris,
 round which Nature has concreted the present physical body. This
 body serves as the vehicle for the "growth" (to use
 a misleading word) and the transformations through Manas and --
 owing to the accumulation of experiences -- of the finite into
 the INFINITE, of the transient into the Eternal and Absolute.
 </p><p>
 Each of these three systems has its own laws, and is ruled and
 guided by different sets of the highest Dhyanis or "Logoi."
 Each is represented in the constitution of man, the Microcosm
 of the great Macrocosm; and it is the union of these three streams
 in him which makes him the complex being he now is.
 </p><p>
 "Nature," the physical evolutionary Power, could never
 evolve intelligence unaided -- she can only create "senseless
 forms," as will be seen in our "<strong>A</strong>NTHROPOGENESIS."
 The "Lunar Monads" cannot progress, for they have not
 yet had sufficient touch with the forms

 created by "Nature" to allow of their accumulating experiences
 through its means. It is the Manasa-Dhyanis who fill up the gap,
 and they represent the evolutionary power of Intelligence and
 Mind, the link between "Spirit" and "Matter"
 -- in this Round.
 </p><p>
 Also it must be borne in mind that the Monads which enter upon
 the evolutionary cycle upon Globe A, in the first Round, are in
 very different stages of development. Hence the matter becomes
 somewhat complicated. . . . Let us recapitulate.
 </p><p>
 The most developed Monads (the lunar) reach the human germ-stage
 in the first Round; become terrestrial, though very ethereal human
 beings towards the end of the Third Round, remaining on it (the
 globe) through the "obscuration" period as the seed
 for future mankind in the Fourth Round, and thus become the pioneers
 of Humanity at the beginning of this, the Fourth Round. Others
 reach the Human stage only during later Rounds, <em>i.e.</em>,
 in the second, third, or first half of the Fourth Round. And finally
 the most retarded of all, <em>i.e.</em>, those still occupying
 animal forms after the middle turning-point of the Fourth Round
 -- will not become men at all during this Manwantara. They will
 reach to the verge of humanity only at the close of the seventh
 Round to be, in their turn, ushered into a new chain after <em>pralaya
 </em>-- by older pioneers, the progenitors of humanity, or the
 Seed-Humanity (<em>Sishta</em>),<em> </em>viz., the men who will
 be at the head of all at the end of these Rounds.
 </p><p>
 The student hardly needs any further explanation on the part played
 by the fourth Globe and the fourth Round in the scheme of evolution.
 </p><p>
 From the preceding diagrams, which are applicable, <em>mutatis
 mutandis</em>,<em> </em>to Rounds, Globes or Races, it will be
 seen that the fourth member of a series occupies a unique position.
 Unlike the others, the Fourth has no "sister" Globe
 on the same plane as itself, and it thus forms the fulcrum of
 the "balance" represented by the whole chain. It is
 the sphere of final evolutionary adjustments, the world of Karmic
 scales, the Hall of Justice, where the balance is struck which
 determines the future course of the Monad during the remainder
 of its incarnations in the cycle. And therefore it is, that, after
 this central turning-point has been passed in the Great Cycle,
 -- <em>i.e.</em>, after the middle point of the Fourth Race in
 the Fourth Round on our Globe -- no more Monads can enter the
 human kingdom. The door is closed for this Cycle and the balance
 struck. For were it otherwise -- had there been a new soul</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 183 MAN, THE OLDEST SON OF THE EARTH.</h6>
 
 <p>
 created for each of the countless milliards of human beings that
 have passed away, and had there been no reincarnation -- it would
 become difficult indeed to provide room for the disembodied "Spirits;"
 nor could the origin and cause of suffering ever be accounted
 for. It is the ignorance of the occult tenets and the enforcement
 of false conceptions under the guise of religious education, which
 have created materialism and atheism as a protest against the
 asserted divine order of things.
 </p><p>
 The only exceptions to the rule just stated are the "dumb
 races," whose Monads are already within the human stage,
 in virtue of the fact that these "animals" are later
 than, and even half descended from man, their last descendants
 being the anthropoid and other apes. These "human presentments"
 are in truth only the distorted copies of the early humanity.
 But this will receive full attention in the next Book.
 </p><p>
 As the Commentary, broadly rendered, says: --
 </p><p>
 1<em>. </em>"<em>Every form on earth</em>,<em> and every
 speck </em>(<em>atom</em>)<em> in Space strives in its efforts
 towards self-formation to follow the model placed for it in the
 </em>' HEAVENLY MAN.' . . <em>. Its </em>(<em>the atom</em>'<em>s</em>)<em>
 involution and evolution</em>,<em> its external and internal growth
 and development</em>,<em> have all one and the same object</em>
 --<em> man; man</em>,<em> as the highest physical and ultimate
 form on this earth; the</em> MONAD, <em>in its absolute totality
 and awakened condition -- as the culmination of the divine incarnations
 on Earth.</em>"
 </p><p>
 2.<em> </em>"<em>The Dhyanis </em>(<em>Pitris</em>)<em> are
 those who have evolved their </em>BHUTA (<em>doubles</em>)<em>
 from themselves</em>,<em> which RUPA </em>(<em>form</em>)<em>
 has become the vehicle of monads </em>(<em>seventh and sixth principles</em>)<em>
 that had completed their cycle of transmigration in the three
 preceding Kalpas </em>(<em>Rounds</em>)<em>. Then</em>,<em> they
 </em>(<em>the astral doubles</em>)<em> became the men of the first
 Human Race of the Round. But they were not complete</em>,<em>
 and were senseless.</em>"
 </p><p>
 This will be explained in the Books that follow. Meanwhile man
 -- or rather his Monad -- has existed on the earth from the very
 beginning of this Round. But, up to our own Fifth Race, the external
 shapes which covered those divine astral doubles changed and consolidated
 with every sub-race; the form and physical structure of the fauna
 changing at the same time, as they had to be adapted to the ever-changing
 conditions of life on this globe during the geological periods
 of its formative cycle. And thus shall they go on changing with
 every</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 184 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 Root Race and <em>every chief sub-race </em>down to the last one
 of the Seventh in this Round.
 </p><p>
 3.<em> </em>"<em>The inner</em>,<em> now concealed</em>,<em>
 man</em>,<em> was then </em>(<em>in the beginnings</em>)<em> the
 external man. The progeny of the Dhyanis </em>(<em>Pitris</em>),<em>
 he was </em>'<em>the son like unto his father.</em>'<em> Like
 the lotus</em>,<em> whose external shape assumes gradually the
 form of the model within itself</em>,<em> so did the form of man
 in the beginning evolve from within without. After the cycle in
 which man began to procreate his species after the fashion of
 the present animal kingdom</em>,<em> it became the reverse. The
 human foetus follows now in its transformations all the forms
 that the physical frame of man had assumed throughout the three
 Kalpas </em>(<em>Rounds</em>)<em> during the tentative efforts
 at Plastic formation around the monad by senseless</em>,<em> because
 imperfect</em>,<em> matter</em>,<em> in her blind wanderings.
 In the present age</em>,<em> the physical embryo is a plant</em>,<em>
 a reptile</em>,<em> an animal</em>,<em> before it finally becomes
 man</em>,<em> evolving within himself his own ethereal counterpart</em>,<em>
 in his turn. In the beginning it was that counterpart </em>(<em>astral
 man</em>)<em> which</em>,<em> being senseless</em>,<em> got entangled
 in the meshes of matter.</em>"
 </p><p>
 But this "man" belongs to the fourth Round. As shown,
 the MONAD had passed through, journeyed and been imprisoned in,
 every transitional form throughout every kingdom of nature during
 the three preceding Rounds. But the monad which becomes human
 <em>is not the Man. </em>In this Round -- with the exception of
 the highest mammals after man, the anthropoids destined to die
 out in this our race, when their monads will be liberated and
 pass into the astral human forms (or the highest elementals) of
 the Sixth* and the Seventh Races, and then into lowest human forms
 in the fifth Round -- no units of either of the kingdoms are animated
 any longer by monads destined to become human in their next stage,
 but only by the lower Elementals of their respective realms.**

 The last human Monad incarnated before the beginning of the 5th

 <p>
 * Nature never repeats herself, therefore the anthropoids of our
 day have not existed at any time since the middle of the Miocene
 period; when, like all cross breeds, they began to show a tendency,
 more and more marked as time went on, to return to the type of
 their first parent, the black and yellow gigantic Lemuro-Atlantean.
 To search for the "Missing Link" is useless. To the
 scientists of the closing sixth Root-race, millions and millions
 of years hence, our modern races, or rather their fossils, will
 appear as those of small insignificant apes -- an extinct species
 of the genus homo.

 turn, only at the next great planetary Manvantara.</p><hr>

 Root-Race.* The cycle of <em>metempsychosis </em>for the human
 monad is closed, for we are in the Fourth Round and the Fifth
 Root-Race. The reader will have to bear in mind -- at any rate
 one who has made himself acquainted with "Esoteric Buddhism"
 -- that the Stanzas which follow in this Book and Book II speak
 of the evolution in our Fourth Round only. The latter is the cycle
 of the turning-point, after which, matter,

 <p>
 * Such anthropoids form an exception because they were not intended
 by Nature, but are the direct product and creation of "senseless"
 man. The Hindus give a divine origin to the apes and monkeys because
 the men of the Third Race were gods from another plane who had
 become "senseless" mortals. This subject had already
 been touched upon in "Isis Unveiled" twelve years ago
 as plainly as was then possible. On pp. 278-279, the reader is
 referred "to the Brahmins, if he would know the reason of
 the regard they have for the monkeys. For then he (the reader)
 would perhaps learn -- were the Brahman to judge him worthy of
 an explanation -- that the Hindu sees in the ape but what Manu
 desired he should: the transformation of species most directly
 connected with that of the human family, a bastard branch engrafted
 on their own stock before the final perfection of the latter.
 He might learn, further, that in the eyes of the educated 'heathen'
 the spiritual or inner man is one thing, and his terrestrial physical
 casket another. That physical nature, the great combination of
 physical correlations of forces, ever creeping onward towards
 perfection, has to avail herself of the material at hand; she
 models and remodels as she proceeds, and finishing her crowning
 work in man, presents him alone as a fit tabernacle for the overshadowing
 of the divine Spirit."
 </p><p>
 Moreover, a German scientific work is mentioned in a footnote
 on the same page. It says that a Hanoverian scientist had recently
 published a Book entitled "Ueber die Auflosung der Arten
 durch Naturliche Zucht-wahl," in which he shows, with great
 ingenuity, that Darwin was wholly mistaken in tracing man back
 to the ape. On the contrary, he maintains that it is the ape which
 is evolved from man. He shows that, in the beginning, mankind
 were morally and physically the types and prototypes of our present
 Race, and of our human dignity, by their beauty of form, regularity
 of feature, cranial development, nobility of sentiments, heroic
 impulses, and grandeur of ideal conception. This is a purely Brahmanic,
 Buddhistic and Kabalistic philosophy. The Book is copiously illustrated
 with diagrams, tables, etc. It asserts that the gradual debasement
 and degradation of man, morally and physically, can be readily
 traced throughout the ethnological transformation down to our
 time. And, as one portion has already degenerated into apes, so
 the civilized man of the present day will at last, under the action
 of the inevitable law of necessity, be also succeeded by like
 descendants. If we may judge of the future by the actual Present,
 it certainly does seem possible that so unspiritual and materialistic
 a body should end as Simia rather than as Seraphs. But though
 the apes descend from man, it is certainly not the fact that the
 human Monad, which has once reached the level of humanity, ever
 incarnates again in the form of an animal.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 186 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 having reached its lowest depths, begins to strive onward and
 to get spiritualized with every new Race and with every fresh
 cycle. Therefore the student must take care not to see contradiction
 where there is none, as in "Esoteric Buddhism" Rounds
 are spoken of in general, while here only the Fourth, or our present
 Round, is meant. Then it was the work of formation; now it is
 that of reformation and evolutionary perfection.
 </p><p>
 Finally, to close this chapter anent various, but unavoidable
 misconceptions, we must refer to a statement in "Esoteric
 Buddhism" which has produced a very fatal impression upon
 the minds of many Theosophists. One unfortunate sentence from
 the work just referred to is constantly brought forward to prove
 the materialism of the doctrine. On p. 48, 5th Edition, the Author,
 referring to the progress of organisms on the Globes, says that
 "the mineral kingdom will no more develop the vegetable .
 . . than the Earth was able to develop man from the ape, till
 it received an impulse."
 </p><p>
 Whether this sentence renders literally the thought of the author,
 or is simply (as we believe it is) a <em>lapsus calami</em>,<em>
 </em>may remain an open question.
 </p><p>
 It is really with surprise that we have ascertained the fact that
 "Esoteric Buddhism" was so little understood by some
 Theosophists, as to have led them into the belief that it thoroughly
 supported Darwinian evolution, and especially the theory of the
 descent of man from a pithecoid ancestor. As one member writes:
 "I suppose you realise that three-fourths of Theosophists
 and even outsiders imagine that, as far as the evolution of man
 is concerned, Darwinism and Theosophy kiss one another."
 Nothing of the kind was ever realised, nor is there any great
 warrant for it, so far as we know, in "Esoteric Buddhism."
 It has been repeatedly stated that evolution as taught by Manu
 and Kapila was the groundwork of the modern teachings, but neither
 Occultism nor Theosophy has ever supported the wild theories of
 the present Darwinists -- least of all the descent of man from
 an ape. Of this, more hereafter. But one has only to turn to p.
 47 of "Esoteric Buddhism," 5th edition, to find there
 the statement that "Man belongs to a kingdom distinctly separate
 from that of the animals." With such a plain and unequivocal
 statement before him, it is very strange that any careful student
 should have been so misled unless he is prepared to charge the
 author with a gross contradiction.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 187 AN ERRONEOUS OPINION.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Every Round repeats on a higher scale the evolutionary work of
 the preceding Round. With the exception of some higher anthropoids,
 as just mentioned, the Monadic inflow, or inner evolution, is
 at an end till the next Manvantara. It can never be too often
 repeated, that the full-blown human Monads have to be first disposed
 of, before the new crop of candidates appears on this Globe at
 the beginning of the next cycle. Thus there is a lull; and this
 is why, during the Fourth Round, man appears on Earth earlier
 than any animal creation, as will be described.
 </p><p>
 But it is still urged that the author of "Esoteric Buddhism"
 has "preached Darwinism" all along. Certain passages
 would undoubtedly seem to lend countenance to this inference.
 Besides which the Occultists themselves are ready to concede <i>partial
 </i>correctness to the Darwinian hypothesis, in later details,
 bye-laws of Evolution, and after the midway point of the Fourth
 Race. Of that which has taken place, physical science can really
 know nothing, for such matters lie entirely outside of its sphere
 of investigation. But what the Occultists have never admitted,
 nor will they ever admit, is that man was <em>an ape in this or
 in any other Round; </em>or that he ever could be one, however
 much he may have been "ape-like." This is vouched for
 by the very authority from whom the author of "Esoteric Buddhism"
 got his information.
 </p><p>
 Thus to those who confront the Occultists with these lines from
 the above-named volume: "It is enough to show that we may
 as reasonably -- and that we must, if we would talk about these
 matters at all -- conceive a life-impulse giving birth to mineral
 form, as of the same sort of impulse concerned to <em>raise a
 race of apes into a race of rudimentary men.</em>"<em> </em>To
 those who bring this passage forward as showing "decided
 Darwinism," the Occultists answer by pointing to the explanation
 of the Master (Mr. Sinnett's "teacher") which would
 contradict these lines, were they written in the spirit attributed
 to them. A copy of this letter was sent to the writer, together
 with others, two years ago (1886), with additional marginal remarks,
 to quote from, in the "<em>Secret Doctrine.</em>"<em>
 </em>It begins by considering the difficulty experienced by the
 Western student, in reconciling some facts, previously given,
 with the evolution of man from the animal, <em>i.e.</em>, from
 the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, and advises the student
 to hold to the doctrine of analogy and correspondences. Then it
 touches upon the mystery of the Devas,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 188 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 and even Gods, having to pass through states which it was agreed
 to refer to as "Inmetallization, Inherbation, Inzoonization
 and finally Incarnation," and explains this by hinting at
 the necessity of failures even in the ethereal races of Dhyan
 Chohans. Concerning this it says:
 </p><p>
 "Still, as these 'failures' are too far progressed and spiritualized
 to be thrown back forcibly from Dhyan Chohanship into the vortex
 of a new primordial evolution through the lower kingdoms. . .
 . ." After which only a hint is given about the mystery contained
 in the allegory of the fallen Asuras, which will be expanded and
 explained in Book II. When Karma has reached them at the stage
 of human evolution, "they will have to drink it to the last
 drop in the bitter cup of retribution. Then they become an active
 force and commingle with the Elementals, the progressed entities
 of the pure animal kingdom, to develop little by little the full
 type of humanity."
 </p><p>
 These Dhyan Chohans, as we see, do not pass through the three
 kingdoms as do the lower Pitris; nor do they incarnate in man
 until the Third Root Race. Thus, as the teaching stands:
 </p><p>
 "<em>Man in the First Round and First Race on Globe D</em>,<em>
 our Earth</em>,<em> was an ethereal being </em>(<em>a Lunar Dhyani</em>,<em>
 as man</em>),<em> non-intelligent but superspiritual; and correspondingly</em>,<em>
 on the law of analogy</em>,<em> in the First Race of the Fourth
 Round. In each of the subsequent races and sub-races </em>. .
 . <em>he grows more and more into an encased or incarnate being</em>,<em>
 but still preponderatingly ethereal. . </em>. <em>. He is sexless</em>,<em>
 and</em>,<em> like the animal and vegetable he develops monstrous
 bodies correspondential with his coarser surroundings.</em> 
 </p><p>
 "<em>II. Round. He </em>(<em>Man</em>)<em> is still gigantic
 and ethereal but growing firmer and more condensed in body</em>,<em>
 a more physical man. Yet still less intelligent than spiritual
 </em>(1),<em> for mind is a slower and more difficult evolution
 than is the physical frame </em>. . .
 </p><p>
 "<em>III. Round. He has now a perfectly concrete or compacted
 body</em>,<em> at first the form of a giant-ape</em>,<em> and
 now more intelligent</em>,<em> or rather cunning</em>,<em> than
 spiritual. For</em>,<em> on the downward arc</em>,<em> he has
 now reached a point where his primordial spirituality is eclipsed
 and overshadowed by nascent mentality </em>(2). <em>In the last
 half of the Third Round his gigantic stature decreases</em>,<em>
 and his body improves in texture</em>,<em> and he becomes a more
 rational being</em>,<em> though still more an ape than a</em>
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 189 A MASTER'S LETTER.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>Deva</em>. . . . (<em>All this is almost exactly repeated
 in the third Root-Race of the Fourth Round.</em>)
 </p><p>
 "<em>IV. Round. Intellect has an enormous development in
 this Round. The </em>(<em>hitherto</em>)<em> dumb races acquire
 </em><i>our </i>(<em>present</em>)<em> human speech on this globe</em>,<em>
 on which</em>,<em> from the Fourth Race</em>,<em> language is
 perfected and knowledge increases. At this half-way point of the
 Fourth Round </em>(<em>as of the Fourth Root</em>,<em> or Atlantean</em>,<em>
 race</em>)<em> humanity passes the axial point of the minor Manvantara
 cycle </em>. . . . <em>the world teeming with the results of intellectual
 activity and spiritual decrease . </em>. . ."
 </p><p>
 This is from the authentic letter; what follows are the later
 remarks and additional explanations traced by the same hand in
 the form of footnotes.
 </p><p>
 (1.) " . . <em>. The original letter contained general teaching
 -- a </em>'<em>bird</em>'<em>s eye view</em>'<em> -- and particularized
 nothing</em>. . . . <em>To </em><i>speak of 'physical man'</i>
 <em>while limiting the statement to the early Rounds would be
 drifting back to the miraculous and instantaneous </em>'<em>coats
 of skin.</em>'<em> . </em>. <em>. The first </em>'<em>Nature</em>,'<em>
 the first </em>'<em>body</em>,'<em> the first </em>'<em>mind</em>'<em>
 on the first plane of perception</em>,<em> on the first Globe
 in the </em><i>first</i> <em>Round</em>,<em> is what was meant.
 For Karma and evolution have </em>--
 </p><blockquote>
 ' . . . <em>centred in our make such strange extremes!<br>
 From different Natures* marvellously mixed</em> . . .'
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 (2.)<em> </em>"<em>Restore: he has now reached the point
 (by analogy</em>,<em> and as the</em> <em>Third Root Race in the
 Fourth Round</em>)<em> where his </em>("<em>the angel</em>"<em>-man</em>'<em>s</em>)<em>
 primordial spirituality is eclipsed and overshadowed by nascent
 human mentality</em>,<em> and you have the true version on your
 thumb-nail</em>. . . ."
 </p><p>
 These are the words of the Teacher -- text, words and sentences
 in brackets, and explanatory footnotes. It stands to reason that
 there must be an enormous difference in such terms as "objectivity"
 and "subjectivity," "materiality" and "spirituality,"
 when the same terms are applied to different planes of being and
 perception. All this must be taken in its relative sense. And
 therefore there is little to be wondered at, if, left to his own
 speculations, an author, however eager to learn, yet quite inexperienced
 in these abstruse teachings, has fallen

 <p>
 * The<em> Natures </em>of the seven hierarchies or classes of
 Pitris and Dhyan Chohans which compose our nature and Bodies are

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 190 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 into an error. Neither was the difference between the "Rounds"
 and the "Races" sufficiently defined in the letters
 received, nor was there anything of the kind required before,
 as the ordinary Eastern disciple would have found out the difference
 in a moment. Moreover, to quote from a letter of the Master's
 (188-), "the teachings were imparted under protest. . . .
 They were, so to say, smuggled goods . . . and when I remained
 face to face with only one correspondent, the other, Mr. . . .
 ., had so far tossed all the cards into confusion, that little
 remained to be said without trespassing upon law." Theosophists,
 "whom it may concern," will understand what is meant.
 </p><p>
 The outcome of all this is that nothing had ever been said in
 the "letters" to warrant the assurance that the Occult
 doctrine has ever taught, or any Adept believed in, the preposterous
 modern theory of the descent of man from a common ancestor with
 the ape -- an anthropoid of the actual animal kind, unless metaphorically.
 To this day the world is more full of "ape-like men"
 than the woods are of "men-like apes." The ape is sacred
 in India because its origin is well known to the Initiates, though
 concealed under a thick veil of allegory. Hanuman is the son of
 Pavana (Vayu, "the god of the wind") by Anjana, a monster
 called Kesari, though his genealogy varies. The reader who bears
 this in mind will find in Book II.<em> passim</em>,<em> </em>the
 whole explanation of this ingenious allegory. The "Men"
 of the Third Race (who separated) were "Gods" by their
 spirituality and purity, though senseless, and as yet destitute
 of mind, as men.
 </p><p>
 These "Men" of the Third Race -- the ancestors of the
 Atlanteans -- were just such ape-like, intellectually senseless
 giants as were those beings, who, during the Third Round, represented
 Humanity. Morally irresponsible, it was these third Race "men"
 who, through promiscuous connection with animal species lower
 than themselves, created that missing link which became ages later
 (in the tertiary period only) the remote ancestor of the real
 ape as we find it now in the pithecoid family.*
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * And if this is found clashing with that other statement which
 shows the animal later than man, then the reader is asked to bear
 in mind that the <em>placental mammal </em>only is meant. In those
 days there were animals of which zoology does not even dream in
 our own; <em>and the modes of reproduction were not identical
 </em>with the notions which modern physiology has upon the subject.
 It is not altogether convenient to touch upon such questions in
 public, but there is <i>no</i> contradiction or impossibility
 in this whatever. </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 191 THE PRELIMINARY CREATION OF MAN.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Thus the earlier teachings, however unsatisfactory, vague and
 fragmentary, did not teach the evolution of "man" from
 the "ape." Nor does the author of "Esoteric Buddhism"
 assert it anywhere in his work in so many words; but, owing to
 his inclination towards modern science, he uses language which
 might perhaps justify such an inference. The man who preceded
 the Fourth, the Atlantean race, however much he may have looked
 physically like a "gigantic ape" -- "the counterfeit
 of man who hath not the life of a man" -- was still a thinking
 and already a speaking man. The "Lemuro-Atlantean" was
 a highly civilized race, and if one accepts tradition, which is
 better history than the speculative fiction which now passes under
 that name, he was higher than we are with all our sciences and
 the degraded civilization of the day: at any rate, the Lemuro-Atlantean
 of the closing Third Race was so.
 </p><p>
 And now we may return to the Stanzas.
