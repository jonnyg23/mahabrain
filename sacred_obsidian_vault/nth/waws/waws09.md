 <p align="center">The Greatest Thing Ever Known.</p>   
 <p>The moment we   fully and vitally realize <i>who and what   we are</i> we then begin to build our own world even as God builds His.<i>From Title-page</i>.</p>   
 <p>It unfolds the   secret of our underlying strength, and shows what it is that gives us power   to fulfil the real and living purposes of our being.<i>The New Christianity</i>.</p>   
 <p align="center">Every Living Creature.</p>   
 <p>The tender and   humane passion in the human heart is too precious a quality to allow it to be   hardened or effaced by practices such as we so often indulge in.<i>From Title-page</i>.</p>   
 <p>An eloquent   appeal and an able argument for justice and mercy to our dumb   fellow-creatures. A good book for those whose characters are being formed,   and for all who love justice and right.<i>Religio-Philosophical   Journal</i>.</p>   
 <p align="center">Character-Building Thought Power,</p>   
 <p>A thought, good   or evil, an act, in time a habit, so runs life's law; what you live in your   thought-world, that, sooner or later, you will find objectified in your   life.<i>From Title-page</i>.</p>   
 <p>In "Character-Building   Thought Power" Mr. Trine demonstrates the power of mental habits, and   show how by daily effort we may train ourselves into right ways of thinking   and acting. His teachings are sound, practical, and of priceless worth.<i>Albany Press</i>.</p>

 <p align="center">What All The World's A-Seeking.</p>   
 <p>Its purpose is distinctly   practical. It is most fascinatingly written, and deserves the remarkable   success it has achieved.<i>The Review of   Reviews</i>.</p>   
 <p>The volume   abounds in passages of great beauty and strength; but the striking feature of   the book is, after all, the solid, sensible, healthy exposition of the one   theme it is written to enforce.<i>New   York Independent</i>.</p>   
 <p>This is a book   among a thousand for its inspiring message, and is eminently worthy of a vast   audience. You will miss much if you miss reading its truth-laden pages.<i>Cumberland Presbyterian</i>.</p>   
 <p align="center">In Tune With the Infinite</p>   
 <p>It is one of   the simplest, clearest works ever written, dealing with the power of the   interior forces in moulding the every-day conditions of life.<i>San Francisco Bulletin</i>.</p>   
 <p>. . . It   immediately suggests the works of Drummond, but shows a decided advance upon   the ground which he made familiar to mankind; it not only reveals the   author's recognition of spiritual law, but in certain instances shows his   rare and remarkable understanding of the nature and action of such law; the   preface alone shows his high intuition, and the book proves his ability to   achieve his purpose in a marvellous degree.<i>Boston Daily Evening Transcript</i>.</p>   
 <p>Mr. Trine can   write well upon such topics as this. He is alive, vigorous, cheery, confident.   The work has distinctiveness in its style and method.<i>The Literary World, London</i>.</p>
