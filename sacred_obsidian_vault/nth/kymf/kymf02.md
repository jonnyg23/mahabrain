 <p>The theory presented in this book is new only in the sense that it has been revitalized of recent date. It is, in fact, as old as the world. Those who have seen the results of this theory in practice have called it miraculous. Others who have yet to see and learn and understand have called it fakery.</p>  
 <p>I have taken upon myself the task of trying to give as complete and accurate a picture of a person working with this theory as my ability permits. To understand him and interpret him for you is what I am trying to do. He thinks and acts from unshakable knowledge through a Source which most of us are only beginning to recognize dimly. The way in which the Source works through him will have to be understood for us to accept.</p>  
 <p>With my first grasp of this work I suggested that this understanding belongs to the people. He agreed and said he had known for some time that he should try to explain his perception of human energy.</p>  
 <p>This wisdom was present from his birth but its application and growth came about through experiment and experience to the highly developed talent it is today. Endless discussions, arguments and bewilderment</p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>went into my education. Revolutionary ideas were hard to accept at first but repetitious proof left me no choice but to accept and believe. I found explanations for conditions that until now had no explanations. The accomplishment of restored health through the revitalization of nervous systems I have witnessed for over a year now.</p>  
 <p>I remember well a conversation we had when I first tried to comprehend his ability.</p>  
 <p>"This is all so startling and new that I wonder whether the people are ready for you. The trend is in this direction but do you think we have had enough preparation?"</p>  
 <p>"Why is this new and startling?" was his reply. "That is a misunderstanding. It is actually a lost art. Doesn't the Bible explain that some of the people, in ancient days, had the understanding and wisdom of healing through the laying on of hands? Don't you think the laying on of hands was their method of distributing human energy? My opinion is that it was the common and accepted practice of healing at that time. We have come to look upon it as miraculous only because of lost knowledge and its usage down through the centuries. Knowledge and power must have been deliberately kept from the people and retained by a few to exert control over the masses. The Power that goes through me is in everyone. Only the wisdom of its application is necessary."</p>  
 <p>This person is an average appearing man, pleasant, jovial and likable. But after a little while in his presence you are aware of a quality and a force behind him that are indefinable, a something that eludes you. He seems to treat his ability as a joke on himself. His</p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>favorite expression is, "It's crazy, isn't it?" And it does seem so. He talks like a combination mechanic and electrician until you begin to wonder what you are made of, flesh and blood or wires and switches.</p>  
 <p>He works by placing his fingers over nerves and nerve relay centers and this transmits human energizing current into the body. One is first conscious of mild vibration at the point of his touch. Then the vibrations start to move in through one, chase around all over and turn up in the most startling spots on one's body. This is followed by a sensation of warmthcomforting mild heat penetrating every partthe rapid cessation of pain and then the complete relaxation of the entire body and a surge of increased energy and vitality throughout.</p>  
 <p>By the time he has finished "tuning" your heart, opened the switches, strengthened the magnetic field to let the energy current through, burned out the rust and oiled a few joints, you depart in a state of bewilderment but relieved of pain and feeling assured you can be helped and life made attractive and livable again. I've been through it; I know. But I was not satisfied alone with results. I wanted to know how and why.</p>  
 <p>"No one can deny the results you get. Almost everyone feels the energyalmost everyone gets better. What is this energy current?" I inquired.</p>  
 <p>"It is life rayhuman energy on individual wave lengths. To my knowledge there are thirty-six different frequencies. Each individual operates on three waves at different frequencies making numerous combinations of magnetic field control. One must complement</p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>the energy frequency of the magnetic field of the individual being worked upon."</p>  
 <p>"That doesn't make sense to me. I have never heard of such things. I have seen miracles occur here in your office and I would like to have some explanation. All I can sayall anyone can say is, 'It is a gift.' When did you first know of this Power?"</p>  
 <p>"This knowledge has been with me from my earliest memory," he said. "As a youngster a lot of my time was spent on the shore of a lake fishing, quiet and alone. At that time by tuning in, the instructions and explanations would come to me."</p>  
 <p>"Tuning in?" I questioned. "Explanations? What explanations?"</p>  
 <p>"Whythings, people, life, the world. What is in the world, what we are made of and why people do the things they do and get into the difficulties they find themselves in."</p>  
 <p>"But how do you tune in?" I persisted.</p>  
 <p>"If you must know," he went on, "it is similar to the action of a radio receiving set. You might say that after tuning in on the waves the answers and explanations come."</p>  
 <p>The theory of electricity as the life force and body activity is as old as the ages and there are many well versed in this ancient wisdom to whom most of this is known. This person's medium of operation is universal wisdom. This world we live in is composed of gases and electricity. Plant, animal and human life are the result of certain electric energy waves acting upon the gases. Plants, animals and human beings have their own individual energy frequencies to establish and maintain life, growth and development.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>"In this great universe of earth and sky"space is the great universe but within it are many more universes. We are familiar with the solar system of our own universe, but there are two more with corresponding solar systems in direct influence upon our planet, earth, and there may be many more in operation. The power, maintenance and law of life come directly</p>  
 <p>I from these three systems, uniting or blending to become the one, understood as Trinity or Power of Powers. The combined action of these three forces is our own energy current from the three universesone wave length from each of the ruling solar suns on a frequency.</p>  
 <p>At birth the first breath of life is our direct supply, our life line with the universal powerlife itself. As this force is electric in nature, so then we live, move and have our being through electric energy. So long as this energy is established and flows through without obstruction we are in tune with the universal supply of life. When our magnetic field is able to maintain ample contact we receive knowledge, wisdom and contentment with the ability to achieve success.</p>  
 <p>In the lower abdomen, the pelvis, is an intricate system forming the magnetic field, the grouping together of the main trunk nerves and their branches and relay systems extending throughout the entire body. The lungs draw the energy in but the magnetic field must draw the energy from the lungs in order to radiate it through the body. We are no stronger than our magnetic field.</p>  
 <p>Physical symptoms, apparent shortness of breath, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, pain, illness, dysfunction are some of the first indications that insufficient</p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>energy is being distributed. Their intensity is in accordance with the degree of depletion and spasm of the magnetic field. When the depletion of the magnetic field continues the nerves are partially starved for their fuel or energy, creating spasm or nerve tension through the body. This depletion develops into many serious ailments.</p>  
 <p>The solar rays give us life unconditionally but the position of the planets at the time of our birth makes us the individuals we are. Characteristics and personality occur at conception but individuality occurs at birth with the first breath taken. Your individuality is governed by your set sign or so-called soul, establishing your magnetic field, which consists of three different frequencies derived from the Power of Powers, making your set sign of life which is thereafter influenced by the vibrations of all the planets of this universe.</p>  
 <p>For each of us there are many whose energy current is a complement or mate to our sign or energy. One of the mating energies represents the positive element and one the negative. For complete function we must have the flow of both. Nature, being bountiful in all respects, provided for this in the mating of man and woman.</p>  
 <p>The wisdom, and its explanations as he gave me, is the only text book he has used, but by faithful adherence to its direction it has brought him today to the position of so-called Miracle Healer. They are miracles to us because at sight they defy explanation to conditions of life familiar to us. The Source of Wisdom working through this man enables him not only to know what has brought these conditions about but</p>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>also, over and above all this, to know wherein lie many of the faults and tribulations of humanity. Every condition he works upon has specific cause behind the effect which he has investigated and proved, over and over again.</p>  
 <p>The unfolding of his mind has been the most tremendous and inspiring experience of my life. In some instances it has been a slow process, bits of information at a time that would literally daze me, glimpses of his stored-up knowledge that almost frightened me. When I had time to digest and assimilate these instructions, I questioned, "Who are you?"</p>  
 <p>His answer was, "Who? Me? Why do you ask? I am only an instrument the Power operates through. I of myself do nothing. The Power does the work. Actually I am only a mechanic."</p>  
 <p>When he had finished giving me the explanation of universal knowledge as he understands it, I was still left with considerable confusion. Energy, matching energy, fire signs, water signs, mating signs and fueling our nervous systems were terms quite new to me. The part they played in our life from birth to death was new territory and in it I found the answers to the "why" of so many questions we ask about life and how to recognize and avoid repeating our mistakes through the coming generations.</p>  
 <p>He took me through the explanations step by step, through all the searching and the checking he has done for years to prove again and again the accuracy and certainty of the universal wisdom. When he had finished I felt he had taken all my carefully acquired knowledge and teachings, shuffled them like a deck of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>cards and had left me to sort out and rearrange them again into new order.</p>  
 <p>As a nurse I have been familiar with many conditions, mental and physical, all having arisen from maladjustment or incompatibility in sex, marriage and home life. Patients, acquaintances and friends have come to me with their stories. Being in this position I was able to weigh one against the other and found them all similar in nature. Friends with growing, questioning children have come to me for advice. To be better informed on the subject of sex education I made it a point to read numerous books. They all were fundamentally alike but none gave any clue as to why the discontentment in so many marriages. What is wrong with marriage?</p>  
 <p>This person has explained it all through the action of our life rays under planetary or energy influences and I have worked out the proof for myself. I began to explore backward through my own life and my family, then on my friends and acquaintances and confirmation of the facts met me at every turn.</p>  
 <p>We accept without question the influence of the moon on tides; we never dispute the movement of the sun and the planets controlling the changes of the seasons; we accept the magnetic electrical field governing planetary action, but we are usually skeptical that the sun and planetary movements influence our personality and affairs. Since we are only another form of creation why should they not regulate or affect us, too?</p>
