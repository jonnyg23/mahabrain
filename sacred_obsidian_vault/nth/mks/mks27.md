 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">THIS Part explains the entire theory and practice of every system of Metaphysics; it tells how to express harmony, how to express health, how to express abundance. It explains the nature of all conditions, and how they may be changed or removed. It explains how every difficulty, no matter what it is or where it is, can be removed or dissolved, and it explains the only way in which this is ever done or can be done. It also tells of a Master Key by which those who are wise enough to understand, broad enough to weigh the evidence, firm enough to follow their own judgment, and strong enough to make the sacrifice exacted, may enter and partake.</div>  
 <p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">INTRODUCTION. PART TWENTY-FOUR</h4>  
 <p>This is the final Part.</p>  
 <p>If you have practised each of the exercises a few minutes every day, as suggested, you will have found that you can get out of life exactly what you wish by first putting into life that which you wish, and you will probably agree with the adept who said: "The Master Key thought is almost overwhelming; it is so vast, so available, so definite, so reasonable and so usable."</p>  
 <p>The fruit of this knowledge is, as it were, a gift of the Gods; it is the "Truth" that makes men free, not only free from every lack and limitation, but free from sorrow, worry and care. Is it not wonderful to realize that omnipotent law is no respecter of persons; that it makes no difference what your past habit of thought may have been, the way has been prepared.</p>  
 <p>If you are inclined to be religious, the greatest religious teacher the world has ever known made the way so plain that all may follow. If your mental bias is toward physical science, the law will operate with mathematical certainty. If you are inclined to be philosophical, Plato or Emerson may be your teacher; but, in each case, you may, by The Master Key, means reach degrees of power to which it is impossible to assign any limit.</p>  
 <p>An understanding of The Master Key, I believe, is the secret for which the ancient Alchemists vainly sought, because it explains how gold in the mind may be transmuted into gold in the heart and in the hand.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">PART TWENTY-FOUR</h4>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:1">XXIV, 1</a></font></span>1. When the scientists first put the Sun in the centre of the Solar System and sent the earth spinning around it, there was immense surprise and consternation. The whole idea was self-evidently false; nothing was more certain than the movement of the Sun across the sky, and any one could see it descend behind the western hills and sink into the sea; scholars raged and scientists rejected the idea as absurd, yet the evidence has finally carried conviction in the minds of all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:2">XXIV, 2</a></font></span>2. We speak of a bell as a "sounding body," yet we knew that all the bell can do is to produce vibrations in the air. When these vibrations come at the rate of sixteen a second they cause a sound to be heard in the mind. It is possible for the mind to hear vibrations at the rate of 38,000 a second. When the number increases beyond this all is silence again; so that we know that the sound is not in the bell, it is in our own mind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:3">XXIV, 3</a></font></span>3. We speak and even think of the Sun as "giving light." Yet we know it is simply giving forth energy which produces vibrations in the ether at the rate of four hundred trillion a second, causing what are termed light waves, so that we know that what we call light is simply a form of energy and that the only light there is, is the sensation caused in the mind by the motion of the waves. When the number increases, the light changes in colour, each change</p>  
 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p>in colour being caused by shorter and more rapid vibrations; so that although we speak of the rose as being red, the grass as being green, or the sky as being blue, we know that the colours exist only in our minds, and are the sensations experienced by us as the result of the vibrations of light waves. When the vibrations are reduced below four hundred trillion a second, they no longer affect us as light, but we experience the sensation of heat. It is evident, therefore, that we cannot depend upon the evidence of the senses for our information concerning the realities of things; if we did we should believe that the sun moved, that the world was flat instead of round, that the stars were bits of light instead of vast suns.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:4">XXIV, 4</a></font></span>4. The whole range then of the theory and practice of any system of metaphysics consists in knowing the Truth concerning yourself and the world in which you live; in knowing that in order to express harmony, you must think harmony; in order to express health you must think health; and in order to express abundance you must think abundance; to do this you must reverse the evidence of the senses.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:5">XXIV, 5</a></font></span>5. When you come to know that every form of disease, sickness, lack and limitation are simply the result of wrong thinking, you will have come to know "the Truth which shall make you free." You will see how mountains may be removed. If these mountains consist</p>  
 <p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>only of doubt, fear, distrust or other forms of discouragement, they are none the less real, and they need not only to be removed but to be "cast into the sea."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:6">XXIV, 6</a></font></span>6. Your real work consists in convincing yourself of the truth of these statements. When you have succeeded in doing this you will have no difficulty in thinking the truth, and as has been shown, the truth contains a vital principle and will manifest itself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:7">XXIV, 7</a></font></span>7. Those who heal diseases by mental methods have come to know this truth they demonstrate it in their lives and the lives of others daily. They know that life, health and abundance are Omnipresent, filling all space, and they know that those who allow disease or lack of any kind to manifest, have as yet not come into an understanding of this great law.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:8">XXIV, 8</a></font></span>8. As all conditions are thought creations and therefore entirely mental, disease and lack are simply mental conditions in which the person fails to perceive the truth; as soon as the error is removed, the condition is removed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:9">XXIV, 9</a></font></span>9. The method for removing this error is to go into the Silence and know the Truth; as all mind is one mind, you can do this for yourself or anyone else. If you have learned to form mental images of the conditions desired, this will be the easiest and quickest way to secure results; if not, results can be accomplished</p>  
 <p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></a></p>  
 <p>by argument, by the process of convincing yourself absolutely of the truth of your statement.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:10">XXIV, 10</a></font></span>10. Remember, and this is one of the most difficult as well as most wonderful statements to grasp. Remember that no matter what the difficulty is, no matter where it is, no matter who is affected, you have no patient but yourself; you have nothing to do but to convince yourself of the truth which you desire to see manifested.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:11">XXIV, 11</a></font></span>11. This is an exact scientific statement in accordance with every system of Metaphysics in existence, and no permanent results are ever secured in any other way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:12">XXIV, 12</a></font></span>12. Every form of concentration, forming Mental Images, Argument, and Auto-Suggestion are all simply methods by which you are enabled to realize the Truth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:13">XXIV, 13</a></font></span>13. If you desire to help some one, to destroy some form of lack, limitation or error, the correct method is not to think of the person whom you wish to help; the intention to help them is entirely sufficient, as this puts you in mental touch with the person. Then drive out of your own mind any belief of lack, limitation, disease, danger, difficulty, or whatever the trouble might be. As soon as you have succeeded in doing this the result will have been accomplished, and the person will be free.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:14">XXIV, 14</a></font></span>14. But remember that thought is creative and consequently every time you allow your thought to rest on any inharmonious condition, you must realize that such conditions are apparent only, they have no reality; that spirit is the only reality and it can never be less than perfect.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:15">XXIV, 15</a></font></span>15. All thought is a form of energy, a rate of vibration, but a thought of the Truth is the highest rate of vibration known and consequently destroys every form of error in exactly the same way that light destroys darkness; no form of error can exist when the "Truth" appears, so that your entire mental work consists in coming into an understanding of the Truth. This will enable you to overcome every form of lack, limitation or disease of any kind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:16">XXIV, 16</a></font></span>16. We can get no understanding of the truth from the world without; the world without is relative only; Truth is absolute. We must therefore find it in the "world within."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:17">XXIV, 17</a></font></span>17. To train the mind to see Truth only is to express true conditions only. Our ability to do this will be an indication of the progress we are making.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:18">XXIV, 18</a></font></span>18. The absolute truth is that the "I" is perfect and complete; the real "I" is spiritual and can therefore never be less than perfect; it can never have any lack, limitation, or disease. The flash of genius does not have origin in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></a></p>  
 <p>molecular motion of the brain; it is inspired by the ego, the spiritual "I" which is one with the Universal Mind, and it is our ability to recognize this Unity which is the cause of all inspiration, all genius. These results are far-reaching and have effect upon generations yet to come; they are the pillars of fire which mark the path that millions follow.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:19">XXIV, 19</a></font></span>19. Truth is not the result of logical training or of experimentation, or even of observation; it is the product of a developed consciousness; Truth within a Caesar, manifests in a Caesar's deportment, in his life and his action; his influence upon social forms and progress. Your life and your actions and your influence in the world will depend upon the degree of truth which you are enabled to perceive, for truth will not manifest in creeds, but in conduct.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:20">XXIV, 20</a></font></span>20. Truth manifests in character, and the character of a man should be the interpretation of his religion, or what to him is truth, and this will in turn be evidenced in the character of his possessions. If a man complains of the drift of his fortune he is just as unjust to himself as if he should deny rational truth, though it stand patent and irrefutable.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:21">XXIV, 21</a></font></span>21. Our environment and the innumerable circumstances and accidents of our lives already exist in the subconscious personality which attracts to itself the mental and physical material which is congenial to its nature. Thus</p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>is our future being determined from our present, and if there should be apparent injustice in any feature or phase of our personal life, we must look within for the cause, try to discover the mental fact which is responsible for the outward manifestation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:22">XXIV, 22</a></font></span>22. It is this truth which makes you "free," and it is the conscious knowledge of this truth which will enable you to overcome every difficulty.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:23">XXIV, 23</a></font></span>23. The conditions with which you meet in the world without are invariably the result of the conditions obtaining in the world within; therefore it follows with scientific accuracy that by holding the perfect ideal in mind you can bring about ideal conditions in your environment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:24">XXIV, 24</a></font></span>24. If you see only the incomplete, the imperfect, the relative, the limited, these conditions will manifest in your life; but if you train your mind to see and realize the spiritual ego, the "I" which is for ever perfect and complete, harmonious; wholesome and healthful conditions only will be manifested.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:25">XXIV, 25</a></font></span>25. As thought is creative, and the truth is the highest and most perfect thought which anyone can think, it is self-evident that to think the truth is to create that which is true and it is again evident that when truth comes into being that which is false must cease to be.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:26">XXIV, 26</a></font></span>26. The Universal Mind is the totality of all mind which is in existence. Spirit is Mind, because spirit is intelligent. The words are, therefore, synonymous.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:27">XXIV, 27</a></font></span>27. The difficulty with which you have to contend is to realize that mind is not individual. It is omnipresent. It exists everywhere. In other words, there is no place where it is not. It is, therefore, Universal.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:28">XXIV, 28</a></font></span>28. Men have, heretofore, generally used the word "God" to indicate this Universal, creative principle; but the word "God" does not convey the right meaning. Most people understand this word to mean something outside of themselves; while exactly the contrary is the fact. It is our very life. Without it we would be dead. We would cease to exist. The minute the spirit leaves the body, we are as nothing. Therefore, spirit is really all there is of us.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:29">XXIV, 29</a></font></span>29. Now the only activity which the spirit possesses is the power to think. Therefore, thought must be creative, because spirit is creative. This creative power is impersonal and your ability to think is your ability to control it and make use of it for the benefit of yourself and others .</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:30">XXIV, 30</a></font></span>30. When the truth of this statement is realized, understood, and appreciated, you will have come into possession of the Master Key, but remember that only those who are wise</p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p>enough to understand, broad enough to weigh the evidence, firm enough to follow their own judgment, and strong enough to make the sacrifice exacted, may enter and partake.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV:31">XXIV, 31</a></font></span>31. Now, try to realize that this is truly a wonderful world in which we live, that you are a wonderful being, that many are awakening to a knowledge of the Truth, and as fast as they awake and come into a knowledge of the "things which have been prepared for them" they, too, realize that for them previously "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man," the splendour which exists for those who find themselves in the Promised Land. They have crossed the river of judgment and have arrived at the point of discrimination between the true and the false, and have found that all they ever willed or dreamed, was but a faint concept of the dazzling reality.</p>

 <p>231. <i>Upon what principle does the theory and practice of every system of Metaphysics in existence depend?</i></p>  
 <p>Upon a knowledge of the "Truth" concerning yourself and the world in which you live.</p>  
 <p>232. <i>What is the "Truth" concerning yourself?</i></p>  
 <p>The real "I" or ego is spiritual and can therefore never be less than perfect.</p>  
 <p>233. <i>What is the method of destroying any form of error?</i></p>  
 <p>To absolutely convince yourself of the "Truth" concerning the condition which you wish to see manifested.</p>  
 <p>234. <i>Can we do this for others?</i></p>  
 <p>The Universal Mind in which "we live and move and have our being" is one and indivisible; it is therefore just as possible to help others as to help ourselves.</p>  
 <p>235. <i>What is the Universal Mind?</i></p>  
 <p>The totality of all mind in existence.</p>  
 <p>236. <i>Where is the Universal Mind?</i></p>  
 <p>The Universal Mind is omnipresent, it exists everywhere. There is no place</p>  
 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p>where it is not. It is therefore within us. It is "The World within." It is our spirit, our life.</p>  
 <p>237. <i>What is the nature of the Universal Mind?</i></p>  
 <p>It is spiritual and consequently creative. It seeks to express itself in form.</p>  
 <p>238. <i>How may we act on the Universal Mind?</i></p>  
 <p>Our ability to think is our ability to act on the Universal Mind and bring it into manifestation for the benefit of ourselves or others.</p>  
 <p>239. <i>What is meant by thinking?</i></p>  
 <p>Clear, decisive, calm, deliberate, sustained thought with a definite end in view.</p>  
 <p>240. <i>What will be the result?</i></p>  
 <p>You will also be able to say, "It is not I that doeth the works, but the 'Father' that dwelleth within me, He doeth the works." You will come to know that the "Father" is the Universal Mind and that He does really and truly dwell within you, in other words, you will come to know that the wonderful promises made in the Bible are fact, not fiction, and can be demonstrated by anyone having sufficient understanding.</p>
