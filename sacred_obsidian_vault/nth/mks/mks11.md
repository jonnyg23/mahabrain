 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">THIS Part tells of the creative principle of the Universe, what it is, how it takes form and how it is brought into manifestation. This principle being the underlying principle of all existence must necessarily be governed by an immutable law. It tells how the character, health and circumstances of the individual are formed, and suggests methods whereby desirable conditions and circumstances may be created. It tells how and why and when the material from which your future is to emerge is secured. It suggests methods and exercises by which you may secure complete control of the power which governs in this mighty field of action. Mighty because it is the most important work which any individual can undertake. We are making our future now, to-day, when it comes we shall have to accept what is given, it will be too late to change it, but we can dominate it, control it, make it what we want it to be, and this Part explains how.</div>  
 <p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">INTRODUCTION. PART EIGHT</h4>  
 <p>In this Part you will find that you may freely choose what you think, but the result of your thought is governed by an immutable law! Is not this a wonderful thought? Is it not wonderful to know that our lives are not subject to caprice or variability of any kind? That they are governed by law. This stability is our opportunity, because by complying with the law we can secure the desired effect with invariable precision.</p>  
 <p>It is the Law which makes the Universe one grand pan of Harmony. If it were not for law, the Universe would be a Chaos instead of a Cosmos.</p>  
 <p>Here, then, is the secret of the origin of both good and evil: this is all the good and evil there ever was or ever will be.</p>  
 <p>Let me illustrate. Thought results in action. If your thought is constructive and harmonious, the result will be good: if your thought is destructive or inharmonious, the result will be evil.</p>  
 <p>There is therefore but one law, one principle, one cause, one Source of Power, and good and evil are simply words which have been coined to indicate the result of our action, or our compliance or non-compliance with this law.</p>  
 <p>The importance of this is well illustrated in the lives of Emerson and Carlyle. Emerson loved the good and his life was a symphony of peace and harmony; Carlyle hated the bad, and his life was a record of perpetual discord and inharmony.</p>  
 <p>Here we have two grand men, each intent upon achieving the same ideal, but one makes use of constructive thought and is therefore in harmony with Natural Law, the other makes use of destructive thought and therefore brings upon himself discord of every kind and character.</p>  
 <p>It is evident therefore that we are to hate nothing, not even the "bad," because hatred is destructive, and we shall soon find that by entertaining destructive thought we are sowing the "wind" and shall reap the "whirlwind."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">PART EIGHT</h4>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:1">VIII, 1</a></font></span>1. Thought contains a vital principle, because it is the creative principle of the Universe and by its nature will combine with other similar thoughts.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:2">VIII, 2</a></font></span>2. As the one purpose of life is growth, all principle underlying existence must contribute to give it effect. Thought, therefore, takes form and the law of growth eventually brings it into manifestation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:3">VIII, 3</a></font></span>3. You may freely choose what you think, but the result of your thought is governed by an immutable law. Any line of thought persisted in cannot fail to produce its result in the character, health and circumstances of the individual. Methods whereby we can substitute habits of constructive thinking for those which we have found produce only undesirable effects are therefore of primary importance.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:4">VIII, 4</a></font></span>4. We all know that this is by no means easy. Mental habits are difficult to control, but it can be done and the way to do it is to begin at once to substitute constructive thought for destructive thought. Form the habit of analysing every thought. If it is necessary, if its manifestation in the objective will be a benefit, not only to yourself, but to all whom it may affect in any way, keep it; treasure it; it is of value; it is in tune with the Infinite; it will grow and develop and produce fruit an hundredfold. On the other hand, it will be well for you to keep this quotation from George</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Matthews Adams in mind, "Learn to keep the door shut, keep out of your mind, out of your office, and out of your world, every element that seeks admittance with no definite helpful end in view."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:5">VIII, 5</a></font></span>5. If your thought has been critical or destructive, and has resulted in any condition of discord or inharmony in your environment, it may be necessary for you to cultivate a mental attitude which will be conducive to constructive thought.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:6">VIII, 6</a></font></span>6. The imagination will be found to be a great assistance in this direction; the cultivation of the imagination leads to the development of the ideal out of which your future will emerge.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:7">VIII, 7</a></font></span>7. The imagination gathers up the material by which the Mind weaves the fabric in which your future is to be clothed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:8">VIII, 8</a></font></span>8. Imagination is the light by which we can penetrate new worlds of thought and experience.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:9">VIII, 9</a></font></span>9. Imagination is the mighty instrument by which every discoverer, every inventor, opened the way from precedent to experience. Precedent said, "It cannot be done"; experience said, "It is done."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:10">VIII, 10</a></font></span>10. Imagination is a plastic power, moulding the things of sense into new forms and ideals.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:11">VIII, 11</a></font></span>11. Imagination is the constructive form</p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>of thought which must precede every constructive form of action.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:12">VIII, 12</a></font></span>12. A builder cannot build a structure of any kind until he has first received the plans from the architect, and the architect must get them from his imagination.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:13">VIII, 13</a></font></span>13. The Captain of Industry cannot build a giant corporation which may co-ordinate hundreds of smaller firms and thousands of employees, and utilize millions of capital until he has first created the entire work in his imagination. Objects in the material world are as clay in the potter's hand; it is in the Master Mind that the real things are created, and it is by the use of the imagination that the work is done. In order to cultivate the imagination it must be exercised. Exercise is necessary to cultivate mental muscle as well as physical muscle. It must be supplied with nourishment or it cannot grow.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:14">VIII, 14</a></font></span>14. Do not confuse Imagination with Fancy, or that form of day dreaming in which some people like to indulge. Day dreaming is a form of mental dissipation which may lead to mental disaster.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:15">VIII, 15</a></font></span>15. Constructive imagination means mental labour, by some considered to be the hardest kind of labour, but, if so, it yields the greatest returns, for all the great things in life have come to men and women who had the capacity to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>think, to imagine, and to make their dreams come true.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:16">VIII, 16</a></font></span>16. When you have become thoroughly conscious of the fact that Mind is the only creative principle, that it is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, and that you can consciously come into harmony with this Omnipotence through your power of thought, you will have taken a long step in the right direction.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:17">VIII, 17</a></font></span>17. The next step is to place yourself in position to receive this power. As it is Omnipresent, it must be within you. We know that this is so because we know that all power is from within, but it must be developed, unfolded, cultivated; in order to do this we must be receptive, and this receptivity is acquired just as physical strength is gained, by exercise.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:18">VIII, 18</a></font></span>18. The law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the conditions, environment, and experiences in life, corresponding with your habitual, characteristic, predominant mental attitude. Not what you think once in a while when you are in church, or have just read a good book, but your predominant mental attitude is what counts.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:19">VIII, 19</a></font></span>19. You cannot entertain weak, harmful, negative thoughts ten hours a day and expect to bring about beautiful, strong and harmonious conditions by ten minutes of strong, positive, creative thought.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:20">VIII, 20</a></font></span>20. Real power comes from within. All </p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>power that anybody can possibly use is within man, only waiting to be brought into visibility by his first recognizing it, and then affirming it as his, working it into his consciousness until he becomes one with it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:21">VIII, 21</a></font></span>21. People say that they desire abundant life, and so they do, but so many interpret this to mean that if they will exercise their muscles or breathe scientifically, eat certain foods in certain ways, drink so many glasses of water every day, of just a certain temperature, keep out of draughts, they will attain the abundant life they seek. The result of such methods is but indifferent. However, when man awakens to the truth, and affirms his oneness with all Life, he finds that he takes on the clear eye, the elastic step, the vigour of youth; he finds that he has discovered the source of all power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:22">VIII, 22</a></font></span>22. All mistakes are but the mistakes of ignorance. Knowledge gaining and consequent power is what determines growth and evolution. The recognition and demonstration of knowledge is what constitutes power, and this power is spiritual power, and this spiritual power is the power which lies at the heart of all things; it is the soul of the universe.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:23">VIII, 23</a></font></span>23. This knowledge is the result of man's ability to think; thought is therefore the germ of man's conscious evolution. When man ceases to advance in his thoughts and ideals, his forces immediately begin to disintegrate</p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>and his countenance gradually registers these changing conditions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:24">VIII, 24</a></font></span>24. Successful men make it their business to hold ideals of the conditions which they wish to realize. They constantly hold in mind the next step necessary to the ideal for which they are striving. Thoughts are the materials with which they build, and the imagination is their mental work-shop. Mind is the ever moving force with which they secure the persons and circumstances necessary to build their success structure, and imagination is the matrix in which all great things are fashioned.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:25">VIII, 25</a></font></span>25. If you have been faithful to your ideal, you will hear the call when circumstances are ready to materialize your plans and results will correspond in the exact ratio of your fidelity to your ideal. The ideal steadily held is what pre-determines and attracts the necessary conditions for its fulfilment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:26">VIII, 26</a></font></span>26. It is thus that you may weave a garment of spirit and power into the web of your entire existence; it is thus that you may lead a charmed life and be for ever protected from all harm; it is thus that you may become a positive force whereby conditions of opulence and harmony may be attracted to you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:27">VIII, 27</a></font></span>27. This is the leaven which is gradually permeating the general consciousness and is largely responsible for the conditions of unrest which are everywhere evident.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:28">VIII, 28</a></font></span>28. In your last exercise you created a mental image, you brought it from the invisible into the visible; now I want you to take an object and follow it back to its origination, see of what it really consists. If you do this you will develop imagination, insight, perception, and sagacity. These come not by the superficial observation of the multitude, but by a keen analytical observation which sees below the surface.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:29">VIII, 29</a></font></span>29. It is the few who know that the things which they see are only effects, and understand the causes by which these effects were brought into existence.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:30">VIII, 30</a></font></span>30. Take the same position as heretofore and visualize a Battleship; see the grim monster floating on the surface of the water; there appears to be no life anywhere about; all is silence; you know that by far the largest part of the vessel is under water; out of sight; you know that the ship is as large and as heavy as a twenty-story skyscraper or the National Gallery; you know that there are hundreds of men ready to spring to their appointed task instantly; you know that every department is in charge of able, trained, skilled officers who have proven themselves competent to take charge of this marvellous piece of mechanism; you know that although it lies apparently oblivious to everything else, it has eyes which see everything for miles around, and nothing is permitted to escape its watchful vision;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>you know that while it appears quiet, submissive and innocent, it is prepared to hurl a steel projectile weighing thousands of pounds at an enemy many miles away; this and much more you can bring to mind with comparatively no effort whatever. But how did the battleship come to be where it is; how did it come into existence in the first place? All of this you want to know if you are a careful observer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:31">VIII, 31</a></font></span>31. Follow the great steel plates through the foundries, see the thousands of men employed in their production; go still further back, and see the ore as it comes from the mine, see it loaded on barges or trucks, see it melted and properly treated; go back still further and see the architect and engineers who planned the vessel; let the thought carry you back still further in order to determine why they planned the vessel; you will see that you are now so far back that the vessel is something intangible, it no longer exists, it is now only a thought existing in the brain of the architect; but from where did the order come to plan the vessel? Probably from the Secretary of War or the First Lord of the Admiralty; probably this vessel was planned long before war was thought of, and Parliament or Congress had to pass a bill appropriating the money; possibly there was opposition, and speeches for or against the bill. Whom do these Members of Parliament or these Congressmen represent? They represent you and me,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>so that our line of thought begins with the Battleship and ends with ourselves, and we find in the last analysis that our own thought is responsible for this and many other things, of which we seldom think, and a little further reflection will develop the most important fact of all, and that is, if someone had not discovered the law by which this tremendous mass of steel and iron could be made to float upon the water, instead of immediately going to the bottom, the battleship could not have come into existence at all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:32">VIII, 32</a></font></span>32. This law is that, "the specific gravity of any substance is the weight of any volume of it, compared with an equal volume of water." The discovery of this law revolutionized every kind of ocean travel, commerce and warfare, and made the existence of the battleship possible.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VIII:33">VIII, 33</a></font></span>33. You will find exercises of this kind invaluable. When the thought has been trained to look below the surface everything takes on a different appearance, the insignificant becomes significant, the uninteresting interesting; the things which we supposed to be of no importance are seen to be the only really vital things in existence.</p>
