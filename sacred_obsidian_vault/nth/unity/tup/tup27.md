 <p>BIBLE WRITERS use the word "light" to represent intelligence. When Jesus said, "I am the light of the world," He undoubtedly meant that He was the expresser of Truth in all of its aspects. In the 1st chapter of John light and Truth are synonymous. </p> 
 <p>"There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world." This does not mean that He was the light of all those who come into the physical world, but of those who are born of Spirit into the world of reality. Those who live in physical consciousness regard the light as a radiation of the sun through which people discern the outline of things. But within this light that chases away the darkness is a principle hidden from the sense man. "And the light shineth in the </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a></p> 
 <p>darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not." Materiality is unillumined and has no power in itself to overcome its ignorance. So all attempts of intellect to lift man and the human family to higher states of consciousness will prove futile. There must be an influx of spiritual energy and inspiration from the "Father of lights." </p> 
 <p>Yet it is interesting to note how the discoveries of modern science are demonstrating phases of truth without bringing forth a single principle that will raise man spiritually. For example, light has been probed to its physical source and properties have been revealed of a world that was nonexistent to the physical man. Yet with all the marvelous knowledge acquired about light no quality has been revealed that man can apply to his moral or health-restoring needs. The argument that light is a property of electricity that is being successfully applied to heal human ills is not borne out by facts. </p> 
 <p>Yet the Scriptures treat light and intelligence as one. In the very first chapter of the Bible we are told that Mind became manifest as light. "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" But the mind that judges according to appearance never discerns the inner truth about light or anything else. </p> 
 <p>We must know the Truth about the omnipresence of the one intelligence in the light; then we shall be made free from our intellectual darkness. Science agrees with James that "every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p> 
 <p>Father of lights." Science says light is a very orderly and exceedingly productive wave motion in the ether, but science does not tell us that light is God intelligence in action and that we can link our mind with the light and reap the benefit of its marvelous potentialities. </p> 
 <p>Some Christian metaphysicians are shy about using the scientists' approach to their problems, fearing that they themselves will fall into a materialistic trend of thought. However when we see scientists telling in physical terms of the properties of God-Mind, needing only to add the assumption of an intelligent moving power, we have found the cooperation of a very earnest and convincing lot of truth seekers. </p> 
 <p>So do not be afraid of the true physical scientist, but give his discoveries the light of mind. Then you will find that the substance and life will become more obedient to your word of command. </p> 
 <p>Remember that Moses received his great command from Jehovah when he turned aside to see why the bush that burned was not consumed. Jehovah spoke to him "out of the midst of the bush"; that is, God was in the fire that lighted an ordinary bush. Open your mind to the light of Spirit wherever you are. See with the eye of the mind that God is omnipresent Spirit, "over all, and through all, and in all." </p>
