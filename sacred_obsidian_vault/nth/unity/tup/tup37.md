 <p>HOW PRAYER HEALING IS DONE </p> 
 <p>FROM A STUDY of the foregoing lessons, you should be convinced that man and the universe are under the creative direction of a supreme being, name it what you will, and that man needs but to conform to the laws of creative Mind in order to be healthy, happy, and wise. It logically occurs to you that all healing methods, whether applied to self or to others, consists in establishing the unity of the individual and the universal consciousness. No man heals himself or another; the supreme Mind does the work. "The Father abiding in me does his works," said Jesus. This is the testimony of all the truly wise. </p> 
 <p>The first move in all healing is a recognition on the part of the healer and on the part of the patient that God is present as an all-powerful mind, equal to the healing of every disease, no matter how bad it may appear. "With God all things are possible." The best way to establish unity with the Father-Mind is by prayer. "God is Spirit," and He has a kingdom or ruling center in every soul. Do not look up or out for God, but "pray to thy Father who is in secret [silently within your own soul], and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee." </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></a></p> 
 <p>Many healers use the Lord's Prayer at the beginning of every treatment. Talk to the Father as if He were an entity present within you. He is visible to your soul, and when you have attained the particular inner confidence called faith, you will realize His presence as clearly as you realize visible things. When you have stilled the outer senses and have become quiet, you are in the mental realm where thoughts are obedient to the word. Error thoughts must be told to go, and true thoughts must be called to take their proper place. </p> 
 <p>Mental causes are so complex that it is impossible to point out in all cases the specific thought that causes a certain disease; but twelve fundamental mind activities lie at the base of all existence, and when any one of these is contacted, all the others respond. </p> 
 <p>Nearly all sick people lack vital force, hence the life treatment is good for all. Hate, anger, jealousy, malice, and the like are almost universal in human consciousness, and a treatment for love will prove a healing balm for all. </p> 
 <p>Fear of poverty burdens most people, and the prosperity treatment will be effective. Do not be afraid to use the statements in healing as a whole or in part; they will always help and never hurt anyone. Remember that the object of all treatment is to raise the mind to the Christ consciousness, through which all true healing is accomplished. </p>

 <p>SAMPLE PRAYER TREATMENTS </p> 
 <p>Fear, anxiety, worry, dread, and suspense--these thoughts cause the mind to become tense, thus shutting out the great helper, the Spirit of truth. Say silently: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>I am now free from fear, anxiety, worry, dread, and<br> suspense. I have faith in Thy Holy Spirit, and I trust Thee<br> to protect me, to provide for me, and to bring all my<br> affairs into divine order.<br> </small></div>  
 <p>NERVOUSNESS </p> 
 <p>The mind sends its messages along the nerves; the nerves, forming a network of communication with the brain, get into a chronic crosscurrented condition from the presence of repeated anxious, worried, fearful thoughts, and the many forms of nervousness result. This idea of nervousness must be specifically denied and the truth affirmed. Say silently: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>I am not subject to any kind of nervousness. My nerves are<br> harmonized, peaceful, and poised in Spirit and in Truth.<br> </small></div>  
 <p>Note: Deny the mental cause first; then the physical appearance. Nervousness is produced by worry, anxiety, and the like. These mental conditions should be healed first; then the secondary state which they have produced in the body must be denied and dissolved, and the perfect condition affirmed. </p>

 <p>COLDS, GRIPPE, AND THE INFLUENZAS </p> 
 <p>Affirm: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Spirit is not subject to heat or cold. I am Spirit. I am<br> the positive force of Being, and I put out of my<br> consciousness all negative thoughts. I do not believe in<br> the thing called a cold, nor do I admit for a moment that<br> it has any power over me. I am Spirit, free-flowing life,<br> and my circulation is equalized in God.<br> </small></div>  
 <p>STOMACH TROUBLES </p> 
 <p>Prayer: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>My understanding is established in Spirit. I know the<br> relation between mind and body, between thought and<br> substance. I agree with what I eat, and what I eat agrees<br> with me. I am at peace with all men and all things. I do<br> not resist or antagonize anybody or anything. My stomach is<br> strong, wise, and energetic, and I always think and speak<br> of it as in every way capable of doing the work given it to<br> do. I do not impose upon my stomach by overloading it. I am<br> guided by divine wisdom in eating and drinking, and I<br> follow its dictates instead of the sense appetites. I am no<br> longer anxious about what I shall eat or what I shall<br> drink. I am not hurried or worried, but after each meal I<br> rest from all the cares of life, and I give my stomach<br> opportunity to do its perfect work under the divine law.<br> </small></div>

 <p>All Liver Troubles </p> 
 <p>Prayer: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>I am not misjudged, nor do I misjudge others. I do not<br> criticize or condemn. I do not hold bitter, revengeful<br> thoughts against others. I do not think that I have been<br> unjustly treated. God-Mind is my supreme arbiter, and I<br> rest all judgment in the divine law of justice. The swift<br> energy of Spirit now penetrates and permeates every atom of<br> my liver, and it is free to do its perfect work.<br> </small></div>  
 <p>Kidney, Bladder, and Urinay Disorders </p> 
 <p>Prayer: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>God is the strength of my life. I do not believe in<br> exhaustion of strength. Strength is always present in<br> supreme completeness, and I am eternally strong. Spirit is<br> the strength of my loins, and my back is free from all<br> thought of burdens. My life is divinely ordered, and I am<br> not afraid of weakness, old age, or death. All the issues<br> of my life are from God, and He is a well of living water<br> within me.<br> Lustful passions no longer separate me from the pure,<br> spiritual life. My life is lifted up by the Christ Mind,<br> and I am resurrected from the dead. My life is hid with<br> Christ in God.<br> </small></div>

 <p>All Throat Affections </p> 
 <p>Prayer: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>All power is given to me, in heaven (mind) and in earth<br> (body). Dominion, control, and mastery are mine by divine<br> right, and I refuse to believe in failure or discouragement.<br> I am free, and the inspiration of Spirit is poured into my<br> soul. I am quickened by Spirit, and the flesh is obedient.<br> I rejoice and am glad because the joy of Christ is mine. I<br> am filled with Spirit energy, and every cell in my organism<br> is alight with God. I am the resurrection and the life.<br> </small></div>  
 <p>SIX-DAY PRAYER TREATMENTS </p> 
 <p>It is found that the mind establishes a permanent consciousness through six steps or stages, called in Genesis "days." </p> 
 <p>First, the mind perceives and affirms Truth to be a universal principle. Secondly, faith in the working power of Truth is born in consciousness. Thirdly, Truth takes definite form in mind. Fourthly, the will carries Truth into acts. Fifthly, discrimination is quickened and the difference between Truth and error is discerned. Sixthly, every thought and word is expressed in harmony with Truth. </p> 
 <p>The seventh "day" represents a peaceful confidence and rest in the fulfillment of the divine law. </p> 
 <p>By the use of these denials and affirmations for one week a new and more orderly basis of thought </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></a></p> 
 <p>is established in mind, and the whole man is harmonized and vitalized. This process often heals obstinate cases, and the six-ray course is recommended in conjunction with the special prayers. </p> 
 <p>Make your denials as if you were gently sweeping away cobwebs, and make your affirmations in a strong, bold, vehement positive attitude of mind. </p> 
 <p>Each day's treatment, and the whole course of treatments if necessary, is to be repeated over and over until it manifests its living presence and potency in consciousness. </p> 
 <p>If you desire to help a patient who will not try or who cannot himself successfully bring his mind into harmonious relations with Principle, think of this person when you hold the daily thought, and Spirit will cause your word to be manifested both in you and in him. </p> 
 <p>Invocation </p> 
 <p>To precede each day's treatment </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>I acknowledge Thy presence and power, O blessed Spirit; in<br> Thy divine wisdom now erase my mortal limitations, and from<br> Thy pure substance of love bring into manifestation my<br> world, according to Thy perfect law.<br> </small></div>
