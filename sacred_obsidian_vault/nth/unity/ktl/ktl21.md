 <p>Unity believes that we can keep Lent best by denying ourselves not "things" but negative thoughts and feelings. And, through prayer and study, we can contemplate the victorious Christ and attempt to be more like Him. </p> 
 <p>Keep a True Lent contains material especially written by Charles Fillmore to help you observe Lent in this way. </p> 
 <p>How to Study </p> 
 <p>1. Before beginning your day-by-day study, we suggest you read all the chapters preceding the Lenten lessons. </p> 
 <p>2. Set aside a definite time for prayer and study when you are least likely to be interrupted. </p> 
 <p>3. Read each day's assignment, beginning with Ash Wednesday. </p> 
 <p>4. Read the Bible reference given at the beginning of each day's lesson. </p> 
 <p>5. Answer the questions concerning what you have read. </p> 
 <p>6. Use the meditation given in the Study Guide. </p>
