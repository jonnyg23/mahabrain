 <p>WHY DOESN'T God do something about it?" This oft-repeated query, uttered by the skeptical and unbelieving, is heard day in and day out. Imitating the skeptics, Christian believers everywhere are looking to God for all kinds of reforms in every department of manifest life and also are charging Him with death and destruction the world over. </p> 
 <p>One who thinks logically and according to sound reason wonders at the contradictions set up by these various queries and desires. </p> 
 <p>Is God responsible for all that occurs on this earth, and if not all, how much of it? </p> 
 <p>The Bible states that God created the earth and all its creatures, and last of all man, to whom He gave dominion over everything. Observation and experience prove that man is gaining dominion over nature wherever he applies himself to that end. But so much remains to be gained, and he is so small physically that man counts himself a pygmy instead of the mental giant that he is. </p> 
 <p>All the real mastery that man attains in the world has its roots in his mind, and when he opens up the mental realm in his being there are no unattainables. If the conquests of the air achieved in the last quarter of a century had been prophesied the </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p> 
 <p>prophets would have been pronounced crazy. The fact is that no one thinking in the old mind realm can have any conception of the transformation of sound waves into electromagnetic waves and back again into words and messages of intelligence. Edison admitted that his discovery of the phonograph was an accident and that he never fully understood how mechanical vibrations could be recorded and be reproduced in all forms of intelligent communication. </p> 
 <p>Reasoning in terms of matter, no one can understand how words and music and pictures can be carried over long distances through space without conflict and then be reproduced by a mechanical device with perfection and accuracy. </p> 
 <p>Now that man has broken away from his limited visualizations and mentally grasped the unhampered ideas of the supermind, he is growing grandly bold and his technical pioneers are telling him that the achievements of yesterday are as nothing compared to those of tomorrow. For example, an article by Harland Manchester condensed in the Reader's Digest from Scientific American tells of the "micro-waves" that are slated for a more spectacular career in the realm of the unbelievable than anything that has preceded them. This article describes in detail some of the marvels that will evolve out of the utilization of microwaves, among which may be mentioned "private phone calls by the hundreds of thousands sent simultaneously over the same wave </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></a></p> 
 <p>band without wires, poles or cables. Towns where each citizen has his own radio frequency, over which he can get voice, music, and television, and call any phone in the country by dialing. Complete abolition of static and interference from electrical devices and from other stations. A hundred times as much 'space on the air' as we now have in the commercial radio band. A high-definition and color television network to cover the country. And, perhaps most important of all, a nation-wide radar network, geared to television, to regulate all air traffic and furnish instantaneous visual weather reports to airfields throughout the land." </p> 
 <p>Add to this the marvels promised by the appliers of atomic energy and you have an array of miracles unequaled in all the bibles of all the nations of the world. </p> 
 <p>It is admitted by those who are most familiar with the dynamic power of these newly discovered forces that we do not yet know how to protect our body cells from the destructiveness of their vibrations. Very thick concrete walls are required to protect those who experiment with atomic forces. One scientist says that the forces released from the bombs that were used on the Japanese cities in 1945 may affect those who were subjected to them and their descendants for a thousand years. Experimentation proves that we have tapped a kingdom that we do not know how to handle safely. </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a></p> 
 <p>It is quite obvious that these forces, if they could be utilized, would vastly improve our standard of living and that they were planned for us by creative Mind. If we cannot control them, why did God allow us to discover them? And now that we are turning them loose in space all about us, what are we going to do about it? Also how do we reconcile this situation with the observation of the Psalmist: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy<br> hands;<br> Thou hast put all things under his feet."<br> </small></div>  
 <p>The fact is that we have reached a point in race evolution where we are forced to give attention to the refinement of the body. Our religion has too long taught that the body is dust and ashes and that it is its destiny to die and be left to the worms. The deterioration of the body cells must be arrested and a new and more powerful life force injected into the physical organism. This is plainly part of the teaching of Jesus. He said, "I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly." He told his followers that when they went to that upper room in Jerusalem they would receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit with power. The original Greek says that they would receive dynamic energy. All baptisms with Spirit impart vitalizing life to the recipient, and the joy of quickened vitality should be felt and retained as part of the physical regeneration. </p> 
 <p>The divine unction imparted by spiritual baptism </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></a></p> 
 <p>also contains all the healing forces of X rays, ultraviolet rays, sunshine, and in fact all the radiant restorative forces now so widely used as healing agents. But the energy imparted by Spirit is so tempered that it never injures but always heals. That this is not true of the shocks given by mechanical generators is evidenced by the scars they often leave. A prayer treatment by an experienced spiritual healer is a baptism, with power proportioned to the spiritual understanding of the healer. The lowest method of imparting spiritual baptism is by the laying on of hands and prayer. The highest is realizing the Holy Spirit presence and its expression through the power of the word. Jesus began His ministry by doing the former, but at the end He sent His word and healed by means of it. </p> 
 <p>God created the fundamental ideas culminating in the idea of ideal man. This ideal man has power to mold God's creation into any manifestation he may choose. If he consults the Father and projects his thoughts in accordance with the law, perfect manifestation follows. As Jesus said, "My Father worketh even until now, and I work." </p> 
 <p>One who understands this relation of man to his creator can assert with confidence that this is man's world and always will be. By right thinking man can have the co-operation of God in producing manifestations and thereby can set up the kingdom of God in the earth; or he can ignore God and attempt </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a></p> 
 <p>to form a world and govern it without divine aid. We are now living in a civilization dominated by human thought, and confusion is the result. </p> 
 <p>How many ages and aeons have passed since man lost contact with God no one can tell. We have about six thousand years of history and no heavenly conditions are recorded. Caves and sand drifts reveal the remains of man in combat with the gorilla for half a million years, with man himself sunk almost to the level of the monkey. When man dropped out of the ethers and became one of the primates mortal understanding has not yet discerned, but the distortions in the earth and all nature bear evidence of a terrible shock. </p> 
 <p>We know that our home is not altogether on the earth but also in the air, over which we must gain dominion before we can have a fit dwelling place. We are now gaining this dominion by mechanical means. This will be followed by the development of a human organism that, unified with Spirit, will transport us everywhere in air and on earth. </p> 
 <p>The great and most important issue before the people today is the development of man's spiritual mind and through it unity with God. There seem to be things in more immediate need of being done to alleviate present conditions, but the taproot of all this confusion is our failure to use our minds intelligently. We can only think as God would have us think by adjusting our thoughts to divine ideas. Religion </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></a></p> 
 <p>and all that it implies in prayer and recognition of God in idea and manifestation is the one and only way out of the chaos in which we find ourselves. We must therefore begin at once to develop this unity with the Father mind by incorporating divine ideas into all that we think and speak. </p>
