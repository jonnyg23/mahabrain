 <p>You have learned that everything man creates or acquires, begins in the form of DESIRE, that desire is taken on the first lap of its journey, from the abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the IMAGINATION, where PLANS for its transition are created and organized.</p>  
 <p>In Chapter two, you were instructed to take six definite, practical steps, as your first move in translating the desire for money into its monetary equivalent. One of these steps is the formation of a DEFINITE, practical plan, or plans, through which this transformation may be made.</p>  
 <p>You will now be instructed how to build plans which will be practical, viz:</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>Keep in mind these facts:--</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>First.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>You are engaged   in an undertaking of major importance to you. To be sure of success, you must   have plans which are faultless.</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>Second.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>You must have   the advantage of the experience, education, native ability and imagination of   other minds. This is in harmony with the methods followed by every person who   has accumulated a great fortune.</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  
 <p>No individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and knowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the cooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to accumulate wealth, should be the joint</p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>creation of yourself and every other member of your "Master Mind" group. You may originate your own plans, either in whole or in part, but SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE CHECKED, AND APPROVED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR "MASTER MIND" ALLIANCE.</p>  
 <p>If the first plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it with a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still another, and so on, until you find a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the point at which the majority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of PERSISTENCE in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.</p>  
 <p>The most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money--nor in any other undertaking--without plans which are practical and workable. Just keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary defeat is not permanent failure. It may only mean that your plans have not been sound. Build other plans. Start all over again.</p>  
 <p>Thomas A. Edison "failed" ten thousand times before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb. That is--he met with <i>temporary defeat</i> ten thousand times, before his efforts were crowned with success.</p>  
 <p>Temporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that there is something wrong with your plan. Millions of men go through life in misery and poverty, because they lack a sound plan through which to accumulate a fortune.</p>  
 <p>Henry Ford accumulated a fortune, not because</p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>of his superior mind, but because he adopted and followed a PLAN which proved to be sound. A thousand men could be pointed out, each with a better education than Ford's, yet each of whom lives in poverty, because he does not possess the RIGHT plan for the accumulation of money.</p>  
 <p>Your achievement can be no greater than your PLANS are sound. That may seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true. Samuel Insull lost his fortune of over one hundred million dollars. The Insull fortune was built on plans which were sound. The business depression forced Mr. Insull to CHANGE HIS PLANS; and the CHANGE brought "temporary defeat," because his new plans were NOT SOUND. Mr. Insull is now an old man, he may, consequently, accept "failure" instead of "temporary defeat," but if his experience turns out to be FAILURE, it will be for the reason that he lacks the fire of PERSISTENCE to rebuild his plans.</p>  
 <p>No man is ever whipped, until he QUITS--<i>in his own mind</i>.</p>  
 <p>This fact will be repeated many times, because it is so easy to "take the count" at the first sign of defeat.</p>  
 <p>James J. Hill met with temporary defeat when he first endeavored to raise the necessary capital to build a railroad from the East to the West, but he, too turned defeat into victory <i>through new plans</i>.</p>  
 <p>Henry Ford met with temporary defeat, not only at the beginning of his automobile career, but after he had gone far toward the top. He created new plans, and went marching on to financial victory.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>We see men who have accumulated great fortunes, but we often recognize only their triumph, overlooking the temporary defeats which they had to surmount before "arriving."</p>  
 <p>NO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING "TEMPORARY DEFEAT." When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give up before your goal has been reached, you are a "quitter." A QUITTER NEVER WINS--AND--A WINNER NEVER QUITS. Lift this sentence out, write it on a piece of paper in letters an inch high, and place it where you will see it every night before you go to sleep, and every morning before you go to work.</p>  
 <p>When you begin to select members for your "Master Mind" group, endeavor to select those who do not take defeat seriously.</p>  
 <p>Some people foolishly believe that only MONEY can make money. This is not true! DESIRE, transmuted into its monetary equivalent, through the principles laid down here, is the agency through which money is "made." Money, of itself, is nothing but inert matter. It cannot move, think, or talk, but it can "hear" when a man who DESIRES it, calls it to come!</p>  
 <p align="center">PLANNING THE SALE OF SERVICES</p>  
 <p>The remainder of this chapter has been given over to a description of ways and means of marketing</p>  
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>personal services. The information here conveyed will be of practical help to any person having any form of personal services to market, but it will be of priceless benefit to those who aspire to leadership in their chosen occupations.</p>  
 <p>Intelligent planning is essential for success in any undertaking designed to accumulate riches. Here will be found detailed instructions to those who must begin the accumulation of riches by selling personal services.</p>  
 <p>It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of IDEAS. What else, except ideas and personal services, would one not possessed of property have to give in return for riches?</p>  
 <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of people in the world. One type is known as LEADERS, and the other as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset whether you intend to become a leader in your chosen calling, or remain a follower. The difference in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably expect the compensation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers make the mistake of expecting such pay.</p>  
 <p>It is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to remain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They became great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few exceptions, the man who cannot follow a leader intelligently, cannot become an efficient leader. The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></a></p>  
 <p>usually the man who develops into leadership most rapidly. An intelligent follower has many advantages, among them the OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE FROM HIS LEADER.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP</p>  
 <p>The following are important factors of leadership:--</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p align="right">1.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>UNWAVERING   COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's occupation. No follower   wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-confidence and courage. No   intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long.</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p align="right">2.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p align="right">3.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p align="right">4.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p align="right">5.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>DEFINITENESS OF   PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work, and <i>work his plan</i>.

 <p align="right">7.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p align="right">8.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME   FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful leader must be willing to assume   responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he   tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of   his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must   consider that it is <i>he</i> who failed.</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>There are two forms of Leadership. The first, and by far the most effective, is LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The second is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the followers.</p>  
 <p>History is filled with evidences that Leadership by Force cannot endure. The downfall and disappearance of "Dictators" and kings is significant. It means that people will not follow forced leadership indefinitely.</p>  
 <p>The world has just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and followers, which very clearly calls for new leaders, and a new brand of leadership in business and industry. Those who belong to the old school of leadership-by-force, must acquire an understanding of the new brand of leadership (cooperation) or be relegated to the rank and file of the followers. There is no other way out for them.</p>  
 <p>The relationship of employer and employee, or of leader and follower, in the future, will be one of mutual cooperation, based upon an equitable division of the profits of business. In the future, the relationship of employer and employee will be more like a partnership than it has been in the past.</p>  
 <p>Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Czar of Russia, and the King of Spain were examples of leadership by force. Their leadership passed. Without much difficulty, one might point to the prototypes of these ex-leaders, among the business, financial, and labor leaders of America who have been dethroned or slated to go. <i>Leadership-by-consent</i> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the followers is the only brand which can endure!</p>  
 <p>Men may follow the forced leadership temporarily, but they will not do so willingly.</p>  
 <p>The new brand of LEADERSHIP will embrace the eleven factors of leadership, described in this chapter, as well as some other factors. The man who makes these the basis of his leadership, will find abundant opportunity to lead in any walk of life. The depression was prolonged, largely, because the world lacked LEADERSHIP of the new brand. At the end of the depression, the demand for leaders who are competent to apply the new methods of leadership has greatly exceeded the supply. Some of the old type of leaders will reform and adapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the world will have to look for new timber for its leadership.</p>

 <p align="center">THE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP</p>

 <p>1.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>UNWILLINGNESS   TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE. Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion   demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to   perform. "The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all" is a   truth which all able leaders observe and respect.</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>3.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>EXPECTATION OF PAY   FOR WHAT THEY "KNOW" INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY <i>DO</i> WITH THAT WHICH THEY KNOW. The world does not pay men for that   which they "know." It pays them for what they DO, or induce others   to do.</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>FEAR OF   COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS. The leader who fears that one of his followers   may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or   later.

Only in this way may a leader multiply   himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many   things at one time.

 <p>DISLOYALTY.   Perhaps this should have come at the head of the list. The leader who is not   loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below   him, cannot long maintain his leadership.

 <p align="center">SOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH "NEW LEADERSHIP" WILL BE REQUIRED</p>

 <p>Industry calls   for new leaders. The old type of leaders thought and moved in terms of   dividends instead of thinking and moving in terms of human equations!

 <p>Do not be afraid of making your brief too long. Employers are just as much interested in purchasing the services of well-qualified applicants as you are in securing employment.

 <p>Successful salesmen groom themselves with care. They understand that first impressions are lasting. Your brief is your salesman. Give it a good suit of clothes, so it will stand out in bold contrast to anything your prospective employer ever saw, in the way of an application for a position. If the position you seek is worth having, it is worth going after with care. Moreover, if you sell yourself to an employer in a manner that impresses him with your individuality, you probably will receive more money for your services from the very start, than you would if you applied for employment in the usual conventional way.</p>  
 <p>If you seek employment through an advertising agency, or an employment agency, have the agent use copies of your brief in marketing your services. This will help to gain preference for you, both with the agent, and the prospective employers.</p>

 <p align="center">THE NEW WAY OF MARKETING SERVICES</p>  
 <p align="center">"JOBS" ARE NOW "PARTNERSHIPS"</p>  
 <p>Men and women who market their services to best advantage in the future, must recognize the stupendous change which has taken place in connection with the relationship between employer and employee.</p>  
 <p>In the future, the "Golden Rule," and not the "Rule of Gold" will be the dominating factor in the marketing of merchandise as well as personal services. The future relationship between employers and their employees will be more in the nature of a partnership consisting of:</p>  <div align="center">  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>a.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>c.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>The public they   serve</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  </div>  
 <p>This new way of marketing personal services is called new for many reasons, first, both the employer and the employee of the future will be considered as fellow-employees whose business it will be to SERVE THE PUBLIC EFFICIENTLY. In</p>  
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></a></p>  
 <p>times past, employers, and employees have bartered among themselves, driving the best bargains they could with one another, not considering that in the final analysis they were, in reality, BARGAINING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE THIRD PARTY, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVED.</p>  
 <p>The depression served as a mighty protest from an injured public, whose rights had been trampled upon in every direction by those who were clamoring for individual advantages and profits. When the debris of the depression shall have been cleared away, and business shall have been once again restored to balance, both employers and employees will recognize that they are NO LONGER PRIVILEGED TO DRIVE BARGAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHOM THEY SERVE. The real employer of the future will be the public. This should be kept uppermost in mind by every person seeking to market personal services effectively.</p>  
 <p>Nearly every railroad in America is in financial difficulty. Who does not remember the day when, if a citizen enquired at the ticket office, the time of departure of a train, he was abruptly referred to the bulletin board instead of being politely given the information?</p>  
 <p>The street car companies have experienced a "change of times" also. There was a time not so very long ago when street car conductors took pride in giving argument to passengers. Many of the street car tracks have been removed and passengers ride on a bus, whose driver is "the last word in politeness."</p>  
 <p>All over the country street car tracks are rusting</p>  
 <p><a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></a></p>  
 <p>from abandonment, or have been taken up. Whereever street cars are still in operation, passengers may now ride without argument, and one may even hail the car in the middle of the block, and the motorman will OBLIGINGLY pick him up.</p>  
 <p>HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED! That is just the point I am trying to emphasize. TIMES HAVE CHANGED! Moreover, the change is reflected not merely in railroad offices and on street cars, but in other walks of life as well. The "public-be-damned" policy is now passé. It has been supplanted by the "we-are-obligingly-at-your-service, sir," policy.</p>  
 <p>The bankers have learned a thing or two during this rapid change which has taken place during the past few years. Impoliteness on the part of a bank official, or bank employee today is as rare as it was conspicuous a dozen years ago. In the years past, some bankers (not all of them, of course), carried an atmosphere of austerity which gave every would-be borrower a chill when he even thought of approaching his banker for a loan.</p>  
 <p>The thousands of bank failures during the depression had the effect of removing the mahogany doors behind which bankers formerly barricaded themselves. They now sit at desks in the open, where they may be seen and approached at will by any depositor, or by anyone who wishes to see them, and the whole atmosphere of the bank is one of courtesy and understanding.</p>  
 <p>It used to be customary for customers to have to stand and wait at the corner grocery until the clerks were through passing the time of day with friends,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172</font></a></p>  
 <p>and the proprietor had finished making up his bank deposit, before being waited upon. Chain stores, managed by COURTEOUS MEN who do everything in the way of service, short of shining the customer's shoes, have PUSHED THE OLD-TIME MERCHANTS INTO THE BACKGROUND. TIME MARCHES ON!</p>  
 <p>"Courtesy" and "Service" are the watch-words of merchandising today, and apply to the person who is marketing personal services even more directly than to the employer whom he serves, because, in the final analysis, both the employer and his employee are EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE. If they fail to serve well, they pay by the loss of their privilege of serving.</p>  
 <p>We can all remember the time when the gas-meter reader pounded on the door hard enough to break the panels. When the door was opened, he pushed his way in, uninvited, with a scowl on his face which plainly said, "what-the-hell-did-you-keep-me-waiting-for?" All that has undergone a change. The meter-man now conducts himself as a gentleman who is "delighted-to-be-at-your-service-sir." Before the gas companies learned that their scowling meter-men were accumulating liabilities never to be cleared away, the polite salesmen of oil burners came along and did a land office business.</p>  
 <p>During the depression, I spent several months in the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania, studying conditions which all but destroyed the coal industry. Among several very significant discoveries, was the fact that greed on the part of operators and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></a></p>  
 <p>their employees was the chief cause of the loss of business for the operators, and loss of jobs for the miners.</p>  
 <p>Through the pressure of a group of overzealous labor leaders, representing the employees, and the greed for profits on the part of the operators, the anthracite business suddenly dwindled. The coal operators and their employees drove sharp bargains with one another, adding the cost of the "bargaining" to the price of the coal, until, finally, they discovered they had BUILT UP A WONDERFUL BUSINESS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS OF OIL BURNING OUTFITS AND THE PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL.</p>  
 <p>"The wages of sin is death!" Many have read this in the Bible, but few have discovered its meaning. Now, and for several years, the entire world has been listening BY FORCE, to a sermon which might well be called "WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP."</p>  
 <p>Nothing as widespread and effective as the depression could possibly be "just a coincidence." Behind the depression was a CAUSE. Nothing ever happens without a CAUSE. In the main, the cause of the depression is traceable directly to the worldwide habit of trying to REAP without SOWING.</p>  
 <p>This should not be mistaken to mean that the depression represents a crop which the world is being FORCED to reap without having SOWN. The trouble is that the world <i>sowed the wrong sort of seed</i>. Any farmer knows he cannot sow the seed of thistles, and reap a harvest of grain. Beginning at the outbreak of the world war, the people of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>world began to sow the seed of service inadequate in both quality and quantity. Nearly everyone was engaged in the pastime of trying to GET WITHOUT GIVING.</p>  
 <p>These illustrations are brought to the attention of those who have personal services to market, to show that we are where we are, and what we are, because of <i>our own conduct!</i> If there is a principle of cause and effect, which controls business, finance, and transportation, this same principle controls individuals and determines their economic status.</p>  
 <p align="center">WHAT IS YOUR "QQS" RATING?</p>  
 <p>The causes of success in marketing services EFFECTIVELY and permanently, have been clearly described. Unless those causes are studied, analyzed, understood and APPLIED, no man can market his services effectively and permanently. Every person must be his own salesman of personal services. The QUALITY and the QUANTITY of service rendered, and the SPIRIT in which it is rendered, determine to a large extent, the price, and the duration of employment. To market Personal services effectively, (which means a permanent market, at a satisfactory price, under pleasant conditions), one must adopt and follow the "QQS" formula which means that QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus the proper SPIRIT of cooperation, equals perfect salesmanship of service. Remember the "QQS" formula, but do more--APPLY IT AS A HABIT!</p>  
 <p>Let us analyze the formula to make sure we understand exactly what it means.</p>

 <p><i>QUANTITY</i> of service shall be   understood to mean the HABIT of rendering all the service of which you are   capable, at all times, with the purpose of increasing the amount of service   rendered as greater skill is developed through practice and experience. Emphasis   is again placed on the word HABIT.</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>3.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p><i>SPIRIT</i> of service shall be construed   to mean the HABIT of agreeable, harmonious conduct which will induce   cooperation from associates and fellow employees.</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  
 <p>Adequacy of QUALITY and QUANTITY of service is not sufficient to maintain a permanent market for your services. The conduct, or the SPIRIT in which you deliver service, is a strong determining factor in connection with both the price you receive, and the duration of employment.</p>  
 <p>Andrew Carnegie stressed this point more than others in connection with his description of the factors which lead to success in the marketing of personal services. He emphasized again, and again, the necessity for HARMONIOUS CONDUCT. He stressed the fact that he would not retain any man, no matter how great a QUANTITY, or how efficient the QUALITY of his work, unless he worked in a spirit of HARMONY. Mr. Carnegie insisted upon men being AGREEABLE.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> To prove that he placed a high value upon this quality, he permitted many men <i>who conformed to his standards</i> to become very wealthy. Those who did not conform, had to make room for others.</p>  
 <p>The importance of a pleasing personality has been stressed, because it is a factor which enables one to render service in the proper SPIRIT. If one has a personality which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these assets often make up for deficiencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY of service one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY SUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE CAPITAL VALUE OF YOUR SERVICES</p>  
 <p>The person whose income is derived entirely from the sale of personal services is no less a merchant than the man who sells commodities, and it might well be added, such a person is subject to EXACTLY THE SAME RULES of conduct as the merchant who sells merchandise.</p>  
 <p>This has been emphasized, because the majority of people who live by the sale of personal services make the mistake of considering themselves free from the rules of conduct, and the responsibilities attached to those who are engaged in marketing commodities.</p>  
 <p>The new way of marketing services has practically forced both employer and, employee into partnership alliances, through which both take into consideration the rights of the third party, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE.</p>  
 <p>The day of the "go-getter" has passed. He has</p>  
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></a></p>  
 <p>been supplanted by the "go-giver." High-pressure methods in business finally blew the lid off. There will never be the need to put the lid back on, because, in the future, business will be conducted by methods that will require no pressure.</p>  
 <p>The actual capital value of your brains may be determined by the amount of income you can produce (by marketing your services). A fair estimate of the capital value of your services may be made by multiplying your annual income by sixteen and two-thirds, as it is reasonable to estimate that your annual income represents six percent of your capital value. Money rents for 6% per annum. Money is worth no more than brains. It is often worth much less.</p>  
 <p>Competent "brains," if effectively marketed, represent a much more desirable form of capital than that which is required to conduct a business dealing in commodities, because "brains" are a form of capital which cannot be permanently depreciated through depressions, nor can this form of capital be stolen or spent. Moreover, the money which is essential for the conduct of business is as worthless as a sand dune, until it has been mixed with efficient "brains."</p>  
 <p align="center">THE THIRTY MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE</p>

 <p>Life's greatest tragedy consists of men and women who earnestly try, and fail! The tragedy lies in the overwhelmingly large majority of people who fail, as compared to the few who succeed.</p>

There is something radically wrong with a civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go through life as failures. But I did not write this book for the purpose of moralizing on the rights and wrongs of the world; that would require a book a hundred times the size of this one.</p>  
 <p>My analysis work proved that there are thirty major reasons for failure, and thirteen major principles through which people accumulate fortunes.

 <p>The oldest of admonitions is "Man, know thyself!" If you market merchandise successfully, you must know the merchandise. The same is true in marketing personal services. You should know all of your weaknesses in order that you may either bridge them or eliminate them entirely. You should know your strength in order that you may call attention to it when selling your services. You can know yourself only through <i>accurate</i> analysis.</p>

 <p>The folly of ignorance in connection with self was displayed by a young man who applied to the manager of a well known business for a position. He made a very good impression until the manager asked him what salary he expected. He replied that he had no fixed sum in mind (<i>lack of a definite aim</i>). The manager then said, "We will pay you all you are worth, after we try you out for a week."</p>  
 <p>"I will not accept it," the applicant replied, "because I AM GETTING MORE THAN THAT WHERE I AM NOW EMPLOYED."</p>  
 <p>Before you even start to negotiate for a readjustment of your salary in your present position, or to seek employment elsewhere, BE SURE THAT YOU ARE WORTH MORE THAN YOU NOW RECEIVE.</p>  
 <p>It is one thing to WANT money--everyone wants more--but it is something entirely different to be WORTH MORE! Many people mistake their WANTS for their JUST DUES. Your financial requirements or wants have nothing whatever to do with your WORTH. Your value is established entirely by your ability to render useful service or your capacity to induce others to render such service.</p>

 <p>Having read and assimilated the information conveyed through this chapter, you are now ready to create a practical plan for marketing your personal services. In this chapter will be found an</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>adequate description of every principle essential in planning the sale of personal services, including the major attributes of leadership; the most common causes of failure in leadership; a description of the fields of opportunity for leadership; the main causes of failure in all walks of life, and the important questions which should be used in self-analysis.</p>  
 <p>This extensive and detailed presentation of accurate information has been included, because it will be needed by all who must begin the accumulation of riches by marketing personal services. Those who have lost their fortunes, and those who are just beginning to earn money, have nothing but personal services to offer in return for riches, therefore it is essential that they have available the practical information needed to market services to best advantage.</p>  
 <p>The information contained in this chapter will be of great value to all who aspire to attain leadership in any calling. It will be particularly helpful to those aiming to market their services as business or industrial executives.</p>  
 <p>Complete assimilation and understanding of the information here conveyed will be helpful in marketing one's own services, and it will also help one to become more analytical and capable of judging people. The information will be priceless to personnel directors, employment managers, and other executives charged with the selection of employees, and the maintenance of efficient organizations. If you doubt this statement, test its soundness by answering in writing the twenty-eight self-analysis questions. That might be both interesting and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p>profitable, even though you do not doubt the soundness of the statement.</p>  
 <p align="center">WHERE AND HOW ONE MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCUMULATE RICHES</p>  
 <p>Now that we have analyzed the principles by which riches may be accumulated, we naturally ask, "where may one find favorable opportunities to apply these principles?" Very well, let us take inventory and see what the United States of America offer the person seeking riches, great or small.</p>  
 <p>To begin with, let us remember, <i>all of us</i>, that we live in a country where <i>every law-abiding citizen enjoys freedom of thought and freedom of deed unequaled anywhere in the world</i>. Most of us have never taken inventory of the advantages of this freedom. We have never compared our unlimited freedom with the curtailed freedom in other countries.</p>  
 <p>Here we have freedom of thought, freedom in the choice and enjoyment of education, freedom in religion, freedom in politics, freedom in the choice of a business, profession or occupation, freedom to accumulate and own without molestation, <i>ALL THE PROPERTY WE CAN ACCUMULATE</i>, freedom to choose our place of residence, freedom in marriage, freedom through equal opportunity to all races, freedom of travel from one state to another, freedom in our choice of foods, and freedom to <i>AIM FOR ANY STATION IN LIFE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED OURSELVES</i>, even for the presidency of the United States.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>We have other forms of freedom, but this list will give a bird's eye view of the most important, which constitute OPPORTUNITY of the highest order. This advantage of freedom is all the more conspicuous because the United States is the only country guaranteeing to every citizen, whether native born or naturalized, so broad and varied a list of freedom.</p>  
 <p>Next, let us recount some of the blessings which our widespread freedom has placed within our hands. Take the average American family for example (meaning, the family of average income) and sum up the benefits available to every member of the family, in this land of OPPORTUNITY and plenty!</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>FOOD. Next to   freedom of thought and deed comes FOOD, CLOTHING, and SHELTER, the three   basic necessities of life.</p>   
 <p>Because of our   universal freedom the average American family has available, at its very   door, the choicest selection of food to be found anywhere in the world, and   at prices within its financial range.</p>   
 <p>A family of   two, living in the heart of Times Square district of New York City, far   removed from the source of production of foods, took careful inventory of the   cost of a simple breakfast, with this astonishing result:</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>

 <p>It is not very difficult to obtain FOOD in a country where two people can have breakfast consisting of all they want or need for a dime apiece! Observe that this simple breakfast was gathered, by some strange form of magic (?) from China, South America, Utah, Kansas and the New England States, and delivered on the breakfast table, ready for consumption, in the very heart of the most crowded city in America, at a cost well within the means of the most humble laborer.</p>  
 <p>The cost included all federal, state and city taxes! (Here is a fact the politicians did not mention when they were crying out to the voters to throw their opponents out of office because the people were being taxed to death).</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>SHELTER. This   family lives in a comfortable apartment, heated by steam, lighted with   electricity, with gas for cooking, all for $65.00 a month. In a smaller   city, or a more sparsely settled part of New York city, the same apartment   could be had for as low as $20.00 a month.</p>

 <p>The toast they   had for breakfast in the food estimate was toasted on an electric toaster,   which cost but a few dollars, the apartment is cleaned with a vacuum sweeper   that is run by electricity.

 <p> </p>  
 <p>Only the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter have been mentioned. The average American citizen has other privileges and advantages available in return for modest effort, not exceeding eight hours per day of labor. Among these is the privilege of automobile transportation, with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>which one can go and come at will, at very small cost.</p>  
 <p>The average American has security of property rights not found in any other country in the world. He can place his surplus money in a bank with the assurance that his government will protect it, and make good to him if the bank fails. If an American citizen wants to travel from one state to another he needs no passport, no one's permission. He may go when he pleases, and return at will. Moreover, he may travel by train, private automobile, bus, airplane, or ship, as his pocketbook permits. In Germany, Russia, Italy, and most of the other European and Oriental countries, the people cannot travel with so much freedom, and at so little cost.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE "MIRACLE" THAT HAS PROVIDED THESE BLESSINGS</p>  
 <p>We often hear politicians proclaiming the freedom of America, when they solicit votes, but seldom do they take the time or devote sufficient effort to the analysis of the source or nature of this "freedom." Having no axe to grind, no grudge to express, no ulterior motives to be carried out, I have the privilege of going into a frank analysis of that mysterious, abstract, greatly misunderstood "SOMETHING" which gives to every citizen of America more blessings, more opportunities to accumulate wealth, more freedom of every nature, than may be found in any other country.</p>  
 <p>I have the right to analyze the source and nature of this UNSEEN POWER, because I know, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p>have known for more than a quarter of a century, many of the men who organized that power, and many who are now responsible for its maintenance.</p>  
 <p>The name of this mysterious benefactor of mankind is CAPITAL!</p>  
 <p>CAPITAL consists not alone of money, but more particularly of highly organized, intelligent groups of men who plan ways and means of using money efficiently for the good of the public, and profitably to themselves.</p>  
 <p>These groups consist of scientists, educators, chemists, inventors, business analysts, publicity men, transportation experts, accountants, lawyers, doctors, and both men and women who have highly specialized knowledge in all fields of industry and business. They pioneer, experiment, and blaze trails in new fields of endeavor. They support colleges, hospitals, public schools, build good roads, publish newspapers, pay most of the cost of government, and take care of the multitudinous detail essential to human progress. Stated briefly, the capitalists are the brains of civilization, because they supply the entire fabric of which all education, enlightenment and human progress consists.</p>  
 <p>Money, without brains, always is dangerous. Properly used, it is the most important essential of civilization. The simple breakfast here described could not have been delivered to the New York family at a dime each, <i>or at any other price</i>, if organized capital had not provided the machinery, the ships, the railroads, and the huge armies of trained men to operate them.</p>  
 <p>Some slight idea of the importance of ORGANIZED</p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> CAPITAL may be had by trying to imagine yourself burdened with the responsibility of collecting, without the aid of capital, and delivering to the New York City family, the simple breakfast described.</p>  
 <p>To supply the tea, you would have to make a trip to China or India, both a very long way from America. Unless you are an excellent swimmer, you would become rather tired before making the round trip. Then, too, another problem would confront you. What would you use for money, even if you had the physical endurance to swim the ocean?</p>  
 <p>To supply the sugar, you would have to take another long swim to Cuba, or a long walk to the sugar beet section of Utah. But even then, you might come back without the sugar, because organized effort and money are necessary to produce sugar, to say nothing of what is required to refine, transport, and deliver it to the breakfast table anywhere in the United States.</p>  
 <p>The eggs, you could deliver easily enough from the barn yards near New York City, but you would have a very long walk to Florida and return, before you could serve the two glasses of grapefruit juice.</p>  
 <p>You would have another long walk, to Kansas, or one of the other wheat growing states, when you went after the four slices of wheat bread.</p>  
 <p>The Rippled Wheat Biscuits would have to be omitted from the menu, because they would not be available except through the labor of a trained organization of men and suitable machinery, ALL OF WHICH CALL FOR CAPITAL.</p>  
 <p>While resting, you could take off for another little</p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>swim down to South America, where you would pick up a couple of bananas, and on your return, you could take a short walk to the nearest farm having a dairy and pick up some butter and cream. Then your New York City family would be ready to sit down and enjoy breakfast, and <i>you could collect your two dimes for your labor!</i></p>  
 <p>Seems absurd, doesn't it? Well, the procedure described would be the only possible way these simple items of food could be delivered to the heart of New York City, if we had no capitalistic system.</p>  
 <p>The sum of money required for the building and maintenance of the railroads and steam ships used in the delivery of that simple breakfast is so huge that it staggers one's imagination. It runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention the armies of trained employees required to man the ships and trains. But, transportation is only a part of the requirements of modern civilization in capitalistic America. Before there can be anything to haul, something must be grown from the ground, or manufactured and prepared for market. This calls for more millions of dollars for equipment, machinery, boxing, marketing, and for the wages of millions of men and women.</p>  
 <p>Steam ships and railroads do not spring up from the earth and function automatically. They come in response to the call of civilization, through the labor and ingenuity and organizing ability of men who have IMAGINATION, FAITH, ENTHUSIASM, DECISION, PERSISTENCE! These men are known as capitalists. They are motivated by the desire to build, construct, achieve, render useful</p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p>service, earn profits and accumulate riches. And, because they RENDER SERVICE WITHOUT WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO CIVILIZATION, they put themselves in the way of great riches.</p>  
 <p>Just to keep the record simple and understandable, I will add that these capitalists are the selfsame men of whom most of us have heard soap-box orators speak. They are the same men to whom radicals, racketeers, dishonest politicians and grafting labor leaders refer as "the predatory interests," or "Wall Street."</p>  
 <p>I am not attempting to present a brief for or against any group of men or any system of economics. I am not attempting to condemn collective bargaining when I refer to "grafting labor leaders," nor do I aim to give a clean bill of health to all individuals known as capitalists.</p>  
 <p>The purpose of this book--<i>A purpose to which I have faithfully devoted over a quarter of a century</i>--is to present to all who want the knowledge, the most dependable philosophy through which individuals may accumulate riches in whatever amounts they desire.</p>  
 <p>I have here analyzed the economic advantages of the capitalistic system for the two-fold purpose of showing:</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">   
 <p>1.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>This is a capitalistic country, it was developed through the use of capital, and we who claim the right to partake of the blessings of freedom and opportunity, we who seek to accumulate riches here, may as well know that neither riches nor opportunity would be available to us if ORGANIZED CAPITAL had not provided these benefits.</p>  
 <p>For more than twenty years it has been a somewhat popular and growing pastime for radicals, self-seeking politicians, racketeers, crooked labor leaders, and on occasion religious leaders, to take pot-shots at "WALL STREET, THE MONEY CHANGERS, and BIG BUSINESS."</p>  
 <p>The practice became so general that we witnessed during the business depression, the unbelievable sight of high government officials lining up with the cheap politicians, and labor leaders, with the openly avowed purpose of throttling the system which has made Industrial America the richest country on earth. The line-up was so general and so well organized that it prolonged the worst depression America has ever known. It cost millions of men their jobs, because those jobs were inseparably a part of the industrial and capitalistic system which form the very backbone of the nation.</p>

 <p>labor leader joined forces with the politicians and offered to deliver voters in return for legislation designed to permit men to TAKE RICHES AWAY FROM INDUSTRY BY ORGANIZED . FORCE OF NUMBERS, INSTEAD OF THE BETTER METHOD OF GIVING A FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A FAIR DAY'S PAY.</p>  
 <p>Millions of men and women throughout the nation are still engaged in this popular pastime of trying to GET without GIVING. Some of them are lined up with labor unions, where they demand SHORTER HOURS AND MORE PAY! Others do not take the trouble to work at all. THEY DEMAND GOVERNMENT RELIEF AND ARE GETTING IT. Their idea of their rights of freedom was demonstrated in New York City, where violent complaint was registered with the Postmaster, by a group of "relief beneficiaries," because the Postmen awakened them at 7:30 A.M. to deliver Government relief checks. They DEMANDED that the time of delivery be set up to 10:00 o'clock.</p>  
 <p>If you are one of those who believe that riches can be accumulated by the mere act of men who organize themselves into groups and demand MORE PAY for LESS SERVICE, if you are one of those who DEMAND Government relief without early morning disturbance when the money is delivered to you, if you are one of those who believe in trading their votes to politicians in return for the passing of laws which permit the raiding of the public treasury, you may rest securely on your belief, with certain knowledge that no one will disturb</p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>you, because THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY THINK AS HE PLEASES, where nearly everybody can live with but little effort, where many may live well without doing any work whatsoever.</p>  
 <p>However, you should know the full truth concerning this FREEDOM of which so many people boast, and so few understand. As great as it is, as far as it reaches, as many privileges as it provides, IT DOES NOT, AND CANNOT BRING RICHES WITHOUT EFFORT.</p>  
 <p>There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding riches, and that is by rendering useful service. No system has ever been created by which men can legally acquire riches through mere force of numbers, or without giving in return an equivalent value of one form or another.</p>  
 <p>There is a principle known as the law of ECONOMICS! This is more than a theory. It is a law no man can beat.</p>  
 <p>Mark well the name of the principle, and remember it, because it is far more powerful than all the politicians and political machines. It is above and beyond the control of all the labor unions. It cannot be swayed, nor influenced nor bribed by racketeers or self-appointed leaders in any calling. Moreover, IT HAS AN ALL-SEEING EYE, AND A PERFECT SYSTEM OF BOOKKEEPING, in which it keeps an accurate account of the transactions of every human being engaged in the business of trying to get without giving. Sooner or later its auditors come around, look over the records of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>individuals both great and small, and demand an accounting.</p>  
 <p>"Wall Street, Big Business, Capital Predatory Interests," or whatever name you choose to give the system which has given us AMERICAN FREEDOM, represents a group of men who understand, respect, and adapt themselves to this powerful LAW OF ECONOMICS! Their financial continuation depends upon their respecting the law.</p>  
 <p>Most people living in America like this country, its capitalistic system and all. I must confess I know of no better country, where one may find greater opportunities to accumulate riches. Judging by their acts and deeds, there are some in this country who do not like it. That, of course is their privilege; if they do not like this country, its capitalistic system, its boundless opportunities, <i>THEY HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CLEARING OUT!</i> Always there are other countries, such as Germany, Russia, and Italy, where one may try one's hand at enjoying freedom, and accumulating riches providing one is not too particular.</p>  
 <p>America provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate riches that any honest person may require. When one goes hunting for game, one selects hunting grounds where game is plentiful. When seeking riches, the same rule would naturally obtain.</p>  
 <p>If it is riches you are seeking, do not overlook the possibilities of a country whose citizens are so rich that women, alone, spend over two hundred million dollars annually for lip-sticks, rouge and cosmetics. Think twice, you who are seeking riches,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>before trying to destroy the Capitalistic System of a country whose citizens spend over fifty million dollars a year for GREETING CARDS, with which to express their appreciation of their FREEDOM!</p>  
 <p>If it is money you are seeking, consider carefully a country that spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually for cigarettes, the bulk of the income from which goes to only four major companies engaged in supplying this national builder of "nonchalance" and "quiet nerves."</p>  
 <p>By all means give plenty of consideration to a country whose people spend annually more than fifteen million dollars for the privilege of seeing moving pictures, and toss in a few additional millions for liquor, narcotics, and other less potent soft drinks and giggle-waters.</p>  
 <p>Do not be in too big a hurry to get away from a country whose people willingly, even eagerly, hand over millions of dollars annually for football, baseball, and prize fights.</p>  
 <p>And, by all means, STICK by a country whose inhabitants give up more than a million dollars a year for chewing gum, and another million for safety razor blades.</p>  
 <p>Remember, also, that this is but the beginning of the available sources for the accumulation of wealth. Only a few of the luxuries and non-essentials have been mentioned. But, remember that the business of producing, transporting, and marketing these few items of merchandise gives regular employment to MANY MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN, who receive for their services MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MONTHLY,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>and spend it freely for both the luxuries and the necessities.</p>  
 <p>Especially remember, that back of all this exchange of merchandise and personal services may be found an abundance of OPPORTUNITY to accumulate riches. Here our AMERICAN FREEDOM comes to one's aid. There is nothing to stop you, or anyone from engaging in any portion of the effort necessary to carry on these businesses. If one has superior talent, training, experience, one may accumulate riches in large amounts. Those not so fortunate may accumulate smaller amounts. Anyone may earn a living in return for a very nominal amount of labor.</p>  
 <p>So--there you are!</p>  
 <p>OPPORTUNITY has spread its wares before you. Step up to the front, select what you want, create your plan, put the plan into action, and follow through with PERSISTENCE. "Capitalistic" America will do the rest. You can depend upon this much--CAPITALISTIC AMERICA INSURES EVERY PERSON THE OPPORTUNITY TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE, AND TO COLLECT RICHES IN PROPORTION TO THE VALUE OF THE SERVICE.</p>  
 <p>The "System" denies no one this right, but it does not, and cannot promise SOMETHING FOR NOTHING, because the system, itself, is irrevocably controlled by the LAW OF ECONOMICS which neither recognizes nor tolerates for long, GETTING WITHOUT GIVING.</p>  
 <p>The LAW OF ECONOMICS was passed by Nature! There is no Supreme Court to which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>violators of this law may appeal. The law hands out both penalties for its violation, and appropriate rewards for its observance, <i>without interference or the possibility of interference by any human being</i>. The law cannot be repealed. It is as fixed as the stars in the heavens, and subject to, and a part of the same system that controls the stars.</p>  
 <p>May one refuse to adapt one's self to the LAW OF ECONOMICS?</p>  
 <p>Certainly! This is a free country, where all men are born with equal rights, including the privilege of ignoring the LAW OF ECONOMICS.</p>  
 <p>What happens then?</p>  
 <p>Well, nothing happens until large numbers of men join forces for the avowed purpose of ignoring the law, and taking what they want by force. <i>THEN COMES THE DICTATOR, WITH WELL ORGANIZED FIRING SQUADS AND MACHINE GUNS!</i></p>  
 <p>We have not yet reached that stage in America! But we have heard all we want to know about how the system works. Perhaps we shall be fortunate enough not to demand personal knowledge of so gruesome a reality. Doubtless we shall prefer to continue with our FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF DEED, and FREEDOM TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE IN RETURN FOR RICHES.</p>  
 <p>The practice, by Government officials of extending to men and women the privilege of raiding the public treasury in return for votes, sometimes results in election, but as night follows day, the final payoff comes; when every penny wrongfully used,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>must be repaid with compound interest on compound interest. If those who make the grab are not forced to repay, the burden falls on their children, and their children's children, "even unto the third and fourth generations." There is no way to avoid the debt.</p>  
 <p>Men can, and sometimes do, form themselves into groups for the purpose of crowding wages up, and working hours down. There is a point beyond which they cannot go. It is the point at which the LAW OF ECONOMICS steps in, and the sheriff gets both the employer and the employees.</p>  
 <p>For six years, from 1929, to 1935, the people of America, both rich and poor, barely missed seeing the Old Man Economics hand over to the sheriff all the businesses, and industries and banks. It was not a pretty sight! It did not increase our respect for mob psychology through which men cast reason to the winds and start trying to GET without GIVING.</p>  
 <p>We who went through those six discouraging years, when FEAR WAS IN THE SADDLE, AND FAITH WAS ON THE GROUND, cannot forget how ruthlessly the LAW OF ECONOMICS exacted its toll from both rich and poor, weak and strong, old and young. We shall not wish to go through another such experience.</p>  
 <p>These observations are not founded upon short-time experience. They are the result of twenty-five years of careful analysis of the methods of both the most successful and the most unsuccessful men America has known.</p>
