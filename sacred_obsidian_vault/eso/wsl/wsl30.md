 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXVIII.--My Home and Work in the Morning Land.</h3>
 I was not, however, destined to remain in the Land of Dawn.  My home was now to be in the circle of the Morning Land, and I was therefore escorted thither by my friends.
 <p>It lay beyond the peaceful lake and those hills behind which I used to watch the light of that dawning day which never seemed to grow brighter or advance in the Land of Dawn, but whose beauties belonged to this Morning Land.  This land lay in an opposite direction from that range of hills beyond which lay the Plain of Remorse.
 </p><p>Here in the Morning Land I found that I was to have a little house of my own, a something earned by myself.  I have always loved a place of my own, and this little cottage, simple as it was, was very dear to me.  It was indeed a peaceful place.  The green hills shut it in on every side save in front, where they opened out and the ground stretched away in undulating slopes of green and golden meadow land.  There were no trees, no shrubs, around my new home, no flowers to gladden my eyes, because my efforts had not yet blossomed into flower.  But there was one sweet trailing honeysuckle that clustered around the little porch and shed the fragrance of its love into my rooms.  This was the gift of my beloved to me, the spiritual growth of her sweet pure loving thoughts which twined around my dwelling to whisper to me ever of her constant love and truth.
 </p><p>There were only two little rooms, the one for me to receive my friends and to study in, and the other my chamber of repose, where I could rest when weary with my work on the earth plane.  And in this room there was my picture framed in roses, and all my little treasures.  The blue sky outside shed down on me so pure a light, my eyes, long wearied to see it, gazed on it again and yet again.  The soft green grass and the fragrant honeysuckle were all so sweet, so delicious to me, wearied as I was with my long dark wanderings, that I was overcome with the emotions of my gratitude.  I was aroused by a kindly hand, a loving voice, and looking up, beheld my father.  Ah!  what a joy, what a happiness I felt, and still more when he bade me come to earth with him and show this home in a vision to her who was its guiding star!
 </p><p>What happy hours I can recall when I look back to that, my first home in the spirit land.  I was so proud to think I had won it.  My present home is far finer, my present sphere far more beautiful in every way, but I have never felt a greater happiness than I felt when that first home of my own was given to me.
 </p><p>I should but weary my readers were I to attempt to describe all the work on the earth plane I did at this time, all the sad ones I helped to cheer and direct upon the better way.  There is a sameness in such work that makes one example serve for many.
 </p><p>Time passes on for spirits as well as mortals and brings ever new changes--fresh progression.  And thus while I was working to help others I was gradually myself learning the lesson which had proved most hard for me to learn.  The lesson of that entire forgiveness of our enemies which will enable us to feel that we not only desire them no harm but that we even wish to do them good--to return good for evil cordially.  It had been a hard struggle to overcome my desire for revenge, or wish that at all events some punishment should overtake the one who had so deeply wronged me, and it was as hard, or harder even, to desire now to benefit that person.  Time and again while I was working on the earth plane I went and stood beside that one, unseen and unfelt save for the thoughts of me that would be awakened, and each time I perceived that my enemy's thoughts were to the full as bitter as my own.  There was no love lost between us.  Standing there I beheld time after time the events of our lives blended together in one picture, the dark shadows of our passionate hate dimming and blurring these pictures as storm clouds sweep over a summer sky.  And in the clearer light of my spiritual knowledge I beheld where my faults had lain, as strongly or more so than I beheld those of my enemy.  And from such visits I would return to my little cottage in the spirit land overwhelmed with the bitterest regrets, the keenest anguish, yet always unable to feel aught but bitterness and anger towards the one whose life seemed only to have been linked by sorrow and wrong to my own.
 </p><p>At last one day while standing beside this mortal I became conscious of a new feeling, almost of pity, for this person was also oppressed in soul--also conscious of regret in thinking of our past.  A wish had arisen that a different course towards me had been followed.  Thus was there created between us a kinder thought, which though faint and feeble was yet the first fruits of my efforts to overcome my own anger--the first softening and melting of the hard wall of hatred between us.  Then was there given to me a chance to assist and benefit this person even as the chance had before come to me of doing harm, and now I was able to overcome my bitterness and to take advantage of this opportunity, so that it was my hand--the hand which had been raised to curse and blight--which was now the one to help instead.
 </p><p>My enemy was not conscious of my presence nor of my interference for good, but felt in a dim fashion that somehow the hatred between us was dead, and that, as I was dead, it were perhaps better to let our quarrels die also.  Thus came at last a mutual pardon which severed the links which had so long bound our earthly lives together.  I know that during the earthly life of that one we shall never cross each other's path again, but even as I had seen in the case of my friend Benedetto, when death shall sever the thread of that earthly life, our spirits will meet once again, in order that each may ask pardon from the other.  Not until then will all links be finally severed between us and each pass on to our appointed sphere.  Great and lasting are the effects upon the soul of our loves and our hates; long, long after the life of earth is past do they cling to us, and many are the spirits whom I have seen tied to each other, not by mutual love but mutual hate.
