 <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is well at certain times to consider 
   our status as Rosicrucians, and to remind ourselves of the origin of the Society 
   to which we belong, to notice how far we moderns have strayed from the original 
   paths laid down by our Founder, C.R., and to take a note of the kindred Societies 
   of Rosicrucians which are now in being, so far as we know of them.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to past history we must not be suprised 
   that extant published records are very scanty, for the purpose of the Rosicrucians 
   was to be unknown to the people among whom they Lived. Some few notable persons 
   only appear to have had the right to function as recognised members of the Rosicrucian 
   Colleges, for instance, Michael Maier the German student of Alchemy who died 
   in 1662, and Dr. Robert Fludd of London and Bearstead near Maidstone who died 
   in 1637.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Star of Rosicrucianism is now once more in 
   the ascendant and our Society has made rapid strides in the past ten years. 
   It is curious to note that waves of interest in occult and mystical subjects, 
   seem to sweep over a nation at intervals; periods of Rosicrucian enlightenment 
   alternate with other periods of materialistic dogmatism.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must remember that Rosicrucianism itself was 
   "no new thing" but only a revival of still earlier forms of Initiation, 
   and was a lineal descendant of the Philosophies of the Chaldean Magi, of the 
   Egyptian priests, of the Neo-Platonists, of the Hermetists of Alexandria of 
   the Jewish Kabalists and of Christian Kabalists such as Raymond Lully and Pic 
   de Mirandola.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The nominal Founder of our Society--Christian 
   Rosencreuz, did not invent, at least in our modern sense of the word, the doctrines 
   he promulgated, and which we should now study. It is narrated that he journeyed 
   to Arabia, to Palestine, to Egypt and to Spain, and in the seats of learning 
   in those countries he found and collected the mystic lore, which was made anew 
   by him into a code of doctrine and knowledge. On his return from these foreign 
   travels he settled in Germany, founded a Collegium, selected certain friends 
   and transformed them into enthusiastic pupils, and giving his new Society his 
   own name, he laid the foundation of that scheme of Mystical Philosophy, which 
   we are now here to perpetuate and carry into practice: let us remember that 
   he died in the year 1484, that is so far back as the reign of our King Richard 
   the Third.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fratres of the original Collegium, who met 
   in the "Domus Sanctus Spiritus," or " House of the Holy Spirit," 
   were learned men, earnest students and public benefactors. Their rules were: 
   That none of the members should profess any art except to relieve the sick and 
   that gratis; each one should wear the ordinary dress of the country, and should 
   attend on Corpus Christi day at a general Convocation every year, whenever possible 
   to do so; each one should seek a suitable pupil to succeed him: that the secret 
   mark of each one should be C.R or R.C., and that the Society should remain secret 
   for 100 years.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">As time went on the purposes and duties of the 
   fratres became altered, the cure of the sick especially was taken over by the 
   development of the medical profession.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">About 1710, one Sigmund Richter, using the motto 
   of "Sincerus Renatus," published at Breslau his work called "The 
   perfect and true preparation of the Philosophical Stone according to the secret 
   of the Brotherboods of the Golden and Rosy Cross." In this volume we find 
   a series of 52 rules for the guidance of Rosicrucian members; these rules are 
   such as were likely to lead to useful and orderly lives.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, about 1785, there was published at Altona 
   in Germany a most important volume of coloured theosophical plates with eludicatory 
   words and phrases and several essays on Rosicrucian subjects: its title was 
   "Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer"; it was in two portions. An English 
   translation of some part of this work was published in 1888 by Franz Hartmann, 
   a German Theosophist.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">We catch a further glimpse of the purposes of 
   the Rosicrucians at a later date, from a curious little tract relating to a 
   French branch of the Society, which relates the Reception of Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom 
   in the Mauritius--French colony--by the Comte de Chazal in 1794. I cannot say 
   where the original MS. now is, but our copy was made by the secretary of the 
   well-known Rosicrucian and crystal-gazer Frederick Hockley, who died in 1885. 
   Bacstrom signed his pledge to fourteen promises;--to piety and sobriety, to 
   keep the secrecy of his admission, to preserve the secret knowledge, to choose 
   suitable successors, to carry on the great work, to give aid and charity privately, 
   to share discoveries with his fellows, to avoid politics, to help strangers, 
   and to show gratitude to those who had led to his reception; etc.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">During a recent visit to East Africa I met in 
   Natal a Mauritius born doctor whose wife was a Miss de Chazal, a native of Mauritius; 
   among her ancestors about I780-90 there was this M. de Chazal who was an eccentric 
   genius and was considered to possess curious arts; he also became a notable 
   Swedenborgian and held classes of mystical philosophy. The name is many times 
   mentioned in a French history of Mauritius which was lent to me by Dr. Dumat 
   of Durban. At the time of the French Revolution it would be natural for our 
   count de Chazal to drop his title, as did many of the French nobility.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aim of our own Society at the present day 
   is to afford mutual aid and encouragement in working out the great problems 
   of Life, and in discovering the Secrets of Nature; to facilitate the study of 
   the system of Philosophy founded upon the Kabalah and the doctrines of Hermes 
   Trismegistus, which was inculcated by the original Fratres Rosae Crucis. of 
   Germany, A.D. 1450; and to investigate the meaning and symbolism of all that 
   now remains of the wisdom, art and literature of the Ancient World.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Rosicrucian Societies of Anglia, Scotia and 
   the United States, alike Masonic bodies, are by no means the only descendants 
   of the original Collegium, for in Germany, and Austria there are other Rosicrucian 
   Colleges of more direct descent than our own, which are not fettered by any 
   of the limitations which Freemasonry has imposed upon us, and some of these, 
   although not composed of many members, include students who understand many 
   curious phenomena, which our Zelators have not studied. The German Rosicrucians 
   keep their Colleges and membership entirely secret, they print no transactions 
   nor even any notices, and it is almost impossible to identify any member.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The German groups of Rosicrucians now existing 
   are much more immersed in mystic and occult lore than ourselves; they endeavour 
   to extend the human faculties beyond the material toward the ethereal, astral 
   and spiritual worlds: at the present time I understand that they use no formulated 
   Ritual, but German Colleges have experienced a notable revival and the teachings 
   of Rudolf Steiner are considered as giving an introduction of their system of 
   occult Theosophy. Several of Steiner's volumes are now available in English 
   translations, such are his "Initiation and its Results," "The 
   Gates of Knowledge," and "Way of Initiation." They are well worthy 
   of study.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia, as well as 
   the Societas Rosicruciana in the U.S.A. were branches from the same Rosicrucian 
   source and sprang from a rejuvenation by Frater Robert Wentworth Little of that 
   lapsed Rosicrucian College in England which is mentioned by Godfrey Higgins 
   in his notable work "The Anacalypsis," or "An attempt to withdraw 
   the Veil of the Isis of Sais," which was published in 1836; he remarks 
   that he did not join the old College there referred to.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">About fifty years earlier a certain eminent Jew 
   named Falk, or Dr. Falcon, lived in London (a reference to whom will be found 
   in the "Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry" by Kenneth Mackenzie) and was 
   of high repute as a teacher of the kabalah and of other studies of a Rosicrucian 
   character; he was indeed said to have magical powers. Falk could not have fully 
   affiliated to any Rosicrucian College because he was a strict Jew of the Jews, 
   and the members of all true Rosicrucian Colleges have always been Christians, 
   but perhaps not of an orthodox type, for there was a tendencv in the teachings 
   toward Gnostic ideals. Mackenzie classes Dr. Falk among the Rosicrucians of 
   eminence, and certainly told me he had first hand evidence of his connection 
   with the Society; manv Christian students adopted a modification of the old 
   Jewish kabalah, so perhaps some Jews have been allied to the Christian Rosicrucians.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our own Magus Frater R. W. Little surrounded himself 
   with several other notable Rosicrucian students, of whom I may mention the late 
   Supreme Magus in Anglia, Dr. William Robert Woodman, a learned Kabalist and 
   Hebrew scholar; W.J. Hughan, the great Masonic historian; William Carpenter, 
   editor of Calmet's "Dictionary of the Bible"; Alphonse Constant, better 
   known as "Eliphaz Levi," who gave Fratres Little and Kenneth Mackenzie 
   much assistance, and was in return elected an honorary member of the Metropolitan 
   College in 1873. Our Society unfortunately lost Frater Little at a very early 
   age. Frater H. C. Levander, too, a Professor at University College, London, 
   was a learned member; and took great interest in the mystic lore of the Society.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The late Lord Lytton, the author of "Zanoni" 
   and "The Strange Story," who was in 1871 Grand Patron of our Society, 
   took very great interest in this form of Philosophy, although he never reached 
   the highest degree of knowledge; for public reasons he once made a disavowal 
   of his <i>membership</i> of the Rosicrucians, but he had been admitted as a 
   Frater of the German Rosicrucian College at Frankfort on the Main; that Coliege 
   was closed after 1850.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the Fratres who have recently been ornaments 
   to our Colleges, I may draw attention to the lately deceased and quaintly cultured 
   John Yarker of Didsbury; to our late Adept of York, T. B. Whytehead, who was 
   famous as an antiquarian: to Frater Fendelow of the Newcastle College, who was 
   the author of a learned and suggestive Rosicrucian Lecture: to Frater F. F. 
   Schnitger, who made deep researches into the French and German Rosicrucian Treatises: 
   to Samuel Liddell Mathers, the translator of portions of the Hebrew "Zohar," 
   and to Frederick Holland, the author of "The Temple Rebuilt," and 
   "The Shekinah Revealed." Another deceased Frater of eminence was Benjamin 
   Cox of Weston-super-Mare, and with him I naturally couple the greater name of 
   Frater Major F. G. Irwin, who, however has now also gone to a Temple far away.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the learned juniors of our Society, I may 
   name Fratres Dr. Vaughan Bateson, Thomas Henry Pattinson, the Rev. C. E. Wright, 
   Sir John A. Cockburn, W. J. Songhurst, Herbert Burrows, A. Cadbury Jones, W. 
   Wonnacott, Dr. Wm Hammond, Dr. B. J. Edwards, and Dr. W. C. Blaker.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our Colleges need not languish for want of subjects 
   of study; the narrative of the foundation of our Society is singularly suggestive 
   of points for future investigation. The German "Fama Fraternitatis" 
   of 1614, in an English translation by Thomas Vaughan of 1652, presents you with 
   the History of Christian Rosenkreuz: its companion tract the "Confessio 
   Fraternitatis" gives you a slight insight into the views of the Rosicrucians 
   of a date a hundred years later. The "Chymische Hochzeit" or "Chemical 
   Wedding" by C.R., and the "Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians" 
   by F. Hartman, are tractates of Rosicrucian Allegory which will well repay, 
   not only perusal, but deep study; while the elucidation of the whole set of 
   Medieval Divinatory Sciences, Astrology, Geomancy, etc, are suitable themes 
   for lectures in your College For such as can understand medieval Latin a most 
   interesting work is the "Oedipus Aegyptiacus" of Athanasius Kircher. 
   It is desirable that our students should make themselves acquainted with the 
   Ancient Mysteries of Egypt, of Greece and of Rome. The basis of the Western 
   occultism of medieval Europe is the Kabalah of the medieval Hebrew Rabbis, to 
   which I have published "An Introduction." This philosophy, although 
   at first sight barbarous and crude, yet will be found, when one has grown familiar 
   with the nomenclature, to be a concrete, coherent and far-reaching scheme of 
   Theology, cosmology, ethics and metaphysics, serving to throw light on many 
   obscure Biblical passages and to suggest original views of the meaning of most 
   of the allegorical descriptions found in the Old Testament. A copy of a very 
   curious old Kabalistic picture from a Syriac Gospel with a descriptive essay 
   by Dr. Carnegie Dickson, a notable Scotch Rosicrucian Adept, has just been given 
   to our Library.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The works of the great Rosicrucian Kabalist, Eliphaz 
   Levi, are, to those who read French with ease, a mine of mystic lore, full of 
   fine imagery, and replete with magical formulas. His "Histoire de la Magie" 
   is a storehouse of information relating to the Secret Sciences and Secret Fraternities 
   of all times and among many nations, while in English the two volumes of the 
   new edition of Heckethorn's "Secret Societies" should he read as an 
   introduction to deeper personal research.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">The work of Franz Hartmann, named "Magic, 
   White and Black," I can recommend to serious enquirers, for it elucidates 
   the real aims of the Higher Magic, with which alone we are concerned, and it 
   clears away many misconceptions which exist in the minds of the uninitiated.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">To such as desire to follow more closely the Old 
   Testament religious element, I should advise a perusal of the Commentaries of 
   Dr. Allen Barnes on "Daniel" and "The Book of Revelation," 
   and the symbolical descriptions of the book of Ezekiel. On the Christian aspect 
   I recommend "The Perfect Way," or "The Finding of Christ," 
   by the late Dr. A. Kingsford; in this volume will be found worked out the broader 
   scheme of Christian teaching which is so apt to be obscured by sectarian forms 
   of worship. The tenets of this work are closely approximate to those of the 
   earliest of the followers of Christian Rosencreuz, whose name was probably a 
   mystic title, motto or synonym, and not a family cognomen:- "Christian" 
   referring to the general theological tendency, and "Rosenkreuz" to 
   the Cross of Suffering whose explanation and key may need a Rose or secret explanation.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is one doctrine for the learned, and a simpler 
   formula for those who are unable to bear it yet, even as the new testament itself 
   tells us, of the Great Master who taught his immediate disciples the true keys, 
   but to others he spake only in parables,--"and without a parable spake 
   he not unto them."</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such, my Fratres, are suitable subjects for the 
   attention of your members, but there are many allied topics which might form 
   suitable centres of interest and instruction, for example the whole range of 
   church architecture as crystalised symbolism, the dogmas of the Gnostics, the 
   several systems of philosophy of the Hindoos, the paralleiism between Rosicrucian 
   doctrine and Eastern Theosophy, for which read Max Heindel's "Rosicrucian 
   Cosmo Conception," and that enticing subject, the origin and meaning of 
   the 22 Trumps or symbolic designs of the "Tarocchi" or pack of Tarot 
   cards, which Eliphaz Levi says form a group of keys which will unlock every 
   secret of Theology and Cosmology. For such as are interested in the Alchemy 
   of the past I recommend a perusal of "A Suggestive Enquiry into the Hermetic 
   Mystery" 1850, by an anonymous author, and E. A. Hitchcock's "Remarks 
   on Alchemy and the Alchemists," 1857. And, lastly, we may make researches 
   into that most interesting problem--Did Speculative Masonry arise from the Rosicrucians? 
   I am to understand that the German Rosicrucians say that before the Masonic 
   revival of 1717 these were identical in Europe.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us not forget, that not only as Rosicrucians, 
   but even as Freemasons, we are pledged, not only to Brotherhood and Benevolence, 
   but also to look below the surface of things, and to seek and to search out 
   the hidden secrets of Nature and of Science. Let us bear in mind that a little 
   knowledge is a dangerous thing, but that deeper study reveals the roots of knowledge, 
   as well as increases our store of information. Let us not, with folded arms, 
   float with the tide of indolence, but ever strive after increase of that true 
   knowledge which is wisdom and remember that "to labour is to pray," 
   or as the Latin motto has it, "Laborare est Orare," for the day is 
   coming to each one of us when no man can work, and the value of the work of 
   each man will be tried in the balance of justice, and if we have done well we 
   shall gain a rich reward.</font></p>
