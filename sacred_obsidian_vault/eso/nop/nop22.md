 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> 14 days of Burial, in the Master's degree: 14 parts into which the body of Osiris was divided: a type of Christ, sacrificed on the 14th day of the month: an amulet of 14 points has been used to cure the sick.</p>  
 <p>There are 14 Books of the Apocrypha; they were written originally in <a href="errata.htm#1">Greek</a>, never in Hebrew. An Israelite had to partake of 14 meals in the Booth during the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>  
 <p>The Israelites killed the Paschal Lamb on the 14th day of the Month Nisan.</p>  
 <p>In Matthew, chap. i., we find the genealogy of Jesus recited in three series of 14 names, the first under Patriarchs and judges, the second under kings, and the third under priests and governors.</p>  
 <p>The ancient physicians considered that the 14th day was the crisis of fevers.</p>  
 <p>The Moon waxes and wanes, each for 14 days.</p>  
 <p>15 was the number of Pairs of The Æons, or Holy Principles in the Gnostic scheme of Valentinus.</p>  
 <p>15 is the number by Gematria of the 8th Sephira Hod, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hud</span>.</p>  
 <p>There were 15 steps in the Temple between the ante-court of Israel and the Women's Court, and in these were sung the 15 Psalms of Degrees; Psalms cxx.–cxxxiv. 15 is the number of Jah, a name of God; so the Jews who wrote letters for numbers, never wrote JH, 10, 5, for 15, but TV, 9, 6 15.</p>  
 <p>The great day of joyful recreation for Jewish Maidens</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>was the 15th day of the month Ab. The Deluge covered the hills to the depth of 15 cubits.</p>  
 <p>A Jewish boy in the olden time was ordered to begin the study of the Gemara when 15 years of age.</p>  
 <p>16 means Felicity; a square number. There are 16 Court Cards in a Tarot pack.</p>  
 <p>17. In the treatise "De Iside et Osiride," Plutarch says Osiris was killed on the 17th day of the moon, and hence when the moon was at the full—and from that reason the Egyptians abominate the number 17, and so did the Pythagoreans—they called in Antiphraxis (obstruction), because it falls between the square number 16 and the oblong number 18.</p>  
 <p>18 was deemed a protection against thieves.</p>  
 <p>18. Isaiah made 18 denunciations against Israel. At 18 years of age a girl should go to the Nuptial Canopy. The Golden Candlestick of the Temple was 18 hands-breadths tall. There are 18 Blessings in the Hebrew Liturgy. There were only 18 High Priests during the existence of the First or Solomonic Temple at Jerusalem.</p>  
 <p>19. The number 19 is famous as being the number of years in the Metonic Cycle; the cycle of the revolutions of the moon, after which she returns to have her changes on the same day of the solar year. Meto lived 433 B.C.; he was an Athenian; he published his discovery at the Olympic Games in the above year. The exact period is, however, 18 years and to days. The Calippic period of four cycles, or seventy-six years, was invented by Calippus, B.C. 330, to correct Meto. John Heydon says that the number 19 facilitates births and menses.</p>  
 <p>20. The Kiddushin, 29. 2, says God may curse a man who does not marry at least when 20 years old, for his life is a constant transgression. A woman marrying before 20 may bear children up to sixty; at 20 until forty, and after forty will have none. Bava Bathra, 119. 2. To die after 20 days’ diarrhœa is to die pure.</p>  
 <p>21. A hen sits 21 days, and the Almond is ripe 21 days after the flower falls.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>22 Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, used also as numerals. The realization of a good Dream may be deferred 22 years. Berachoth, 55. 2.</p>  
 <p>From the Works of Hermes Trismegistus are abstracted 22 axioms on the Human Will; they can be found in Tukaram Tatya's "Guide to Theosophy," Bombay, 1887.</p>  
 <p>There are 22 Trumps in a pack of ancient Tarot Cards, used for Divination; Eliphaz Lévi, in his "Clef des Mystères," says that the numbers 1 to 19 refer to the Keys of Occult Science, and that numbers 19 to 22 are the Keys of Nature: the relation of letters to these are nowhere correctly printed in books.</p>  
 <p>23. In the Sanhedrin 23 judges were required to try cases punishable by death.</p>  
 <p>23. This day of September is notable because the moon which comes to the full within a fortnight of it is called the harvest moon, which rises three days in succession at the same time, instead of getting daily later.</p>  
 <p>24 is an evil number, referring to Cain, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Qin</span>, but not of his numeration, which is 100 + 10 + 50 =160, or else 100 + 10 + 700 = 810.</p>  
 <p>24. There are 24 birds unclean as food; 24 ribs both in man and woman.</p>  
 <p>26. The number of Jehovah, IHVH, 10 + 5 + 6 + 5.</p>  
 <p>26. In the English language, which uses 26 letters, it is found that the letters occur in very different proportions. In a fair example of modern English it has been calculated that the proportion between the frequency of the use of the letters was, of a, 85; b, 16; c, 30; d, 44; e, 120; f, 25; g, 17; h, 64; i, 80; j, 4; k, 8; 1, 40; m, 30; n, 80; o, 80; p, 17; q, 5; r, 62; s, 80; t, 90; u, 34; v, 12; w, 20; x, 4; y, 20; and z, 2.</p>  
 <p>27. The number of the Izeds or Angels who ruled under the supervision of the Seven Amshaspands of the Zoroastrian theology.</p>  
 <p>28. A division of the Zodiac into 28 mansions of the moon, was probably earlier than the solar division into 12</p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>parts. The names and symbols can be obtained in Sanskrit and in Arabic. Proctor believes that Solar Astronomy of the 12 signs arose about 2170 B.C., in a country of about 36 degrees of north latitude, and at a period when Taurus was the first constellation of the Zodiac.</p>  
 <p>29. The Rosh Hashanha says the period of the Moon's Revolution is 29 days and six hours and forty minutes.</p>  
 <p>30. A meal of Lentils once in 30 days keeps off the Quinsy. At 30 years of age Jesus began his ministry; Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh; David was 30 years old when he began to reign; 30 pieces of silver was the price Judas received, and Jair had 30 sons.</p>  
 <p>31. The number of El, God = <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Al</span>. 1 + 30.</p>  
 <p>31. Joshua did not complete the conquest of Canaan until he had slain 31 kings.</p>

 <p>35. The number of Agla, AGLA, a composite Kabalistic wonder-working name. See page <a href="nop06.htm#page_27">27</a>.</p>  
 <p>36. Abaji said there are never less than 36 holy men of any generation upon whom the Shekinah does not rest.</p>  
 <p>36. Plutarch, "De Iside et Osiride," calls the Tetractys the power of the number 36, and on this was the greatest oath of the Pythagoreans sworn; and it was denominated the World, in consequence of its being composed of the first four even and the first four odd numbers; for 1 and 3 and 5 and 7 are 16; add 2 and 4 and 6 and 8, and obtain 36.</p>  
 <p>39. The number of Articles of the Protestant Christian Church belief.</p>  
 <p>40. Up to 40 years of age eating is best for a man, after 40 drinking suits best. He who has passed 40 days without an affliction has had his reward in this life.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>For 40 days the Flood lasted, for 40 days the spies searched the promised land, for 40 days Goliath challenged Israel, 40 days of Ezekiel's penitence, the Jews were 40 years in the Wilderness, 40 days of waiting before embalming the dead, Genesis 1. 3; for 40 days the woman's purification lasted after childbirth; for 40 days Moses fasted twice; for 40 days Elijah fasted, and for 40 days Jesus fasted in the Wilderness, and 40 days elapsed between the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus. Moses was 40 years in Egypt, 40 in Midian, and 40 in the Wilderness. The Israelites were 40 years among the Philistines.</p>  
 <p>42 is notable because of the 42-lettered name of God, taught by the Kabalists: there were 42 Judges in the Judgment Hall of Osiris. See Bettany, "The World's Religions," p. 166, on the events of the 42nd day after death.</p>  
 <p>42. The Talmud of Babylon in Kiddushin 71, mentions the 42-lettered Name, and it is given by Ignatz Stern as composed of the Divine Names of the Bible; thus Eheieh asher eheieh, Al, Jah, Jehovah, Elohim, Jehovah Sabaoth, El Chai and Adonai. AHIH AShR AHIH; IH; IHVIH; AL; ALHIM; IHVH TzBAVT; AL ChI; ADNI, Or 4, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 2, 4 = 42.</p>  
 <p>It is very curious that the Ten Sephiroth which denote the attributes of God will show, when these letters are added together, and a V added for <i>and</i> before the last one, this same number 42; if Chesed be called Gedulah, as was common among Kabalists.</p>  
 <p>45. The number of Adam, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adm</span>.</p>

 <p>50. The number of the Gates of Binah (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Binh</span>) the Understanding. The Kabalah states that even Moses only reached the 49th. See my "Sepher Yetzirah," Third Edition, 1911.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>58. Noah, Nch.</p>  
 <p>60. Aristotle stated that the Crocodile lives naturally 60 years, and sits 60 days on 60 eggs.</p>

 <p>72 has a large number of mystic references—to the 72 angels bearing the names of God—derived from Exodus xiv. 19, 20, 21, by the Kabalists; there is an important set of 72 pentacles which, placed in pairs, forms a series of 36 talismans (see Dr. Rudd, the Lemegeton, Harleian MSS.); it is also the number of Chesed (ChSD) the Sephira, Mercy.</p>  
 <p>72. It is said that Ptolemy, King of Egypt, collected 72 Hebrew Rabbis and confined each in a separate room, and ordered each to write out the Mosaic Law, and that by the help of God each wrote out the same words. Megillah of the Talmud, 9. 1.</p>  
 <p>This account is similar to that of Josephus and Aristæus, but different to that of Philo: hence the name Septuagint.</p>  
 <p>73. The number of Chokmah (ChKMH), Wisdom, the 2nd Sephira.</p>  
 <p>78. The number of cards in a Tarot pack: 40 numerals, r6 court cards and 22 Trumps.</p>

 <p>646. The total numeration of Elohim, or Aleim ALHIM, being 1 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 600; or avoiding the use of final Mem, we get 1 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 40; neglecting the tens 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4, and placing these figures in a circle, we get the sequence 3.1415, notable as the value of π, or the relation of a diameter to circumference of every circle. Elohim is both a singular and a plural word.</p>  
 <p>650 has been referred by Godfrey Higgins to Noah, Menes, and Bacchus. Noah, in Hebrew, is NVCh or 64.</p>

 <p>666 is the pet number of Godfrey Higgins, as referred to Rasit (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rsvt</span>), 200 + 60 + 6 + 400, which he insists means Wisdom—or as most believe—Beginning or Principle: The first words of Genesis are <i>be-rasit</i>, In the beginning.</p>  
 <p>666. The number of the Beast, the number of a Man, has been associated with Satan, Mahomet, the Pope and a hundred others. It is also the number of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Svrt</span>, the Hebrew word for the Sun. It occurs in Revelations xiii. 18.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>666 is also the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2093, which is the diagonal of a square whose sides are 1480, the number of Christos. It is also the sum of the numbers 1 to 36. It is also the number of Syënë in Greek, a place in Egypt at which, if a pit be dug, said Eratosthenes, the rays of the Sun at the Summer Solstice shine perpendicularly into it.</p>

 <p>891. Uranus, ουρανος—Heaven.</p>  
 <p>903.
