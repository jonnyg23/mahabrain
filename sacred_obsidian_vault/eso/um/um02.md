 <p>IT WAS through Saint Germain's assistance that I was privileged to have the experiences re  corded in this series of books, and that permission has been granted for them to be put in a form which can be given to the public. No one can realize, unless he too has had similar assistance, how great and eternal is my love and gratitude to him and those other Ascended Masters, whose assistance I had.</p>  
 <p>With the exception of Saint Germain, the real names of the Ascended Masters, exact locations, records, and treasure herein described are withheld intentionally at his command, for reasons that are obvious because only by the Service of Love and invitation from the Ascended Masters is the right earned to be with them in visible, tangible, living, breathing bodies. Any other way of approach is bound to meet with disappointment and failure, for the Great "Presence" and Power which has guarded through the centuries, guards them still.</p>  
 <p>One's own Inner purity, strength, and attainment are the only passports by which one enters into these activities, and association with the Ascended Masters comes about. When an individual, by conscious self-correction of his weaknesses, reaches a certain point, nothing in the universe can keep him from them.</p>

 <p>In America is one of the most Ancient Foci of the Great White Brotherhood which has been working for man's freedom since his advent upon this planet. Some of the activities within this retreat are revealed to the reader that he may, if he be ready, make conscious contact, through his own Inner Light, with the Greater Light pouring out through this powerful center of God-radiation, and thereby drink once again at the Fountain of the Ancient Wisdom and carry the Crystal Cup of Peace, Love, and Strength to his weary brothers.</p>  
 <p>The purpose of putting this book into the hands of the public is to convey to the individual the encouragement and strength that will lift and sustain him through the transition period we are now in, and reveal something of the sane and sound foundation upon which the future of our country and the coming age is this hour being built.</p>  
 <p>This book is written in the embrace of the majestic, towering presence of Mount Shasta, whose apex is robed forever in that pure, glistening white, the symbol of the "Light of Eternity." Its pages are a record of the way by which I was brought in touch with the Beloved Master, Saint Germain, and those other Great Ascended Masters who labor ceaselessly to assist the humanity of this earth, as it struggles on the path to Peace, Love, Light, and Everlasting Perfection.</p>

 <p>I, whose experience it was, held steadfastly to a great dominant desire from Within to see, to hear, and to know, infallibly, the Truth of Life. I was led step by step to realize and accept the Mighty God "Presence" within my own Being—the "Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world"—the "Christ." A way to make contact with the Christ—"Light," Its All-Knowing Omnipresence, and Unerring Activity was revealed to me, and I give it to the reader in these pages.</p>  
 <p>I can record only a part of the events that took place and the instruction I received. One by one, my great desires have been fulfilled because those desires were unselfish. My quest for Truth and Happiness has been long and steady but I have found both, and no human being can take them from me because they are Eternal and come from my own Great God Self.</p>  
 <p>In presenting this experience, it is with the deepest prayer that the reader may receive the "Light," be blest, and prospered on his way, as he walks the Path of Truth which is the only place where permanent happiness can be found. There, and there only, will the Seeker after "Light" find Eternal Peace and Activity in the Service of Love. If my present effort in sending these books forth into the world can carry some of the Love, Light, and Happiness I have received to those of earth, who also have been</p>  
 <p><a name="page_xii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xii</font></a></p>  
 <p>seeking the "Light," I shall have been amply rewarded.</p>  
 <p>The saying that Truth is stranger than fiction applies to this book. It is for the reader to accept or reject as he chooses but the Ascended Masters, whose help I have received, have said to me often;—"The more humanity can accept our 'Presence,' the wider they open the door for us to pour greater and greater help to them; but the rejection of us, by those who do not agree with this Truth, does not remove us or that Truth from existence and activity in the universe."</p>  
 <p>Those, who do accept the Truth herein recorded, will find a new and powerful "Force" entering their lives. Each copy carries with it this Mighty "Presence," Its Radiation, and Sustaining Power. All, who study these pages honestly, deeply, sincerely, and persistently, will know and make contact with the Reality of that "Presence" and Power. To those who read this work, I wish to say, that these experiences are as Real and True as mankind's existence on this earth today, and that they all occurred during August, September, and October of 1930 upon Mount Shasta, California, U. S. A.</p>
