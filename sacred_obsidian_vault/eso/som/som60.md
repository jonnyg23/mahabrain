 <p align="center"><b>I SEE NO EVIL</b></p>  
 <p>I see no evil; I behold only the good.<br> I have seen the drunkard lying in the gutter, and the saint kneeling in ecstasy before the high altar of his faith; but I have found no difference.<br> I have perceived that each, in his own tongue, is seeking to express the One Life.<br> I will not separate and divide; I cannot condemn nor censure, for I know that there is but One in All.<br> I know that all came from the One, and all will return to the One.<br> I know that all are now in the One, and that each is seeking to express the One.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I know and love all</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>I SHALL NEVER DIE</b></p>  
 <p>I shall never die, for the Spirit within me is God and cannot change.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 370</font></a></p>  
 <p>My life is hid within the Universe of Love and Light, and that Light shall live forever.<br> Go, fear of death and change; begone from my thought, fear of death and uncertainty.<br> That which is cannot become that which is not; and that which I am can never change.<br> The Spirit of Eternity is enthroned within me, and the Life of Endless Ages flows through my being.<br> From Eternity to Eternity my Life flows along its way of peace and harmony.<br> Time brings but more glory to crown me with its pleasures.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>My life is forever</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>LOVE TO THE WORLD</b></p>  
 <p>My Love goes out to everyone in the world;<br> I do not exclude anything, for I love all Nature and everything that is.<br> My Love warms and lightens everything that it touches, and it goes out into all places.<br> The Love flowing through me is a Power to all who come into contact with it, and all feel and know that I love.<br> Love within me is Complete and Perfect.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Love within me is Complete</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>MY LIFE IS ONE WITH GOD</b></p>  
 <p>My life is in God; it cannot be hurt nor hindered in its expression.<br> God lives and expresses through me; His work is complete and perfect in me now.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 371</font></a></p>  
 <p>I know His life to be my life, and I know that my life is complete and perfect.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>My Life is in God</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS</b></p>  
 <p>There are no misunderstandings.<br> All is made clear between the ideas of Good.<br> No false sense of separation can come between people, nor disturb the realization of the Unity of All Life.<br> I perceive that I am one with all people, and all are One with me.<br> There is no separation.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>There is no separation</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE DIVINE PLAN FOR ME</b></p>  
 <p>The Divine Plan for me is Perfect. I am held in the Mind of God as a Complete and Perfect Expression of Life and Truth.<br> No power can hinder nor mar this Inner Image of Reality, for It is God-given and God-kept.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>God gave and God will keep</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE PERSONALITY OF GOD</b></p>  
 <p>The Great Personality of God is my Personality; the Limitless Knowingness of The Spirit is my Knowingness, and the One Mind is my mind.<br> All, All live in One Infinite Person, and each manifests the One Who is formed through and in all.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 372</font></a></p>  
 <p>Man is the Personality of God in manifestation and cannot be left without the Inner Witness of the Spirit.<br> I now realize that the Infinite Personalness of the Spirit is my Personality, and I rejoice to know the Truth about myself.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>God is my Personality</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE RADIATION OF LIFE</b></p>  
 <p>The life of God within me radiates and shines forth from me in a constant stream of Light to all.<br> The One Life flowing through me is Life to all who come near.<br> The One Power operating through me is flowing into everything that I contact.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Life radiates from me</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>UNITY</b></p>  
 <p>To-day I realize that I am One with the All Good; my God and I are One.<br> I cannot be hid from His face.<br> I behold Thee, O Most High, enthroned in my temple of flesh.<br> Thy secret place is within me. I feel Thy presence,<br> I hear Thy voice, I rejoice in Thy Light.<br> To-day my body responds to the Divine Behest: "Be perfect."<br> I know of my perfection and wholeness; I am complete and perfect now.<br> Let every thought of disease flee from me, and let Thy Light shine.<br> O Light Eternal, O Light of my Life, I come into Thy presence with joy and thanksgiving.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>So be it</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 373</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>WITHIN THEE IS FULNESS OF LIFE</b></p>  
 <p>Within Thee is fulness of Life.<br> Within Thee is complete Joy and everlasting Peace.<br> Within Thee is all.<br> Thou art in me as I am in Thee, and we are all in all.<br> My Life is full and complete within me, and that Life I give to all men freely;<br> And from all I receive again that which I have given,</p>  
 <p>For it is One in All.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am One with the fulness of All Life</i>.</p>
