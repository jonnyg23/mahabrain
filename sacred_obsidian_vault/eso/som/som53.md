 <p align="center"><b>FREEDOM</b></p>  
 <p>Yes, I know that the Truth has freed me from the bonds of fear.<br> I am not afraid. I adore thee, Most High within me; I trust in Thee and abide in that hope that knows no fear; I am Free Spirit and cannot be bound.<br> The One Life flowing through me is Perfect and Complete. I am not apart from It. I am One with It in Marvelous Unity and Freedom; One with the Complete Whole.<br> I was born free and must always remain free. The realization of freedom permeates my whole being and sinks into the innermost parts of me.<br> I love it, adore it, I accept it.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am free</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>FREEDOM FROM SIN</b></p>  
 <p>I am free from belief in sin; there is neither sin nor sinner.<br> There is no judgment against any one.<br> God does not condemn, and man cannot.<br> All fear of sin is removed from me; all theological belief in punishment is gone from me.<br> I do not allow myself to receive such suggestions, for I perceive that they are lies.<br> I am free from all lies and from all liars.<br> I live by the One Power, and no thought can enter to disturb me.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>There is neither sin nor sinner</i>.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>FREE FROM SENSITIVENESS</b></p>  
 <p>My feelings cannot be hurt.<br> No one wishes to harm me, and there is nothing in me that can believe in any separation from the All Good.<br> I perceive that I am free from all people, and I cannot be harmed nor mistreated.<br> I have such a sense of unity with all that the circle is complete and perfect.<br> I love my friends and they love me, and that love is in, and of, God, and cannot be marred nor hindered.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am filled with joy and love, forever</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>I KEEP THE PROMISE</b></p>  
 <p>I shall keep the promise that I have made to myself.<br> I shall never again tell myself that I am poor, sick, weak, nor unhappy.<br> I shall not lie to myself any more, but shall daily speak the truth to my inner Soul, telling It that It is wonderful and marvelous; that It is One with the Great Cause of all Life, Truth, Power and Action.</p>  
 <p>I shall whisper these things into my Soul until it breaks forth into songs of joy with the realization of Its Limitless possibilities.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I shall assure my Soul</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>LOVE GLEAMS THROUGH THE MIST</b></p>  
 <p>Through the mist of human fear love gleams and points the way to freedom.<br> I now decree and declare that I am free from all sense of bondage.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>I am made perfect and whole through knowledge of the Real Life within me.<br> No illusions can enter my thought.<br> I know that there is One Power, and I know that this Power now protects me from all harm.<br> As Perfect Love casts out all fear, so my fear flees before the knowledge of Truth.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am not afraid</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO BONDAGE</b></p>  
 <p>There is no bondage nor limitation.<br> Every part of me moves in perfect harmony and freedom.<br> I cannot be tied, bound nor made inactive, for<br> I am Free Spirit, and the Power of my Life is from on High.<br> There is no inaction nor false action,<br> And I am now completely Free.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am free</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO CONDEMNATION</b></p>  
 <p>There is no condemnation in me nor operating through me.<br> I am free from the belief or thought of men.<br> I walk my own way, immune to all suggestion of condemnation.<br> Only those thoughts can enter my mentality which I allow to enter.<br> I do not, and cannot, receive adverse thoughts.<br> Only those thoughts which are helpful and life-giving can find entrance to my house.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>There is no condemnation</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>

 <p align="center"><b>NO FALSE HABIT</b></p>  
 <p>There are no vicious nor false habits.<br> Ever desire of my thought and heart is satisfied in the Truth.<br> I do not long for anything nor feel the lack of anything.<br> I am complete within myself; I am perfect within myself; I am happy and satisfied within myself.<br> I am One with All Life within me.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am free</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO HYPNOTISM NOR FALSE SUGGESTION</b></p>  
 <p>There is no hypnotism nor false suggestion.<br> I represent the One Mind which cannot act against Itself nor can It act against me.<br> I am immune to all suggestion and cannot receive false thoughts, nor harbor them.<br> I am surrounded with a circle of Love and Protection.<br> Asleep or awake, I am free from false thoughts.<br> I see the nothingness of all belief in, or fear of, otherness; and I know that The One and Only Mind, alone, can act.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Only the Good can enter</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO MISTAKES</b></p>  
 <p>There are no mistakes; none have ever been made and none ever will be made.<br> Nothing ever happened in the past to hinder or hurt.<br> There is no past, and I know, and can see, that there is no belief in any past to rise against me.<br> I live in the Now, free from any yesterdays or to-morrows.<br> Now, I am Happy, Free and Complete.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p>My Word erases any and all beliefs in mistakes and sets me free.<br> I Am Free!</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am free from any beliefs in the past</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THERE ARE NO RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>  
 <p>The Spirit has no responsibilities.<br> Its work is already accomplished and Its purposes are already fulfilled.<br> The Spirit knows no want nor fear.<br> It is complete within Itself and lives by virtue of Its own Being.<br> I am Spirit and cannot take on the fears of the world.<br> My work is accomplished and my ways are made straight before me.<br> The pathway of Life is an endless road of Eternal Satisfaction and Perfect Joy.<br> My Life within me is Complete and Perfect, and has no cares nor burdens.<br> It is Free Spirit and cannot be bound.<br> I rejoice in that Freedom.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I rejoice in freedom</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE TIME HAS COME</b></p>  
 <p>The time has come, the hour has struck.<br> The power from within has come forth and is expressing through my word.<br> I do not have to wait; to-day is the time.<br> To-day I enter into all Truth; to-day I am completely saved and healed and made happy.<br> To-day I enter into my inheritance.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>To-day the Truth has made me free</i>.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>WITHIN THY LAW IS FREEDOM</b></p>  
 <p>Within Thy Law is freedom to all who will believe.<br> I believe in Thy Law and I love Thy precepts.<br> I know that Thy Law is perfect and It is a delight to my Soul, for It is illumined with Thy Words of Power.<br> Thy Law is complete freedom to me, and to all for whom it shall be spoken.<br> I speak the Word of freedom to all, and all shall receive it.</p>
