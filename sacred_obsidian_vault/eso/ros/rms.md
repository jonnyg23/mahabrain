          THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS AND THE ROSICRUCIAN FELLOWSHIP

                          OUR MESSAGE AND MISSION

         A SANE MIND

                                A SOFT HEART

                                                     A SOUND BODY

    Before   entering  upon   an  explanation  of  the  teachings   of   the
Rosicrucians,  it  may be well to say a word about them and about the  place
they hold in  the evolution of humanity.

    For  reasons  to be given later these teachings advocate  the  dualistic
view;  they hold that man is a Spirit enfolding all the powers of God as the
seed enfolds the plant,   and that these powers are being slowly unfolded by
a   series  of existences in a gradually improving earthy body;   also  that
this  process of development  has been performed under the guidance  of  ex-
alted  Beings  who  are yet  ordering  our steps,   though in  a  decreasing
measure,    as  we  gradually  acquire  intellect  and  will.  These exalted
Beings,  though  unseen  to  the physical eyes, are nevertheless potent fac-
tors in all affairs of life, and give to the various groups of humanity les-

sons which will most efficiently  promote  the  growth  of  their  spiritual
powers. In fact, the earth  may be  likened  to  a  vast  training school in
which there are pupils  of  varying age and ability as we  find it in one of
our own schools.  There are the savages,  living and  worshipping under most
primitive conditions, seeing in stick or stone a  God.  Then,  as  man  pro-
gresses  onwards  and  upwards  in  the scale  of  civilization,  we  find a
higher  and  higher conception  of  Deity,  which  has flowered here  in our 
Western World in the  beautiful  Christian  religion that now furnishes  our 
spiritual inspiration and  incentive to  improve.

    These  various  religions have been given to each group  of humanity  by
the  exalted beings whom we know in the Christian  religion as the Recording
Angels,  whose  wonderful prevision enables them  to  view the trend of even
so unstable a quantity as the human mind,  and thus  they are enabled to de-
termine what steps are necessary to lead our unfoldment along the lines con-
gruous to the  highest universal good.

    When  we study the history of the ancient nations we shall find that  at
about six hundred years B.C.   a  great spiritual wave had its inception  on
the Eastern  shores  of the  Pacific Ocean where  the  great  Confucian  re-
ligion accelerated the progress of the Chinese nation,   then also the reli-
gion of the Buddha commenced to win its millions of adherents in India,  and
still further West we have the lofty philosophy of Pythagoras.  Each  system
was suited to the needs  of the particular people to whom it was sent.  Then
came  the  period   of  the  Skeptics,  in  Greece,   and  later,  traveling


[PAGE 7]                                           THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

westward  the  same spiritual wave is manifested as the  Christian  religion
of the so-called "Dark Ages"  when the dogma of a dominant church  compelled
belief from the whole of Western Europe.

    It is a law in the universe that a wave of spiritual awakening is always
followed by a period of doubting materialism; each phase is necessary in or-
der  that  the Spirit  may receive equal development of heart and  intellect
without being  carried too far in either direction.  The great Beings afore-
mentioned,  who  care for our progress,  always take steps to safeguard  hu-
manity  against that  danger,  and when they foresaw the wave of materialism
which  commenced in the sixteenth century with the birth of our modern  sci-
ence,  they  took steps to protect  the  West  as  they had  formerly  safe-
guarded  the  East  against  the skeptics who were held in check by the Mys-
tery Schools.

    In the fourteenth century there appeared in central Europe a great spir-
itual teacher whose symbolical name was


                        CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUZ

                                or

                        CHRISTIAN ROSE CROSS,


who  founded the mysterious Order of the Rosy Cross,   concerning  which  so
many  speculations   have  been made and so little has become known  to  the
world  at large,  for it is the Mystery School of the West and is open  only
to those who have attained the stage of spiritual unfoldment necessary to be
initiated in its secrets concerning the Science of Life and Being.


[PAGE 8]                                           THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    If we are so far developed that we are able to leave our dense  physical
body and take a soul flight into interplanetary space we shall find that the
ultimate physical atom is spherical in shape like our earth;  it is a  ball.
When  we take a number of balls of even size and group them around  one,  it
will  take just twelve balls to hide a thirteenth within.  Thus  the  twelve
visible  and the one hidden are numbers revealing a cosmic relationship  and
as  all  Mystery Orders are based upon cosmic lines,  they are  composed  of
twelve members gathered around a thirteenth who is the invisible HEAD.

    There  are seven colors in the spectrum:  red,  orange,  yellow,  green,
blue, indigo, and violet. But between the violet and the red there are still
five  other colors which are invisible to the physical eye but reveal  them-
selves to the spiritual sight.  In every Mystery Order there are also  seven
Brothers who at times go out into the world and there perform whatever  work
may be necessary to advance the people among whom they serve,  but five  are
never seen outside the temple. They work with and teach those alone who have
passed through certain stages of spiritual unfoldment and are able to  visit
the temple in their spiritual bodies,  a feat taught in the first initiation
which usually takes place outside the temple as it is not convenient for all
to visit that place physically.

    Let not the reader imagine that this initiation  makes the pupil  a  Ro-
sicrucian, it does not, any more than admission to a high school makes a boy


[PAGE 9]                                           THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

a member of the faculty.  Nor does he become a Rosicrucian even  after  hav-
ing passed through all the nine degrees of this or any other Mystery School.
The Rosicrucians are Hierophants of the Lesser Mysteries,   and beyond  them
there are  still  schools wherein greater Mysteries are taught.   Those  who
have advanced through the Lesser Mysteries are called Adepts,  but even they
have  not  reached  the exalted standpoint of the  twelve  Brothers  of  the
Rosicrucian  Order  or  the Hierophants of any other Lesser  Mystery  School
any more  than the  freshman  at  college has attained to the knowledge  and
position  of  a teacher in the high school from which he has just graduated.

     A later work will deal with initiation,  but we may say here  that  the
door   of a genuine Mystery School is not unlocked by a golden key,  but  is
only  opened as a reward for meritorious service to humanity and any one who
advertises himself as a Rosicrucian or makes a charge for tuition, by either
of those acts shows himself to be a charlatan. The true pupil of any Mystery
School is far too modest to advertise the fact,  he will scorn all titles or
honors  from men,  he will have no regard for riches save the riches of love
given to him by those whom it becomes his privilege to help and teach.

    In the centuries that have gone by since the Rosicrucian Order was first
formed they have worked quietly and secretly, aiming to mold  the thought of
Western Europe through the works of Paracelsus, Boehme, Bacon,  Shakespeare,


[PAGE 10]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

Fludd and others. Each night at midnight when the physical activities of the
day are at their lowest ebb,  and the spiritual impulse at its highest flood
tide, they have sent out from their temple soul-stirring vibrations to coun-
teract materialism  and  to further the development of soul powers. To their
activities we owe the gradual spiritualization of our once so  materialistic
science.

    With the commencement of the twentieth century a further step was taken.
It  was realized that something must be done to make religion scientific  as
well as to make science religious,  in order that they may ultimately blend;
for  at  the  present  time heart and intellect  are  divorced.   The  heart
instinctively  feels  the  truth  of  religious  teachings  concerning  such
wonderful  mysteries as the Immaculate Conception (the Mystic  Birth),   the
Crucifixion  (the Mystic Death),  the Cleansing Blood,  the Atonement,   and
other doctrines of the Church,  which the intellect refuses to believe,   as
they are incapable of demonstration,  and seemingly at war with natural law.
Material  advancement  may be furthered when intellect is dominant  and  the
longings  of the heart unsatisfied,  but soul growth will be retarded  until
the heart also receives satisfaction.

    In  order to give the world a teaching so blended that it  will  satisfy
both the mind and heart,  a messenger must be found and instructed.  Certain
unusual  qualifications were necessary,  and the first one chosen failed  to
pass  a certain test after several years had been spent to prepare  him  for
the work to be done.


[PAGE 11]                                          THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

    It  is well said that there is a time to sow,  and a time to reap,   and
that  there are certain times for all the works of life,  and in  accordance
with  this law of periodicity each impulse in spiritual uplift must also  be
undertaken  at  an appropriate time to be successful.   The first and  sixth
decades  of  each  century  are  particularly  propitious  to  commence  the
promulgation  of new spiritual teachings.  Therefore the  Rosicrucians  were
much concerned at this failure,  for only five years were left of the  first
decade of the twentieth century.

    Their second choice of a messenger fell upon the present writer,  though
he knew it not at the time, and by shaping circumstances about him they made
it  possible  for  him to begin a period of preparation for  the  work  they
desired  him to do.  Three years later,  when he had gone to Germany,   also
because of circumstances shaped by the invisible Brotherhood, and was on the
verge of despair at the discovery that the light which was the object of his
quest,   was only a jack-o-lantern,  the Brothers of the  Rosicrucian  Order
applied  the test to see whether he would be a faithful messenger  and  give
the teachings they desired to entrust to him, to the world.  And when he had
passed  the  trial they gave him the monumental solution of the  problem  of
existence first published in THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION  IN  November,
1909,   more  than a year before the expiration of the first decade  of  the
twentieth  century.   This  book  marked a new  era  in  so-called  "occult"
literature, and the many editions which have since been published as well as


[PAGE 12]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

the thousands of letters which continue to come to the author,  are speaking
testimonies  to  the  fact  that  people are  finding  in  this  teaching  a
satisfaction they have sought elsewhere in vain.

    The  Rosicrucians teach that all great religions have been given to  the
people among whom they are found,  by Divine Intelligences who designed each
system  of  worship to suit the needs of the race or nation to whom  it  was
given. A primitive people cannot respond to a  lofty  and  sublime religion,
and VICE VERSA.   What helps one race would hinder another, and in pursuance
of the same policy there has been devised a system of soul-unfoldment suited
especially to the Western people, who are racially and temperamentally unfit
to undergo the discipline of the Eastern school,  which was designed for the
more backward Hindus.


                       THE ROSICRUCIAN FELLOWSHIP

    For the purpose of promulgating the Rosicrucian Teachings in the Western
World,  the Rosicrucian Fellowship was founded in 1909.  It is the herald of
the  Aquarian  Age,   when the Sun by its precessional passage  through  the
constellation  Aquarius,  will bring out all the intellectual and  spiritual
potencies  in  man which are symbolized by that sign.  As heat from  a  fire
warms all objects within the sphere of its radiations,  so also the Aquarian
ray  will  raise the earth's vibrations to a pitch we are as yet  unable  to
comprehend,  though we have demonstrations of the MATERIAL workings of  this


[PAGE 13]                                          THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

force  in the inventions which have revolutionized life within the memory of
the  present generation.  We have wondered at the X-ray,  which sees through
the  human  body,  but each one has a sense latent which when  evolved  will
enable him to see through any number of bodies or to any distance. We marvel
at the telephone conversations across the continent of America, but each has
within a latent sense which when evolved will enable him to see through  any
number   of  bodies  or  to  any  distance.   We  marvel  at  the  telephone
conversations across the continent of America,  but each has within a latent
sense of speech and hearing that is far more acute;  we are surprised at the
exploits  of  ships  under sea and in the sky,  but we are  all  capable  of
passage  under water or through the sky;  nay,  more we may  pass  unscathed
through  the solid rock and the raging fire,  if we know how,  and lightning
itself  is slow compared to the speed with which we may travel.  This sounds
like a fairy tale today,  as did Jules Verne's stories a generation ago, but
the  Aquarian Age will witness the realization of these dreams,  and ever so
much  more that we still do not even dream of.  Such faculties will then  be
the  possessions of large numbers of people who will have gradually  evolved
them  as  previously  the ability to walk,  speak,  hear,   and  see,   were
developed.

    Therein lies a great danger,  for,  obviously,  anyone endowed with such
faculties  may  use  them to the greatest detriment of the world  at  large,
unless  restrained  by  a  spirit  of  unselfishness  and  an  all-embracing
altruism. Therefore religion is needed today as never before, to foster love
and  fellow-feeling  among humanity so that it may be prepared  to  use  the
great  gifts  in  store for it wisely and well.  This need  of  religion  is


[PAGE 14]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

specially  felt in a certain class where the ether is more loosely  knit  to
the  physical atoms than in the majority,  and on that account they are  now
beginning to sense the Aquarian vibrations.

    This  class is again divided in two groups.   In one  the  intellect  is
dominant, and the people in that class therefore seek to grasp the spiritual
mysteries  out of curiosity from the viewpoint of cold reason.  They  pursue
the path of knowledge for the sake of knowledge,  considering that an end in
itself.   The  idea that knowledge is of value only when  put  to  practical
constructive use does not seem to have presented itself to them.  This class
we may call OCCULTISTS.

    The  other group does not care for knowledge,  but feels an  inner  urge
God-ward, and pursues the path of devotion to the high ideal set before them
in  Christ,  doing the deeds that He did as far as their flesh will  permit,
and  this  in time results in an interior illumination which brings with  it
all the knowledge obtained by the other class, and much more.  This class we
may describe as MYSTICS.

    Certain  dangers  confront  each of the two groups.   If  the  occultist
obtains  illumination  and  evolves  within  himself  the  latent  spiritual
faculties,  he may use them for the furtherance of his personal objects,  to
the  great  detriment  of his  fellowmen.  That is  black  magic,   and  the
punishment   which  it  AUTOMATICALLY  calls  down  upon  the  head  of  the
perpetrator is so awful that it is best to draw the veil over it. The mystic
may also err because of ignorance, and fall into the meshes of nature's law,


[PAGE 15]                                          THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

but being actuated by love,  his mistakes will never be very serious, and as
he  grows  in  grace the soundless voice within his heart  will  speak  more
distinctly to teach him the way.

    The  Rosicrucian Fellowship endeavors to prepare the world  in  general,
and the sensitives of the two groups in particular, for the awakening of the
latent  powers  in  man,   so that all may  be  guided  safely  through  the
danger-zone  and  be as well fitted as possible to use these new  faculties.
Effort  is made  to  blend  the love without which Paul declared  a   knowl-
edge   of   all  mysteries worthless,  with a mystic  knowledge  rooted  and
grounded in love, so that  the pupils of this school may become LIVING expo-
nents  of  this   blended soul-science of the  Western  Wisdom  School,  and
gradually  educate  humanity at large in the virtues necessary to  make  the
possession of higher powers safe.

                               CHAPTER II

                 THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

                          THE PROBLEM OF LIFE

    Among  all  the vicissitudes of life,  which vary in  each  individual's
experience,     there   is  one  event  which  sooner  or  later  comes   to
everyone--Death!  No matter what our station in life, whether the life lived
has  been  a laudable one or the reverse,  whether great  achievements  have
marked  our  path among men;  whether health or sickness has been  our  lot,
whether we have been famous and surrounded by a host of admiring friends  or
have  wandered unknown through  the years of our life,   at some time  there
comes  a  moment  when  we stand alone before the portal of  death  and  are
forced to take the leap  into the dark.

    The  thought of this leap and of what lies beyond must inevitably  force
itself upon every thinking person.  In the years of youth and health,   when
the  bark  of  our  life sails upon seas of prosperity,   when  all  appears
beautiful  and  bright,  we may put the thought behind us,  but  there  will
surely come a time in the life of every thinking person when the problem  of
life  and death forces itself upon his consciousness and refuses to  be  set
aside.  Neither will it help him to accept the ready-made solution of anyone
else without thought and in blind belief,  for this is a basic problem which
every one must solve for himself or herself in order to obtain satisfaction.


[PAGE 17]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

    Upon   the  eastern  edge  of the Desert of  Sahara  there  stands   the
world-famous    Sphinx   with   its  inscrutable  face  turned  toward   the
East,  ever greeting the Sun as its rising rays herald the newborn day.   It
was  said  in the Greek myth that it was the wont of this monster to  ask  a
riddle  of  each traveler.   She devoured those who could not  answer,   but
when Oedipus solved the riddle she destroyed herself.

    The  riddle which she asked of men was the riddle of life and death,   a
query which is as relevant today as ever,  and which each one must answer or
be  devoured  in the jaws of death.  But when  once a person has  found  the
solution to the problem,  it will appear that in reality there is no  death,
that  what  appears  so,  is but a change from one  state  of  EXISTENCE  to
another.   Thus,   for the man who finds the true solution to the riddle  of
life, the sphinx of death has ceased to exist,  and he can lift his voice in
the triumphant cry,  "O death,  where is thy sting?  O  grave,  where is thy
victory?"

   Various  theories of life have been advocated to solve  this  problem  of
life. We may divide them into two classes, namely THE MONISTIC THEORY, which
holds  that  all  the facts of life can be explained by  reference  to  this
visible world wherein we live,  and THE DUALISTIC THEORY,  which refers part
of the phenomenon of life to another world which is now invisible to us.

  Raphael in his famous painting, "The School of Athens," has most aptly pic-
tured to us the attitude of these two schools of thought.   We see upon that
marvelous painting a  Greek  Court  such  as those wherein philosophers were


[PAGE 18]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

once wont to congregate. Upon the various stepss which lead into the building
a  large number of men are engaged in deep  conversation,  but in the center
at the top of the steps stand  two  figures,  supposedly  of Plato and Aris-
totle,  one pointing upwards, the other towards the earth,  each looking the
other in the face, mutely, but with  deeply concentrated will;  each seeking
to convince the other that his attitude  is right,  for  each bears the con-
viction in his heart.  One  holds that  he  is of the earth earthy,  that he
has come from the dust  and  that thereto  he will return,  the other firmly
advocates the position that there is a higher something which has always ex-
isted and will continue regardless of whether the body wherein it now dwells
holds together or not.

    The  question  who is right is still an open one with  the  majority  of
mankind.   Millions  of tons of paper and printer's  ink have been  used  in
futile attempts to settle it by argument,  but it will always remain open to
all who have not solved the riddle themselves,  for it is a basic problem, a
part  of  the life experience of every human being to settle that  question,
and therefore no one can give us the solution ready-made for our acceptance.
All that can be done by those who have really solved the problem, is to show
to others the line along which they have found the solution, and thus direct
the inquirer how he also, by his own efforts, may arrive at a conclusion.

    That  is  the aim of this little book;  not to offer a solution  to  the
problem  of  life to be taken blindly,  on faith in the author's ability  of


[PAGE 19]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

investigation.  The teachings herein set forth are those handed down by  the
Great Western Mystery School of the Rosicrucian Order and are the result  of
the concurrent testimony of a long line of trained Seers given to the author
and  supplemented  by  his  own  independent  investigation  of  the  realms
traversed  by the Spirit in its cyclic path from the invisible world to this
plane of existence and back again.

    Nevertheless,    the  student  is  warned  that  the  writer  may   have
misunderstood  some  of the teachings and that despite the greatest care  he
may have taken  a wrong view of that which he believes to have been seen  in
the  invisible world where the possibilities of making a mistake are legion.
Here  in  the world which we view about us the forms are stable and  do  not
easily  change,  but in the world around us which is perceptible only by the
spiritual sight,  we may say that there is in reality no form,  but that all
is  life.   At  least  the forms are so changeable  that  the  metamorphosis
recounted  in fairy stories is discounted there to an amazing  degree,   and
therefore we have the surprising revelations of mediums and other  untrained
clairvoyants  who,   though they may be perfectly honest,  are  deceived  by
illusions of FORM which is evanescent, because they are incapable of viewing
the LIFE that is the permanent basis of that form.

    We must learn to see in this world.  The new-born babe has no conception
of distance and will reach for things far, far beyond its grasp until it has
learned  to  gauge its capacity.  A  blind man who acquires the  faculty  of
sight, or has it restored by an operation will at first be inclined to close


[PAGE 20]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

his eyes when moving from place to place,  and declare that it is easier  to
walk by feeling than by sight; that is because he has not learned to use his
newly  acquired faculty.  Similarly the man whose spiritual vision has  been
newly  opened requires to be trained;  in fact,  he is in much greater  need
thereof  than  the  babe and the blind man already mentioned.   Denied  that
training,   he would be like a new-born babe placed in a nursery  where  the
walls  are  lined with mirrors of different convex and  concave  curvatures,
which  would  distort  its own shape and the forms of  its  attendants.   If
allowed to grow up in such surroundings and unable to see the real shapes of
itself and its nurses it would naturally believe that it saw many  different
and  distorted shapes,  when in reality the mirrors were responsible for the
illusion.   Were  the persons concerned in such an experiment and the  child
taken out of the illusory surroundings, it would be incapable of recognizing
them until the matter had been properly explained. There are similar dangers
of  illusion  to those who have developed spiritual sight,  until they  have
been trained to discount the refraction and view the LIFE which is permanent
and stable,  disregarding the FORM which is evanescent and changeable.   The
danger  of getting things out of focus always remains,  however,  and is  so
subtle that the writer feels an imperative duty to warn his readers to  take
all  statements  concerning the unseen  world with the proverbial  grain  of
salt, for he has no intention to deceive. He is therefore inclined rather to


[PAGE 21]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

magnify  than  to minimize his limitations and would advise the  student  to
accept  nothing from the author's pen without reasoning it out for  himself.
Thus,   if  he  is deceived,  he will be self-deceived  and  the  author  is
blameless.


                         THREE THEORIES OF LIFE

    Only  three  noteworthy theories have been offered as solutions  to  the
riddle  of existence and in order that we may be able to make the  important
choice  between them,  we will state briefly what they are and give some  of
the  arguments  which  lead us to advocate the Doctrine of  Rebirth  as  the
method  which favors soul-growth and the ultimate attainment of  perfection,
thus offering the best solution to the problem of life.

    1)  THE  MATERIALISTIC THEORY TEACHES THAT LIFE IS BUT A  SHORT  JOURNEY
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE;  THAT THERE IS NO HIGHER INTELLIGENCE  IN  THE
UNIVERSE THAN MAN; THAT HIS MIND IS PRODUCED BY CERTAIN CORRELATIONS OF MAT-
TER AND THAT THEREFORE DEATH AND DISSOLUTION OF THE  BODY  TERMINATE  EXIST-
ENCE.

    There was a day when the arguments of materialistic philosophers  seemed
convincing, but as science advances it discovers more and more that there is
a  spiritual  side to the universe.  That life and consciousness  may  exist
without  being  able to give us a sign,  has been amply proven  in the cases
where  a  person who was entranced and thought dead for  days  has  suddenly


[PAGE 22]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

awakened and told all that had taken place around  the  body.   Such eminent 
scientist as  Sir  Oliver  Lodge,  Camille Flammarion,  Lombroso,  and other 
men of highest intelligence  and  scientific  training,  have  unequivocally 
stated as the result of their investigations, that the intelligence which we 
call man survives death of  the  body and lives on in our midst as independ-
ently of whether we see them or  not, as light and color exist all about the 
blind man regardless of the fact  that  he  does  not  perceive them.  These 
scientist have reached their conclusion after years  of  careful  investiga-
tion.  They have found that the so-called dead can, and  under  certain cir-
cumstances do, communicate with us in such a manner that mistake  is  out of 
the question.  We maintain that their testimony is worth more than the argu-
ment of materialism to the contrary,  for it is based  on  years of  careful 
investigation,  it is in harmony  with  such  well  established  laws as THE 
LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MATTER and THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY. Mind is 
a form of energy, and immune from destruction as claimed by the materialist.
Therefore we disbar the materialistic theory as unsound  because out of har-
mony with the laws of nature and with well established facts.

    2) THE THEORY OF THEOLOGY CLAIMS THAT JUST PRIOR TO EACH BIRTH A SOUL IS
CREATED BY GOD AND ENTERS INTO THE WORLD WHERE IT LIVES FOR A  TIME  VARYING
FROM A FEW MINUTES TO A FEW SCORE YEARS; THAT AT THE END OF THIS SHORT  SPAN
OF LIFE IT RETURNS THROUGH THE PORTAL OF  DEATH  TO  THE  INVISIBLE  BEYOND,
WHERE IT REMAINS FOREVER IN A CONDITION OF HAPPINESS OR MISERY ACCORDING  TO
THE DEEDS DONE IN THE BODY DURING THE FEW YEARS IT LIVED HERE.


[PAGE 23]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

    Plato  insisted upon the necessity of a clear definition of terms  as  a
basis of argument and we contend that that is as necessary in discussing the
problem  of  life from the Bible  point  of  view as in arguments  from  the
platonic  standpoint.  According to the Bible man is a composite being  con-
sisting of body,  soul,  and Spirit.  The two latter are usually taken to be
synonymous but we in sist that they are not interchangeable and present  the
following to support our dictum.

    All things are in a state of vibration.  Vibrations from objects in  our
surroundings are constantly impinging upon us and carry to our senses a cog-
nition of the external world.  The vibrations in the ether act upon our eyes
so  that we see,  and vibrations in the air transmit sounds to the  ear.

    We  also  breathe  the air and ether which is thus charged with pictures
of  our surroundings  and  the  sounds in our environment,  so that by means
of  the breath we receive at each moment of our life,  INTERNALLY,  an accu-
rate picture of our external surroundings.

    That is a scientific proposition.  Science does not explain what becomes
of  these  vibrations,  however,  but according to the  Rosicrucian  Mystery
Teaching  they are transmitted to the blood,  and then etched upon a  little
atom in the heart as automatically as a moving picture is imprinted upon the
sensitized   film,   and   a   record   of   sounds   is   engraved upon the


[PAGE 24]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

phonographic  disc.  This breath-record starts with the first breath of  the
new-born babe and ends only with the last gasp of the dying man,  and "soul"
is a product of the breath. Genesis also shows the connection between breath
and  soul  in the words:  "And  the Lord God formed man of the dust  of  the
ground,  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
living soul"   (The same word: NEPHESH,  is  translated  breath  and soul in
the above quotation.)

    In the post-mortem existence the breath-record is disposed of.  The good
acts  of life produce feelings of pleasure and the intensity  of  attraction
incorporates them into the Spirit as soul-power.  THUS THE BREATH-RECORDS OF
OUR GOOD ACTS ARE THE SOUL WHICH IS SAVED,  for by the union with the Spirit
they  become immortal.  As they accumulate life after life,  we become  more
soulful and they are thus also the basis of soul-growth.

    The record of  our evil acts  is also derived from our breath in the mo-
ments  when  they  were committed.  The  pain and suffering they bring cause
the Spirit to expel  the breath-record  from  it being in Purgatory. As that
cannot exist independently of the  life-giving Spirit,  the breath-record of
our sins disintegrates upon expurgation, and thus we see that "the soul that
sinneth, it  shall  die." The memory of the suffering incidental to expurga-
tion, however, remains with the Spirit as  CONSCIENCE, to deter from repeti-
tion of the same evil in later lives.

     Thus both our good and evil acts are recorded through the agency of the


[PAGE 25]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

breath,  which  is  therefore  the basis of the soul,  but while the breath-
record of good acts amalgamates  with  the Spirit and lives on forever as an
immortal soul,  the breath-record of evil  deeds is disintegrated; it is the 
soul that sinneth and dies.

    While the Bible teaches that immortality of the soul is conditional upon
well-doing,  it makes no distinction in respect of the Spirit. The statement
is  clear and emphatic when...."The silver cord be loosed...then  shall  the
dust  return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return to  God  who
gave it."

    Thus  the  Bible  teaches  that the body is made  of  dust  and  returns
thereto, that a part of the soul generated in the breath is perishable,  but
that  the  Spirit survives bodily death and persists  forever.  Therefore  a
"lost  soul"  in  the  common acceptance of that term is not a Bible  teach-
ing,  for the Spirit is uncreated and eternal as God Himself,  and therefore
the orthodox theory cannot be true.

    3) THE THEORY OF REBIRTH: WHICH TEACHES THAT EACH SPIRIT IS AN  INTEGRAL
PART OF GOD,  THAT  IT ENFOLDS ALL DIVINE POSSIBILITIES AS THE ACORN ENFOLDS
THE OAK;  THAT BY MEANS OF MANY EXISTENCES IN AN EARTHLY BODY  OF  GRADUALLY
IMPROVING TEXTURE ITS LATENT POWERS ARE BEING  SLOWLY  UNFOLDED  AND  BECOME
AVAILABLE AS DYNAMIC ENERGY;  THAT NONE CAN BE LOST BUT THAT ALL WILL  ULTI-
MATELY ATTAIN TO PERFECTION AND REUNION WITH GOD,  EACH BRINGING WITH IT THE
ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCES WHICH ARE THE  FRUITAGE  OF  ITS PILGRIMAGE  THROUGH
MATTER.


[PAGE 26]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Or, as we may poetically express it:

                WE ARE ETERNAL

On whistling storm cloud; on Zephyrus wing,
The Spirit-choir loud the world-anthems sing;
Hark! List to their voice: "We have passed through death's door,
There's no Death; rejoice! life lives evermore."

We are, have always been, will ever be.
We are a portion of Eternity,
Older than Creation, a part of One Great Whole,
Is each Individual and immortal Soul.

On Time's whirring loom our garments we've wrought,
Eternally weave we on network of Thought,
Our kin and our country, by Mind brought to birth,
Were patterned in heaven ere molded on earth.

We have shone in the jewel and danced on the wave,
We have sparkled in fire, defying the grave;
Through shapes everchanging, in size, kind and name
Our individual essence still is the same.

And when we have reached to the highest of all,
The gradations of growth our minds  shall recall,
So that link by link we may join them together
And trace step by step the way we reached thither.

Thus in time we shall know, if only we do
What lifts, ennobles, is right and true.
With kindness to all, with malice to none,
That in and through us God's will may be done.


[PAGE 27]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

    We venture to make the assertion that there  is but one sin:  IGNORANCE,
and but  one salvation:  APPLIED KNOWLEDGE.  Even the wisest among  us  know
but little  of what may be learned, however, and no one has attained to per-
fection,  or an attain in one single short life, but we note that everywhere
in nature slow persistent unfoldment makes for higher and higher development
of everything, and we call this process evolution.

    One  of the chief characteristics of evolution lies in the fact that  it
manifests in alternating periods of activity and rest. The busy summer, when
all things upon earth are exerting themselves to bring forth, is followed by
the flood-tide.  Thus, as all other things move in cycles, the life that ex-
presses  itself here upon earth for a few years is not to be thought  of  as
ended  when death has been reached,  but as surely as the Sun rises  in  the
morning after having set at night, will the life that was ended by the death
of  one body be taken up again in a new vehicle and in a different  environ-
ment.

    This earth may,  in fact, be likened to a school to which we return life
after life to learn new lessons,  as our children go to school day after day
to increase their knowledge. The child sleeps through the night which inter-
venes  between death and a new birth.  There are also different  classes  in
this  world school which correspond to the various grades from  kindergarten
to college. In the lower classes we find Spirits who have gone to the school
of life but a few times, they are savages now,  but in time they will become
wiser  and  better than we are,  and we ourselves shall progress  in  future
lives  to spiritual heights of which we cannot even conceive at the present.


[PAGE 28]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

If we apply ourselves to learn the lessons of life,  we shall of course  ad-
vance much faster in the school of life than if we dilly-dally and idle  our
time away.  This,  on the same principle which governs in one of our own in-
stitutions of learning.

    We  are not here then by the caprice of God.  He has not placed  one  in
clover and another in a desert,  nor has He given one a healthy body so that
he may live at ease from pain and sickness,  while He placed another in poor
circumstances with never a rest from pain.  But what we are,  we are on  ac-
count of our own diligence or negligence, and what we shall be in the future
depends  upon  what we will to be and not upon divine caprice  or  upon  in-
exorable fate.  No matter what the circumstances,  it lies with us to master
them,  or to be mastered as we will. Sir Edwin Arnold puts the teaching most
beautifully in his  "Light of Asia:"

The Books say well, my Brothers! each man's life
The outcome of his former living is;
The bygone wrongs bring forth sorrows and woes,
The bygone right breeds bliss.

Each has such lordship as the loftiest ones,
Nay, for with powers around, above, below,
As with all flesh and whatsoever lives ACT maketh joy or woe.


Who toiled, a slave, may come anew a prince
For gentle worthiness and merit won,
Who ruled, a king, may wander earth in rags
For things done or undone.


[PAGE 29]                                THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

Or, as Ella Wheeler Wilcox says:

"One ship sails East and another sails West
With the self same winds that blow.
'Tis the set of the sail, and not the gale,
Which determines the way they go.

As the winds of the sea are the ways of fate
As we voyage along through life.
'Tis the act of the soul, which determines the goal
And not the calm or the strife."


    When we wish to engage someone to undertake a certain mission we  choose
some one whom we think particularly fitted to fulfill the requirements,  and
we must suppose that a Divine Being would use at least as much common  sense
and not choose anyone to do his errand who was not fitted therefor.  So when
we  read in the Bible that Samson was foreordained  to be the slayer of  the
Philistines  and that Jeremiah was predestined to be a prophet,  it  is  but
logical to suppose that they must have been particularly suited to such  oc-
cupations.  John the Baptist,  also,  was born to be a herald of the  coming
Savior  and to preach the Kingdom of God  which is to take the place of  the
kingdom of men.

    Had these people had no previous training, how could they have developed
such a fitness to fulfill their various missions,  and if they had been fit-
ted,  how  else could they have received their training if  not  in  earlier
lives?


[PAGE 30]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

   The Jews believed in the Doctrine of Rebirth or they would not have asked
John  the  Baptist if he were Elijah, as recorded in the  first  chapter  of
John. The Apostles of Christ also held the belief as we may see from the in-
cident  recorded in the Sixteenth chapter of Matthew where the Christ  asked
them  the  question:  "Whom do men say that I,  the Son  of  Man,  am?"  The
Apostles replied:  "Some  say that thou art John the Baptist;  some,  Elias;
and others Jeremias or one of the Prophets."   Upon this occasion the Christ
tacitly  assented to the teaching of Rebirth because He did not correct  the
disciples as would have been His plain duty in His capacity as teacher, when
the  pupils  entertained  a  mistaken idea.

   But to  Nicodemus  He  said  unequivocally: "Except a  man be born again,
he cannot see the  kingdom of God," and  in the eleventh chapter of Matthew,
the fourteenth  verse,  He said, speaking of John the Baptist: "THIS IS ELI-
JAH."  In  the  seventeenth chapter of Matthew,  the twelfth verse, He said:
"Elijah  is come already and they knew him not, but have done unto him what-
soever  they  listed."  "Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them
of John the Baptist."

    Thus  we maintain that the Doctrine of Rebirth offers the only  solution
to  the problem of life which is in harmony with the laws of  nature,  which
answers  the  ethical requirements of the case and permits us  to  love  God
without blinding our reason to the inequalities of life and the varying cir-
cumstances which give to a few the ease and comfort,  the health and wealth,
which are denied to the many.


[PAGE 31]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

    The  theory  of heredity advanced by materialists applies  only  to  the
FORM,  for  as a carpenter uses material from a certain pile  of  lumber  to
build a house in which he afterward lives,  so does the Spirit take the sub-
stance wherewith to build its house from the parents.  The carpenter  cannot
build  a  house of hard wood from spruce lumber,  and the Spirit  also  must
build a body which is like those from which the material was taken.  But the
theory  of heredity does not apply upon the moral plane,  for it is a  known
fact  that  in the rogues galleries of America and Europe there is  no  case
where  both  father and son are represented.  Thus the  sons  of  criminals,
though  they have the tendencies to crime, keep out of the clutches  of  the
law.  Neither will heredity hold good upon the plane of the  intellect,  for
many  cases  may be cited where a genius and an idiot spring from  the  same
stock. The great Cuvier, whose brain was of about the same weight, as Daniel
Webster's, and whose intellect  was as great, had five children who all died
of  paresis;  the brother of Alexander the Great was an idiot;  and thus  we
hold that another solution must be found to account for the facts of life.

    The Law of Rebirth coupled with its companion law, the Law of Causation,
does that. When we die after one life, we return to earth later,  under cir-
cumstances determined by the manner in which we lived before. The gambler is
drawn  to  pool  parlors and race tracks to associate with  others  of  like
taste,  the  musician is attracted to the concert halls  and  music  studios
where there are congenial Spirits,  and the returning Ego also carries  with
it  likes  and dislikes which cause it to seek parents among  the  class  to
which it belongs.


[PAGE 32]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    But  then someone will point to cases where we find people  of  entirely
opposite tastes living lives of torture, because grouped in the same family,
and forced by circumstances to stay there contrary to their wills.  But that
does not vitiate the law in the slightest.  In each life we contact  certain
obligations which cannot then be fulfilled.  Perhaps we have run away from a
duty such as the care of an invalid relative and have met death without com-
ing  to a realization of our mistake. That relative upon the other hand  may
have  suffered  severely from our neglect, and have stored up  a  bitterness
against us before death terminates the suffering.  Death and the  subsequent
removal to another environment does not pay our debts in this life, any more
than  the removal from the city where we now live to another place will  pay
the  debts we have contracted prior to our removal.  It is  therefore  quite
possible  that  the two who have injured each other as described,  may  find
themselves members of the same family. Then,  whether they remember the past
grudge or not, the old enmity will assert itself and cause them to hate anew
until the consequent discomfort force them to tolerate each other,  and per-
haps later they may learn to love where they hated.

    The question also arises in the mind of inquirers:  If  we have been here
before why do we not remember?  And  the answer is that while most people are
not aware  of  how their previous existences were spent, there are others who


[PAGE 33]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

have very distinct recollection of previous lives.  A  friend of the  writer 
for  instance,   when  living  in  France,   one  day  started  to  read  to
her son about a certain city where they were then going upon a bicycle tour,
and the boy exclaimed:  "You do not need to tell me about  that,  Mother.  I
know  that city.  I lived there and was killed!"  He  then commenced to  de-
scribe the city and also a certain bridge.  Later he took his mother to that
bridge and showed her the spot where he had met death centuries before.  An-
other friend travelling in Ireland saw a scene which she recognized, and she
also described to the party the scene around the bend of the road which  she
had never seen in this life,  so it must have been a memory from a  previous
life.  Numerous other instances could be given where such minor  flashes  of
memory reveal to us glimpses from a past life.  The verified case in which a
little three year old girl in Santa Barbara described her life and death has
been  given  in  THE  ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION.  It is perhaps the  most
conclusive  evidence  as it hinges on the veracity of a child too  young  to
have learned deception.

    This theory of life does not rest upon speculation,  however.  It is one
of the first facts of life demonstrated to the pupil of a Mystery School. He
is taught to watch a child in the act of dying, also, to watch it in the in-
visible world from day to day,  until it comes to a new birth a year or  two
later. Then he knows with absolute certainty that we return to Earth to reap
in a future life what we now sow.


[PAGE 34]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    The reason for taking a child to watch in preference to an adult is that
the child is reborn very quickly,  for its short life on Earth has borne but
few  fruits and these are soon assimilated, while the adult who has lived  a
long life and had much experience remains in the invisible worlds for centu-
ries, so that the pupil could not watch him from death to rebirth. The cause
of infant mortality will be explained later; here we merely desire to empha-
size  the  fact that it is within the range of possibilities  of  every  one
without  exception to become able to know at first hand that which  is  here
taught.

    The average interval between two Earth-lives is about a thousand  years.
It is determined  by the movement of the Sun known to  astronomers  as  PRE-
CESSION OF THE EQUINOX,  by  which the Sun moves through one of the signs of
the Zodiac in about 2,100 years.  During that time the conditions upon Earth
have  changed  so much that the Spirit will find  entirely  new  experiences
here, and therefore it returns.

    The  Great Leaders of evolution always obtain the maximum  benefit  from
each condition designed by them,  and as the experiences in the same  social
conditions are very different in the case of a man from what they are for  a
woman, the human Spirit takes birth twice during the 2,100 years measured by
the precession of the equinox,  as already explained:  it is born once as  a
man  and another time as a woman.  Such is the rule,  but it is  subject  to
whatever  modifications  may  be necessary to facilitate  reaping  what  the
Spirit has sown,  as required under the Law of Causation which works hand in


[PAGE 35]                               THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AND ITS SOLUTION

hand with the Law of Rebirth. Thus,  at  times  a  Spirit  may be brought to 
birth long ere the thousand years have expired,  in order  to fulfill a cer-
tain mission,  or it may be detained in the invisible worlds  after the time 
when it should have come to birth according  to the strict requirements of a 
blind law.  The laws of nature  are not that, however. They are Great Intel-
ligences who always subordinate minor considerations  to  higher  ends,  and 
under their beneficent guidance we  are constantly progressing  from life to 
life under conditions exactly suited  to each individual, until  in  time we 
shall attain to a higher evolution and become Supermen.

    Oliver Wendell Holmes has so beautifully voiced that aspiration and  its
consummation in the lines:

"Build thee more stately mansions, O my  soul,
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low-vaulted past;
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
Till thou at length art free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!"

                    THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

                           THE CHEMICAL REGION

    If  one who is capable of consciously using his spiritual body with  the
same  facility that we now use our physical vehicles should glide away  from
the Earth into interplanetary space, the Earth and the various other planets
of our solar system would appear to him or her to be composed of three kinds
of matter, roughly speaking. The densest matter, which is our visible Earth,
would  appear to him as being the center of the ball as the yolk is  in  the
center of an egg.  Around that nucleus he or she would observe a finer grade
of matter similarly disposed in relation to the central mass,  as the  white
of the egg is disposed outside the yolk.  Upon a little closer investigation
he  would  also discover that this second kind of  substance  permeates  the
solid  Earth to the very center,  even as the blood percolates  through  the
more solid parts of our flesh. Outside both of these mingling layers of mat-
ter he would observe a still finer,  third layer corresponding to the  shell
of the egg,  except that this third layer is the finest,  most subtle of the
three  grades of matter,  and that it interpenetrates both of the two  inner
layers.

    As  already said,  the central mass,  spiritually seen,  is our  visible
world,  composed of solids,  liquids, and gases.  They constitute the Earth,


[PAGE 37]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

its atmosphere,  and also the ether, of which physical science speaks  hypo-
thetically as permeating the atomic substance of all chemical elements.  The
second layer of matter is called the Desire World and the outermost layer is
called the World of Thought.

    A  little reflection upon the subject will make clear that just  such  a
constitution  is necessary to account for facts of life as we see them.  All
forms in the world about us are built from chemical substances: solids, liq-
uids,  and gases, but insofar that they do move, these forms obey a separate
and distinct impulse,  and when this impelling energy leaves,  the form  be-
comes inert.  The steam engine rotates under the impetus of an invisible gas
called steam. Before steam filled its cylinder, the engine stood still,  and
when the impelling force is shut off its motion again ceases. The dynamo ro-
tates under the still more subtle influence of an electric current which may
also  cause the click of a telegraph instrument or the ring of  an  electric
bell,  but the dynamo ceases its swift whirl and the persistent ring of  the
electric  bell becomes mute when the invisible electricity is switched  off.
The forms of the bird,  the animal, and the human being also cease their mo-
tion when the inner force which we call LIFE has winged its invisible way.

    All  forms are impelled into motion by desire:  the bird and the  animal
roam  land and air in their desire to secure food and shelter,  or  for  the
purpose of breeding. Man is also moved by these desires, but has in addition
other and higher incentives to spur him to effort;  among them is desire for


[PAGE 38]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

rapidity of motion which led him to construct the steam engine and other de-
vices  that move in obedience to HIS desire.

    If there were no iron in the mountains man could not build machines.  If
there were no clay in the  soil, the bony structure of the skeleton would be
an impossibility,  and if  there were no Physical World at all, with its so-
lids,  liquids,  and gases,  this dense  body  of ours could never have come
into existence.  Reasoning  along similar  lines it must be at once apparent
that if there were no Desire World composed  of desire-stuff, we should have
no way of forming feelings,  emotions, and desires. A planet composed of the
materials we perceive with our PHYSICAL eyes and  of  no  other  substances,
might be the home of plants which grow unconsciously, but have no desires to
cause them to move. The human and animal kingdoms, however, would be  impos-
sibilities.

    Furthermore,  there  is in the world a vast number of things,  from  the
simplest and most crude instruments,  to the most intricate and cunning  de-
vices which have been constructed by the hand of man.  These reveal the fact
of man's thought and ingenuity.  Thought must have a source as well as  FORM
and FEELING.  We saw that it was necessary to have the requisite material in
order  to build a steam engine or a body and we reasoned from the fact  that
in  order  to obtain material to express desire there must also be  a  world
composed of desire stuff.   Carrying our argument to its logical conclusion,


[PAGE 39]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

we  also  hold that unless a World of Thought provides a reservoir  of  mind
stuff upon which we may draw, it would be impossible for us to think and in-
vent the things which we see in even the lowest civilization.

    Thus  it will be clear that the division of a planet into worlds is  not
based  on fanciful metaphysical speculation, but is logically  necessary  in
the economy of nature.  Therefore it must be taken into consideration by any
one  who would study and aim to understand the inner nature of things.  When
we see the street cars moving along our streets,  it does not explain to say
that the motor is driven by electricity of so many amperes at so many volts.
These  names only add to our confusion until we have thoroughly studied  the
science of electricity; and then we shall find that the mystery deepens, for
while the street car belongs to the world of INERT FORM perceptible  to  our
vision,  the electric current which moves it is indigenous to the  realm  of
FORCE,  the invisible Desire World, and the thought which created and guides
it,  comes  from the still more subtle World of Thought which  is  the  home
world of the human Spirit, the Ego.

    It may be objected that this line of argument makes a simple matter  ex-
ceedingly intricate,  but a little reflection will soon show the fallacy  of
such a contention.  Viewed superficially any of the sciences seem  extremely
simple; anatomically we may divide the body into flesh and bone,  chemically
we may make the simple divisions between solid, liquid,  and gas,  but thor-
oughly to master the science of  anatomy  it  is necessary to spend years in


[PAGE 40]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

close  application  and learn to know all the little nerves,  the  ligaments
which  bind  articulations between various parts of the bony  structure,  to
study the several kinds of tissue and their disposition in our system  where
they form the bones,  muscles,  glands, etc., which in the aggregate we know
as the human body.  To understand properly the science of chemistry we  must
study  the valence of the atom which determines the power of combination  of
the various elements,  together with other niceties,  such as atomic weight,
density,  etc. New wonders are constantly opening up to the most experienced
chemist, who understands best the immensity of his or her chosen science.

    The youngest lawyer,  fresh from law school,  knows more about the  most
intricate cases,  in his or her own estimation, than the judges upon the Su-
preme Court bench who spend long hours, weeks and months, seriously deliber-
ating  over their decisions.  But those who,  without having studied,  think
they  understand and are fitted to discourse upon the greatest of  all  sci-
ences, the science of Life and Being, make a greater mistake. After years of
patient study,  of holy life spent in close application, a man is oftentimes
perplexed at the immensity of the subject he studies.  He finds it to be  so
vast  in  both  the  direction  of the  great  and  small  that  it  baffles
description,  that  language fails,  and that the tongue must  remain  mute.
Therefore we hold (and we speak from knowledge gained through years of close
study and investigation) that the finer distinctions which we have made, and
shall make,  are not at all arbitrary, but absolutely necessary as are divi-
sions and distinctions made in anatomy or chemistry.


[PAGE 41]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    No  form  in the physical world has feeling in the true  sense  of  that
word.  It is the indwelling life which feels, as we may readily SEE from the
fact  that a body which responds to the lightest touch while  instinct  with
life,  exhibits no sensation whatever even when cut to pieces after the life
has fled.  Demonstrations have been made by scientists, particularly by Pro-
fessor Bose of Calcutta, to show that there is feeling in dead animal tissue
and  even  in tin and other metal, but we maintain that the  diagrams  which
seem  to support his contentions in reality demonstrate only a  response  to
impacts similar to the rebound of a rubber ball,  and that must not be  con-
fused with such feelings as LOVE, HATE, SYMPATHY and AVERSION.  Goethe also,
in his novel.  "Elective Affinities," (Wahlverwandtschaft),  brings out some
beautiful  illustrations  wherein  he makes it seem as if  atoms  loved  and
hated,  from  the fact that some elements combine readily while  other  sub-
stances refuse to amalgamate,  a phenomenon produced by the different  rates
of  speed  at which various elements vibrate and an unequal  inclination  of
their  axes.   Only where there is sentient life can there  be  feelings  of
pleasure and pain, sorrow or joy.


                          THE ETHERIC REGION

    In addition to the solids, liquids, and gases which compose the CHEMICAL


[PAGE 42]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

REGION of the Physical World there is also a finer grade of matter called e-
ther,  which permeates the atomic structure of the earth and its  atmosphere
substantially as science teaches. Scientists have never seen,  nor have they
weighed,  measured,  or analyzed this substance, but the infer that it  must
exist in order to account for transmission of light and various other pheno-
mena.  If it were possible for us to live in a room from which the  air  had
been exhausted,  we might speak at the top of our voices,  we might ring the
largest bell,  or we might even discharge a cannon close to our ear  and  we
should  hear no sound,  for air is the medium which transmits  sound  vibra-
tions to the tympanum of our ear, and that would be lacking. But if an elec-
tric light were lighted,  we should at once perceive its rays;  it would il-
lumine the room despite the lack of air. Hence there must be a substance ca-
pable of being set into vibration,  between the electric light and our eyes.
That medium scientists call ether,  but it so subtle that no instrument  has
been devised whereby it may be measured or analyzed,  and therefore the sci-
entists are without much information concerning it,  though forced to postu-
late its existence.

    We  do  not seek to belittle the achievements of modern  scientists.  We
have the greatest admiration for them and we entertain high expectations  of
what  ambitions they may yet realize,  but we perceive a limitation  in  the
fact that all discoveries of the past have been made  by  the  invention  of


[PAGE 43]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

wonderful instruments applied in a most ingenious manner to solve  seemingly
insoluble and baffling problems.  The strength of science lies vested in its
instruments,  for the scientist may say to anyone: "Go,  procure a number of
glasses ground in a certain manner, insert them in a tube,  direct that tube
toward  a certain point in the sky where now nothing appears to  your  naked
eye.  You will then see a beautiful star called Uranus."  If  his directions
are followed,  anyone is QUICKLY AND WITHOUT PREPARATION able to demonstrate
for  himself the truth of the scientist's assertion.  But while the  instru-
ments  of science are its tower of strength,  they also mark the end of  its
field  of investigation,  for it is impossible to contact the  spirit  world
with  PHYSICAL instruments;  so the research of occultists begins where  the
physical  scientist  finds his limit and is carried on by  SPIRITUAL  means.

   These investigations are as thorough and  as  reliable  as  researches by
material scientists, but not as easily demonstrable to the  general  public.
Spiritual  powers lie dormant within every human being,  and when  awakened,
they  compensate for both telescope and microscope,  they enable their  pos-
sessor to investigate, instanter, things beyond the veil of matter, but they
are  only developed by a patient application and continuance in  well  doing
extended over years,  and few are they who have faith to start upon the path
to attainment to perseverance to go through with the ordeal.  Therefore  the
occultist's assertions are not generally credited.

    We  can readily see that long probation must precede attainment,  for  a
person equipped with spiritual sight is able to penetrate walls of houses as


[PAGE 44]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

easily  as  we  walk through the atmosphere, able to read at  will  the  in-
nermost  thoughts of those about him,  and if not actuated by the most  pure
and unselfish motives,  would become a  scourge to humanity.  Therefore that
power is safeguarded as we would withhold the dynamite bomb from an  anarch-
ist and from the well-intentioned but ignorant person,  or,  as we  withhold
match and powder barrel from a child.

    In the hands of an experienced engineer the dynamite bomb may be used to
open a highway of commerce,  and an intelligent farmer may use gunpowder  to
good  account in clearing his field of tree-stumps,  but in the hands of  an
ill-intentioned criminal or ignorant child an explosive may wreck much  pro-
perty and end many lives. The force is the same,  but used differently,  ac-
cording to the ability or intention of the user, it may produce results of a
diametrically opposite nature. So it is also with spiritual powers, there is
a time-lock upon them,  as upon a bank safe, which keeps out until they have
earned the privilege and the time is ripe for its exercise.

    As already said, the ether is physical matter and responsive to the same
laws  which govern other physical substances upon this plane  of  existence.
Therefore it requires but a slight extension of PHYSICAL sight to see  ether
(which is disposed in four grades of density);  the blue haze seen in  moun-
tain  canyons is in fact ether of the kind known to occult investigators  as
CHEMICAL ETHER.  Many  people who see this ether unaware that they are  pos-
sessed of a faculty not enjoyed by all. Others, who have developed spiritual
sight are not endowed with etheric vision, a fact which seems an anomaly un-
til the subject of clairvoyance is thoroughly understood.


[PAGE 45]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    The reason is,  that as ether is physical matter,  etheric sight depends
upon  the  sensitiveness of the optic nerve,  while spiritual sight  is  ac-
quired  by developing latent vibratory powers in two little organs  situated
in  the brain:  the pituitary body and the pineal gland.  Even  near-sighted
people may have etheric vision.  Though unable to read the print in a  book,
they may be able to "see through a wall," owing  to  the fact that their op-
tic nerve responds more rapidly to fine than to coarse vibrations.

    When anyone views an object with etheric sight he sees THROUGH that  ob-
ject  in a manner similar to the way an X-ray penetrates opaque  substances.
If  he looks at a sewing machine, he will perceive first,  an outer  casing;
then, the works within, and behind both,  the casing farthest away from him.

    If he has developed the grade of spiritual vision which opens the Desire
World to him and he looks at the same object, he will see it both inside and
out.  If he looks closely,  he will perceive every little atom spinning upon
its axis and no part or particle will be excluded from his perception.

  But if his spiritual sight has been developed in such a measure that he is
capable of viewing the sewing machine with the vision peculiar to the  World
of Thought,  he will behold a cavity where he had previously seen  the form.


[PAGE 46]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Things seen with etheric vision are very much alike in color.  They  are
nearly  reddish-blue,  purple or violet,  according to the  density  of  the
ether,  but when we view any object with the spiritual sight  pertaining  to
the Desire World, it scintillates and coruscates in a thousand ever changing
colors  so indescribably beautiful that they can only be compared to  living
fire.  The writer therefore calls this grade of vision COLOR SIGHT, but when
the  spiritual vision of the World of Thought is the medium  of  perception,
the  seer finds that in addition to still more beautiful colors,  there  is-
sues from the cavity described a constant flow of a certain harmonious TONE.
Thus  this world wherein we now consciously live and which we  perceive  the
world of FORM, the Desire World is particularly the world of COLOR,  and the
World of Thought is the realm of TONE.

    Because of the relative proximity or distance of these worlds, a statue,
a FORM  withstands the ravages of time for millenniums, but the COLORS  upon
a  painting fade in far shorter time, for they come from the  Desire  World;
and MUSIC, which is native to the world farthest removed from us,  the World
of Thought,  is like a will-o-the-wisp which none may catch or hold;  it  is
gone again as soon as it has made its appearance.  But there is in color and
music a compensation for this increasing evanescence.

    The  statue is cold and dead as the mineral of which it is composed  and
has attractions for but few though its FORM is a tangible reality.


[PAGE 47]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    The forms upon a painting are illusory,  yet they express LIFE,  on  ac-
count  of the COLOR which has come from a region where nothing is inert  and
lifeless. Therefore the painting is enjoyed by many.

    Music is intangible and ephemeral,  but it comes from the home world  of
the  Spirit  and  though so fleeting it is recognized by  the  Spirit  as  a
SOUL-SPEECH fresh from the celestial realms, an echo from the home whence we
are  now exiled.  Therefore it touches a chord in our being,  regardless  of
whether we realize the true cause or not.

    Thus  we  see  that there are various grades of  spiritual  sight,  each
suited to the superphysical realm which it opens to our perception:  etheric
vision, color vision, and tonal vision.

    The occult investigator finds that ether is of four kinds,  or grades of
density:  the CHEMICAL ETHER,  the LIFE ETHER, the LIGHT ETHER,  and the RE-
FLECTING ETHER.

    The CHEMICAL ETHER is the avenue of expression for forces promoting  as-
similation, growth, and the maintenance of form.

    The LIFE ETHER is the vantage ground of forces active in propagation, or
the building of new forms.

    The LIGHT ETHER transmits the motive  power of the Sun along the various
nerves of living bodies and makes motion possible.

    The  REFLECTING ETHER receives an impression of all that is,  lives  and
moves.  It also records each change,  in a similar manner as the film upon a
moving picture machine.  In this record mediums and psychometrists may  read
the past,  upon the same principle as, under proper conditions,  moving pic-
tures are reproduced time and again.


[PAGE 48]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    We have been speaking of ether as an avenue of FORCES, a word which con-
veys no meaning to the average mind, because force is invisible.  But to  an
occult investigator the forces are not merely names such as  steam,electric-
ity,  etc.  He finds them to be intelligent beings of varying  grades,  both
sub-  and superhuman.    What we call "laws of nature,"  are great  Intelli-
gences  which  guide more elemental beings in accordance with certain  rules
designed to further their evolution.

    In the Middle Ages,  when many people were still endowed with a  remnant
of NEGATIVE clairvoyance,  they spoke of gnomes, elves,  and fairies,  which
roamed  about the mountains and forests. These were the EARTH spirits.  They
also  told  of  the undines or WATER sprites,  which  inhabited  rivers  and
streams,  and of sylphs which were said to dwell in the mists above moat and
moor as air spirits.  But not much was said of the salamanders,  as they are
fire spirits, and therefore not so easily detected, or so readily accessible
to the majority of people.

    The old folk stories are now regarded as superstitions,  but as a matter
of fact,  one endowed with etheric vision may yet perceive the little gnomes
building  green chlorophyll into the leaves of plants and giving to  flowers
the multiplicity of delicate tints which delight our eyes.

    Scientists  have attempted time and again to offer an adequate  explana-
tion  of the phenomenon of wind and storm but have failed signally,  nor can


[PAGE 49]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

they  succeed  while  they seek a mechanical solution to what  is  really  a
manifestation of life. Could they see the hosts of sylphs winging their  way
hither  and  thither,  they would KNOW who and what is responsible  for  the
fickleness  of the wind;  could they watch a storm at sea from  the  etheric
viewpoint,  they would perceive that the saying   "the war of the  elements"
is not an empty phrase,  for the heaving sea is truly then a battlefield  of
sylphs and undines and the howling tempest is the war cry of spirits in  the
air.

    Also the salamanders are found everywhere and no fire is lighted without
their help.  However, they are active mostly underground,  being responsible
for explosions and volcanic eruptions.

    The  classes of beings which we have mentioned are still sub-human,  but
will all at some time reach a stage in evolution corresponding to the human,
though  under different circumstances from those under which we evolve.  But
at  present the wonderful Intelligences we speak of as the laws  of  nature,
marshal the armies of less evolved entities mentioned.

    To arrive at a better understanding of what these various beings are and
their relation to us, we may take an illustration: Let us suppose that a me-
chanic is making an engine, and meanwhile a dog is watching him. It SEES the
man at his labor, and how he uses various tools to shape his materials, also
how,  from the crude iron,  steel, brass, and other metals the engine slowly
take shape.  The dog is a being from a lower evolution and does not  compre-
hend  the purpose of the mechanic but it sees both the workman,  his  labor,
and the result thereof which manifests as an engine.


[PAGE 50]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Let  us  now suppose that the dog were able to see the  materials  which
slowly change their shape,  assemble,  and become an engine,  but that it is
unable  to perceive the workman and to see the work he does.  The dog  would
then  be in the same relation to the mechanic as we are to the great  Intel-
ligences we call laws of nature, and their assistants,  the nature  spirits,
for  we  behold the manifestations of their work as FORCE moving  matter  in
various ways but always under immutable conditions.

    In the ether we may also observe the Angels,  whose densest body is made
of that material, as our dense body is formed of gases, liquids, and solids.
These Beings are one step beyond the human stage,  as we are a degree in ad-
vance of the animal evolution.  We have never been animals like our  present
fauna,  however, but at a previous stage in the development of our planet we
had  an animal-like constitution.  Then the Angels were human,  though  they
have never possessed a dense body such as ours,  nor ever functioned in  any
material denser than ether.  At some time, in a future condition,  the Earth
will again become ethereal. Then man will be like the Angels. Therefore  the
Bible  tells  us  that man was made A LITTLE LOWER than the Angels. (Hebrews
2:7).

    As ether is the avenue of vital, creative forces, and as Angels are such
expert builders of ether,  we may readily understand that they are eminently


[PAGE 51]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

fitted to be warders of the propagative forces in plant,  animal,  and  man.
All through the Bible we find them thus engaged:  Two ANGELS came to Abraham
and  announced the birth of Isaac,  they promised a child to the man who had
obeyed God.   Later these same Angeles destroyed Sodom for abuse of the cre-
ative force.   ANGELS foretold to the parents of Samuel and Samson the birth
of  these  giants  of brain and brawn.   To Elizabeth came  the  ANGEL  (not
Arch-angel) Gabriel and announced the birth of John;  later he appeared also
to Mary with the message that she was chosen to bear Jesus.


                            THE DESIRE WORLD

    When  spiritual sight is developed so that it becomes possible to behold
the Desire World,  many wonders confront the newcomer,  for conditions there
are  so  widely different from what they are here that  a  description  must
sound quite as incredible as a fairy tale to anyone who has not himself seen
them.

    Many cannot believe that such a world exists,  and that other people can
see that which is invisible to them,  yet some people are blind to the beau-
ties of this world which we see.  A man who was born blind,  may say to  us:
"I know that this world exists.  I can hear, I can smell,  I can taste,  and
above  all I can feel,  but when you speak of light and of color,  they  are
non-existent to me.  You say that you SEE these things.  I cannot believe it
for I cannot SEE myself. You say that light and color are all about me,  but


[PAGE 52]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

none of the senses at my command reveal them to me and I do not believe that
the  sense you call sight exists.  I think you suffer from  hallucinations."
We might sympathize very sincerely with the poor man who is thus  afflicted,
but his skepticisms, reasonings, objections, and sneers notwithstanding,  we
would be obliged to maintain that we perceive light and color.

    The man or woman whose spiritual sight has been awakened is in a similar
position with respect to those who do not perceive the Desire World of which
he  speaks.  If  the  blind  man  acquires  the faculty of sight by an oper-
ation, his eyes are opened and he will  be compelled to assert the existence
of light and color which he formerly denied, and when spiritual sight is ac-
quired by anyone, he also perceives for himself the facts related by others.
Neither is it an argument against the existence of spiritual realms that se-
ers  are  at variance in their descriptions of conditions in  the  invisible
world.  We need but to look into books on travel and compare stories brought
home by explorers of China,  India, or Africa;  we shall find them differing
widely  and often contradictory,  because each traveler saw things from  his
own  standpoint,  under other conditions than those met by his  brother  au-
thors. We maintain that the man who has read most widely these varying tales
concerning a certain country AND WRESTLED  WITH THE CONTRADICTIONS OF NARRA-
TORS,  will have a more comprehensive idea of the country or people of  whom
he has read, than the man who has read only one story assented to by all the
authors.  Similarly, the varying stories of visitors to the Desire World are
of value,  because giving a fuller view, and more rounded,  than if all  had
seen things from the same angle.


[PAGE 53]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    In this world matter and force are widely different.  The chief  charac-
teristic  of matter here is INERTIA:  the tendency to remain at  rest  until
acted upon by a force which sets it in motion.  In the Desire World,  on the
contrary,  force and matter are almost indistinguishable one from the other.
We might almost describe desire-stuff as force-matter,  for it is in  inces-
sant motion,  responsive to the slightest FEELING of a vast multitude of be-
ings  which populate this wonderful world in nature.  We often speak of  the
"teeming  millions"  of  China  and India, even of our vast cities,  London,
New York,  Paris,  or Chicago;  we consider them overcrowded in the extreme,
yet  even the densest population of any spot on Earth is sparsely  inhabited
compared with the crowded conditions of the Desire World.  No  inconvenience
is felt by any of the denizens of that realm,  however,  for,  while in this
world two things cannot occupy the same space at the same time,  it is  dif-
ferent there.  A number of people and things may exist IN THE SAME PLACE  AT
THE SAME TIME and be engaged in most diverse activities,  regardless of what
others are doing,  such is the wonderful elasticity of desire-stuff.  As  an
illustration we may mention a case where the writer, while attending a reli-
gious service,  plainly perceived at the altar certain beings interested  in
furthering  that service and working to achieve that end.  At the same  time
there drifted through the room and the altar,  a table at which four persons
were  engaged in playing cards.  They were as oblivious to the existence  of
the beings engaged in furthering our religious service,  as though these did
not exist.


[PAGE 54]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    The Desire World is the abode of those who have died, for some time sub-
sequent to that event,  and we may mention in the above connection that  the
so-called "dead" very  often  stay for a long while among their still living
friends.  Unseen  by their relatives they go about the  familiar  rooms.  At
first  they are often unaware of the condition mentioned:  THAT TWO  PERSONS
MAY BE IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME,  and when they seat themselves in
a  chair or at the table,  a living relative may take the supposedly  vacant
seat. The man we mistakenly call dead will at first hurry out of his seat to
escape being sat upon,  but he soon learns that being sat upon does not hurt
him in his altered condition, and that he may remain in his chair regardless
of the fact that his living relative is also sitting there.

    In  the lower regions of the Desire World the whole body of  each  being
may  be  seen,  but in the highest regions only the head  seems  to  remain.
Raphael,  who  like many other people in the Middle Ages was gifted  with  a
so-called  SECOND SIGHT,  pictured that condition for us in his Sistine  Ma-
donna,  now in the Dresden Art Gallery, where Madonna  and  the Christ-child
are represented as floating in  a golden atmosphere and surrounded by a host
of genie-heads: conditions which the occult investigator knows to be in har-
mony with actual facts.


[PAGE 55]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    Among the entities who are, so to speak,   "native" to that realm of na-
ture,  none are perhaps better known to the Christian world than the Archan-
gels.  These exalted Beings were human at a time in the Earth's history when
we were yet plant-like.  Since then we have advanced two steps;  through the
animal  and to the human stage of development.  The present Archangels  have
also made two steps in progression;  one, in which they were similar to what
the  Angels are now,  and another step which made them what we call  Archan-
gels.

    Their  densest body,  though differing from ours in shape,  and made  of
desire-stuff, is used by them as a vehicle of consciousness in the same man-
ner that we use our body.  They are expert manipulators of forces in the De-
sire World, and these forces, as we shall see, move all the world to action.
Therefore the Archangels work with humanity INDUSTRIALLY and POLITICALLY  as
arbitrators of the destiny of peoples and nations. The Angels may be said to
be FAMILY SPIRITS,  whose mission is to unite a few Spirits as members of  a
family,  and cement them with ties of blood and love of kin, while the Arch-
angels may be called race and national spirits,  as they unite whole nations
by patriotism or love of home and country. They are responsible for the rise
and fall of nations, they give war or peace, victory or defeat, as it serves
the best interest of the people they rule.  This we may see,  for  instance,
from the book of Daniel, where the Archangel Michael is called the prince of
the children of Israel.  Another Archangel tells Daniel (in the tenth  chap-
ter)  that  he intends to fight the prince of Persia by means of the Greeks.


[PAGE 56]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    There  are varying grades of intelligence among human beings;  some  are
qualified to hold lofty positions entirely beyond the ability of others.  So
it  is also among higher beings.  Not all Archangels are fitted to govern  a
nation and rule the destiny of a race, people, or tribe; some are not fitted
to rule human beings at all,  but as the animals also have a desire  nature,
these  lower  grades of Archangels govern the animals as Group  Spirits  and
evolve to higher capacity thereby.

    The work of the Race Spirit is readily observable in the people it  gov-
erns.   The lower in the scale of evolution the people, the more they show a
certain racial likeness.   That is due to the work of the Race Spirit.   One
national  Spirit is responsible for the swarthy complexion common  to  Ital-
ians, for instance, while another causes the Scandinavians to be blond.   In
the  more advanced types of humanity,  there is a wider divergence from  the
common type, due to the individualized Ego, which thus expresses in form and 
feature  its  own  particular  idiosyncrasies.  Among  the  lower  types  of 
humanity such as Mongolians, native African Negroes and South Sea Islanders, 
the resemblance of individuals in each tribe makes it almost impossible  for 
civilized Westerners to distinguish between them. Among  animals, where  the 
                    

[PAGE 57]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

separate Spirit is not individualized and self-conscious, the resemblance is
not only much more marked physically but extends even to traits and  charac-
teristics.  We may write the biography of a man, for the experiences of each
varies from that of others and his acts are different,  but we cannon  write
the  biography of an animal,  for members of each tribe all act alike  under
similar circumstances.  If we desire to know the facts about Edward VII,  it
would profit us nothing to study the life of the Prince-Consort, his father,
or of George V,  his son,  as both would be entirely different from  Edward.
In order to find out what manner of man he was,  we must study his own indi-
vidual life.   If, on the other hand, we wish to know the characteristics of
beavers,  we may observe any individual of the tribe, and when we have stud-
ied its idiosyncrasies,  we shall know the traits of the whole tribe of bea-
vers.  What we call "instinct" is in reality the dictates of "Group Spirits"
which govern separate individuals of its tribe telepathically, as it were.

    The  ancient Egyptians knew of these animal Group spirits  and  sketched
many  of them,  in a crude way, upon their temples and tombs.  Such  figures
with a human body and an animal head actually live in the Desire World. They
may be spoken to,  and will be found much more intelligent than the  average
human being.

    That statement brings up another peculiarity of conditions in the Desire
World in respect of language. Here in this world human speech is so diversi-
fied that there are countries where people who live only a few  miles  apart


[PAGE 58]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES
        
speak a dialect so different that they understand each other with great dif-
ficulty,  and each nation has its own language that varies  altogether  from
the  speech of other peoples.
    In the lower regions of the  Desire  World, there  is the same diversity
of tongues as on  Earth,  and  the  so-called "dead"  of one  nation find it
impossible to converse with those who  lived in another country.  Hence lin-
guistic accomplishments are of great value to the Invisible Helpers, of whom
we shall hear later, as their sphere of usefulness is enormously extended by
that ability.

     Even  apart from differences of language our mode of speech is  exceed-
ingly productive of misunderstandings.  The same words often convey most op-
posite  ideas to different minds.    If we speak of a "body of  water,"  one
person may think we mean a lake of small dimensions, the thoughts of another
may  be  directed to the Great Lakes, and a third person's thoughts  may  be
turned  towards the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean.    If we speak of a  "light,"
one may think of a gaslight,  another of an electric arc-lamp,  or if we say
"red,"  one  person  may think we mean a delicate shade of pink and  another
gets the idea of crimson. The misunderstandings of what words mean goes even
farther, as illustrated in the following.

    The writer once opened a reading room in a large city where he lectured,
and invited his audience to make use thereof.  Among those who availed them-
selves  of  the opportunity was a gentleman who had for many  years  been  a
veritable "metaphysical tramp,"  roaming from lecture  to  lecture,  hearing


[PAGE 59]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

the  teachings of everybody and practicing nothing.  Like the  Athenians  on
Mars' Hill,   he was always looking for something "new," particularly in the
line of phenomena,  and his mind was in that seething chaotic state which is
one of the most prominent symptoms of "mental indigestion."

    Having attended a number of our lectures he knew from the program  that:
"The lecturer does not give readings or cast horoscopes FOR PAY."   But see-
ing on the door of the newly opened reading room,  the legend:   "Free Read-
ing Room,"   his erratic mind at once jumped to the conclusion that although
we were opposed to telling fortunes for pay,  we were now going to give free
readings  of the future in the Free Reading Room.  He was much  disappointed
that  we did not intend to tell fortunes,  either gratis or for a  consider-
ation,   and we changed our sign to  "Free Library"  in order to  obviate  a
repetition of the error.

    In the higher Regions of the Desire World the confusion of tongues gives
place to a universal mode of expression which absolutely prevents  misunder-
standings of our meaning.  There each of our thoughts takes a definite  form
and color perceptible to all,  and this thought-symbol emits a certain tone,
which  is not a word,  but it conveys our meaning to the one we  address  no
matter what language we spoke on earth.


[PAGE 60]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    To  arrive at an understanding of how such a universal language  becomes
possible  and is at once comprehended by all,  without preparation,  we  may
take as an illustration the manner in which a musician reads music. A German
or a Polish composer may write an opera. Each has his own peculiar terminol-
ogy and expresses it in his own language. When that opera is to be played by
an Italian bandmaster,  or by a Spanish or American musician, it need not be
translated; the notes and symbols upon the page are a universally understood
language of symbols which is intelligible to musicians of no matter what na-
tionality.  Similarly with figures, the German counts: ein, zwei, drei;  the
Frenchman says: un, deux, trois, and in English we use the words: one,  two,
three,  but the figures: 1,2,3, though differently spoken,  are intelligible
to all and mean the same. There is no possibility of misunderstanding in the
cases  of either music or figures.  Thus it is also with the universal  lan-
guage peculiar to the higher regions of the Desire World and the still  more
subtle realms in nature, it is intelligible to all, an exact mode of expres-
sion.

    Returning  to our description of the entities commonly met with  in  the
lower  Desire  World,  we may note that other systems of religion  than  the
EGYPTIAN,  already mentioned, has spoken of various classes of beings native
to  these realms.  The Zoroastrian religion,  for instance,  mentions  SEVEN
AMSHASPANDS  and  the IZZARDS as having dominion over certain  days  in  the
month and certain months in the year. The Christian religion speaks of Seven
Spirits before the Throne,  which  are  the  same beings the Persians called


[PAGE 61]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

Amshaspands.  Each of them rules over two months in the year while the  sev-
enth:  Michael,  the highest, is their leader, for he is ambassador from the
Sun to the Earth; the others are ambassadors from the planets.  The Catholic
religion  with  its abundant occult information takes most notice  of  these
"star-angels"  and  knows  considerable about their influence upon  the  af-
fairs of the earth.

    The Amshaspands, however, do not inhabit the lower regions of the Desire
World but influence the Izzards.  According to the old Persian legend  these
beings are divisible into two groups: one of twenty-eight classes,  and  the
other of three classes.  Each of these classes has dominion over,  or  takes
the  lead  of all the other classes on one certain day of  the  month.  They
regulate the weather conditions on that day and work with animal and man  in
particular.  At least the twenty-eight classes do that,  the other group  of
three  classes  has  nothing  to do with animals,  because  they  have  only
twenty-eight  pairs  of spinal nerves, while human beings  have  thirty-one.
Thus animals are attuned to the lunar month of twenty-eight days,  while man
is correlated to the solar month of thirty or thirty-one days.  The  ancient
Persians were astronomers but not physiologists; they had no means of  know-
ing  the  different  nervous constitution of animal and man,  but  they  saw
clairvoyantly these superphysical beings; they noted and recorded their work
with animal and men,  and our own anatomical investigations may show us  the
reason  for these divisions of the classes of Izzards recorded in  that  an-
cient system of philosophy.


[PAGE 62]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Still  another class of beings should be mentioned:  those who have  en-
tered the Desire World through the gate of death and are now hidden from our
physical vision.  These so-called "dead"  are  in  fact much more alive than
any of us,  who are tied to a dense body and subject to all its limitations,
who  are forced slowly to drag this clog along with us at the rate of a  few
miles an hour,  who must expend such an enormous amount of energy upon  pro-
pelling that vehicle that we are easily and quickly tired,  even when in the
best of health, and who are often confined to a bed, sometimes for years, by
the indisposition of this heavy mortal coil. But when that is once shed  and
the  freed Spirit can again function in its spiritual body,  sickness is  an
unknown condition,  and distance is annihilated, or at least practically so,
for though it was necessary for the Savior to liken the freed Spirit to  the
wind which blows where it listeth,  that simile gives but a poor description
of what actually takes place in soul flights. Time is non-existent there, as
we shall presently explain,  so the writer has never been able to time  him-
self,  but has on several occasions timed others when he was in  the  physi-
cal  body and then speeding through space upon a certain  errand.  Distances
such  as from the Pacific Coast to Europe,  the delivery of a short  message
there and the return to the body has been accomplished in slightly less than
one minute. Therefore our assertion, that those whom we call dead are in re-
ality much more alive than we, is well founded in facts.


[PAGE 63]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    We  spoke of the dense body in which we now live,   as  a "clog"  and  a
"fetter."  It must not be inferred,  however,  that  we sympathize with  the
attitude of certain people who,  when they have learned with what ease soul-
flights are accomplished,  go about bemoaning the fact that they are now im-
prisoned.  They are constantly thinking of, and longing for,  the  day  when
they  shall be able to leave this mortal coil behind and fly away  in  their
spiritual body.  Such an attitude of mind is decidedly mistaken;  the  great
and  wise Beings who are invisible leaders of our evolution have not  placed
us  here to no purpose.  Valuable lessons are to be learned in this  visible
world wherein we dwell, lessons that cannot be learned in any other realm of
nature,  and the very conditions of density and inertia whereof such  people
complain,  are factors which make it possible to acquire the knowledge  this
world  is designed to give.  This fact was so amply illustrated in a  recent
experience of the writer:

    A  friend had been studying occultism for a number of years but had  not
studied  astrology.  Last year she became aroused to the importance of  this
branch of study as a key to self-knowledge and a means of understanding  the
natures  of others,  also of developing the compassion for their errors,  so
necessary in the cultivation of love for one's neighbor. Love for our neigh-
bor the Savior enjoined  upon us as the Supreme Commandment,  which  is  the


[PAGE 64]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

fulfillment of all laws, and as astrology teaches us to BEAR and FORBEAR, it
helps  as  nothing else can in the development of this supreme  virtue.  She
therefore  joined one of the classes started in Los Angeles by  the  writer,
but a sudden illness quickly ended in death and thus terminated her study of
the subject in the physical body, here it was well begun.

    Upon one of many occasions when she visited the writer subsequent to her
release from the body,  she deplored the fact that it seemed so difficult to
make headway in her study of astrology.  The writer advised continued atten-
dance at the classes,  and suggested that she could surely  get someone  "on
the other side" to help her study.

    At  this she exclaimed impatiently:  "Oh,  yes!  Of course I attend  the
classes. I have done so right along; I have also found a friend who helps me
here.  But you cannot imagine how difficult it is to concentrate  here  upon
mathematical  calculations and the judgment of a horoscope or in  fact  upon
any  subject here,  where every little thought-current takes you miles  away
from  your study.  I used to think it difficult to concentrate when I had  a
physical body,  but it is not a circumstance to the obstacles which face the
student here."

    The physical body was an anchor to her, and it is that to all of us. Be-
ing dense,  it is also to a great extent impervious to disturbing influences
from which the more subtle spiritual bodies do not shield us.  It enables us
to bring our ideas to a logical conclusion with far less effort  at  concen-


[PAGE 65]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

tration  than is necessary in that realm where all is in such incessant  and
turbulent  motion.  Thus we are gradually developing the faculty of  holding
our thoughts to a center by existence in this world, and we should value our
opportunities  here,  rather than deplore the limitations which help in  one
direction more than they fetter in another. In fact, we should never deplore
any condition,  each has its lesson.  If we try to learn what that lesson is
and  to assimilate the experience which may be extracted therefrom,  we  are
wiser than those who waste time in vain regrets.

    We  said  there  is no time in the Desire World,  and  the  reader  will
readily  understand that such must be the case from the fact,  already  men-
tioned, that nothing there is opaque.

    In this world the rotation of the opaque earth upon its axis is  respon-
sible for the alternating conditions of day and night.  We call it DAY  when
the  spot where we live is turned towards the Sun and its rays illumine  our
environment,  but when our home is turned away from the Sun and its rays ob-
structed by the opaque earth we term the resulting darkness NIGHT.  The pas-
sage  of the earth in its orbit around the Sun produces the seasons and  the
year,  which are our divisions of time. But in the Desire World where all is
light there is but one long day. The Spirit is not there fettered by a heavy
physical  body,  so  it  does not need  sleep  and  existence  is  unbroken.
Spiritual  substances are not subject to contraction and expansion  such  as
arise  here  from  heat  and  cold,   hence   summer  and  winter  are  also


[PAGE 66]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

non-existent. Thus there is nothing to differentiate one moment from another
in respect of the conditions of light and darkness, summer and winter, which
mark time for us.   Therefore,   while the so-called "dead"  may have a very
accurate  memory  of time as regards the life they lived here in  the  body,
they are usually unable to tell anything about the chronological relation of
events  which have happened to them in the Desire World,  and it is  a  very
common thing to find that they do not even know how many years have  elapsed
since  they passed out from this plane of existence.  Only students  of  the
stellar  science are able to calculate the passage of time after  their  de-
mise.

      When the occult investigator wishes to study an event in the past his-
tory of man,  he may most readily call up the picture from THE MEMORY OF NA-
TURE,  but if he desires to fix the time of the incident, he will be obliged
to count backwards by the motion of the heavenly bodies. For that purpose he
generally uses the measure provided by the Sun's precession:  each year  the
Sun  crosses the Earth's equator about the twenty-first of March.  Then  day
and night are of even length,  therefore this is called the vernal  equinox.
But on account of a certain wobbling motion (nutation) of the Earth's  axis,
the Sun does not cross over at the same place in the zodiac.  It reaches the
equator a little too early,  it PRECEDES, year by year it moves BACKWARDS  a
little. At the time of the birth of Christ, for instance, the vernal equinox


[PAGE 67]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

was in about seven degrees of the zodiacal sign Aries.  During the two thou-
sand  years which have intervened between that event and the  present  time,
the Sun has moved BACKWARDS about twenty-seven degrees, so that it is now in
about ten degrees of the sign Pisces.  It moves around the circle of the zo-
diac in about 25,868 years. The occult investigator may therefore count back
the number of signs,  or whole circles,  which the Sun has PRECEDED  between
the present day and the time of the event he is investigating.  Thus he  has
by the use of the heavenly time keepers an approximately correct measure  of
time even though he is in the Desire World,  and that is another reason  for
studying the stellar science.


                          THE WORLD OF THOUGHT 

    When we have attained the spiritual development necessary consciously to 
enter the World of Thought and leave the Desire World, which is the realm of 
light and color,   we pass through a condition which the occult investigator 
calls The Great Silence. 

    As previously stated, the higher regions of the Desire World exhibit the 
marked peculiarity of blending form and sound,   but when one passes through 
the Great Silence,   all the world seems to disappear and the Spirit has the 
feeling  of  floating  in  an ocean of intense light,   utterly alone,   yet 
absolutely fearless, because imbued with a sense of its impregnable  securi-
ty, no longer subject to form or sound,  past or future;  all is one eternal 
NOW.


[PAGE 68]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

There  seems to be neither pleasure nor pain and yet there is no absence  of
feeling  but it all seems to center in the one idea:  "I AM!"    The   human
Ego, stands face to face with itself, as it were, and for the time being all
else  is shut out.  This is the experience of anyone who passes that  breach
between the Desire World and the World of Thought, whether involuntarily, in
the  course of an ordinary cyclic pilgrimage of the Spirit,  which we  shall
later elucidate when speaking of the post-mortem existence,  or by an act of
the will,  as in the case of the trained occult investigator;  all have  the
same experience in transition.

    There are two main divisions in the Physical World:  the Chemical Region
and  the Etheric Region.  The World of Thought also has two  great  subdivi-
sions: The Region of Concrete Thought and the Region of Abstract Thought.

    As we specialize the material of the Physical World and shape it into  a
dense body,  and as we form the force-matter of the Desire World into a  de-
sire body, so also do we appropriate a certain amount of mind-stuff from the
Region of Concrete Thought; but we, as Spirits,  clothe ourselves in spirit-
substance  from the Region of Abstract Thought and thereby we  become  indi-
vidual, separate Egos.

                      THE REGION OF CONCRETE THOUGHT

    The  Region of Concrete Thought is neither shadowy nor illusory.  It  is
the acme of reality,  and this world which we mistakenly regard as the  only
verity, is but an evanescent replica of that region.


[PAGE 69]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    A  little reflection will show the reasonableness of this statement  and
prove  our contention that all we see here is really  crystallized  thought.
Our houses,  our machinery, our chairs and tables, all that has been made by
the  hand of man is the embodiment of a thought.  As the juices in the  soft
body of the snail gradually crystallize into the hard and flinty shell which
it  carries  upon its back and which hides it,  so everything  used  in  our
civilization  is  a  concretion of  invisible,  intangible  mind-stuff.  The
thought of James Watt in time congealed into a steam engine and  revolution-
ized the world.   Edison's thought was condensed into an electric  generator
which has turned night to day,  and had it not been for the thought of Morse
and Marconi,  the telegraph would not have annihilated distances as it  does
today.  An earthquake may wreck a city and demolish the lighting  plant  and
telegraph station,  but the thoughts of Watt, Edison, and Morse remain,  and
upon  the  basis  of their indestructible ideas new machinery  may  be  con-
structed  and  operations resumed.  Thus thoughts are  more  permanent  than
things.

    The  sensitive ear of the musician detects a certain musical note in  e-
very  city which is different from that of another city.  He hears  in  each
little brook a new melody,  and to him the sough of wind in the treetops  of
different forests gives a varying sound.    In the Desire World we noted the
existence  of forms similar to the shapes of things here,  also  that  seem-
ingly SOUND PROCEEDS FROM FORM.  But in the Region of Concrete Thought it is


[PAGE 70]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

different,  for while each form occupies and obscures a certain space  here,
form  is nonexistent when viewed from the standpoint of the Region  of  Con-
crete Thought.  Where the form was, a transparent vacuous space is  observa-
ble.   FROM THAT EMPTY VOID COMES A SOUND which is the  "keynote"  that cre-
ates and maintains the form whence it APPEARS to come,  as the almost invis-
ible core of a gas-flame is the source of the light we perceive.

    Sound from a vacuum cannot be heard in the Physical World,  but the har-
mony  which  proceeds from the vacuous cavity of a  celestial  ARCHETYPE  is
"the Voice of the Silence,"  and  it becomes audible when all earthly sounds
have ceased.  Elijah heard it not while the storm was raging;  nor was it in
evidence during the turbulence of the earthquake,  nor in the crackling  and
roaring fire, but when the destructive and inharmonious sounds of this world
had melted into silence,  "the still small voice"  issued  its  commands  to
save Elijah's life.

    That  "keynote"  is a direct manifestation of the Higher Self which uses
it to impress and govern the personality it has created. But, alas,  part of
its  life  has been infused into the material side of its being,  which  has
thus obtained a certain will of its own and only too often are the two sides
of our nature at war.

    At  last there comes a time when the Spirit is too weary to strive  with
the recalcitrant flesh; when "the Voice of the  Silence"  ceases.  No matter


[PAGE 71]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

how much earthly nourishment we may seek to give,  it will not avail to sus-
tain a form when this harmonious sound,  this  "word from heaven"  no longer
reverberates through the empty void of the celestial archetype.   "Man lives
not by bread alone,"  but by the WORD,   and the last sound-vibration of the
"keynote" is the death-knell of the physical body.

    In  this world we are compelled to investigate and to study a thing  be-
fore we know about it,  and although the facilities for gaining  information
are in some respects much greater in the Desire World,  a certain amount  of
investigation is necessary, nevertheless, to acquire knowledge. In the World
of Thought, on the contrary, it is different. When we wish to know about any
certain  thing there,  and we turn our attention thereto,  then  that  thing
speaks to us,  as it were.  The sound it emits at once gives us a most lumi-
nous comprehension of every phase of its nature.  We attain to a realization
of its past history;  the whole story of its unfoldment is laid bare and  we
seem to have lived through all of those experiences together with the  thing
we are investigating.

    Were it not for one enormous difficulty,  the story thus obtained  would
be exceedingly valuable; but all this information, this life-picture,  flows
in upon us with an enormous rapidity,  in a moment,  in the twinkling of  an
eye, so that it has neither beginning nor end, for, as said, in the World of
Thought, all is one great NOW; TIME does not exist.


[PAGE 72]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Therefore,  when  we  want  to use the  archetypal  information  in  the
Physical  World,  we must disentangle and arrange it in chronological  order
with beginning and ending before it becomes intelligible to beings living in
a realm where TIME is a prime factor. That rearrangement is a most difficult
task as all words are coined with relation to the three dimensions of  space
and the evanescent unit of time, the fleeting moment, hence much of that in-
formation remains unavailable.

    Among  the denizens of this Region of Concrete Thought we may note  par-
ticularly two classes. One is called the Powers of Darkness by Paul, and the
mystic  investigator of the Western World knows them as Lords of Mind.  They
were human at the time when the Earth was in a condition of darkness such as
worlds-in-the-making  go through before they become luminous and  reach  the
firemist-stage.  At that time we were in our mineral evolution.  That is  to
say:  the human Spirit which has now awakened was encrusted in the  ball  of
mindstuff,  which was then the Earth. At that time the present human Spirits
were as much asleep as is the life which ensouls our minerals of today,  and
as we are working with the mineral chemical constituents of the earth, mold-
ing them into houses, railways, steamboats, chairs, etc., etc., so those Be-
ings,  who are now Lords of Mind, worked with us when we were  mineral-like.
They have since advanced three steps,  through stages similar to that of the
Angels and Archangels,  before they attained their present position and  be-
came creative Intelligences.  They are expert builders of mind-stuff,  as we
are  builders  of the present mineral substances,  and therefore  they  have
given  us necessary help to acquire a mind which is the highest  development
of the human being.


[PAGE 73]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    According  to the foregoing explanation it seems to be an  anomaly  when
Paul speaks of them as evil and exhorts us to withstand them. The difficulty
disappears,  however, when we understand that good and evil are but relative
qualities. An illustration will make the point clear: Let us suppose that an
expert organ builder has constructed a wonderful organ, a masterpiece.  Then
he  has followed his vocation in the proper manner,  and is therefore to  be
commended  for  the good which he has done.  But if he is not  satisfied  to
leave well enough alone,  if he refuses to give up his product to the  musi-
cian  who understands how to play upon the instrument,  if he  intrudes  his
presence  into the concert hall,  he is out of place and to be  censured  as
evil.  Similarly the Lords of Mind did the greatest possible service to  hu-
manity when they helped us to acquire our mind,  but many subtle thought in-
fluences come from them,  and are to be resisted,  as Paul very properly em-
phasizes.

    The other class of beings which must be mentioned are called  Archetypal
Forces by the Western School of occultism.  They direct the energies of  the
creative archetypes native to this realm.  They are a composite class of be-
ings of many different grades of intelligence, and there is one stage in the
cyclic journey of the human Spirit when that also labors in, and is part of,
that great host of beings. For the human Spirit is also destined to become a


[PAGE 74]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

great creative Intelligence at some future time, and if there were no school
wherein  it  could gradually learn to create, it would not be  able  to  ad-
vance,  for nothing in nature is done suddenly. An acorn planted in the soil
does not become a majestic oak overnight,  but many years of slow,  persist-
ent  growth are required before it attains to the stature of a giant of  the
forest.  A man does not become an Angel by the mere fact of dying and enter-
ing  a  new world any more than an animal advances to be a man by  the  same
process.   But in time all that lives, mounts the ladder of Being  from  the
clod to the God.  There is no limitation possible to the Spirit,  and so  at
various  stages in its unfoldment the human Spirit works with the other  na-
ture forces,  according to the stage of intelligence which it has  attained.
It creates, changes, and remodels the Earth upon which it is to live.  Thus,
under the great Law of Cause and Effect,  which we observe in every realm of
nature,  it reaps upon earth what it has sown in heaven, and vice versa.  It
grows slowly but persistently and advances continually.


                      THE REGION OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT

    Various  religious  systems  have been given to  humanity  at  different
times,  each suited to meet the spiritual needs of the people among whom  it
was promulgated, and, coming from the same divine source: God; all religions
exhibit similar fundamentals of first principles.


[PAGE 75]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    All  systems teach that there was a time when DARKNESS reigned  supreme.
Everything which we now perceive was then non-existent. Earth, sky,  and the
heavenly  bodies were uncreated,  so were the multitudinous forms which live
and move upon the various planets. All, all,  was yet in a fluidic condition
and the Universal Spirit brooded QUIESCENT in limitless Space as the One Ex-
istence.

    The Greeks called that condition  of  homogeneity  CHAOS,  and the state
of  orderly segregation which we now see:  the marching orbs which  illumine
the  vaulted canopy of heaven,  the stately procession of planets  around  a
central light,  the majestic Sun,  the unbroken sequence of the seasons  and
the unvarying alternation of tidal ebb and flow--all this aggregate of  sys-
tematic order was called  COSMOS,  and  was  supposed to have proceeded from
Chaos.

    The  Christian Mystic obtains a deeper comprehension when he  opens  his
Bible  and  ponders  the  first five verses of that  brightest  gem  of  all
spiritual ore: the gospel of St. John.

    As  he reverently opens his aspiring heart to acquire  understanding  of
those sublime mystical teachings he transcends the form-side of nature, com-
prising  various realms of which we have been speaking,  and  finds  himself
"in the spirit,"  as  did the prophets in olden times. He is then in the Re-
gion  of Abstract Thought and sees the eternal verities which also Paul  be-
held in this, the Third Heaven.


[PAGE 76]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

      For those among us who are unable to obtain knowledge save by  reason-
ing upon the matter,  however, it will be necessary to examine the fundamen-
tal meaning of words used by St. John to clothe his wonderful teachings.  It
was  originally given in the Greek language,  a much simpler matter than  is
commonly supposed, for Greek words have been freely introduced into our mod-
ern languages,  particularly in scientific terms, and we shall show how this
ancient teaching is supported by the latest discoveries of modern science.

    The opening verse of the Gospel of St. John is as follows:   "In the BE-
GINNING was the WORD and the WORD was with GOD,  and the WORD was  GOD."  We
will  examine  the  words:  "beginning,"  "Word,"  and "God."    We may also
note that in the Greek version the concluding sentence reads:  "and  God was
the Word," a difference which makes a great distinction.

    It is an axiomatic truth that  "out of nothing, nothing comes,"   and it
has often been asserted by scoffers that the Bible teaches generation  "from
nothing."  We readily agree that TRANSLATIONS into the modern languages pro-
mulgate  this  erroneous doctrine,  but we have  shown  in  THE  ROSICRUCIAN
COSMO-CONCEPTION (chapter on  "The  Occult Analysis of Genesis"),  that  the
Hebrew  text  speaks of an EVER-EXISTING essence, as the  basis  whence  all
forms,  the Earth and the heavenly lights included, were first created,  and
John also gives the same teaching.

    The Greek word  ARCHE,  in  the  opening  sentence of the Gospel of  St.
John has been translated  THE BEGINNING,  and  it  may be said to have mean-
ing, but it also has other valid interpretations, vastly more significant of
the idea John wished to convey. It means:  an elementary condition,  a chief
source, a first principle, primordial matter.


[PAGE 77]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    There was a time when science insisted that the elements were immutable,
that  is  to say,  that an atom of iron had been an atom of iron  since  the
earth  was  formed and would so remain to the end of time.   The  alchemists
were  sneered at as fanciful dreamers or madmen,  but since PRofessor J.  J.
Thomson's  discovery  of the electron,  the atomic theory of matter,  is  no
longer  tenable.   The principle of radio-activity has later vindicated  the
alchemists.   Science and the Bible agree in teaching that all that  is  has
been formed from one homogeneous substance.

    It is that basic principle which  John  called  ARCHE:   primordial mat-
ter,  and the dictionary defines archeology as:   "the science of the origin
(ARCHE) of things."  Masons style God the  "Grand Architect,"  for the Greek
word tekton means builder,  and God is the Chief Builder (TEKTON) of  ARCHE,
the primordial virgin matter which is also the chief source of all things.

    Thus we see that when the opening  sentence of St.  John's Gospel is pro
perly  translated,  our Christian religion teaches that once a  virgin  sub-
stance enfolded the divine Thinker: God.

    That is the identical condition which the earlier Greeks called Chaos. A
little  thought  will make it evident that we are not arbitrary  in  finding
fault with the translation of the gospel, for it is self-evident that a word


[PAGE 78]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

cannot be the beginning, a thought must precede the word, and a thinker must
originate thought before it can be expressed as a word. When properly trans-
lated the teaching of John fully embodies  that  idea,  for  the Greek  term
LOGOS   means  both the reasonable thought (we also say logic) and the  word
which expresses this (logical) thought.

    1)  In the primordial substance was thought,  and the thought  was  with
        God, And God was the word,

    2) That (The Word), also was with God in the primal state.

    Later the divine WORD, the Creative Fiat, reverberates through space and
segregates the homogeneous virgin substance into separate forms.

    3) Every thing has come into existence because of that prime fact,  (The
    Word of God), and no thing exists apart from that fact.

    4) In that was Life.

    In the alphabet we have a few elementary sounds from which words may  be
constructed.  They are basic elements of expression,  as bricks,  iron,  and
lumber are raw materials of architecture, music, literature, or poetry,  but
the  contour of the finished product and the purpose it will  serve  depends
upon  the  arrangement  of  the  raw materials,  which  is  subject  to  the
constructor's design.

    But a heap of bricks,  iron,  and lumber,  is not a house,  neither is a
jumbled mass of notes music, nor can we call a haphazard arrangement of  al-
phabetical sounds a word.  These raw materials are prime necessities in con-
struction of architecture,  music, literature, or poetry, but the contour of
the  finished  product  and  the  purpose  is  will  serve  depends upon the


[PAGE 79]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

arrangement of the raw materials,  which is subject to the constructor's de-
sign.   Building materials may be formed into prison or palace; notes may be
arranged as fanfare or funeral dirge;  words may be indicted to inspire pas-
sion  or  peace,  all according to the will of the  designer.  So  also  the
majestic  rhythm  of  the  Word of God has  wrought  the  primal  substance,
ARCHE,  into  the  multitudinous  forms which comprise the phenomenal world,
according to His will.

    Did  the reader ever stop to consider the wonderful power of  the  human
word?  Coming to us in the sweet accents of love,  it may lure us from paths
of  rectitude  to shameful ignominy and wreck our life with sorrow  and  re-
morse,  or it may spur us on in noblest efforts to acquire glory and  honor,
here  or  hereafter.  According to the inflection of the voice  a  word  may
strike terror into the bravest heart or lull a timid child to peaceful slum-
ber. The word of an agitator may rouse the passions of a mob and impel it to
awful bloodshed,  as in the French Revolution, where dictatorial mandates of
mob-rule  killed  and exiled at pleasure, or,  the strain of   "Home,  Sweet
Home"   may cement the setting of a family-circle beyond possibility of rup-
ture.

    Right  words are true and therefore free;  they are never bound or  fet-
tered by time or space;  they go to farthest corners of earth,  and when the
lips  that  spoke them first have long since  moldered in the  grave,  other
voices take up with unwearying enthusiasm their message of life and love, as
for instance,  the mystical  "Come unto me"   which has sounded from  unnum-
bered tongues and brought oceans of balm to troubled hearts.


[PAGE 80]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Words  of peace have been victorious where war would have meant  defeat,
and  no  talent is more to be desired than ability always to say  the  right
word  at the auspicious time.    
    Considering thus the immense power and potency of the human word, we may
perhaps dimly apprehend the potential magnitude of the Word of God, the Cre-
ative Fiat, when,  as a mighty dynamic force it  first  reverberated through
space and commenced to form primordial  matter into worlds, as  sound from a
violin bow molds sand into geometrical figures. Moreover,  THE WORD  OF  GOD
STILL SOUNDS to sustain the marching orbs and impel them  onwards  in  their
circle paths;  the Creative Word continues to produce forms of gradually in-
creasing efficiency,  as media expressing life and consciousness.  The  har-
monious enunciation of consecutive syllables  in  the Divine  Creative  Word
mark successive stages in the evolution of  the  world  and  man.  When  the
last syllable has been spoken and the complete word  has  sounded,  we shall
have reached perfection as human beings. Then TIME will be at  an  end,  and
with the last vibration of the Word of God, the worlds will be resolved into
their original elements.  Our life will then be  "hid  with  Christ in God,"
until the Cosmic Night, Chaos, is over,  and we wake to  do "greater things"
in a "new heaven and a new earth."


[PAGE 81]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

    According  to the general idea Chaos and Cosmos  are  superlative  anti-
theses of each other. Chaos being regarded as a past condition of  confusion
and disorder which has long since been entirely superseded by the cosmic or-
der which now prevails.

    As a matter of fact,  Chaos is the seed-ground of Cosmos,  the basis  of
all progress, for thence come all IDEAS which later materialize as railways,
computers,  telephones,  etc.

    We  speak  of thoughts as being  "conceived by the mind,"  but  as  both
father and mother are necessary in the generation of a  child, so also there
must be both IDEA and MIND before a THOUGHT can  be conceived. As semen ger-
minated in the positive male organ is projected into the negative  uterus at
conception,  so ideas are generated by a positive human Ego in  the  spirit-
substance of the Region of Abstract Thought. This idea is projected upon the
receptive mind, and a conception takes place. Then, as the spermatozoic  nu-
cleus draws upon the maternal body for material to  shape a body appropriate
to its individual expression,  so does each idea clothe itself in a peculiar
form of mind-stuff. It is then a thought, as visible to the  inner vision of
composite man as a child is to its parent.

    Thus   we   see   that  ideas  are   embryonic   thoughts,   nuclei   of
spirit-substance from the Region of Abstract Thought.  Improperly  conceived
in a diseased mind they become vagaries and delusions,  but when gestated in
a sound mind and formed into rational thoughts they are the basis of all the
material, moral,  and mental progress. The closer our touch with Chaos,  the
better will be our Cosmos,  for in that realm of abstract realities truth is
not obscured by matter, it is self-evident.


[PAGE 82]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

      Pilate asked "What is Truth?" but no answer is recorded.    We are in-
capable  of cognizing truth in the abstract while we live in the  phenomenal
world,  for the inherent nature of matter is illusion and delusion,  and  we
are constantly making allowances and corrections whether we are conscious of
the  fact or not.  The sunbeam which proceeds for 90 millions of miles in  a
straight  line  is refracted or bent as soon as it strikes our  dense  atmo-
sphere, and according to the angle of its refraction, it APPEARS to have one
color or another. The straightest stick appears crooked when partly immersed
in water,  and the truths which are so self-evident in the higher worlds are
likewise obscured,  refracted or twisted out of all semblance under the  il-
lusory conditions of this material world.

    "The truth shall set you free,"  said Christ,   and the more we turn our
aspirations from material acquisitiveness and seek to lay up treasure above,
the  more  we aim to rise,  the oftener we  "get in the spirit,"   the  more
readily  we  "shall know truth"  and reach  liberation  from the  fetter  of
flesh  which binds us to a limited environment,  and attain to a  sphere  of
greater usefulness.

    Study of philosophy and science has a tendency to further perception  of
truth,  and  as  science has progressed it has gradually  receded  from  its
erstwhile  crude materialism.  The day is not far off when it will  be  more
reverently  religious  than the church itself.  Mathematics is  said  to  be


[PAGE 83]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

"dry,"  for it does not stir the emotions.  When  it is taught that "the sum
of  the  angles of a triangle is 180 degrees,"   the dictum is at  once  ac-
cepted,  because its truth is self-evident and no feeling is involved in the
matter.  But  when  a doctrine such as the  Immaculate  Conception  is  pro-
mulgated and our emotions are stirred, bloody war,  or heated argument,  may
result,  and still leave the matter in doubt.  Pythagoras demanded that  his
pupils  study mathematics,  because he knew the elevating effect of  raising
their  minds above the sphere of feeling,  where it is subject to  delusion,
and  elevating it towards the Region of Abstract Thought which is the  prime
reality.

    In this place we are dealing with worlds in particular,  and will there-
fore defer comment upon the remainder of the first five verse of St.  John's
Gospel:

                       And Life became Light in man,
                  5)   and Light shines in Darkness.

    We have now seen that the Earth is composed of three worlds which inter-
penetrate  one  another so that it is perfectly true when Christ  said  that
"heaven  is  within  you"  or,   as   the  translation  should  rather  have
been, AMONG YOU.   We  have  also  seen that of these three realms  two  are
subdivided.  It  has also been explained that each division serves  a  great
purpose  in the unfoldment of various forms of life which dwell in  each  of
these worlds,  and we may note in conclusion,  that the lower regions of the
Desire  World constitute what  the  Catholic  religion  calls  PURGATORY,  a


[PAGE 84]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

place  where the evil of a past life is transmuted to good,  usable  by  the
Spirit as conscience in later lives.  The higher regions of the Desire World
are the  FIRST HEAVEN  where  all  the good a man has done is assimilated by
the Spirit as SOUL power.  The  Region  of  Concrete  Thought is  the SECOND
HEAVEN,  where,  as already said, the Spirit prepares its future environment
on Earth, and the Region of Abstract Thought is the  THIRD  HEAVEN,  but  as
Paul said, it is scarcely lawful to speak about that.

    Some will ask:  Is there then no hell?   No!  THE MERCY OF GOD tends  as
greatly towards the principle of GOOD AS THE INHUMANITY OF MAN towards  cru-
elty,  so  that he would consign his brother men to flames  of  hell  during
eternity for the puerile mistakes committed during a few years,  or  perhaps
for  a slight difference in belief.  The writer has heard of a minister  who
wished  to  impress his "flock"  with  the  reality of an eternity  of  hell
flames,  and to demonstrate the fallacy of a heretical notion entertained by
some  of his parishioners:  that when sinners go to hell they burn to  ashes
and that is the end.

    He took with him an alcohol lamp  and some asbestos into  the pulpit and
told  his audience that God would turn their souls into a  substance  resem-
bling asbestos. He showed them that thought the asbestos were heated red hot
it did not decompose into ashes.  Fortunately,  the day of the hell preacher
has  gone by,  and if we believe the Bible which says that  "in God we  live
and move and have our being,"  we  can  readily  understand that A LOST SOUL


[PAGE 85]                               THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WORLDS

WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBILITY,  for  were  one single soul (Spirit)  lost,  then
logically a part of God Himself would be lost. No matter what our color, our
race,  or  our  creed,  we are all equally the children of God  and  in  our
various ways we shall obtain satisfaction.  Let us therefore rather look  to
Christ and forget creed.


                              CREED OR CHRIST?

No man loves God who hates his king;
    Who tramples on his brother's heart and soul,
Who seeks to shackle, cloud, or fog the mind
    By fears of Hell has not perceived our goal.

God-sent are all religions blest;
    And Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life,
TO Give the heavy-laden rest,
    And peace from sorrow, sin, and strife.

At his request the Universal Spirit came
    TO ALL THE CHURCHES, not to one alone;
On Pentecostal morn a tongue of flame
    Round EACH apostle as a halo shone.

Since then, as vultures ravenous with greed,
    We oft have battled for an empty name,
And sought by dogma, edict, creed,
    To send each other to the flame.

Is Christ then twain?  Was Cephas, Paul
    To save the world, nailed to the tree?
Then why divisions here at all?
    Christ's love enfolds both you and me.


[PAGE 86]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

His pure sweet love is not confined
    By creeds which segregate and raise a wall,
His love enfolds, embraces HUMAN KIND,
    No matter what ourselves of Him we call.

Then why not take Him at His word?
    Why hold to creeds which tear apart?
But one thing matters, be it heard,
    That brother-love fill every heart.

There`s but one thing the world has need to know;
    There`s but one balm for all our human woe.
There`s but one way that leads to heaven above--
    That way is human sympathy and love.

                                 CHAPTER IV

                           THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN

                        VITAL BODY--DESIRE BODY--MIND

    Our chapter head,  "The Constitution of Man,"  may surprise a reader who
has not previously studied the Mystery Teachings,  or he may imagine that we
intend  to give an anatomical dissertation, but such is not  our  intention.
We  have  spoken of the Earth upon which we live as being  composed  of  se-
veral invisible realms in addition to the world we perceive by means of  our
senses.  We  have also spoken of man as being correlated  to  these  various
divisions in nature, and a little thought upon the subject will quickly con-
vince us that in order to function upon the various planes of existence  de-
scribed,  it  is necessary that a man should have a body composed  of  their
substance,  or at least have specialized for his or her own use, some of the
material of each of these worlds.

    We have said that finer matter, called desire-stuff and mind-stuff, per-
meates our atmosphere and the solid Earth,  even as blood percolates through
all parts of our flesh.  But that is not a sufficient explanation to account
for all facts of life. If that were all, then minerals,  which are interpen-
etrated by the World of Thought and the World of Desire, would have thoughts
and  desires as well as man.  This is not the case,  so something more  than
mere interpenetration must be requisite to acquire the faculties of  thought
and feeling.


[PAGE 88]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    We know that in order to function in this world,  to live as a  physical
being  among other like beings,  we must have a physical body all  our  own,
built of the chemical constituents of this visible world. When we lose it at
death,  it  profits  us  nothing that the world is full  of  just  the  very
chemicals needed to build such a body.  We cannot then specialize them,  and
therefore we are invisible to all others. Similarly, if we did not possess a
special  body made of ether,  we should be unable to grow and to  propagate.
That  is  the case with the mineral.  Had we no separate  individual  desire
body,  we should be unable to feel desires and emotions,  there would be  no
incentive to move from one place to another. We should then be stationary as
plants,  and did we not possess a mind,  we should be incapable of  thought,
and act upon impulse and instinct as animals do.

    Some one may of course object to  this last statement,  and contend that
animals do think.  So far  as our domesticated animals are concerned that is
partially true, but it is not quite in the same way that we  think  and rea-
son.  The difference may  perhaps best  be  understood if we  take  an illu-
stration from the  electrical  field. When an electric current OF HIGH VOLT-
AGE is passed through a coiled  copper wire,  and  another wire is placed in
the center of the coils, that wire will become charged with electricity OF A
LOWER VOLTAGE; so also the animal, when brought  within  the sphere of human
thoughts, evolves a mental activity of a lower order.


[PAGE 89]                                            THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN

    Paul,  in his writings, also mentions the NATURAL BODY and the SPIRITUAL
BODY  while the man himself is a Spirit inhabiting those vehicles.  We  will
briefly note the constitution of the various bodies of man invisible to  the
physical sight but as objective to spiritual sight as the dense body to  or-
dinary vision.


                            THE VITAL BODY

    That  body of ours is composed of ether  is  called  the  VITAL BODY  in
Western Mystery Schools,  for, as we have already seen,  ether is the avenue
of ingress for vital force from the Sun and the field of agencies in  nature
which promote such vital activities as assimilation,  growth,  and  propaga-
tion.

    This vehicle is an exact counterpart of our visible body,  molecule  for
molecule,  and  organ for organ,  with one exception,  which we  shall  note
later.  But it is slightly larger, extending about one and  one-half  inches
beyond the periphery of our dense vehicle.

    The  spleen is the entrance gate of forces which vitalize the  body.  In
the  etheric counterpart of that organ solar energy is transmuted  to  vital
fluid of a pale rose color.  Thence it spreads all over the nervous  system,
and  after  having  been used in the body it radiates in  streams,  much  as
bristles protrude from a porcupine.

    The rays of the Sun are transmitted either directly, or reflected by way
of the planets and the Moon.  The rays directly from the Sun give  spiritual
illumination;  the  rays perceived by way of the  planets  produce  intelli-
gence, morality, and soul growth,  but the rays reflected by way of the Moon


[PAGE 90]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

make  for  physical growth as seen in the case of plants,  which  grow  dif-
ferently  when planted in the light of the Moon from what is the  case  when
they are planted when the Moon is dark. There is also a difference in plants
sown when the Moon is in barren and fruitful signs of the Zodiac.

    The solar ray is absorbed by the human Spirit which has its seat in  the
center of the forehead;  the stellar ray is absorbed by the brain and spinal
cord; and the lunar ray enters our system through the spleen.

    The solar, stellar, and lunar rays are all three-colored, and in the lu-
nar which supplies our vital force, the blue beam is the life of the FATHER,
which cause germination;  the yellow beam is the life of the SON,  which  is
the  active principle in nutrition and growth; and the red beam is the  life
of  the  HOLY SPIRIT,  which stimulates to action,  dissipating  the  energy
stored  by the yellow force.  This principle is particularly active in  gen-
eration.

    The  various kingdoms absorb this life-force differently,  according  to
their constitution.  Animals have only 28 pairs of spinal nerves.  They  are
keyed  to  the lunar month of 28 days and therefore dependent upon  a  Group
Spirit  for an infusion of stellar rays necessary to produce  consciousness.
They are altogether incapable of absorbing the direct ray of the Sun.

    Man  is in a transition stage,  he has 31 pairs of spinal  nerves  which
keys him to the solar month,  but  the  nerves in the so-called cauda-equina


[PAGE 91]                                            THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN

(literally, horse-tail) at the end of our spinal cord are still too undevel-
oped to act as avenues for the spiritual ray of the Sun. In proportion as we
draw our creative force upward by spiritual thought we develop these  nerves
and awaken dormant faculties of the Spirit.  But it is dangerous to  attempt
that  development  except  under guidance of a qualified  teacher,  and  the
reader  is  earnestly warned not to use any method published in  books,  nor
sold, for their practice usually leads to insanity. The safe method is never
sold  for money or any earthly consideration however large or small;  it  is
always freely given as a reward of  merit.  "Ask and ye shall receive,  seek
and ye shall find,  knock and it shall be opened,"  said the Christ.  If our
life is a prayer for illumination, the search will not be uncertain, nor the
knock without response.

    When  solar  energy has been transmuted in the spleen it  traverses  the
whole nervous system of the body,  glowing with a most beautiful color of  a
delicate rosy hue. It answers the same purpose as electricity in a telegraph
system.  We may string wires between cities,  erect telegraph stations,  in-
stall  receivers and transmitters.  We may even have operators ready at  the
keys,  but until electric fluid is turned into our wires, the telegraph keys
will refuse to click.

    So also in the body, the human Spirit is operator,  and from the central
station of the brain,  nerves ramify,  go through the whole body to all  the
different muscles.  When this vitalizing fluid of which we are speaking tra-
verses the nervous system,  the Ego may send his commands to the muscles and


[PAGE 92]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

cause them to move, but if the vital fluid for any reason does not flow into
a certain part of the body such as an arm or a limb,  then the Spirit is po-
werless to move that part of the body and we say that it is paralyzed.

    When we are in health,  we specialize solar energy in such great quanti-
ties that we cannot use it all in the body and therefore it radiates through
the pores of our skin in straight streams and serves a similar purpose as an
exhaust fan.  That machine drives the foul air out of a room or building and
keeps the atmosphere within pure and sweet.  The excessive vital force which
radiates from the body drives out poisonous gases, deleterious microbes, and
effete matter,  thus tending to preserve a healthy condition.  It also  pre-
vents armies of disease germs, which swarm about in the atmosphere, from en-
tering, upon the same principle that a fly cannot wing its way into a build-
ing through the exhaust fan.  Thus it serves a most beneficent purpose  even
after it has been utilized in our body and is returning to the free state.

    It  is a curious and most astounding sight when one first observes  how,
from exposed parts of the body such as hands and face,  there suddenly  com-
mences to flow a stream of stars, cubes,  pyramids,  and a variety of  other
geometrical  forms.  The writer has more than once rubbed his eyes  when  he
first perceived the phenomenon, for it seemed that he must be suffering from
hallucinations.  The forms observed are chemical atoms, however,  which have
served their purpose in the body and are expelled through the pores.


[PAGE 93]                                            THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN

    When one has eaten a meal,  vital fluid is consumed by the body in great
quantities, for it is the cement whereby nature's forces build our food into
the body.  Therefore the radiations are weakest during the period of  diges-
tion.  If  the  meal  has been heavy, the outflow is very perceptibly dimin-
ished, and does not then cleanse our body as thoroughly as when the food has
been digested,  nor  are  the  radiations as potent in keeping out  inimical
germs. Therefore one is most liable to catch cold or other diseases by over-
eating.

    During  ill health the vital body specializes but little  solar  energy.
Then,  for a time, the visible body seems to feed upon the vital body, as it
were,  so  that the vehicle becomes more transparent and attenuated  at  the
same rate as the visible body exhibits a state of emaciation.  The cleansing
odic radiations are almost entirely absent during sickness,  therefore  com-
plications set in easily.

     Though science has not directly observed this vital body of man, it has
upon several occasions postulated the existence of such a vehicle as  neces-
sary to account for facts in life, and the radiations have been observed  by
a  number  of scientists at different times and  under  varying  conditions.
Blondlot  and Charpentier have called them N-rays after the city  of  Nantes
where  the radiations were observed by these scientists;  others have  named
them  "The Odic fluid."  Scientific  investigators  who have  conducted  re-
searches into psychic phenomena have even photographed  it  when it has been
                                                         

[PAGE 94]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

extracted through the spleen by materializing Spirits.  Dr.  Hotz,  for  in-
stance, obtained two photographs of a materialization through the German me-
dium, Minna-Demmler.  On one a cloud of ether is seen oozing out through the
left side of the medium,  shapeless and without form.   The second  picture,
taken  a few moments later,  shows the materialized Spirit standing  at  the
medium's  side.   Other photographs obtained by scientists from the  Italian
medium, Eusapio Palladino, show a luminous cloud over-hanging her left side.

    We said in the beginning of this description that the vital is an  exact
counterpart of the dense body with one exception: it is of the opposite sex,
or  perhaps we should rather say POLARITY.  As the vital body nourishes  the
dense vehicle,  we may readily understand that blood is its highest  visible
expression,  and also that a positively polarized vital body would  generate
more blood than a negative one.  Woman,  who is physically negative,  has  a
positive  vital body,  hence she generates a surplus of blood which  is  re-
lieved  by  the periodic flow.  She is also more prone to tears,  which  are
white bleeding,  than man,  whose negative vital body does not generate more
blood  than he can comfortably take care of.  Therefore it is not  necessary
for him to have the outlets which relieve excess of blood in woman.


                              THE DESIRE BODY

    In  addition to the visible body and the vital body we also have a  body
made of desire stuff from which we form our feelings and emotions.  This ve-
hicle also impels us to seek sense gratification.  But while the two instru-
ments of which we have already spoken are well organized,  the  desire  body


[PAGE 95]                                            THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN

appears  to  spiritual  sight as an ovoid cloud extending  from  sixteen  to
twenty inches beyond the physical body.  It is above the head and below  the
feet  so that our dense body sits in the center of this egg-shaped cloud  as
the yolk is in the center of an egg.

    The reason for the rudimentary state of this vehicle is that it has been
added  to  the human constitution more recently than the  bodies  previously
mentioned.  Evolution  of  form may be likened to the manner  in  which  the
juices in the snail first condense into flesh and later become a hard shell.
When  our  present  visible body first germinated in the Spirit,  it  was  a
thought-form,  but gradually it has become denser and more concrete until it
is now a chemical crystallization.  The vital body was next emanated by  the
Spirit as a thought-form,  and is in the third stage of concretion which  is
etheric.  The  desire body is a still later acquisition.  That  also  was  a
thought-form  at its inception,  but has now condensed to desire-stuff,  and
the mind,  which we have only recently received,  is still but a mere cloudy
thought-form.

    Arms and limbs,  ears and eyes are not necessary to use the desire body,
for it can glide through space more swiftly than wind without such means  of
locomotion as we require in this visible world.

    When viewed by spiritual sight, it appears that there are in this desire
body a number of whirling vortices.  We have already explained that it  is a


[PAGE 96]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

characteristic of desire-stuff to be in constant motion,  and from the  main
vortex in the region of the liver, there is a constant outwelling flow which
radiates  toward  the periphery of this egg-shaped body and returns  to  the
center through a number of other vortices.  The desire body exhibits all the
colors and shades which we know and a vast number of others which are  inde-
scribable in earthly language.  Those colors vary in every person  according
to his or her characteristics and temperament,  and they also vary from  mo-
ment  to moment as passing moods, fancies,  or emotions are  experienced  by
him. There is, however, in each one a certain basic color dependent upon the
ruling  star at the moment of his or her birth.  The man in whose  horoscope
Mars is peculiarly strong usually has a crimson tint in his aura;  where Ju-
piter is the strongest planet the prevailing tint seems to be a bluish tone;
and so on with the other planets.

    There  was a time in the Earth's past history when incrustation was  not
yet  complete,  and human beings of that time lived upon  islands  here  and
there,  amid  boiling seas.  They had not yet evolved eyes or  ears,  but  a
little organ:  the pineal gland, which anatomists have called THE THIRD EYE,
protruded through the back of the head and was a LOCALIZED ORGAN OF FEELING.
It  warned the man when he came too near a volcanic crater and thus  enabled
him to escape destruction.  Since then the cerebral hemispheres have covered
the pineal gland,  and instead of a single organ of feeling,  the whole body
inside  and  out is sensitive to impacts, which of course is a  much  higher
state of development.


[PAGE 97]                                            THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN

    In the desire body every particle is sensitive to vibrations similar  to
those which we call sight,  sounds,  and feelings,  and every particle is in
incessant motion,  rapidly swirling about so that in the same instant it may
be at the top and bottom of the desire body and impart at all points to  all
the other particles a sensation of that which it has experienced. Thus every
particle  of  desire-stuff in this vehicle of ours will instantly  feel  any
sensation experienced by any single particle.  Therefore the desire body  is
of  an exceedingly sensitive nature,  capable of most intense  feelings  and
emotions.


                                 THE MIND

    This is the latest acquisition of the human Spirit,  and in most  people
who have not yet accustomed themselves to orderly,  consecutive thought,  it
is  a mere inchoate cloud disposed particularly in the region of  the  head.
When looking at a person clairvoyantly there appears to be an empty space in
the  center  of the forehead just above and between the eyebrows.  It  looks
like the blue part of a gas flame.  That is mind-stuff which veils the human
Spirit,  or Ego,  and the writer has been told that not even the most gifted
seer can penetrate that veil,  said to have been spoken of in ancient  Egypt
as "THE VEIL OF ISIS."  None  may lift it and live,  for behind that veil is
the Holy of Hollies,  the temple of our body, where the Spirit is to be left
secure from all intrusion.


[PAGE 98]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    To  those  who have not previously studied the deeper  philosophies  the
question may occur:  But why all these divisions? Even the Bible speaks only
of soul and body,  for most people believe soul and Spirit to be  synonymous
terms.  We  can  only answer that this division is  not  arbitrary  but  ne-
cessary,  and founded upon facts in nature.  Neither is it correct to regard
the soul and the Spirit as synonymous.  Paul himself speaks of  the  NATURAL
BODY  which  is composed of physical substances: solids, liquids, gases, and
ethers;  he  mentions  a  SPIRITUAL  BODY, the vehicle of the  Spirit,  com-
posed  of the mind and desire body, and THE SPIRIT ITSELF,  which is  called
EGO in Latin or "I" in English.

    That  term "I"  is  an  application which can be made only by the  human
Spirit of itself. We may all call a dog, dog; or we may call a table, table,
and  any one else may apply the same name to the dog and to the  table,  but
only a human being can be called "I."  Only  he  himself can apply that most
exclusive of all words,  "I,"  for  this is the badge of self-consciousness,
the  recognition  by the human spirit of ITSELF as an entity,  separate  and
apart from all others.

      Thus we see that the constitution of man is more complex than  appears
upon the surface,  and we will now proceed to note the effect upon this mul-
tiplex being of various conditions of life.


[PAGE 99]                                                     LIFE AND DEATH

                                 CHAPTER V.

                               LIFE AND DEATH

                       INVISIBLE HELPERS AND MEDIUMS

    There are two classes of people in the world. In one class the vital and
dense bodies are so firmly cemented that the ethers cannot be extracted  un-
der any circumstances but remain with the dense body at all times and  under
all  conditions  from  birth to death. Those people are  insensible  to  any
supersensuous sights or sounds. They are therefore usually exceedingly skep-
tical, and believe nothing exists but what THEY can see.

    There  is  another class of people in whom the  connection  between  the
dense and the vital bodies is more or less loose, so that the ether of their
vital  bodies vibrates at a higher rate than in the first  class  mentioned.
These people are therefore more or less sensitive to the spiritual world.

    This class of sensitives may again be divided. Some are weak characters,
dominated by the will of others in a NEGATIVE manner,  as mediums,  who  are
the  prey of disembodied Spirits desirous of obtaining a physical body  when
they have lost their own by death.

    The  other  class of sensitives are strong POSITIVE characters  who  act
only from within, according to their own will. They may develop into trained
clairvoyants,  and be their own masters instead of slaves of  a  disembodied
Spirit. In some sensitives of both classes it is possible to extract part of


[PAGE 100]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

the  ether which forms the vital body.  When a disembodied Spirit obtains  a
subject of that nature, it develops the sensitive as a MATERIALIZING MEDIUM.
The  man who is capable of extracting his own vital body by an act of  will,
becomes  a citizen of two worlds, independent and free.  These  are  usually
known  as  INVISIBLE HELPERS.  There are certain other  abnormal  conditions
where the vital body and the dense body are separated totally or in part, as
for instance, if we place our limb in an uncomfortable position so that cir-
culation of the blood ceases.  Then we may see the etheric limb hanging down
below the visible limb as a stocking.  When we restore  circulation and  the
etheric  limb  seeks to enter into place,  an intense prickly  sensation  is
felt,  due to the fact that the little streams of force,  which radiate  all
through the ether,  seek to permeate the molecules of the limb and stir them
into  renewed  vibration.  When a person is drowning,  the vital  body  also
separates  from the dense vehicle and the intense prickly pain  incident  to
resuscitation is also due to the cause mentioned.

    While  we are awake and going about our work in the Physical World,  the
desire body and mind both permeate the dense and the vital bodies, and there
is  a constant war between the desire nature and the vital body.  The  vital
body is continually engaged in building up the human organism, while the im-
pulses of the desire body tend to tire and to break down tissue.  Gradually,
in  the course of the day, the vital body loses ground before the onslaughts


[PAGE 101]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

of the desire body,  poisons of decay slowly accumulate, and the flow of vi-
tal fluid becomes more and more sluggish until at length it is incapable  of
moving the muscles.  The body then feels heavy and drowsy. At last the vital
body collapses,  as it were; the little streams of force which permeate each
atom  seem to shrivel up,  and the Ego is forced to abandon its body to  the
restorative powers of sleep.

    When  a  building becomes dilapidated and is to be RESTORED and  put  in
thorough  repair,  the tenants must move out to let the workmen have a  free
field.  So also when the building of a Spirit has become unfit  for  further
use, it must withdraw therefrom. As the desire body caused the damage, it is
a logical conclusion that it also must be removed. Every night when our body
has become tired,  the higher vehicles are withdrawn, only the dense and vi-
tal bodies being left upon the bed.

      Then  the process of restoration commences and lasts for a  longer  or
shorter time according to circumstances.

      At  times,  however,  the grip of the desire body upon our denser  ve-
hicles is so strong that it refuses to let go.  When it has become so inter-
ested in the proceedings of the day, it continues to ruminate over them  af-
ter  the collapse of the physical body,  and is perhaps only half  extracted
from  that vehicle.   Then it may transmit sights and sounds of  the  Desire
World to the brain. But, as the connections are necessarily askew under such
conditions, the most confused dreams result. Furthermore, as the desire body


[PAGE 102]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

compels  motion,  the dense body is very apt to toss about when  the  desire
body is not fully extracted; hence the restless sleep which usually accompa-
nies dreams of a confused nature.

    There are times, of course, when dreams are prophetic and come true, but
such dreams result only AFTER complete extraction of the desire body.  Under
circumstances where the Spirit has seen some danger, perhaps,  which may be-
fall, it then impresses the fact upon the brain AT THE MOMENT OF AWAKENING.

    It  also  happens that the Spirit goes upon a soul flight and  omits  to
perform its part of the work of restoration;  then the body will not be  fit
to re-enter in the morning, so it sleeps on. The Spirit may thus roam afield
for  a number of days,  or even weeks,  before it again enters its  physical
body and assumes the normal routine of alternating waking and sleeping. This
condition is called TRANCE,  and  the  Spirit  may  remember upon its return
what it has seen and heard in the super-physical realm,  or it may have for-
gotten,  according  to  the stage of its development and the  depth  of  the
trance  condition.  When the trance is very light,  the  Spirit  is  usually
present in the room where its body lies all the time, and upon its return to
the body it will be able to recount to relatives all they said and did while
its body lay unconscious.  Where the trance is deeper,  the returning Spirit
will  usually be unconscious of what happened around its body,  but may  re-
count experiences from the invisible world.


[PAGE 103]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    A  few  years  ago  a little girl by the name  of  Florence  Bennett  in
Kankakee,  Illinois, fell into such a trance. She returned to the body every
few  days,  but stayed within only a few hours each time,  the whole  trance
lasting three weeks,  more or less.  During the returns to her body she told
relatives  that in her absence she seemed to be in a place inhabited by  all
the people who had died.  But she stated that none of them spoke about dying
and no one among them seemed to realize that they were dead. Among those she
had  seen was a locomotive engineer  who had been  accidentally killed.  His 
body was  mangled in the accident which caused death.  The little girl  per-
ceived him there walking  about minus arms,  and with lesions upon his head,  
all of  which  is in line  with facts usually seen by mystic  investigators.  
Persons who have been hurt in accidents go about thus, until they learn that 
a mere wish to have  their body made whole will supply a new  arm  or  limb;  
for desire-stuff is most quickly and readily molded by thought.

                          
                                 DEATH

    After a longer or shorter time there comes in each life a point when the
experiences  which a Spirit can gain from its present environment have  been
exhausted,  and life terminates in death. Death may be sudden and  seemingly
unexpected,  as for instance by earthquake, upon the battlefield,  or by ac-
cident,  as we call it,  though in reality death is never accidental or  un-
foreseen by Higher Powers.  Not a sparrow falls to the ground without divine


[PAGE 104]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

will.  There are along life's path partings of the way,  as it were;  on one
side the main line of life continues onward,  the other path leads into what
we might call a blind alley. If the man takes the latter path,  it soon ends
in  death.  We are here in life for the sake of gaining experience and  each
life  has a certain harvest to reap.  If we order our life in such a  manner
that we gain the knowledge it is intended we should acquire,  we continue in
life,  and opportunities of different kinds constantly come our way.  But if
we neglect them, and the life goes into paths which are not congruous to our
individual development,  it would be a waste of time to let us stay in  such
an environment. Therefore the great and wise Beings who are behind the scene
of evolution,  terminate our life, that we may  have a fresh start in a dif-
ferent  sphere of influence.  The Law of Conservation of Energy is not  con-
fined  to  the Physical World,  but operates in the spiritual  realms  also.
There  is  nothing in life that has not its purpose.  We do  wrong  to  rail
against circumstances, no matter how disagreeable. We should rather endeavor
to  learn the lessons which are contained therein,  that we may live a  long
and useful life. Some one may object and say:  "You are inconsistent in your
teachings.  You say there is really no death; that we go into a brighter ex-
istence, and that we have to learn other lessons there in a different sphere
of usefulness! Why then aim to live a long life?"


[PAGE 105]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    It is very true that we make these claims,  and they are perfectly  con-
sistent with the other assertions just mentioned. However, there are lessons
to be learned HERE which cannot be learned in the other worlds,  and we have
to  bring  up  this physical body through the useless  years  of  childhood,
through  hot and impulsive youth,  to the ripeness of manhood or  womanhood,
before it becomes of true spiritual use.  The longer we live after  maturity
has been attained,  when we have commenced to look upon the serious side  of
life and started truly to learn lessons which make for soul-growth, the more
experience we shall gather and the richer our harvest will be.  Then,  in  a
later  existence,  we shall be much more advanced and capable of  taking  up
tasks  that would be impossible with less length of life and breadth of  ac-
tivity. Besides, to die is hard for the man in the prime of life with a wife
and growing family whom he loves,  with ambitions of greatness  unfulfilled,
with  hosts of friends about him,  and with interests all centered upon  the
material plane of existence. It is sad for the woman whose heart is bound up
in  home and the little ones she has reared to leave them,  perhaps  without
anyone  to care for them;  to know that they have to fight their  way  alone
through the early years when tender care is needed and perhaps to see  those
little  ones abused,  and she unable to lift a hand,  though her  heart  may
bleed  as freely as it would in Earth life.  All these things are  sad,  and
THEY BIND THE SPIRIT TO  EARTH for a much longer time than ordinarily;  they
hinder it from reaping the experiences it should reap upon the other side of
death,  and  they make it desirable, along with other reasons  already  men-
tioned, to live a long life before passing onwards.


[PAGE 106]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    The difference between those who pass out at a ripe old age and one  who
leaves  this Earth in the prime of life may be illustrated by the manner  in
which the seed clings to a fruit in an unripe state.  A great deal of  force
is necessary to tear the stone from a green peach;  it has such a  tenacious
hold upon the fruit that shreds of pulp adhere to it when forcibly  removed.
So also the Spirit clings to the flesh in middle life and a certain part  of
its  material  interest remains and binds it to Earth after  death.  On  the
other hand,  when a life has been lived to the full, when the spirit has had
time to realize its ambitions or to find out their futility, when the duties
of  life has been misspent and the pangs of conscience have worked upon  the
man,  and shown him his mistakes; when, in fact,  the Spirit has learned the
lessons of life,  as it must have to come to old age, then it may be likened
to  the seed of the ripe fruit which falls out clean,  without a vestige  of
flesh clinging thereto, at the moment the encasing pulp is opened. Therefore
we say,  as before,  that thought there is a brighter existence in store for
those who have lived well,  it is nevertheless best to live a long life  and
to live it to the fullest extent possible.


[PAGE 107]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    We also maintain that no matter what may be the circumstances of a man's
death, it is not accidental; it has either been brought about by his own ne-
glect to embrace opportunities of growth or else life has been lived to  the
ultimate possible.  There is one exception to that rule,  and that is due to
man's  exercise of his divine prerogative of interference.  If we lived  ac-
cording to schedule,  if we all assimilated the experiences designed for our
growth by the Creative Powers, we should live to the ultimate length, but WE
OURSELVES  usually shorten our lives by not taking advantage  of  opportuni-
ties.  It also happens that OTHER MEN may shorten our lives and cut them off
as  suddenly as the so-called accident whereby the divine  rulers  terminate
our life here.  In other words, murder,  or fatal accidents brought about by
HUMAN CARELESSNESS are in reality the only  termination to life not  planned
by invisible leaders of humanity.  No one is ever compelled to do murder  or
other  evil,  or there could not come to them a just retribution  for  their
acts.  The  Christ  said that evil must come but WOE  UNTO  HIM  BY  WHOM IT
COMETH,  and to harmonize that with the law of divine  justice,  "as  a  man
soweth,  so shall he also reap,"   THERE MUST AT LEAST BE ABSOLUTE FREE WILL
IN RESPECT TO EVIL ACTS.

      There are also cases where a person lives such a full and good life of
such  vast benefit to humanity and to himself that his days  are  lengthened
beyond the ultimate, as they are shortened by neglect, but such cases are of
course too few to allow of their being dwelt upon at length.

    Where  death is not sudden as in the case of accidents,  but  occurs  at
home after an illness, quietly and peacefully, dying persons usually experi-
ence a falling upon them as of a  pall  of great darkness before termination


[PAGE 108]                                          THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

of life. Many pass out from the body under that condition and do not see the
light again until they have entered the superphysical realms. There are many
other cases, however, where the darkness lifts before the final release from
the body.  Then the dying person views both worlds at once, and is cognizant
of the presence of both dead and living friends. Under such circumstances it
very often happens that a mother sees some of her children who have gone be-
fore,  and she will exclaim joyously:  "Oh,  there is Johnny standing at the
foot of the bed:  my,  but hasn't he grown!"   The living relatives may feel
shocked  and uneasy,  thinking the mother is suffering from  hallucinations,
while  in reality she is more clear-sighted than they.  She perceives  those
who  have passed beyond the veil,  who have come to greet and assist her  to
find herself at home in the new world she is entering.

    Each  human being is an individual, separate and apart from all  others,
and  as experiences in the life of each differ from those of all  others  in
the interval from the cradle to the grave,  so we may also reasonably  infer
that  the  experiences of each Spirit when it passes through  the  gates  of
birth and death.  We print what purports to be a spirit message communicated
by the late professor James of Harvard at the Boston Spirit Temple,  and  in
which he describes sensations which he felt when passing through the gate of
death.  We do not vouch for its authenticity as we (the writer) have not in-
vestigated the matter personally.


[PAGE 109]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    Professor James had promised to communicate after death with his friends
in  this life,  and the whole world of psychic research was and still is  on
watch for a word from him. Several mediums have claimed that Professor James
has  communicated  through them,  but the most remarkable  are  those  given
through the Boston Spirit temple as follows:

    "And  this is death,  only to fall asleep, only to awaken in the morning
and to know that all is well. I am not dead, only arisen.

                             *  *  *  *  *

    "I  only know that I experienced a great shock through my entire system,
as if some mighty bond had been rent asunder.  For a moment I was dazed  and
lost consciousness.  When I awakened I found myself standing beside the  old
body  which had served me faithfully and well.  To say that I was  surprised
would  only inadequately express the sensation that thrilled my very  being,
and  I realized that some wonderful change had taken place.  Suddenly I  be-
came conscious that my body was surrounded by many of my friends, and an un-
controllable desire took possession of me to speak and touch them that  they
might know that I still lived.  Drawing a little nearer to that which was so
like and yet unlike myself, I stretched forth my hand and touched them,  but
they heeded me not."

                             *  *  *  *  *  

    "Then  it  was that the full significance of the great change  that  had
taken place flashed upon my newly awakened senses;  then it was that I real-
ized that an impenetrable barrier separated me from my loved ones on  Earth,
and that this great change which had taken place was indeed death.  A  sense
of  weariness  and longing for rest took possession of me.  I seemed  to  be
transported through space,  and I lost consciousness, to awaken in a land so


[PAGE 110]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

different and yet so similar to the one which I had lately left.  It was not
possible  for  me  to  describe my sensations when  I  again  regained  con-
sciousness and realized that, though dead, I was still alive.

    "When  I first became conscious of my new environment I was resting in a
beautiful  grove,  and was realizing as never before what it was  to  be  at
peace with myself and all the world."

                            *  *  *  *  *

      "I  know  that only with the greatest difficulty shall I be enabled to
express to you my sensations when I fully realized that I had awakened to  a
new life. All was still, no sound broke the silence. Darkness had surrounded
me. In fact, I seemed to be enveloped in a heavy mist, beyond which which my
gaze could not penetrate.  Soon in the distance I discerned a faint  glimmer
of light, which slowly approached me, and then, to my wonder and joy,  I be-
held  the face of her who had been my guiding star in the early days  of  my
earth life."

                            *  *  *  *  *  

    One  of the saddest sights witnessed by the seer at a death-bed  is  the
tortures to which we often subject our dying friends on account of ignorance
of how to care for them in that condition.  We have a science of birth;  ob-
stetricians who have been trained for years in their profession and have de-
veloped  a  wonderful skill assist the little stranger into this  world.  We
have also trained nurses attendant upon mother and child,  the ingenuity  of
brilliant minds is focused upon the problem of how to make maternity easier;
neither pains nor money are spared in these beneficent efforts for one  whom
we  have  never seen.  But when the friend of a lifetime,  the man  who  has
served his kind well and nobly in profession,  state, or church, is to leave


[PAGE 111]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

the scene of his labors for a new field of activity, when the woman, who has
labored to no less good purpose in bringing up a family to take its part  in
the world's work,  has to leave that home and family,  when one whom we have
loved all our lives is about to bid us the final farewell, we stand by,  ut-
terly at a loss how to help.  Perhaps we even do the very things most detri-
mental to the comfort and welfare of the departing one.

    Probably  there is no form of torture more commonly inflicted  upon  the
dying  than that which is caused by administering stimulants.  Such  potions
have  the effect of drawing a departing Spirit into its body with the  force
of a catapult,  to remain and to suffer for some time longer.  Investigators
of conditions beyond have heard many complaints of such treatment.  When  it
is  seen that death must inevitably ensue, let not selfish desire to keep  a
departing  Spirit  a little longer prompt us to inflict such  tortures  upon
them.  The death chamber should be a place of the utmost quiet,  a place  of
peace and of prayer, for at that time, and FOR THREE AND ONE-HALF DAYS AFTER
THE LAST BREATH,  the  Spirit is passing through a Gethsemane and needs  all
the assistance that can be given.  The value of the life that has just  been
passed  depends greatly upon conditions which then prevail about  the  body;
yes,  even the conditions of its future life are influenced by our  attitude
during that time,  so that if ever we were our brother's keeper in life,  we
are a thousand times more so at death.


[PAGE 112]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

      Post-mortem examinations,  embalming,  and cremation during the period
mentioned,  not only disturb the passing Spirit mentally,  but are even pro-
ductive of a certain amount of pain,  there still being a slight  connection
with the discarded vehicle.  If sanitary laws require us to prevent decompo-
sition  while thus keeping the body for cremation,  it may be packed in  ice
till  the three and one-half days have passed.  After that time  the  Spirit
will not suffer, no matter what happens to the body.


                        THE PANORAMA OF A PAST LIFE

    No matter how long we may keep the Spirit from passing out, however,  at
last  there  will  come a time when no stimulant can hold it  and  the  last
breath is drawn.  Then the silver cord of which the Bible speaks,  and which
holds  the higher and the lower vehicles together,  snaps in the  heart  and
causes  that organ to stop.  That rupture releases the vital body,  and  it,
with the desire body and mind, floats above the visible body for from one to
three and one-half days,  while the Spirit is engaged in reviewing the  past
life, an exceedingly important part of its post-mortem experience. Upon that
review depends its whole existence from death to a new birth.

    The  question may arise in the student's mind:  "How  can we review  our
past life from the cradle to the grave, when we do not even remember what we
did  a month ago?  To form a proper basis for our future life,  this  record
ought to be very accurate, but even the best memory is faulty."  When we un-
derstand the difference between the conscious and  subconscious  memory  and


[PAGE 113]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

the manner in which the latter operates, the difficulty vanishes.  This dif-
ference  and the manner in which the subconscious memory keeps  an  accurate
record of our life experiences may be best understood by an illustration, as
follows: When we go into a field and view the surrounding landscape,  vibra-
tions  in the ether carry to us a picture of everything within the range  of
our vision. It is as sad as it is true, however, that  "we have eyes and see
not,"  as  the Savior said. These vibrations impinge  upon the retina of our
eyes,  even to the very smallest details,  but they usually do not penetrate
to our consciousness, and therefore are not remembered. Even the most power-
ful impressions fade in the course of time, so that we cannot call them back
at will when they are stored in our conscious memory.

    When  a photographer goes afield with his camera,  the results which  he
obtains are different.  The  ether vibrations emanating from all things upon
which his camera is focused,  transmit to the sensitive plate an  impression
of the landscape,  true to the minutest detail;  and,  mark this well,  this
true and accurate picture is in no wise dependent upon whether the photogra-
pher  is observant or not.  It will remain upon the plate and may be  repro-
duced under proper conditions.  Such is the subconscious memory,  and it  is
generated automatically by each of us during every moment of time,  indepen-
dently of our volition, in the following manner.

    From  the first breath which we draw after birth to our last dying  gasp


[PAGE 114]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

we inspire air which is charged with pictures of our surroundings,  and  the
same  ether which carries that picture to the retina of our eye  is  inhaled
into our lungs where it enters the blood.  Thus it reaches the heart in  due
time.  In  the left ventricle of that organ,  near the apex,  there  is  one
little  atom which is particularly sensitized and which remains in the  body
all through life. It differs in this respect from all other atoms which come
and  go,  for it is the particular property of God,and of a certain  Spirit.
This  atom may be called the book of the Recording Angel,  for as the  blood
passes through the heart,  cycle after cycle,  the pictures of our good  and
evil acts are inscribed thereon to the minutest detail.   This record may be
called the subconscious memory.  It forms the basis of our future life  when
reproduced  as a panorama just subsequent to death.  By removal of the  seed
atom--which corresponds to the sensitized plate in a camera--the  reflecting
ether of the vital body serves as a focus,  and as the life unrolls  slowly,
backwards,  from death to birth the pictures thereof are etched into the de-
sire body, which will be our vehicle during our sojourn in Purgatory and the
First Heaven where evil is eradicated and good assimilated, so that in a fu-
ture  life  the  former may serve as CONSCIENCE to  withhold  the  man  from
repeating  mistakes  of the past,  and the latter will spur him  to  greater
good.

    A phenomenon similar to the panorama of life usually takes place where a
person is drowning.  People who have been resuscitated speak of having  seen
their whole life IN A FLASH. That is because under such conditions the vital


[PAGE 115]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

body also leaves the dense body.  Of course there is no rupture of the  sil-
ver cord,  or life could not be restored. Unconsciousness follows quickly in
drowning,  while in the usual post-mortem review the  consciousness  contin-
ues  until the vital body collapses in the same manner that it does when  we
go to sleep.  Then consciousness ceases for a while and the panorama is ter-
minated.  Therefore also the time occupied by the panorama varies with  dif-
ferent persons,  according to whether the vital body was strong and healthy,
or had become thin and emaciated by protracted illness.  The longer the time
spent  in  review,  and the more quiet and peaceful  the  surroundings,  the
deeper  will  be the etching which is made in the desire  body.  As  already
said,  that has a most important and far-reaching effect,  for then the suf-
ferings which the Spirit will realize in Purgatory on account of bad  habits
and misdeeds will be much keener than if there is only a slight  impression,
and in a future life the still small voice of conscience will warn much more
insistently against mistakes which caused sufferings in the past.

    When  conditions are such at the time of death that the Spirit  is  dis-
turbed  by  outside conditions,  as for instance the din and  turmoil  of  a
battle,  the harrowing conditions of an accident, or the hysterical wailings
of  relatives,  the distraction prevents it from  realizing  an  appropriate
depth in the etching upon the desire body.  Consequently its post-mortem ex-
istence becomes vague and insipid; the Spirit does not harvest the fruits of


[PAGE 116]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

experience as it should have done had it passed out of the body in peace and
under normal conditions.  It would therefore lack incentive to good in a fu-
ture  life,  and miss the warning against evil which a deep etching  of  the
panorama  of life would have given.  Thus its growth would be retarded in  a
very  marked degree,  but the beneficent Powers in charge of evolution  take
certain  steps  to compensate for our ignorant treatment of  the  dying  and
other untoward circumstances mentioned. What these steps are,  we shall dis-
cuss when considering the life of children in heaven; for the present let it
be  sufficient to say that in God's kingdom every evil is always  transmuted
to a greater good, though the process may not be at once apparent.


                                 PURGATORY

    During life the collapse of the vital body at night terminates our  view
of the world about us,  and causes us to lose ourselves in the  unconscious-
ness of sleep.  When the vital body collapses just subsequent to death,  and
the  panorama of life is terminated,  we also lose consciousness for a  time
which varies according to the individual.  A darkness seems to fall upon the
Spirit;  then  after a while it wakes up and begins dimly  to  perceive  the
light  of the other world,  but is only gradually accustomed to the  altered
conditions.  It is an experience similar to that which we have  when  coming
out of a darkened room into sunlight, which blinds us by its brilliancy, un-
til the pupils of our eyes have contracted so that they admit a quantity  of
light bearable to our organism.


[PAGE 117]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    If  under such a condition we turn momentarily from the bright  sunlight
and look back into the darkened room, objects there will be much plainer  to
our  vision than things outside which are illumined by the powerful rays  of
the Sun. So it is also with the Spirit; when it has first been released from
the body it perceives sights, scenes, and sounds of the material world which
it has just left much more readily than it observes the sights of the  world
it  is entering.   Wordsworth  in  his  ODE TO IMMORTALITY  noted a  similar
condition in the case of newborn children,  who are all clairvoyant and much
more  awake to the spiritual world than to this present plane of  existence.
Some  lose the spiritual sight very early, others retain it for a number  of
years,  and a few keep it all through life, but as the birth of a child is a
death in the spiritual world and it retains the spiritual sight for a  time,
so also death here is a birth upon the spiritual plane,  and the newly  dead
retain a consciousness of this world for some time subsequent to demise.

    When  one awakes in the Desire World after having passed through  afore-
mentioned experiences,  the general feeling seems to be one of relief from a
heavy burden,  a feeling perhaps akin to that of a diver encased in a  heavy
rubber suit,  a weighty brass helmet upon his head,  leaden soles under  his
feet,  and heavy weights of lead upon his breast and back,  confined  in his


[PAGE 118]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

operations  on  the bottom of the ocean by a short length of air  tube,  and
able  to move only clumsily and with difficulty.  When after the day's  work
such a man is hauled to the surface,  and divests himself of his heavy  gar-
ments and he moves about with the facility we enjoy here, he must surely ex-
perience  a  feeling of great relief.  Something like that is  felt  by  the
Spirit when it has been divested of the mortal coil and is able to roam  all
over  the  globe instead of being confined to the narrow  environment  which
bound it upon earth.

    There is also a feeling of relief for those who have been ill. Sickness,
such as we know it,  does not exist there.  Neither is it necessary to  seek
food and shelter,  for in that world there is neither heat nor cold.  Never-
theless,  there are many in the purgatorial region who go to all the bothers
of housekeeping,  eating and drinking  just as we do here.  George DuMaurier
in his novel,  PETER IBBETTSON,  gives  a  very good idea of this condition,
in  his life lived between the hero and the Countess of Towers.  This  novel
also  illustrates splendidly what has been said of the subconscious  memory,
for George DuMaurier has somewhere,  somehow discovered an easy method which
anyone may apply to do what he calls  "dreaming true."   By taking a certain
position in going to sleep, it is possible, after a little practice, to com-
pel the appearance, in a dream, of any scene IN OUR PAST LIFE,  which we de-
sire to live over again. The book is well worth reading on that account.


[PAGE 119]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    When  a  fiery nebulae has been formed in the sky and commences  to  re-
volve,  a little matter in the center where motion is slowest  commences  to
crystallize.  When  it  has reached a certain density it is  caught  in  the
swirl,  and whirled nearer, and nearer to the outward extremity of what has,
by  that time,  become the equator of a revolving globe.  Then it is  hurled
into space and discarded from the economy of the revolving Sun.

    This process is not accomplished automatically as scientists would  have
us  believe,  an  assertion  which has been proven in THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-
CONCEPTION and other places in our literature.  Herbert Spencer rejected the
nebular theory because it required  a  First  cause, which he denied (though
unable to form a better hypothesis of the formation  of  solar systems), but
it is accomplished through the activity of a Great Spirit, which we may call
God or any other name we  choose.  As above, so below, says the Hermetic ax-
iom. Man, who is a lesser Spirit,  also gathers  about  himself  spirit-sub-
stance,  which crystallizes into matter  and becomes the visible  body which
the spiritual sight reveals as placed  inside an aura of finer vehicles. The
latter are in constant motion. When the dense body is born as a child  it is
extremely soft and flexible.

    Childhood, youth, maturity, and old age are but so many different stages
of crystallization, which goes on until at last a point is reached where the
Spirit  can no longer move the hardened body and it is thrown out  from  the
Spirit as the planet is expelled from the Sun.  That is death--the commence-
ment of a disrobing process which continues in Purgatory.  The low evil pas-
sions  and  desires  we  cultivated  during  life  have   crystallized   the


[PAGE 120]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

desire-stuff in such a manner that also must be expelled. Thus the Spirit is
purged  of evil under the same law that a sun is purged of the matter  which
later forms a planet. If the life has been a reasonably decent one, the pro-
cess of purgation will not be very strenuous nor will the evil desires  thus
expurgated persist for a long time after having been freed, but they quickly
disintegrate.  If,  on the other hand,  an extremely vile life has been led,
the  part of the expurgated desire nature may persist even to the time  when
the  Spirit returns to a new birth for further experience.  It will then  be
attracted to him and haunt him as a demon,  inciting him to evil deeds which
he himself abhors. The story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is not a mere fanci-
ful idea of Robert Louis Stevenson,  but is founded upon facts well known to
spiritual investigators.  Such cases are extremes,  of course,  but they are
nevertheless  possible,  and we unfortunately have laws which  convert  such
possibilities  of probabilities in the case of a certain class of  so-called
criminals.  We refer to laws which decree capital punishment as penalty  for
murder.

    When  a  man is dangerous he should of course be  restrained,  but  even
apart from the question of the moral right of a community to take  the  life


[PAGE 121]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

of anyone--which we deny--society by its very act of retaliatory murder  de-
feats the very end it would serve. If the vicious murderer is restrained un-
der whatever discipline is necessary in a prison,  for a number of years un-
til  his natural death,  he will have forgotten his bitterness  against  his
victim and against society,  and when he stands as a free Spirit in the  De-
sire World,  he may even by prayer have obtained forgiveness and have become
a good Christian.  He will then go on his way rejoicing, and will in the fu-
ture life seek to help those whom he hurt here.

    When society retaliates and puts him to a violent death shortly after he
has  committed the crime,  he is most likely to feel himself as having  been
greatly injured,  and not without cause. Then such a character will  usually
seek to "get even,"  as  he  calls it,  going about for a long time inciting
others  to commit murder and other crimes. Then we have am epidemic of  mur-
ders in a community, a condition not infrequent.

    The regicide in Serbia shocked the Western world (in 1914) by wiping out
an entire royal house in a most shockingly bloody manner,  and the  Minister
of the Interior was one of the chief conspirators.  Later he wrote his  mem-
oirs,  and therein he writes that whenever the conspirators had tried to win
anyone as a recruit, they always succeeded when they burned incense.  He did
not know why, but simply mentioned it as a curious coincidence.

    To the mystic investigator the matter is perfectly clear.  We have shown
the necessity of having a vehicle made of the materials of any world wherein
we wish to function.  We usually obtain a physical vehicle by going  through
the womb,  or perhaps in a few special cases, from a particularly good mate-
rializing medium, but where it is only necessary to work upon the brain  and


[PAGE 122]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

influence someone else to act,  we need but a vehicle made of such ether  as
may be obtained from fumes of many different substances.  Each kind attracts
different classes of Spirits,  and there is no doubt that the incense burned
at meetings where the conspirators were successful was of a low and  sensual
order and attracted Spirits who had a grudge against humanity in general and
the  King of Serbia in particular. These malcontents were unable  to  injure
the king himself,  but used a subtle influence which helped the conspirators
in their work. The released murderer who has a grudge against society on ac-
count  of his execution,  may enter low gambling saloons where the fumes  of
liquor  and tobacco furnish ample opportunity for working upon the class  of
people who congregate in such places,  and the man whose spiritual sight has
been  developed is often sadly impressed when he sees the subtle  influences
to  which  those  who frequent such places are exposed.  It is  a  fact,  of
course,  that  a  man  must be of a low caliber  to  be  influenced  by  low
thoughts,  and  that it is as impossible to incite a  person  of  benevolent
character to do murder--unless we put him into a hypnotic sleep--as to  make
a  tuning fork which vibrates to C sing by striking another attuned  to  the
key of G.  But the thoughts of both living and dead constantly surround  us,
and no man ever thought out a high spiritual philosophy under the  influence


[PAGE 123]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

of tobacco fumes or while imbibing alcoholic stimulants.  Were capital  pun-
ishment, newspaper notoriety of criminals, and the manufacture of liquor and
tobacco eliminated from society,  the gun factories would soon cease to  ad-
vertise and go out of business along with most of the locksmiths. The police
force  would  decrease,   and  jails  and  taxes  would  be  correspondingly
minimized.

    When a person enters Purgatory he is  exactly the same person as  before
he died. He has just the same appetites, likes and dislikes,  sympathies and
antipathies, as before. There is one important difference, however,  namely,
that HE HAS NO DENSE BODY WHEREWITH TO GRATIFY HIS APPETITES.  The  drunkard
craves drink, in fact, far more than he did in this life, but has no stomach
which  can  contain liquor and cause the chemical  combustion  necessary  to
bring about the state of intoxication in which he delights.  He may and does
enter  saloons where he interpolates his body into the body of the  physical
drunkard so that he may obtain his desires at second hand,  as it were,  in-
citing his victim to drink more and more.

    Yet  there  is no true satisfaction.  He sees the full  glass  upon  the
counter but his spirit hand is unable to lift it. He suffers the tortures of
Tantalus until in time he realizes the impossibility of gratifying his  base
desire.  Then he is free to go on, so far as that vice is concerned.  He has
been purged from that evil without intervention of an angry Deity or a  con-
ventional  devil with hell's flames and pitchfork to administer  punishment,
but under the immutable law THAT AS WE SOW SO SHALL WE REAP, he has suffered


[PAGE 124]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

exactly  according to his vice.  If his craving for drink was of a mild  na-
ture, he would scarcely miss the liquor which he cannot there obtain. If his
desires were strong and he simply lived for drink, he would suffer veritable
tortures of hell without need of actual flames. Thus the pain experienced in
eradication of his vice would be exactly commensurate with the energy he had
expended upon contracting the habit,  as the force wherewith a falling stone
strikes the earth is proportionate to the energy expended in hurling it  up-
wards into the air.

    Yet  it is not the aim of God to "get even;"  LOVE  is  higher than  LAW
and in His wonderful mercy and solicitude for our welfare He has opened  the
way  of repentance and reform whereby we may obtain forgiveness of  sin,  as
taught by the Lord of Love: the Christ. Not indeed contrary to law,  for His
laws are immutable,  but by application of a higher law,  whereby we  accom-
plish here that which would otherwise be delayed until death had forced  the
day of reckoning. The method is as follows:

    In  our explanation concerning the subconscious memory we noted  that  a
record of every act,  thought, and word is transmitted by air and ether into
our lungs, thence to the blood, and finally inscribed upon the tablet of the
heart: a certain little  SEED ATOM,  which  is  thus the book of the Record-
ing Angels.  It was later explained how this panorama of life is etched into
the desire body and forms the basis of retribution after death. When we have


[PAGE 125]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

committed a wrong and our conscience accuses us in consequence, and this ac-
cusation is productive of sincere repentance ACCOMPANIED BY REFORM, the pic-
ture  of that wrong act will gradually fade from the record of our life,  so
that  when we pass out at death it will not stand accusingly against us.  We
noted that the panorama of life unwinds BACKWARDS just after death. Later in
the purgatorial life it again passes before the spiritual vision of the man,
who  then  experiences the exact feeling of those whom he  has  wronged.  He
seems to lose his or her identity for the time being and assumes the  condi-
tion of his one time victim, he experiences all the mental and physical suf-
fering himself which he inflicted upon others. Thus he learns to be merciful
instead of cruel, and to do right instead of wrong in a future life.  But if
he awakens to a thorough realization of a wrong previous to his death, then,
as said, the feeling of sorrow for his victim and the restitution or redress
which  he gives of his own free will makes the suffering after  death  unne-
cessary. Hence "his sin is forgiven."

    The  Rosicrucian Mystery Teaching gives a scientific method  whereby  an
aspirant to the higher life may purge himself continually,  and thus be able
entirely to avoid existence in Purgatory. Each night after retiring the  pu-
pil  reviews his or her life during the day IN REVERSE ORDER.  He starts  to
visualize as clearly as possible the scene which took place just before  re-
tiring. He then endeavors to view impartially his actions in that scene, ex-
amining them to see whether he did right or wrong. If the latter, he endeav-
ors to FEEL AND REALIZE AS VIVIDLY AS POSSIBLE that wrong.  For instance, if


[PAGE 126]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

he spoke harshly to someone,  and upon later consideration finds it was  not
merited,  he will endeavor to FEEL exactly as that one felt whom he  wronged
and at the very earliest opportunity to apologize for the hasty  expression.
Then he will call up the next scene in backward succession which may perhaps
be the supper table.  In respect of that scene he will examine himself as to
whether he ate to live, sparingly and of foods prepared without suffering to
other creatures of God (such as flesh foods that cannot be obtained  without
taking life).  If he finds that he allowed his appetite to run away with him
and that he ate gluttonously, he will endeavor to overcome these habits, for
to live a clean life we must have a clean body,  and no one can live to  his
highest possibilities while making his stomach a graveyard for the  decaying
corpses  of murdered animals.  In this respect there occurs to the writer  a
little poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox:

    "I am the voice of the voiceless;
          Through me the dumb shall speak,
    Till a deaf world's ear
    Shall be made to hear
          The wrongs of the wordless weak.

    The same force formed the sparrow
          That fashioned man the king;
    The God of the whole
    Gave a spark of soul
          To furred and feathered thing.


[PAGE 127]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    And I am my brother's keeper
          And I will fight his fight,
    And speak the work
    For beast and bird
          Till the world shall set things right.

    Thus the pupil will continue to review each scene IN REVERSE ORDER  from
night till morning, and TO FEEL REALLY SORRY  for whatever he has done amiss.
He  will not neglect to FEEL GLAD either when he comes to a scene  where  he
has done well,  and THE MORE INTENSELY HE CAN FEEL,  THE MORE THOROUGHLY  HE
WILL ERADICATE THE RECORD UPON THE TABLET OF THE HEART AND SHARPEN HIS  CON-
SCIENCE,  so that as time goes on from year to year, he will find less cause
for blame and enhance his soul power enormously. Thus he will grow in a mea-
sure  impossible  by  any  less systematic method,  and  there  will  be  no
necessity for his stay in Purgatory after death.

    This evening exercise, and another for the morning, if persistently per-
formed  day by day will in time awaken the spiritual vision as they  improve
life.   This matter has, however, been so thoroughly treated in number 11 of
the  lecture  series "SPIRITUAL SIGHT AND INSIGHT"  that it is unnecessary to
dwell upon the matter further in this place.


[PAGE 128]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

                            THE FIRST HEAVEN

    In the First Heaven, which is located in the higher regions of  the  De-
sire  World,  the  panorama  of  life  again unrolls and reveals every scene
where we aimed to help or benefit others. They were not felt at the time the
Spirit was in the lower regions,   for  higher  desires cannot express them-
selves in the coarse matter composing the lower regions of the Desire World;
but when the Spirit ascends to the First Heaven it reaps from each scene all
the good which it expressed in life.   It will feel the gratitude poured out
by  those whom it helped; if it comes to a scene where itself received a fa-
vor from others AND WAS GRATEFUL, it will experience the gratitude anew. The
sum of all these feelings is there amalgamated into the Spirit to serve in a
future life as incentives to good.

    Thus  the  Spirit is purged from evil in Purgatory and  strengthened  in
good  in the First Heaven.  In one region the extract of  sufferings  become
CONSCIENCE  to deter us from doing wrong,  in the other region the  quintes-
sence of good is transmuted to BENEVOLENCE and altruism, which are the basis
of all true progress.  Moreover, Purgatory is far from being a place of PUN-
ISHMENT.  It is perhaps the most beneficent realm in nature,  for BECAUSE OF
PURGATION WE ARE BORN INNOCENT life after life. The tendencies to commit the
same  evil for which we suffered remain with us,  and temptations to  commit
the same wrongs will be placed in our placed in our path until we have  con-
sciously overcome the evil here. Temptation is not sin, however,  the sin is
in yielding.

    Among  the inhabitants of the invisible world there is one  class  which
lives a particularly painful life,  sometimes for a great many years,  name-
ly, the suicide who tried to play truant from the school of life.  Yet it is


[PAGE 129]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

not  an angry God or a malevolent devil who administers punishment,  but  an
immutable  law  which proportions the sufferings differently to  each  indi-
vidual suicide.

    We learned previously, when considering the World of Thought,  that each
form in this visible world has its archetype there--a vibrating hollow  mold
which  emits  a  certain harmonious sound.  That sound  attracts  and  forms
physical into the shape we behold,  much in the same manner as when we place
a  little  sand upon a glass plate and rub the edge with a violin  bow;  the
sand is shaped into different geometrical figures which change as the  sound
changes.

    The  little atom in the heart is the sample and the center around  which
the atoms in our body gather.  When that is removed at death,  the center is
lacking,  and although the archetype keeps on vibrating until the  limit  of
the  life has been reached--as also previously explained--no matter  can  be
drawn into the hollow shape of the archetype.  Therefore the suicide feels a
dreadful gnawing pain as if he were hollowed out,  a torture which can  only
be likened to the pangs of hunger. In his case,  the intense suffering  will
continue  for exactly as many years as he should have lived in the body.  At
the expiration of that time,  the archetype collapses as it does when  death
comes naturally.  Then the pain of the suicide ceases,  and he commences his
period of purgation as do those who die a natural death.  But the memory  of
sufferings experienced in consequence of the act of suicide will remain with
him in future lives and deter him from a similar mistake.


[PAGE 130]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    In  the First Heaven there is a class who have not had  any  purgatorial
existence and who lead a particularly joyous life:  the children.  Our  home
may be saddened almost beyond endurance when the little flower is broken and
the sunshine it brought has gone.  But could we see the beautiful  existence
with these little ones lead,  and did we understand the great benefits which
accrue to a child from its limited stay there,  our sorrow would be at least
ameliorated in a great measure, and the wound upon our heart would heal more
quickly.  Besides, as nothing else in the world happens without a cause,  so
there  is also a much deeper cause for infant mortality than we are  usually
aware  of,  and as we awake to the facts of the case,  we shall be  able  to
avoid in future the sorrow incident to loss of our little ones.

    To understand the case properly we must revert to the experiences of the
dying in the death hour.  We remember that the panorama of the past life  is
etched  upon  the desire body during a period varying from a  few  hours  to
three and one-half days just subsequent to demise.  We recall also that upon
the depth of this etching depends the clearness of the picture, and that the
more  vivid this panorama of life,  the more intensely will the Spirit  suf-
fer  in Purgatory and feel the joys of heaven;  also,  that the greater  the
suffering Purgatory the stronger the conscience in the next life.


[PAGE 131]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    It was explained how the horrors of death upon the battle field,  in  an
accident, or other untoward circumstances would prevent the Spirit from giv-
ing  all its attention to the panorama of life,  with the result that  there
would be a light etching in the desire body, followed by a vague and insipid
existence  in Purgatory and the First Heaven.  It was also stated that  hys-
terical lamentations in the death chamber would produce the same effect.

    A Spirit which had thus escaped suffering proportionate to its misdeeds,
and which had not experienced the pleasure commensurate with the good it had
done,  would not in a future life have as well developed a conscience as  it
ought to have,  nor would it be as benevolent as it ought to be,  and there-
fore the life, terminated under conditions over which the Spirit had no con-
trol,  would be partly wasted.  The Great Leaders of humanity therefore take
steps to counteract such a calamity and prevent an injustice.  The Spirit is
brought to birth, caused to die in childhood, re-enters the Desire World and
in the First Heaven it is taught the lessons of which it was deprived previ-
ously.

    As  the First Heaven is located in the Desire World (which is the  realm
of  light and color),  where matter is shaped most readily by  thought,  the
little  ones are given wonderful toys impossible of construction here.  They
are taught to play with COLORS, WHICH WORK UPON THEIR MORAL CHARACTER in ex-
actly the manner each child requires.  Anyone who is at all sensitive is af-
fected by the color of his clothing and surroundings. Some colors have a de-
pressing effect, while others inspire  us  with  energy,  and  others  again


[PAGE 132]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

soothe and comfort us. In the Desire World the effect of colors is much more
intense; they are much more potent factors of good and evil there than here.
In this color play,  the child imbibes unconsciously the qualities which  it
did  not acquire on account of accident or lamentations of relatives.  Often
it  also falls to the lot of such relatives to care for a child and  see  it
die.  Thus  they receive just retribution for the wrong committed.  As  wars
cease,  and man learns to be more careful of life,  also how to care for the
dying, infant mortality, which now is so appalling, will decrease.


                             THE SECOND HEAVEN

    When  both the good and evil of a life have been extracted,  the  Spirit
discards its desire body and ascends to the Second Heaven.  The desire  body
then commences to disintegrate as the physical body and the vital body  have
done,  but it is a peculiarity of desire-stuff that, once it has been formed
and inspired with life, it persists for a considerable time. Even after that
life has fled it lives a semiconscious,  independent life.  Sometimes it  is
drawn  by magnetic attraction to relatives of the Spirit whose  clothing  it
was,  and at spiritualistic seances these SHELLS generally  impersonate  the
departed Spirit and deceive its relatives.  As the panorama of the past life
is  etched  into  the  shells, they have a memory of incidents in connection


[PAGE 133]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

with these relatives,  which facilitates the deception.  But as the intelli-
gence has fled, they are of course unable to give any true counsel, and that
accounts for the inane,  goody-goody nonsense of which these things  deliver
themselves.

    When passing from the First to the Second Heaven, the Spirit experiences
the condition known and described previously as  THE  GREAT  SILENCE,  where
it stands utterly alone,  conscious only of its divinity.  When that silence
is broken there floats in upon the Spirit  celestial harmonies of THE  WORLD
OF TONE  where  the Second Heaven is located.  It seems then to lave  in  an
ocean of sound and to experience a joy beyond all description and words,  as
it  nears  its heavenly home--for this is the first of the  truly  spiritual
realms  from which the Spirit has been exiled during its Earth life and  the
subsequent post-mortem existence.  In the Desire World its work was  CORREC-
TIVE,  but in the World of Thought the human Spirit becomes one with the na-
ture forces and its CREATIVE activity begins.

    Under the Law of Causation we reap exactly what we sow,  and it would be
wrong to place one Spirit in an environment where there is a scarcity of the
necessities of life,  where a scorching sun burns the crop and millions  die
from famine, or where the raging flood sweeps away primitive habitations not
built  to withstand its ravages,  and to bring another Spirit to birth in  a
land of plenty,  with fertile soil which yields a maximum of increase with a
minimum  of labor,  where the earth is rich in minerals that may be used  in
industry to facilitate transportation of products of the soil from one point
to another.


[PAGE 134]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    If  we  were thus placed without action or acquiescence upon  our  part,
there would be no justice, but as our post-mortem existence in Purgatory and
the First Heaven is based upon our moral attitude in this life,  so our  ac-
tivities in the Second Heaven are determined by our mental aspirations. They
produce  our  future physical environment,  for in the  Second  Heaven,  the
Spirit  becomes  part  of the nature forces which work upon  the  earth  and
change its climate,  flora,  fauna. A Spirit of an indolent nature,  who in-
dulges in daydreams and metaphysical speculations HERE,  is not  transformed
by  death respecting its mental attitude any more than regarding  its  moral
propensities.  It will dream away time in heaven, glorying in its sights and
sounds. Thus it will neglect to work upon its future country and return to a
barren and arid land. Spirits, on the other hand, whose material aspirations
lead them to desire so-called solid comforts of hearth and home,  who aim to
promote  great  industries,  and whose mind is concerned in trade  and  com-
merce,  will build in heaven a land that will suit their  purpose:  fertile,
mineralized,  with navigable rivers and sheltered harbors.  They will return
in time to enjoy upon Earth the fruits of their labors in the Second Heaven,
as they reap the result of their life upon Earth in Purgatory and the  First
Heaven.


[PAGE 135]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

                             THE THIRD HEAVEN

    In the Third Heaven most people have very little consciousness, for rea-
sons explained in connection with the Region of Abstract Thought,  for there
the  Third  Heaven is located.  It is therefore more of a place  of  waiting
where the Spirit rests between the time when its labors in the Second Heaven
have  been completed and the time when it again experiences the  desire  for
rebirth.  But  from this realm inventors bring down  their  original  ideas,
there  the philanthropist obtains the clearest vision of how to realize  his
utopian  dreams,  and the spiritual aspirations of the  saintly  minded  are
given renewed impetus.

    In  time the desires of the Spirit for further experiences draw it  back
to  rebirth,  and the great celestial Beings who are known in the  Christian
Religion  as  Recording Angels,  assist the Spirit to come to birth  in  the
place best suited to give it the experience necessary further to unfold  its
powers and possibilities.

      We  have all been here many times and in different families,  we  have
had  relations  of varying nature with many different  people,  and  usually
there are several families among whom we may seek re-embodiment to work  out
our  self-generated destiny and reap what we have sown in former  lives.  If
there are no special reasons why we should take birth in any particular fam-
ily among certain friends or foes,  the Spirit is allowed to choose its  own
place  of  birth.  Thus it may be said that most of us are  in  our  present
places by our own prenatal choice.


[PAGE 136]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    In order to assist us in making that choice the Recording Angels call up
before the Spirit's vision a panorama in general outlines of each of the of-
fered lives.  This panorama will show what part of our past debts we are  to
pay, and what fruits we may be expected to reap in the coming life.

    The Spirit is left free to choose between the several lives offered. But
once a choice has been made no evasion is possible during life. We have free
will  with regard to the future,  but the past MATURE destiny we cannot  es-
cape, as shown by the incident recorded in THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION,
where  the writer warned a well known Los Angeles lecturer that if  he  left
his home upon a certain day,  he would be injured by a conveyance,  in head,
neck, breast and shoulders.  The gentleman believed and intended to heed our
warning.   Nevertheless, he went to Sierra Madre to lecture upon the fateful
day.   He  was  injured by a collision in the places stated  and  later  ex-
plained:  "I thought the twenty-eighth was the twenty-ninth."

    When the Spirit has made its choice,  it descends into the Second Heaven
where  it is instructed by the Angels and Archangels how to build an  arche-
type of the body which it will later inhabit upon Earth.  Also here we  note
the operation of the great Law of Justice which decree that we reap what  we
sow. If our tastes are coarse and sensual, we shall build an archetype which


[PAGE 137]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

will express these qualities;  if we are refined and of aesthetic taste,  we
shall  build an archetype correspondingly refined, but no one can  obtain  a
better body than he can build.  Then, as the architect who builds a house in
which he afterwards lives,  will suffer discomfort if he neglects to  venti-
late it properly,  so also the Spirit feels disease in a poorly  constructed
body.  As the architect learns to avoid mistakes and remedy the shortcomings
of  one house when building another,  so also the Spirit which suffers  from
defects in its body learns in time to build better and better vehicles.

    In the Region of Concrete Thought, the Spirit also draws to itself mate-
rials for a new mind.  As a magnet draws iron filings but leaves other  sub-
stances alone,  so also each Spirit draws only the kind of mind-stuff  which
it  used in its former life,  plus that which it has learned to use  in  its
present post-mortem state.  Then it descends into the Desire World where  it
gathers  materials for a new desire body such as will express  appropriately
its moral characteristics. Later it attracts a certain amount of ether which
is built into the mold of the archetype Constructed in the Second Heaven and
acts  as cement between the solids, liquids,  and gaseous material from  the
bodies of parents which form the dense physical body of a child,  and in due
time the latter is brought to birth.


                             BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD


    It must not be imagined,  however,  that when the little body of a child
has been born,  the  process of birth is completed.  The dense physical body


[PAGE 138]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

has  had  the longest evolution,  and as a shoemaker who has worked  at  his
trade  for a number of years is more expert than an apprentice and can  make
better shoes and QUICKER,  so also the Spirit which has built many  physical
bodies produces them quickly,  but the vital body is a later acquisition  of
the  human being.  Therefore we are not so expert in building that  vehicle.
Consequently, it takes longer to construct it from the materials not used in
making the lining of the archetype, and the vital body is not born until the
seventh year.  Then the period of rapid growth commences. The desire body is
a  still later addition of composite man, and is not brought to birth  until
the fourteenth year,  when the desire nature expresses itself most  strongly
during the so-called  "hot" youth, and the mind, which makes man,  does  not
come to birth until the twenty-first year.  In law that age is recognized as
the earliest time he is fitted to exercise a franchise.

    This knowledge is of the utmost importance to parents,  as a proper  un-
derstanding  of the development which should take place in each of the  sep-
tenary  epochs  enables the educator to work intelligently with  nature  and
thus fulfill more thoroughly the trust of a parent than those who are  igno-
rant of the Western Mystery Teaching.  We shall therefore devote the remain-
ing pages to an elucidation of this matter  and  to  the  importance  of the
knowledge of astrology upon the part of the parent.


[PAGE 139]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

              THE MYSTERY OF LIGHT, COLOR, AND CONSCIOUSNESS

    "God  is Light,"  says  the  Bible,  and we are unable to conceive of  a
grander simile of His omnipresence,  or the mode of His manifestation.  Even
the greatest telescopes have failed to reach the boundaries of light, though
they  reveal to us stars millions of miles from the Earth,  and we may  well
ask ourselves,  as did the Psalmist of old:  "Whither  shall I flee from thy
presence?  If I ascend into heaven Thou art there,  if I make my bed in  the
grave  Thou art there,  if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in  the
uttermost parts of the sea. Even there shall thy hand lead me."

    When,  in the dawn of Being, GOD THE FATHER enunciated THE WORD, and THE
HOLY SPIRIT moved upon the sea of homogeneous VIRGIN MATTER,  primeval DARK-
NESS was turned to LIGHT. That is therefore,  the prime manifestation of De-
ity,  and a study of the principles of Light will reveal to the mystic intu-
ition a wonderful source of spiritual inspiration.   As it would take us too
far  afield from our subject we shall not enter into an elucidation of  that
theme here,  except so far as to give an elementary idea of how divine  Life
energizes the human frame, and stimulates to action.

    Truly,  God is ONE and undivided.  He unfolds within His being all  that
is, as the white light embraces all colors.  But  He  appears  threefold  in


[PAGE 140]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

manifestation,  as  the white light is refracted in  three  primary  colors:
blue, yellow, and red. Wherever we see these colors they are emblematical of
the Father,  Son,  and Holy Spirit.  These three primary rays of divine Life
are  diffused or radiated through the Sun and produce  LIFE,  CONSCIOUSNESS,
AND FORM upon each of the seven light-bearers, the planets, which are called
"the Seven Spirits before the Throne."  Their  names  are:  Mercury,  Venus,
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Bode's Law proves that Neptune and
Pluto do  not "belong" to our solar system. See SIMPLIFIED SCIENTIFIC ASTRO-
LOGY by  the  present  writer for mathematical demonstration of this concep-
tion.

    Each  of the seven planets receives the light of the Sun in a  different
measure,  according to its proximity to the central orb and the constitution
of its atmosphere, and the beings upon each, according to their stage of de-
velopment,  have affinity for some of the solar rays. They absorb the colors
congruous  to them,  and reflect the remainder upon the other planets.  This
reflected  ray  bears with it an impulse of the nature of  the  beings  with
which it has been in contact.

    Thus  the  divine Light and Life comes to each planet,  either  directly
from the Sun, or reflected from its sister planets, and as the summer breeze
which has been wafted over blooming fields carries upon its silent invisible
wings  the blended fragrance of a multitude of flowers,  so also the  subtle
influences from the garden of God bring to us the co-mingled impulses of all
the Spirits, and in that varicolored light we live and move and have our be-
ing.


[PAGE 141]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    The  rays which come directly from the Sun are productive  of  spiritual
illumination,  the  reflected rays from other planets make  for  added  con-
sciousness and moral development,  and the rays reflected by way of the Moon
give physical growth.

    But  as  each planet can absorb only a certain quantity of one  or  more
colors according to the general stage of evolution there, so each being upon
Earth:  mineral,  plant,  animal, and man, can only absorb and thrive upon a
certain quantity of the various rays projected upon the Earth. The remainder
do not affect it or produce sensation, any more than the blind are conscious
of light and color which exists everywhere around them. Therefore each being
is differently affected by the stellar rays, and the science of astrology, a
fundamental  truth in nature,  is of enormous benefit in the  attainment  of
spiritual growth.

    From a horoscopic figure in mystic script we may learn our own  strength
and weakness,  with the path best suited to our development,  or we may  see
the tendencies of those friends who come to us as children,  and what traits
are dormant in them. Thus we shall know clearly how to discharge our duty as
parents,  by repressing evil before it comes to birth, and fostering good so
that  it  may  bring forth most abundantly the spiritual  potencies  of  the
Spirit committed to our care.

    As we have already said,  man returns to Earth to reap that which he has
sown in previous lives and to sow anew the seeds which make for future expe-
rience.  The stars are the heavenly time keepers which measure the year; the


[PAGE 142]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES
         
Moon  indicates the month when the time will be propitious to harvest or  to
sow.

    The child is a mystery to us all.  We can know its propensities only  as
they  slowly  develop into characteristics,  but it is usually too  late  to
check  when evil habits have been formed and the youth is upon the  downward
grade.  A horoscope cast for the time of birth in a scientific manner  shows
the tendencies to good or evil in the child,  and if a parent will take  the
time and trouble necessary to study the science of the stars,  he or she may
do the child entrusted to his or her care an inestimable service by  foster-
ing  tendencies to good and repressing the evil bent of a child ere  it  has
crystallized into habit.  Do not imagine that a superior mathematical knowl-
edge is necessary to erect a horoscope.  Many construct a horoscope in  such
an involved manner,  so "fearfully and wonderfully made,"  that  it  is  un-
readable to themselves or others,  while a simple figure,  easy of  reading,
may be constructed by anyone who knows how to add and subtract.  This method
has been thoroughly elucidated in SIMPLIFIED SCIENTIFIC ASTROLOGY,  which is
a complete text book, though small and inexpensive, and parents who have the
welfare of their children thoroughly at heart should  endeavor  to learn the
stellar science for themselves. Even though their ability  may  not  compare
with that of a professional  astrologer,  their  intimate  knowledge  of the
child and their deep interest will more than compensate  for  such  lack and
enable them to see most deeply into the child's character  by  means  of its
horoscope.


[PAGE 143]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

                           EDUCATION OF CHILDREN

    Respecting  the birth of the various  vehicles and the  influence  which
that has upon life,  we may say that during the time from birth to the  sev-
enth year the lines of growth of the physical body are determined, and as it
has  been  noted that sound is builder both in the great and small,  we  may
well  imagine that rhythm must have an enormous influence upon  the  growing
and sensitive little child's organism. The apostle John in the first chapter
of  his Gospel expresses this idea mystically in the  beautiful  words:  "In
the  beginning was the WORD...and without it was not anything made that  was
made... and the word became flesh."  The Word is a rhythmic sound, which is-
sued  from  the Creator,  reverberated through the  universe  and  marshaled
countless  millions of atoms into the multiplex variety of shapes and  forms
which we see about us. The mountain, the mayflower,  the mouse,  and the man
are all embodiments of the great Cosmic Word which is still sounding through
the universe and which is still building and ever building though unheard by
our  insensitive ears.  But though we do not hear that  wonderful  celestial
sound,  we may work upon the little child's body by terrestrial  music,  and
though the nursery  rhymes are without sense,  they are nevertheless bearers
of a wonderful rhythm. The more a child is taught to say,  sing,  and repeat
them,  to dance and to march to them,  the more music is incorporated into a
child's  daily life,  the stronger and healthier will be its body in  future
years.


[PAGE 144]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    There are two mottoes which apply during this period,  one to the  child
and the other to the parent: EXAMPLE AND IMITATION. No creature under heaven
is  more imitative than a little child, and its conduct in after years  will
depend largely upon the example set by its parents during its early life. It
is  no use to tell the child "not to mind."  It  has  no mind  wherewith  to
discriminate,  but follows its natural tendency, as water flows down a hill,
when it imitates.  Therefore it behooves every parent to remember from morn-
ing till night that watchful eyes are upon him all the time, waiting but for
him to act in order to follow his example.

    It is of the utmost importance that the child's clothing should be  very
loose,  particularly the clothing of little boys,  as chafing garments often
product vices which follow a man through life.

    If anyone should attempt forcibly to extract a babe from the  protecting
womb of its mother, the outrage would result in death,  because the babe had
not  yet arrived at a maturity sufficient to endure impacts of the  Physical
World.  In the three septenary periods which follow birth, the invisible ve-
hicles are still in the womb of Mother Nature. If we teach a child of tender
years to memorize,  or to think,  or if we arouse its feelings and emotions,
we  are in fact opening the protecting womb of nature,  and the results  are
equally as disastrous in other respects as a forced premature  birth.  Child


[PAGE 145]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

prodigies  usually become men and women of less than ordinary  intelligence.
We  should not hinder the child from learning or thinking OF HIS OWN  VOLI-
TION,  but we should not goad them on as parents often do to  nourish  their
own pride.

    When  the vital body is born at the age of seven a period of growth  be-
gins and a new motto, or rather a new relation,  is established between par-
ent  and  child.  This may be expressed  by  the  two  words  AUTHORITY  and
DISCIPLESHIP.  In  this  period the child is taught certain lessons which it
takes  upon faith in the authority of its teachers,  whether at home  or  at
school,  and  as memory is a faculty of the vital body it can  now  memorize
what is learned.  It is therefore eminently teachable;  particularly because
it  is unbiased by preconceived opinions which prevent most of us  from  ac-
cepting new views.  At the end of this second period,  from about twelve  to
fourteen,  the vital body has been so far developed that puberty is reached.
At the age of fourteen we have the birth of the desire body, which marks the
commencement  of self-assertion.  In earlier years the child regards  itself
more as belonging to a family,  and subordinate to the wishes of its parents
than after the fourteenth year. The reason is this: In the throat of the fe-
tus and the young child there is a gland called the thymus gland,  which  is
largest before birth,  then gradually diminishes through the years of child-
hood and finally disappears at ages which vary according to the characteris-
tics of the child.


[PAGE 146]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

    Anatomists  have been puzzled as to the function of this organ and  have
not  yet come to any settled conclusion, but it has been suggested that  be-
fore development of the red marrow bones, the child is not able to  manufac-
ture its own blood, and that therefore the thymus gland contains an essence,
supplied  by the parents,  upon which the child may draw during infancy  and
childhood,  till  able  to manufacture its own blood.  That  theory  is  ap-
proximately true,  and as the family blood flows in the child, it looks upon
itself as part of the family and not as an Ego.  But the moment it commences
to manufacture its own blood, the Ego asserts itself; it is no longer papa's
girl or mama's boy; it has an "I"-dentity of its own.

    Then  comes the critical age when parents reap what they have sown.  The
mind  has not yet been born,  nothing holds the desire nature in check,  and
much, very much, depends upon how the child has been taught in earlier years
and   what  example  the  parents  have  set.    At  this  point   in   life
self-assertion,  the feeling "I AM MYSELF,"  is  stronger than at any  other
time, and therefore authority should give place to advice. The parent should
practice  the utmost tolerance,  for at no time in life is a human being  as
much  in  need  of  sympathy as during the  seven  years  from  fourteen  to
twenty-one when the desire nature is rampant and unchecked.


[PAGE 147]                                                    LIFE AND DEATH

    It  is a crime to inflict corporal punishment upon a child at  any  age.
Might is never right,  and as the stronger,  parents should always have com-
passion  for  the weaker.  But there is one feature of  corporal  punishment
which makes it particularly dangerous to apply it to the youth: namely, that
it  wakens the passional nature which is already perhaps beyond the  control
of the growing boy.

    If we whip a dog, we shall soon break its spirit and transform it into a
cringing  cur,  and it is deplorable that some parents seem to regard it  as
their mission in life to break the spirit of their children with the rule of
the rod.  If there is one universal lack among the human race which is  more
apparent than any other,  it is lack of will,  and as parents we may  remedy
the evil in a large measure by guiding the wills of our children along  such
lines as dictated by our own more mature reason. Thus we help them to grow a
backbone instead of a wishbone,  with which unfortunately most of us are af-
flicted.  Therefore, never whip a child; if punishment is needed, correct by
withholding favors or withdrawing privileges.

    At the twenty-first year the birth of the mind transforms the youth into
an  adult fully equipped to commence his own life in the school  of  experi-
ence.

    Thus we have followed the human Spirit around a life cycle from death to
birth  and maturity;  we have seen how immutable law governs its every  step
and how it is ever encompassed by the loving care of the great and  glorious
Beings who are  the  ministers of God.  The method of his future development
will be explained in a later work which  will deal with THE CHRISTIAN MYSTIC 
INITIATION.

                              MOUNT ECCLESIA

      A DESCRIPTION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ROSICRUCIAN FELLOWSHIP

    Work  in  the Physical World requires physical means of  accomplishment;
therefore  a  tract  of land was bought in 1911  in the town  of  Oceanside,
ninety  miles  south of Los Angeles,  California.   SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  WAS
SELECTED BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF ETHER IN THE ATMOSPHERE THERE, AND THIS
SPOT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY FAVORED IN THAT RESPECT.

    On  this commanding site having a wide view of the great Pacific  Ocean,
of  snow  capped  mountains and smiling valleys,  we began to  establish our
Headquarters  in  the  latter part of 1911.  Soon after this  we  erected  a
sanctuary, the Pro-Ecclesia, where the Rosicrucian Temple Service is held at
appropriate times. The Rose Cross Healing Circle holds its meetings there to
help  sufferers,   and it is the place appointed for the united morning  and
evening  devotions of the workers.  In the latter half of 1920  we built  an
Ecclesia,   which  is designed to be a Temple of Healing.  The building,   a
beautiful domed structure, is of steel and reinforced concrete. It is twelve
sided  in shape,  corresponding to the twelve signs of the zodiac.   At  the
present  writing,   January,  1921,  the final work upon it  is  just  being
completed. The esoteric work of the Fellowship will be carried on here.

    We  have  also built a two-story Administration Building  to  house  the


[PAGE 149]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

general office,  the book department, the correspondence school in Christian
Mysticism which links Headquarters with students all over the world, and the
editorial  offices  of  our monthly publications,  notably  THE  ROSICRUCIAN
FELLOWSHIP MAGAZINE--RAYS FROM THE ROSE CROSS.  We have also an astrological
department which conducts a correspondence school.  Its offices are  located
on the second floor.

    The  whole first floor is occupied by a modern printing plant  and  book
bindery required to furnish the immense amount of literature needed in  this
work.   In  the book department we publish all the standard works  and  text
books  of the Rosicrucian Philosophy written by Max Heindel.  We are now  in
the process of publishing in book form his former lessons to students.

    In October,  1920, a Training School was established for the preparation
of candidates for the lecture field. it is our intention thereby to maintain
a  Lecture  Bureau,   from which we will send our lecturers  throughout  the
country to disseminate the Teachings and carry the message of our Philosophy
to the people to a greater extent than has before been possible.

    A Dining Hall with seating capacity for over one hundred people  affords
ample  accommodation for workers,  students,  and patients.  The  scientific
meatless diet served there preserves or restores health, as required in each
case. Furthermore,  it improves the vitality and mentality to an astonishing


[PAGE 150]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

degree. A large dormitory, and a number of cottages and tents provide living
quarters for all.

    By  the  liberal use of water and the expenditure of much labor,   Mount
Ecclesia   is  gradually being transformed into a luxuriant  tropical  park.
There is a deep spiritual purpose in this attempt to make the visible center
of  the new world movement beautiful,  for it fosters in the workers a poise
and peace which are absolutely essential to the proper performance of  their
work. Without that they cannot escape being disturbed by the flood of sorrow
and  trouble  which flows in Headquarters from members all over  the  world;
without  that  they cannot continue to put heart into the letters  of  help,
hope, and cheer which continually go out to souls who are groaning under the
burden  of  sickness;   but  by bathing their souls in  the  beauty  of  the
surroundings, whether consciously or not,  they gain in strength and grow in
grace;   they  become  better and better fitted for the Great  Work  in  the
Master's Vineyard.

    In order to aid those who feel the upward urge to prepare  intelligently
and  reverently  for the unfoldment of their inner latent spiritual  powers,
The  Rosicrucian  Fellowship  maintains  two  correspondence  courses  which
furnish  instruction  to  students  all  over the  world.   One  deals  with
ASTROLOGY, the other with CHRISTIAN MYSTICISM (The Rosicrucian Philosophy).

    The astrology to which we refer is not to be  confounded  with  fortune-
telling; it is a phase of the mystic religion, as sublime as the  stars with


[PAGE 151]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

which it deals.  To the mystic the stars are not dead bodies moving in space
in obedience to so-called blind natural law, but they are the embodiments of
THE  SEVEN  SPIRITS  BEFORE THE THRONE,  mighty Star-Angels  who  use  their
benevolent influences to guide other less exalted beings, humanity included,
upon the path of evolution.

    There is a side of the Moon which we never see,  but that hidden half is
as  potent  a factor in creating the ebb and flow as the part  of  the  Moon
which is visible. Similarly,  there is an invisible part of man which exerts
a powerful influence in life, and as the tides are measured by the motion of
Sun  and Moon,  so also the eventualities of existence are measured  by  the
circling  stars,   which may therefore be called The Clock of Destiny,   and
knowledge of their import is an immense power; to the competent astrologer a
horoscope reveals every secret of life.

    Thus, when you have given an astrologer the data of your birth, you have
given him the key to your innermost soul, and there is no secret that he may
not ferret out. This knowledge may be used for good or ill, to help or hurt,
according  to the nature of the man.  Only a friend should be  trusted  with
this key to your soul, and it should never be given to anyone base enough to
prostitute a spiritual science for material gain.

    To  the  medical man astrology is invaluable in diagnosing  disease  and
prescribing  a remedy,  for it reveals the hidden cause of all ailments in a


[PAGE 152]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

manner that has often perplexed the skeptic and dumbfounded the scoffer.

    The  opinion  of  thousands is of great value,  but it  does  not  prove
anything, for thousands may hold an opposite view; occasionally a single man
may  be right and the rest of the world moves,  as when  Galileo  maintained
that  the  earth  moves.  Today the whole world has been  converted  to  the
opinion  for  which  he suffered torture,  and we assert that AS  MAN  IS  A
COMPOSITE  BEING,   CURES ARE SUCCESSFUL ONLY IN PROPORTION AS  THEY  REMEDY
DEFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL, MORAL, AND MENTAL PLANES OF BEING. We also maintain
that  results may be obtained more easily at certain times when stellar rays
are  propitious  to healing of a particular disease,  or by  treatment  with
remedies previously prepared under auspicious conditions.

    If  you  are a parent,  the horoscope will aid you to  detect  the  evil
latent in your child and teach you how to apply the ounce of prevention.  It
will show you the good points also,  that you may make a better man or woman
of the Spirit entrusted to your care. It will reveal systematic weakness and
enable you to guard the health of your child;  it will show what talents are
there, and how the life may be lived to a maximum of usefulness.  Therefore,
the  message of the marching orbs is so important that you cannot afford  to
remain ignorant thereof.

    In  order to aid those who are willing to help themselves we maintain  a
Correspondence  Class  in Astrology,  but make no mistake,  we do not  teach
fortune-telling.  If that is what you are looking for,  we have nothing  for
you.


[PAGE 153]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

                         OUR LESSONS ARE SERMONS

    They  embody the highest moral and spiritual principles,  together  with
the loftiest system of ethics, for astrology is, to us, a phase of religion;
we never look at a horoscope without feeling that we are in a holy presence,
face to face with an immortal Spirit,  and our attitude is one of prayer for
light to guide that Spirit aright.


                       WE DO NOT CAST HOROSCOPES

    Despite  all  we  can  say,   many  people  write  enclosing  money  for
horoscopes,   forcing us to spend valuable  time writing letters of  refusal
and giving us the trouble of returning their money.  Please do not annoy us;
it will avail you nothing.


                  THE COURSE IN CHRISTIAN MYSTICISM

    CHRIST, taught the multitude in PARABLES, but explained the MYSTERIES to
His disciples.

    PAUL gave MILK to the babes, but MEAT to the strong.

    Max  Heindel,   the  founder and leader of The  Rosicrucian  Fellowship,
endeavored  to  follow  in their steps and give to  interested  and  devoted
students a DEEPER TEACHING than that promulgated in public.

    For  that  purpose  we  conduct a  correspondence  course  in  CHRISTIAN


[PAGE 154]                                         THE ROSICRUCIAN MYSTERIES

MYSTICISM.   The  General Secretary may admit applicants to the  preliminary
course,  but ADVANCEMENT into the deeper degrees depends upon merit.  it  is
for those alone who have been TRIED, and found true.


                      HOW TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION

    Anyone  who  is  not engaged in fortune-telling or  similar  methods  of
commercializing   spiritual  knowledge  will,   upon  request,   receive  an
application blank from the General Secretary,  Rosicrucian Fellowship.  When
this  blank  is  returned properly filled,  he may admit  the  applicant  to
instruction in either or both correspondence courses.


                        THE COST OF THE COURSES

    There  are  no fixed fees;  no esoteric instruction is ever put  in  the
balance  against  coin.   At the same time,  it cannot be given  FREE,   FOR
NOTHING,    for those who work to promulgate it must have the necessities of
life.  Type , paper, machinery, and postage also cost money,  and UNLESS YOU
PAY YOUR PART SOMEONE ELSE MUST PAY FOR YOU.

    There are a few who cannot contribute,  and who need these Teachings  as
much  or  more  than  those  who may take comfort  from  financial  ease  or
affluence.   If they make their condition known,  they will receive as  much
attention as the largest contributors, but others are expected to contribute
for their own good as well as for the good of the work.  Remember, A  CLOSED
HAND THAT DOES NOT GIVE CANNOT RECEIVE.

                               ADDENDA

    At  the  time of the printing of this edition,  1966,   The  Rosicrucian
Fellowship   Headquarters   continues  to  carry  forward  its  purpose   of
disseminating  the Western Wisdom Teachings along the lines started  by  Max
Heindel.   In  addition  to the Philosophy and Astrology  Courses  given  by
Correspondence, a Course of twenty-eight lessons in Bible Interpretation, is
now offered.  A number of additional books by Max Heindel have been added to
our list of publications,  and also those on Bible Interpretation by Corinne
Heline  (an early pupil of Max Heindel).  The number of volumes shipped  out
from Mt. Ecclesia to all parts of the world increases each year, and several
new  buildings have been erected since 1921,  including more  modern  living
quarters for workers.

    A  day  school is conducted every summer for at least four weeks  during
which classes in the Rosicrucian Philosophy,  Spiritual Astrology (including
erecting  of  the  chart,   delineation,  and  astro-analysis).   and  Bible
Interpretation are taught by teachers well versed in their subjects.  Anyone
interested  in the New Age Teachings is eligible to enroll,  provided he  or
she is not a hypnotist, or professionally engaged as a medium, a palmist, or
an astrologer.
