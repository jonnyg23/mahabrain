                    A TABLET ADDRESSED TO 
               `HIM WHO WILL BE MADE MANIFEST' 
 
          This is an epistle from this lowly servant to the All-Glorious 
     Lord--He Who hath been aforetime and will be 
     hereafter made manifest.  Verily He is the Most Manifest, 
     the Almighty.  
 
     IN the name of the Sovereign Lord, the Lord of 
Power.  
     Glorified is He before Whom all the dwellers 
of earth and heaven bow down in adoration and 
unto Whom all men turn in supplication.  He is the One 
Who holdeth in His grasp the mighty kingdom of all 
created things and unto Him shall all return.  He is the One 
Who revealeth whatsoever He willeth and by His injunction 
`Be Thou' all things have come into being.  
     This is an epistle from the letter `&amp;Tha'+F1 unto Him Who 
will be made manifest through the power of Truth--He 
Who is the All-Glorious, the Best Beloved--to affirm that 
all created things as well as myself bear witness for all time 
that there is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, 
the Self-Subsisting; that Thou art God, there is no God 
besides Thee and that all men shall be raised up to life 
through Thee.  
     Lauded and glorified be Thy name, O Lord, my God!  
 
+F1 This is the first letter of `&amp;Thamarih' which means `fruit'.  Shoghi 
+F1 Effendi, in his writings, refers to the &amp;Bab as the `&amp;Thamarih' (fruit) 
+F1 of the Tree of God's successive Revelations.  (See Shoghi Effendi's 
+F1 letter to the &amp;Baha'is of the East dated &amp;Naw-Ruz 110, page 5.)  
 
+P4 
     From all eternity I have indeed recognized Thee and 
unto all eternity will ever do so through Thine Own Self 
and not through any one else besides Thee.  Verily Thou 
art the Source of all knowledge, the Omniscient.  From 
everlasting I have besought and unto everlasting will beseech 
forgiveness for my limited understanding of Thee, 
aware as I am that there is no God but Thee, the All-Glorious, 
the Almighty.  
     I beg of Thee, O my Best Beloved, to pardon me and 
those who earnestly seek to promote Thy Cause; Thou art 
indeed the One Who forgiveth the sins of all mankind.  
And in this second year of my Revelation--a Revelation 
which took place at Thy behest--I bear witness that Thou 
art the Most Manifest, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Abiding; 
that of all things that exist on earth and in the heavens nothing 
whatsoever can frustrate Thy purpose and that Thou 
art the Knower of all things and the Lord of might and 
majesty.  
     Verily, we have believed in Thee and in Thy signs ere 
the dawn of Thy Manifestation, and in Thee are we all 
well-assured.  Verily, we have believed in Thee and in Thy 
signs after the fulfilment of Thy Manifestation, and in Thee 
do we all believe.  Verily, we have believed in Thee and in 
Thy signs at the hour of Thy Manifestation and bear witness 
that through Thine injunction `Be Thou' all things 
have been created.  
     Every Manifestation is but a revelation of Thine Own 
Self, with each of Whom we have truly appeared and we 
bow down in adoration before Thee.  Thou hast been, O 
my Best Beloved, and shalt ever be my witness throughout 
bygone times and in the days to come.  Verily, Thou art 
the All-Powerful, the Ever-Faithful, the Omnipotent.  
     I have testified to Thy oneness through Thine Own Self 
 
+P5 
before the dwellers of the heavens and the earth, bearing 
witness that, verily, Thou art the All-Glorious, the Best 
Beloved.  I have attained the recognition of Thee through 
Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the heavens and the 
earth, bearing witness that Thou art in truth the Almighty, 
the All-Praised.  I have glorified Thy Name through Thine 
Own Self before the dwellers of the heavens and the earth, 
bearing witness that Thou art indeed the Lord of power, He 
Who is the Most Manifest.  I have exalted Thy holiness 
through Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the 
heavens and the earth, bearing witness that in truth Thou 
art the Most Sanctified, the Most Holy.  I have praised Thy 
sanctity through Thine Own Self before the dwellers of 
the heavens and the earth, bearing witness that Thou art 
indeed the Indescribable, the Inaccessible, the Immeasurably 
Glorified.  I have extolled Thine overpowering majesty 
through Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the 
heavens and the earth, bearing witness that, verily, Thou 
and Thou alone art the Lord of might, the Eternal One, 
the Ancient of Days.  
     Hallowed and glorified art Thou; there is none other 
God but Thee and in truth unto Thee do we all return.  
     As to those who have put the kindred of &amp;Ali to death, 
ere long they shall realize to what depths of perdition they 
have descended.

               A SECOND TABLET ADDRESSED TO 
              `HIM WHO WILL BE MADE MANIFEST' 
 
          May the glances of Him Whom God shall make manifest 
     illumine this letter at the primary school.+F1  
 
                    He is the Most Glorious.  
 
     HE is God, no God is there but Him, the Almighty, the 
Best Beloved.  All that are in the heavens and on the earth 
and whatever lieth between them are His.  Verily He is the 
Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  
     This is a letter from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, 
unto God, the Almighty, the Best Beloved, to 
 
+F1 In one of His Tablets &amp;Abdu'l-Baha explains that some were misled 
+F1 by this statement and thought that the school referred to was 
+F1 a physical school for the training of unlettered children, whereas 
+F1 it referred to a spiritual school sanctified from the limits of the 
+F1 contingent world.  &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas also refers to 
+F1 this Epistle of the &amp;Bab in the following words:  
+F1     O Thou Supreme Pen!  Move over the Tablet by the leave of Thy 
+F1 Lord, the Creator of the heavens.  Call Thou then to mind the day when 
+F1 the Fountainhead of divine unity sought to attend the school which is 
+F1 sanctified of all save God, that perchance the righteous might become 
+F1 acquainted, to the extent of a needle's eye, with that which is concealed 
+F1 behind the veil of the inner mysteries of Thy Lord, the Almighty, the 
+F1 All-Knowing.  
+F1     Say, We, in truth, entered the school of inner meaning and exposition 
+F1 at a time when the minds of all that dwell on earth were wrapt in 
+F1 heedlessness.  We beheld what the Merciful Lord had revealed, accepted 
+F1 the gift He [the &amp;Bab] had offered Me of the verses of God, the Help in 
+F1 Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and hearkened to that to which He had 
+F1 attested in the Tablet.  We, verily, are the Witness.  We responded to 
+F1 His call at Our Own behest, and We are, in truth, the Ordainer.  
+F1     O people of the &amp;Bayan!  We entered the School of God when ye were 
+F1 slumbering on your couches, and perused the Tablet when ye were fast 
+F1 asleep.  By the righteousness of God, the True One, We had read it 
+F1 before it was revealed, and ye were utterly unaware.  Indeed Our knowledge 
+F1 had encompassed the Book when ye were yet unborn.  
+F1     These utterances are revealed according to your measure, not to 
+F1 God's, and unto this beareth witness that which is enshrined in the 
+F1 knowledge of God, did ye but know.  Unto this testifieth He Who is the 
+F1 Mouthpiece of God, could ye but understand.  By the righteousness of 
+F1 God!  Were We to lift the veil ye would swoon away.  Take heed lest ye 
+F1 dispute with Him and His Cause.  He hath indeed appeared in such wise 
+F1 as to encompass all things, whether of the past or of the future.  Were 
+F1 We to speak forth at this time in the language of the dwellers of the 
+F1 Kingdom, We would say that God raised up this School ere the earth 
+F1 and the heavens were brought into being, and We entered it before the 
+F1 letters `B' and `E' were joined and knit together.  
 
+P7 
affirm that the &amp;Bayan and such as bear allegiance to it are 
but a present from me unto Thee and to express my undoubting 
faith that there is no God but Thee, that the kingdoms 
of Creation and Revelation are Thine, that no one 
can attain anything save by Thy power and that He Whom 
Thou hast raised up is but Thy servant and Thy Testimony.  
I, indeed, beg to address Him Whom God shall make 
manifest, by Thy leave in these words:  `Shouldst Thou 
dismiss the entire company of the followers of the 
&amp;Bayan in the Day of the Latter Resurrection by a mere 
sign of Thy finger even while still a suckling babe, Thou 
wouldst indeed be praised in Thy indication.  And though 
no doubt is there about it, do Thou grant a respite of 
nineteen years as a token of Thy favour so that those who 
have embraced this Cause may be graciously rewarded by 
Thee.  Thou art verily the Lord of grace abounding.  Thou 
dost indeed suffice every created thing and causest it to be 
 
+P8 
independent of all things, while nothing in the heavens or 
on the earth or that which lieth between them can ever 
suffice Thee.'  
     Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the All-Knowing; 
Thou art indeed potent over all things.  
 
+P9 
 
          TABLET TO THE FIRST LETTER OF THE LIVING 
 
          This is that which We have revealed for the First Believer 
     in Him Whom God shall make manifest, that it may serve 
     as an admonition from Our presence unto all mankind.  
 
          In the Name of the Almighty, the Best Beloved.  
 
     LAUDED and glorified is He Who is the sovereign Lord 
of the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatever is between 
them.  Say, verily unto Him shall all return, and He 
is the One Who guideth at His Own behest whomsoever 
He pleaseth.  Say, all men beseech His blessings and He is 
supreme over all created things.  He is indeed the All-Glorious, 
the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.  
     This is an epistle from the letter `&amp;Tha' unto him who is 
the First Believer.  Bear thou witness that verily He is I, 
Myself, the Sovereign, the Omnipotent.  He is the One 
Who ordaineth life and death and unto Him shall all return.  
Indeed there is none other God but Him and all men 
bow down in adoration before Him.  Verily Thy Lord, 
God, shall presently recompense every one as He ordaineth, 
even swifter than uttering the words `Be thou, and it is'.  
     God hath in truth testified in His Book and so also have 
testified the company of His angels, His Messengers and 
those endued with divine knowledge, that thou hast 
believed in God and in His signs and that everyone is 
guided aright by virtue of thy guidance.  This is indeed a 
boundless grace which God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, 
hath graciously conferred upon thee aforetime 
 
+P10 
and will confer hereafter.  And since thou didst believe in 
God before the creation, He hath in truth, at His own 
behest, raised thee up in every Revelation.  There is no God 
but Him, the Sovereign Protector, the All-Glorious.  
     It behooveth you to proclaim the Cause of God unto all 
created things as a token of grace from His presence; no 
God is there but Him, the Most Generous, the All-Compelling.  
     Say:  All matters must be referred to the Book of God; 
I am indeed the First to believe in God and in His signs; 
I am the One Who divulgeth and proclaimeth the Truth 
and I have been invested with every excellent title of God, 
the Mighty, the Incomparable.  Verily I have attained the 
Day of the First Manifestation and by the bidding of the 
Lord and as a token of His grace, I shall attain the Day of 
the Latter Manifestation.  There is no God but Him and at 
the appointed hour everyone shall bow down unto Him 
in adoration.  
     I render thanks and yield praise unto God for having 
been chosen by Him as the Exponent of His Cause in bygone 
days and in the days to come; there is none other God 
save Him, the Glorified, the All-Praised, the Ever-Abiding.  
Whatever is in the heavens and on the earth is His and 
through Him are we guided aright.  
     O people of the &amp;Bayan!  Those who embrace the Truth 
must turn unto Me, as ordained in the Book and divine 
guidance will be vouchsafed to whosoever attaineth My 
presence.  
 
+P11 
               EXTRACTS FROM AN EPISTLE TO 
                      &amp;MUHAMMAD &amp;SHAH 
 
     THE substance wherewith God hath created Me is not the 
clay out of which others have been formed.  He hath 
conferred upon Me that which the worldly-wise can never 
comprehend, nor the faithful discover ... I am one of the 
sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God.  Whosoever 
hath recognized Me, hath known all that is true and right, 
and hath attained all that is good and seemly; and whosoever 
hath failed to recognize Me, hath turned away from 
all that is true and right and hath succumbed to everything 
evil and unseemly.  
     I swear by the righteousness of Thy Lord, the Lord of all 
created things, the Lord of all the worlds!  Were a man to 
rear in this world as many edifices as possible and worship 
God through every virtuous deed which God's knowledge 
embraceth, and attain the presence of the Lord, and were he, 
even to a measure less than that which is accountable before 
God, to bear in his heart a trace of malice towards Me, all 
his deeds would be reduced to naught and he would be 
deprived of the glances of God's favour, become the object 
of His wrath and assuredly perish.  For God hath ordained 
that all the good things which lie in the treasury of His 
knowledge shall be attained through obedience unto Me, 
and every fire recorded in His Book, through disobedience 
unto Me.  Methinks in this day and from this station I 
behold all those who cherish My love and follow My 
behest abiding within the mansions of Paradise, and the 
entire company of Mine adversaries consigned to the lowest 
depths of hell-fire.  
 
+P12 
     By My life!  But for the obligation to acknowledge the 
Cause of Him Who is the Testimony of God ... I would 
not have announced this unto thee...  All the keys of 
heaven God hath chosen to place on My right hand, and all 
the keys of hell on My left...  
     I am the Primal Point from which have been generated 
all created things.  I am the Countenance of God Whose 
splendour can never be obscured, the Light of God 
Whose radiance can never fade.  Whoso recognizeth Me, 
assurance and all good are in store for him, and whoso 
faileth to recognize Me, infernal fire and all evil await 
him...  
     I swear by God, the Peerless, the Incomparable, the 
True One:  for no other reason hath He--the supreme 
Testimony of God--invested Me with clear signs and 
tokens than that all men may be enabled to submit to His 
Cause.  
     By the righteousness of Him Who is the Absolute Truth, 
were the veil to be lifted, thou wouldst witness on this 
earthly plane all men sorely afflicted with the fire of the 
wrath of God, a fire fiercer and greater than the fire of hell, 
with the exception of those who have sought shelter 
beneath the shade of the tree of My love.  For they in very 
truth are the blissful...  
     God beareth Me witness, I was not a man of learning, 
for I was trained as a merchant.  In the year sixty+F1 God 
graciously infused my soul with the conclusive evidences 
and weighty knowledge which characterize Him Who is 
the Testimony of God--may peace be upon Him--until 
finally in that year I proclaimed God's hidden Cause and 
unveiled its well-guarded Pillar, in such wise that no one 
could refute it.  `That he who should perish might perish 
 
+F1 1260 A.H. (1844 A.D.)  
 
+P13 
with a clear proof before him and he who should live 
might live by clear proof.'+F1  
     In that same year [year 60] I despatched a messenger and 
a book unto thee, that thou mightest act towards the Cause 
of Him Who is the Testimony of God as befitteth the 
station of thy sovereignty.  But inasmuch as dark, dreadful 
and dire calamity had been irrevocably ordained by the 
Will of God, the book was not submitted to thy presence, 
through the intervention of such as regard themselves the 
well-wishers of the government.  Up to the present, when 
nearly four years have passed, they have not duly presented 
it to Your Majesty.  However, now that the fateful 
hour is drawing nigh, and because it is a matter of faith, 
not a worldly concern, therefore I have given thee a 
glimpse of what hath transpired.  
     I swear by God!  Shouldst thou know the things which in 
the space of these four years have befallen Me at the hands 
of thy people and thine army, thou wouldst hold thy 
breath from fear of God, unless thou wouldst rise to obey 
the Cause of Him Who is the Testimony of God and make 
amends for thy shortcomings and failure.  
     While I was in &amp;Shiraz the indignities which befell Me at 
the hands of its wicked and depraved Governor waxed so 
grievous that if thou wert acquainted with but a tithe 
thereof, thou wouldst deal him retributive justice.  For as a 
result of his unmitigated oppression, thy royal court hath 
become, until the Day of Resurrection, the object of the 
wrath of God.  Moreover, his indulgence in alcohol had 
grown so excessive that he was never sober enough to 
make a sound judgement.  Therefore, disquieted, I was 
obliged to set out from &amp;Shiraz with the aim of attaining the 
enlightened and exalted court of Your Majesty.  The 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 8:44  
 
+P14 
&amp;Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih then became aware of the truth of 
the Cause and manifested exemplary servitude and devotion 
to His chosen ones.  When some of the ignorant people in 
his city arose to stir up sedition, he defended the divine 
Truth by affording Me protection for a while in the 
privacy of the Governor's residence.  At length, having 
attained the good-pleasure of God, he repaired to his habitation 
in the all-highest Paradise.  May God reward him 
graciously...  
     Following his ascension to the eternal Kingdom, the 
vicious &amp;Gurgin, resorting to all manner of treachery, false 
oaths and coercion, sent Me away from &amp;Isfahan with an 
escort of five guards on a journey which lasted seven days, 
without providing the barest necessities for My travel 
(Alas!  Alas! for the things which have touched Me!), until 
eventually Your Majesty's order came, instructing Me to 
proceed to &amp;Maku...  
     I swear by the Most Great Lord!  Wert thou to be told 
in what place I dwell, the first person to have mercy on Me 
would be thyself.  In the heart of a mountain is a fortress 
[&amp;Maku] ... the inmates of which are confined to two guards 
and four dogs.  Picture, then, My plight...  I swear by the 
truth of God!  Were he who hath been willing to treat Me 
in such a manner to know Who it is Whom he hath so 
treated, he, verily, would never in his life be happy.  Nay-- 
I, verily, acquaint thee with the truth of the matter--it is as 
if he hath imprisoned all the Prophets, and all the men of 
truth and all the chosen ones...  
     When this decree was made known unto Me, I wrote to 
him who administereth the affairs of the kingdom, saying:  
`Put Me to death, I adjure thee by God, and send My head 
wherever thou pleasest.  For surely an innocent person such 
as I, cannot reconcile himself to being consigned to a place 
 
+P15 
reserved for criminals and let his life continue.'  My plea 
remained unanswered.  Evidently His Excellency the &amp;Haji, 
is not fully aware of the truth of our Cause.  It would be 
far more heinous a deed to sadden the hearts of the faithful, 
whether men or women, than to lay waste the sacred House 
of God.  
     Verily, the One True God beareth Me witness that in 
this Day I am the true mystic Fane of God, and the Essence 
of all good.  He who doeth good unto Me, it is as if he doeth 
good unto God, His angels and the entire company of His 
loved ones.  He who doeth evil unto Me, it is as if he doeth 
evil unto God and His chosen ones.  Nay, too exalted is the 
station of God and of His loved ones for any person's good 
or evil deed to reach their holy threshold.  Whatever 
reacheth Me is ordained to reach Me; and that which hath 
come unto Me, to him who giveth will it revert.  By the One 
in Whose hand is My soul, he hath cast no one but himself 
into prison.  For assuredly whatsoever God hath decreed 
for Me shall come to pass and naught else save that which 
God hath ordained for us shall ever touch us.  Woe betide 
him from whose hands floweth evil, and blessed the man 
from whose hands floweth good.  Unto no one do I take 
My plaint save to God; for He is the best of judges.  Every 
state of adversity or bliss is from Him alone, and He is the 
All-Powerful, the Almighty.  
     In brief, I hold within My grasp whatsoever any man 
might wish of the good of this world and of the next.  Were 
I to remove the veil, all would recognize Me as their Best 
Beloved, and no one would deny Me.  Let not this assertion 
astound Your Majesty; inasmuch as a true believer in the 
unity of God who keepeth his eyes directed towards Him 
alone, will regard aught else but Him as utter nothingness.  
I swear by God!  I seek no earthly goods from thee, be it as 
 
+P16 
much as a mustard seed.  Indeed, to possess anything of this 
world or of the next would, in My estimation, be tantamount 
to open blasphemy.  For it ill beseemeth the believer 
in the unity of God to turn his gaze to aught else, much 
less to hold it in his possession.  I know of a certainty that 
since I have God, the Ever-Living, the Adored One, I am 
the possessor of all things, visible and invisible...  
     In this mountain I have remained alone, and have come 
to such a pass that none of those gone before Me have 
suffered what I have suffered, nor any transgressor endured 
what I have endured!  I render praise unto God and yet 
again praise Him.  I find Myself free from sorrow, inasmuch 
as I abide within the good-pleasure of My Lord and 
Master.  Methinks I am in the all-highest Paradise, rejoicing 
at My communion with God, the Most Great.  Verily this 
is a bounty which God hath conferred upon Me; and He 
is the Lord of unbounded blessings.  
     I swear by the truth of God!  Wert thou to know that 
which I know, thou wouldst forgo the sovereignty of this 
world and of the next, that thou mightest attain My good-pleasure, 
through thine obedience unto the True One...  
Wert thou to refuse, the Lord of the world would raise up 
one who would exalt His Cause, and the Command of God 
would, verily, be carried into effect.  
     Through the grace of God nothing can frustrate My 
purpose, and I am fully conscious of that which God hath 
bestowed upon Me as a token of His favour.  If it were My 
will, I would disclose to Your Majesty all things; but I have 
not done this, nor will I do it, that the Truth may be 
distinguished from aught else beside it, and this prophecy 
uttered by the &amp;Imam &amp;Baqir--may peace rest upon Him 
--be fully realized:  `What must needs befall us in &amp;Adhirbayjan 
is inevitable and without parallel.  When this 
 
+P17 
happeneth, rest ye in your homes and remain patient as we 
have remained patient.  As soon as the Mover moveth make 
ye haste to attain unto Him, even though ye have to crawl 
over the snow.'  
     I implore pardon of God for Myself and for all things 
related to Me and affirm, `Praise be to God, the Lord of all 
the worlds'.  
 
+P18 
               EXTRACTS FROM ANOTHER EPISTLE TO 
                        &amp;MUHAMMAD &amp;SHAH 
 
     GLORY be unto Him Who knoweth all that is in the 
heavens and in the earth.  Verily there is no God but Him, 
the sovereign Ruler, the Almighty, the Great.  
     He is the One Who on the Day of Severing shall pass 
judgement through the power of Truth; indeed no God is 
there besides Him, the Peerless, the All-Compelling, the 
Exalted.  He is the One Who holdeth within His grasp the 
kingdom of all created things; there is none other God but 
Him, the Single, the Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, the 
Inaccessible, the Most Great.  
     At this moment I testify unto God, even as He testified 
unto Himself before the creation of all things:  Verily 
there is no God save Him, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.  
And I bear witness unto whatsoever He hath fashioned or 
will fashion, even as He Himself, in the majesty of His 
glory, hath borne witness:  No God is there but Him, the 
Peerless, the Self-Subsisting, the Most Wondrous.  
     In God, Who is the Lord of all created things, have I 
placed My whole trust.  There is no God but Him, the 
Peerless, the Most Exalted.  Unto Him have I resigned 
Myself and into His hands have I committed all My affairs.  
No God is there besides Him, the supreme Ruler, the 
resplendent Truth.  Indeed all-sufficient is He for Me; independently 
of all things doth He suffice, while nothing in 
the heavens or in the earth but Him sufficeth.  He, in very 
truth, is the Self-Subsisting, the Most Severe.  
     Praise be unto Him Who at this very moment perceiveth 
 
+P19 
in this remote prison the goal of My desire.  He is the One 
Who beareth witness unto Me at all times and beholdeth 
Me ere the inception of `after &amp;Hin'.+F1  
     Why didst thou pronounce judgement without remembering 
God, the All-Wise?  How canst thou endure in 
the fire?  Indeed, mighty and most severe is thy God.  
     Thou pridest thyself in the things thou dost possess, yet 
no believer in God and in His signs, nor any righteous man 
would ever deign to regard them.  This mortal life is like 
unto the carcass of a dog, around which none would gather, 
nor would any partake thereof, except those who gainsay 
the life hereafter.  Verily it is incumbent upon thee to 
become a true believer in God, the All-Possessing, the 
Almighty, and to turn away from the one who guideth 
thee into the torment of hell-fire.  
     I have been waiting a while that perchance thou wouldst 
take heed and be rightly guided.  How canst thou answer 
God on the day which is near at hand--the day whereon 
witnesses will stand forth to testify in the presence of thy 
Lord, the Lord of all the worlds?  
     By the righteousness of Him Who hath called thee into 
being and unto Whom ere long thou shalt return, if thou 
remainest, at the moment of death, a disbeliever in the 
signs of thy Lord thou shalt surely enter the gates of hell, 
and none of the deeds thy hands have wrought will profit 
thee, nor shalt thou find a patron nor anyone to plead for 
thee.  Fear thou God and pride not thyself on thine earthly 
possessions, inasmuch as what God doth possess is better 
for them that tread the path of righteousness.  
     Verily in this Day all that dwell on earth are the servants

of God.  As to those who truly believe in God and are well 
assured in the signs revealed by Him, perchance He will 
graciously forgive them the things their hands have committed, 
and will grant them admission into the precincts 
of His mercy.  He, in truth, is the Ever-Forgiving, the 
Compassionate.  But the verdict of divine chastisement is 
pronounced against those who have turned away disdainfully 
from Me and have repudiated the conclusive 
proofs and the unerring Book with which God hath invested 
Me, and on the Day of Severing they shall find no 
protector or helper.  
     I swear by Him Who createth all beings and unto Whom 
all shall return, if anyone at the hour of death beareth 
hatred towards Me or disputeth the clear tokens wherewith 
I have been invested, then naught but afflictive torment shall 
be his lot.  On that day no ransom will be accepted, nor will 
any intercession be permitted, unless God so please.  Verily 
He is the All-Compelling, the All-Glorious; and no God 
is there other than Him, the sovereign Ruler, the Almighty, 
the Most Severe.  
     If thou rejoicest in My imprisonment, woe then unto 
thee for the grievous torment which will soon overtake 
thee.  Indeed God hath permitted no one to pass unfair 
judgement, and if thou wouldst fain do so, then soon shalt 
thou learn.  
     From the first day that I cautioned thee not to wax 
proud before God until the present time, four years have 
elapsed, and during this space naught have I witnessed, 
either from thee or from thy soldiers, except dire oppression 
and disdainful arrogance.  Methinks thou dost imagine that 
I wish to gain some paltry substance from this earthly life.  
Nay, by the righteousness of My Lord!  In the estimation 
of them that have fixed their eyes upon the merciful Lord, 
 
+P21 
the riches of the world and its trappings are worth as much 
as the eye of a dead body, nay even less.  Far from His 
glory be what they associate with Him!...  I seek patience 
only in God.  Verily He is the best protector and the best 
helper.  No refuge do I seek save God.  Verily He is the 
guardian and the best supporter...  
     I swear by the glory of God, My Lord, the Most Exalted, 
the Most Great, He assuredly, as is divinely ordained, will 
make His Cause shine resplendent, while there will be no 
helper for the unjust.  If thou hast any scheme, produce thy 
scheme.  Indeed every revelation of authority proceedeth 
from God.  In Him do I trust and unto Him do I turn.  
     Hast thou heard anyone of old passing a judgement similar 
to the one thou didst contrive or like unto that whereto 
thou didst give thine assent?  Woe then unto the oppressors!  
Both thine intentions and the manner in which thou dealest 
with the people clearly demonstrate thine infidelity 
towards God, hence He hath ordained a severe chastisement 
for thee.  Verily I seek patience only in God, and Him do I 
regard as the goal of My desire.  This signifieth that I have 
the undoubted Truth on My side.  
     If thou art not apprehensive that the truth might be 
revealed and the works of the ungodly be brought to 
naught, why summonest thou not the divines of the land, 
and then summon Me, so that I may confound them forthwith, 
even as those disbelievers whom I have previously 
confounded?  This is My sure testimony unto thee and unto 
them, if they speak the truth.  Summon thou all of them.  
Should they then be able to utter words like unto this, thou 
wouldst know that their cause is worthy of attention.  Nay, 
by the righteousness of My Lord!  They are bereft of power, 
nor are they endued with perception.  They professed faith 
in the past without understanding its significance, then 
 
+P22 
later they repudiated the Truth; for they are devoid of 
discernment.  
     If thou hast decided to shed My blood, wherefore dost 
thou delay?  Thou art now endowed with power and 
authority.  For Me it will prove an infinite bounty conferred 
by God, while for thee and for them that would commit 
such an act it will amount to a chastisement meted out by 
Him.  
     How great the blessedness that would await Me, wert 
thou to pass a verdict such as this; and what immense joy 
would be Mine, shouldst thou agree to do this!  This is a 
bounty which God hath reserved for them that enjoy near 
access to His court.  Give then thy leave and wait no longer.  
In truth, mighty is thy Lord, the Avenger.  
     Art thou not ashamed in the presence of God for consenting 
to the consignment to a fortress of Him Who is the 
Testimony of God, and His being made captive in the 
hands of the faithless?  Woe betide thee and them who rejoice 
at this moment in inflicting so dire a humiliation upon 
Me...  
     I swear by Him Who hath called Me into being, I can 
discover no trace of sinfulness in Myself, nor have I followed 
aught but the Truth; and unto Me God is sufficient 
witness.  Fie upon the world and its people and upon those 
who take delight in earthly riches, while oblivious of the 
life to come.  
     Were the veil to be removed from thine eye thou 
wouldst crawl unto Me on thy breast, even through the 
snow, from fear of the chastisement of God which is swift 
and near at hand.  By the righteousness of Him Who hath 
created thee, wert thou to be acquainted with that which 
hath transpired during thy reign, thou wouldst wish not to 
have issued from thy father's loins, but rather to have passed 
 
+P23 
into oblivion.  However, that which God, thy Lord, had 
ordained hath presently come to pass, and woe betide the 
oppressors in this day.  
     Methinks thou hast not perused the unerring Book.  If 
thou art satisfied with thine own way and dost not wish 
to follow the Truth, then to Me be My way and to thee 
thine.  If thou aidest Me not, why dost thou seek to abase 
Me?  Verily, God is the hearer of the suppliant, and in Him 
all things find their highest consummation, both in this 
world and in the world to come.  
     Far from the glory of God, the Lord of heaven and earth, 
the Lord of creation, be that which is affirmed of Him by 
the peoples of the world, except by such as faithfully observe 
His precepts.  May the peace of God rest upon the 
sincere among His servants.  
     All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.

               EXTRACTS FROM A FURTHER EPISTLE TO 
                         &amp;MUHAMMAD &amp;SHAH 
 
     THIS is an Epistle from Him Who is the true, the undoubted 
Leader.  Herein is revealed the law of all things for 
those who fain would heed His Call or wish to be reckoned 
among them that are guided aright.  Herein is enshrined the 
law of all things for such as would bear witness to the 
Revelation of thy Lord in accordance with this clear 
balance.  Verily the ordinances of God concerning all things 
were formerly set forth in eloquent Arabic.  Indeed those 
whose souls have been created through the splendour of 
the light of thy Lord recognize the Truth and are numbered 
with such as faithfully obey the One True God and are well 
assured...  
     O &amp;Muhammad!  The Decree of thy Lord was fulfilled 
four years ago; and ever since the inception of the Cause 
of thy Lord I have warned thee to fear God and not to be of 
the ignorant.  I despatched a messenger unto thee with a 
truly resplendent Tablet, but the followers of the devil 
turned him away disdainfully and interposed themselves 
between him and thee.  They expelled him from the land 
whereof thou art the undisputed sovereign.  Thus hath the 
good of this world and of the next escaped thee, unless thou 
submit to the commandment ordained by God and be of 
them that are rightly guided.  
     On My return from the sacred House of God+F1 I sent thee 
a Message similar to, nay even greater than the one I had 
previously sent unto thee.  Indeed God is the best protector 
 
+F1 The &amp;Ka'bah in Mecca 
 
+P25 
and witness.  I despatched a messenger unto thee with 
Epistles revealed by Me, that thou mightest obey the command 
of God and not be of them that have repudiated the 
Truth.  The oppressor, however, committed a thing the like 
of which no one would commit, not even any of the 
wicked, nor anyone among the vile wrong-doers...  
     The tribulations which I have suffered in this land, no 
one of old hath suffered.  Verily unto God shall revert the 
whole affair, and He in truth is the best protector and is 
cognizant of all.  The things which have, from the first day 
till now, befallen Me at the hand of thy people are but the 
work of Satan.+F1  Ever since the Cause of thy Lord hath 
appeared none of thy deeds hath been acceptable, and thou 
hast been lost in palpable error while all thou couldst see 
appeared to thee as deeds performed for the sake of thy 
Lord.  In truth thy day is nigh at hand and thou shalt be 
questioned concerning all this, and assuredly God is not 
heedless of the deeds of the wicked.  
     Had it not been for thee, thy supporters would not have 
disdainfully rejected Me, though they have gone more 
widely astray than the foolish.  
     Dost thou imagine him whom thou hast appointed 
Chancellor in thy kingdom to be the best leader and the 
best supporter?  Nay, I swear by thy Lord.  He will bring 
thee into grievous trouble by reason of that which Satan 
instilleth in his heart, and verily, he himself is Satan.  He 
comprehendeth not a single letter from the Book of 
God and is seized with fear by reason of that which his 
hands have wrought.  Fain would he extinguish the light 
which thy Lord hath kindled, so that the old impiety which 
is concealed in his inner being may not be revealed.  Hadst 
thou not appointed him as thy Chancellor no one would 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 4:119  
 
+P26 
have paid him the slightest attention.  Indeed in the estimation 
of the people he is naught but manifest darkness...  
     Fear thou God and suffer not thy soul to be chastised 
beyond that with which it hath already been tormented; 
for ere long thou shalt pass away and shalt declare thyself 
clear of the devil whom thou hast appointed as thy Chancellor, 
saying:  `O would that I had not taken the devil as my 
Chancellor, nor appointed an impostor as my guide and 
adviser.'  
     Why dost thou burden thy soul with that which is far 
more abject than the deeds of Pharaoh, and still callest thyself 
one of the faithful?  How dost thou peruse the verses of 
the &amp;Qur'an, while thou art of the unjust?  Never would the 
Jews, nor the Christians nor any such people as have 
rejected the truth consent to inflict wrongs upon the son of 
their Prophet's daughter.  Woe betide thee, for the day of 
chastisement is approaching.  Dost thou not dread the 
wrath of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Lord of the heavens, 
the Lord of all worlds?  Indeed these manifest verses are conclusive 
testimony for those who seek true guidance.  
     I have no desire to seize thy property, even to the extent 
of a grain of mustard, nor do I wish to occupy thy position.  
If thou followest Me not, then unto thee be the things thou 
dost possess, and unto Me the land of unfailing security.  If 
thou obeyest Me not, wherefore dost thou look disdainfully 
upon Me and seek to treat Me with sore injustice?  
Verily, behold My habitation--a lofty mountain wherein 
no one dwelleth.  Woe betide them that wrongfully do injustice 
to people, and unjustly and deceitfully usurp the 
property of the believers in violation of His lucid Book; 
whereas I, Who, in very truth, am the rightful Sovereign 
of all men, designated by the true, the undeniable Leader, 
would never infringe on the integrity of the substance of 
 
+P27 
the people, were it to the extent of a grain of mustard, nor 
would I treat them unjustly.  Rather would I consort with 
them even as one of themselves, and I would be their witness.  
     That which devolveth upon Me is but to mention the 
Book of thy Lord and to deliver this clear Message.  If thou 
wishest to enter the gates of Paradise, lo, they are open 
before thy face and no harm can reach Me from anyone.  
Every missive which up till now I have directed unto thee 
and unto the custodian of thy affairs hath been but a token 
of My bounty to you both, that perchance ye may grow 
anxious about the day which is nigh at hand.  Nevertheless 
from the moment ye waxed disdainful, divine judgement 
was passed upon you in the Book of God, for in truth ye 
both have denied your Lord and are numbered with them 
that will perish...  This is indeed My last reminder unto 
you, and I shall make no mention of you hereafter, nor 
shall I make any remark other than affirming you as 
infidels.  
     Unto God do I commit Mine affair and yours, and He 
verily is the best Judge.  Were ye to return, however, ye 
would be granted whatever ye desire of earthly possessions 
and of the ineffable delights of the life to come, and ye 
would inherit such glorious might and majesty as your 
minds can scarce conceive in this mortal life.  But if ye fail 
to return then upon ye shall be your transgressions.  
     Ye cannot alter the things which the Almighty hath 
prescribed unto Me.  Naught shall touch Me besides that 
which God, My Lord, hath pre-ordained for Me.  In Him 
have I placed My whole trust and upon Him do the faithful 
place their complete reliance.  
     Bear Thou witness unto Me, O Lord.  By sending forth 
this resplendent Epistle I shall have proclaimed Thy Verses 
 
+P28 
unto both of them and shall have fulfilled Thy Testimony 
for them.  I am well pleased to lay down My life in Thy 
path and ere long to return to Thy presence.  Unto Thee be 
praise in the heavens and on the earth.  Deal with them 
according to Thy decree.  In truth Thou art the best protector 
and helper.  
     Set right, O Lord, such disorders as people stir up, and 
cause Thy Word to shine resplendent throughout the 
earth, so that no trace of the ungodly may remain.  
     I beg forgiveness of Thee, O My Lord, for that which I 
have uttered in Thy Epistle, and I repent unto Thee.  I am 
but one of Thy servants who give praise to Thee.  Glorified 
art Thou; no God is there but Thee.  In Thee have I placed 
My whole trust and of Thee do I beg pardon for being a 
suppliant at Thy door.  
     Sanctified is God thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty 
Throne, from that which the people wrongfully and without 
the guidance of His lucid Book, affirm of Him.  Peace 
be upon them that beseech forgiveness from God thy Lord, 
saying:  `Verily, praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.'  
 
+P29 
               EXTRACTS FROM A TABLET CONTAINING WORDS 
                  ADDRESSED TO THE SHERIF OF MECCA 
 
     O SHERIF!...  All thy life thou hast accorded worship 
unto Us, but when We manifested Ourself unto thee, thou 
didst desist from bearing witness unto Our Remembrance, 
and from affirming that He is indeed the Most Exalted, the 
Sovereign Truth, the All-Glorious.  Thus hath Thy Lord 
put thee to proof in the Day of Resurrection.  Verily He is 
the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.  
     For hadst thou uttered `Here am I' at the time We sent 
thee the Book, We would have admitted thee to the company 
of such of Our servants as truly believe, and would 
have graciously praised thee in Our Book, until the Day 
when all men shall appear before Us for judgement.  This 
is in truth far more advantageous unto thee than all the 
acts of worship thou hast performed for thy Lord during 
all thy life, nay, from the beginning that hath no beginning.  
Assuredly this is what would have served and will ever 
serve thy best interests.  Verily We are cognizant of all 
things.  Yet notwithstanding that We had called thee into 
being for the purpose of attaining Our presence in the Day 
of Resurrection, thou didst shut thyself out from Us without 
any reason or explicit Writ; whereas hadst thou been 
among such as are endowed with the knowledge of the 
&amp;Bayan, thou wouldst have, at the sight of the Book, 
testified forthwith that there is no God but Him, the Help in 
Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and wouldst have affirmed that 
He Who hath revealed the &amp;Qur'an, hath likewise revealed 
this Book, that every word of it is from God, and unto it 
we all bear allegiance.  
 
+P30 
     However, that which was preordained hath come to 
pass.  Shouldst thou return unto Us while revelation still 
continueth through Us, We shall transform thy fire into 
light.  Truly We are powerful over all things.  But if thou 
failest in this task, thou shalt find no way open to thee other 
than to embrace the Cause of God and to implore that the 
matter of thine allegiance be brought to the attention of 
Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He may 
graciously enable thee to prosper and cause thy fire to be 
transformed into light.  This is that which hath been sent 
down unto Us.  Should this not come to pass, whatever We 
have set down shall remain binding and irrevocably decreed 
by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and 
We shall therefore banish thee from Our presence as a 
token of justice on Our part.  Verily we are equitable in Our 
judgement.  
 
+P31 
               ADDRESS TO A MUSLIM DIVINE 
 
     O &amp;ABDU'S-SAHIB!  Verily God and every created thing 
testify that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, 
the Best Beloved...  
     Thy vision is obscured by the belief that divine revelation 
ended with the coming of &amp;Muhammad, and unto this 
We have borne witness in Our first epistle.  Indeed, He Who 
hath revealed verses unto &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, 
hath likewise revealed verses unto &amp;Ali-Muhammad.  For 
who else but God can reveal to a man such clear and manifest 
verses as overpower all the learned?  Since thou hast 
acknowledged the revelation of &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle 
of God, then there is no other way open before thee but to 
testify that whatever is revealed by the Primal Point hath 
also proceeded from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  
Is it not true that the &amp;Qur'an hath been sent 
down from God and that all men are powerless before its 
revelation?  Likewise these words have also been revealed 
by God, if thou dost but perceive.  What is there in the 
&amp;Bayan which keepeth thee back from recognizing these 
verses as being sent forth by God, the Inaccessible, the Most 
Exalted, the All-Glorious?  
     The essence of these words is this:  Were We to bring 
thee to a reckoning, thou wouldst prove thyself empty-handed; 
We in truth know all things.  Hadst thou uttered 
`yea' on hearing the Words of God, thou wouldst have 
been seen to have been worshipping God from the beginning 
that hath no beginning until the present day, never to 
have disobeyed Him, not even for the twinkling of an eye.  
 
+P32 
Yet, neither the upright deeds thou hast wrought during all 
thy life, nor the exertions thou didst make to banish every 
thought from thy heart save that of the good-pleasure of 
God, none of these did in truth profit thee, not even to the 
extent of a grain of mustard seed, inasmuch as thou didst 
veil thyself from God and tarried behind at the time of His 
manifestation.  
     Verily all the divines in the land of &amp;Kaf [&amp;Kufih] shall, 
even as thyself, be asked by God:  `Is it not strange that a 
Messenger should have come to you with a Book, and ye, 
while confessing your powerlessness, refused to follow the 
Faith of God which He had brought, and ye persisted in 
your disbelief?'  Therefore unto thee shall be assigned the 
fire which was meant for those who turned away from God 
in that land, inasmuch as thou art their leader; would that 
thou might be of them who heed.  
     Hadst thou faithfully obeyed the Decree of God, all the 
inhabitants of thy land would have followed thee, and would 
have themselves entered into the celestial Paradise, content 
with the good-pleasure of God for evermore.  However, on 
that day thou shalt wish that God had not created thee.  
     Thou hast set thyself up as one of the learned in the 
Faith of &amp;Islam, that thou mightest save the believers, yet 
thou didst cause thy followers to descend into the fire, for 
when the verses of God were sent forth thou didst deprive 
thyself therefrom and yet reckoned thyself to be of the 
righteous...  Nay, by the life of Him Whom God shall 
make manifest!  Neither thou nor any one among His servants 
can produce the slightest proof, while God shineth 
resplendent above His creatures and through the power of 
His behest standeth supreme over all that dwell in the kingdoms 
of heaven and earth and in whatever lieth between 
them.  Verily He is potent over all created things.  
 
+P33 
     Thou hath named thyself &amp;Abdu's &amp;Sahib [servant of the 
Lord].  Yet, while God hath, in very truth, made thy Lord 
manifest, and thou didst set thine eyes upon Him, thou 
didst not recognize Him, even though thou hadst been 
called into being by God for the purpose of attaining His 
presence, didst thou but truly believe in the third verse of 
the chapter entitled `Thunder'.+F1  
     Thou contendest, `How can we recognize Him when 
we have heard naught but words which fall short of irrefutable 
proofs?'  Yet since thou hast acknowledged and 
recognized &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, through the 
&amp;Qur'an, how canst thou withhold recognition from Him 
Who sent thee the Book, despite thy calling thyself `His 
servant'?  Verily He doth exercise undisputed authority 
over His revelations unto all mankind.  
     Wert thou to come unto Us while divine revelation is 
descending upon Us, haply God will change thy fire into 
light.  Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.  
Otherwise that which hath been revealed is decisive and 
final and will be faithfully upheld by all until the Day of 
Resurrection...  If divine revelation ceaseth, thou shouldst 
write a petition to Him Whom God shall make manifest, 
imploring that it be delivered into His presence.  Therein 
thou must beg pardon of thy Lord, turn unto Him in 
repentance and be of them that are wholly devoted to Him.  
Perchance God will transform thy fire into light at the next 
Resurrection.  He, of a truth, is the Protector, the Most 
Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving.  Unto Him bow down in 
worship all that are in the heavens and on the earth and 
whatever lieth between them; and unto Him shall all return.  
     We enjoin thee to save thyself and all the inhabitants of 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 13  
 
+P34 
that land from the fire, then to enter the peerless and exalted 
Paradise of His good-pleasure.  Otherwise the day is 
approaching when thou shalt perish and enter the fire, 
when thou shalt have neither patron nor helper from God.  
We have taken compassion on thee, as a sign of Our grace, 
inasmuch as thou hast related thyself unto Us.  Verily We 
are aware of all things.  We are cognizant of thy righteous 
deeds, though they shall avail thee nothing; for the whole 
object of such righteousness is but recognition of God, thy 
Lord, and undoubted faith in the Words revealed by Him.  
 
+P35 
               ADDRESS TO &amp;SULAYMAN, ONE OF THE MUSLIM 
                   DIVINES IN THE LAND OF &amp;MASQAT 
 
     THIS is an Epistle from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, 
unto &amp;Sulayman in the land of &amp;Masqat, to the 
right of the Sea.  In truth there is none other God but Him, 
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting...  Indeed, were all 
the inhabitants of heaven and earth and whatever existeth 
between them to assemble together, they would utterly 
fail and be powerless to produce such a book, even though 
We made them masters of eloquence and learning on earth.  
Since thou dost adduce proofs from the &amp;Qur'an, God shall, 
with proofs from that self-same Book, vindicate Himself in 
the &amp;Bayan.  This is none other than a decree of God; He is 
truly the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.  
     If thou art of them that truly believe, thou hast no other 
alternative than to bear allegiance unto it.  This is the Way 
of God for all the inhabitants of earth and heaven and all 
that lieth betwixt them.  No God is there but Me, the Almighty, 
the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted.  
     From this land We then proceeded to the sacred House, 
and on Our return journey We landed once again at this 
spot, when We perceived that thou hadst heeded not that 
which We sent thee, nor art thou of them that truly believe.  
Although We had created thee to behold Our countenance, 
and We did actually alight in thy locality, yet thou didst 
fail to attain the object of thy creation, and this despite thy 
worshipping God all thy life.  Wherefore vain shall be the 
deeds thou hast wrought, by reason of thy being shut out 
as by a veil from Our presence and from Our Writings.  
 
+P36 
This is an irrevocable decree ordained by Us.  Verily We are 
equitable in Our judgement.  
     Hadst thou observed the contents of the Epistle We sent 
unto thee, it would have been far more profitable to thee 
than worshipping thy Lord from the beginning that hath 
no beginning until this day, and indeed more meritorious 
than proving thyself wholly devoted in thine acts of worship.  
And hadst thou attained the presence of thy Lord in 
this land, and been of them that truly believe that the Face 
of God is beheld in the person of the Primal Point, it would 
have been far more advantageous than prostrating thyself 
in adoration from the beginning that hath no beginning 
until the present time....  
     In truth We tested thee and found that thou wert not of 
them that are endowed with understanding, wherefore 
We passed upon thee the sentence of negation, as a token 
of justice from Our presence; and verily We are equitable.  
     However, shouldst thou return unto Us, We would convert 
thy negation into affirmation.  Verily We are the One 
Who is of immense bounteousness.  But should the Primal 
Point cease to be with you, then the judgement given in 
the Words of God shall be final and unalterable and every 
one will assuredly uphold it.  
     Wert thou to address a letter to Him Whom God shall 
make manifest, begging that it be delivered unto His 
presence, perchance He would graciously forgive thee and, 
at His behest, turn thy negation into affirmation.  He is in 
truth the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, He Whose 
grace is infinite.  Otherwise, no way shalt thou find open 
unto thee and no benefit shalt thou gain from the deeds 
thou hast wrought, by reason of thy failure to respond `yea, 
here am I'.  Verily We have reduced thee and thy works to 
naught, as though thou hadst never come into existence nor 
 
+P37 
ever been of them that do good works, that this may serve 
as a lesson for those unto whom the &amp;Bayan is given, that 
they may take good heed when the sacred Writings of Him 
Whom God shall make manifest will reach them and perchance, 
by pondering upon them, may be enabled to save 
their own souls.  
     Our grace assuredly pervadeth all that dwell in the kingdoms 
of earth and heaven and in whatever lieth between 
them, and beyond them all mankind.  However, souls that 
have shut themselves out as by a veil can never partake of 
the outpourings of the grace of God.

                       EXCERPTS FROM THE 
                        &amp;QAYYUMU'L-ASMA' 
 
+P40 
 
+P41 
     ALL praise be to God Who hath, through the 
power of Truth, sent down this Book unto His 
servant, that it may serve as a shining light for 
all mankind...  Verily this is none other than 
the sovereign Truth; it is the Path which God hath laid out 
for all that are in heaven and on earth.  Let him then who 
will, take for himself the right path unto his Lord.  Verily 
this is the true Faith of God, and sufficient witness are God 
and such as are endowed with the knowledge of the Book.  
This is indeed the eternal Truth which God, the Ancient of 
Days, hath revealed unto His omnipotent Word--He Who 
hath been raised up from the midst of the Burning Bush.  
This is the Mystery which hath been hidden from all that 
are in heaven and on earth, and in this wondrous Revelation 
it hath, in very truth, been set forth in the Mother 
Book by the hand of God, the Exalted...  
     O concourse of kings and of the sons of kings!  Lay aside, 
one and all, your dominion which belongeth unto God...  
     Let not thy sovereignty deceive thee, O &amp;Shah, for `every 
soul shall taste of death,'+F1 and this, in very truth, hath been 
written down as a decree of God.  Chapter I.  
 
 
     O King of &amp;Islam!  Aid thou, with the truth, after having 
aided the Book, Him Who is Our Most Great Remembrance, 
for God hath, in very truth, destined for thee, and 
for such as circle round thee, on the Day of Judgement, a 
responsible position in His Path.  I swear by God, O &amp;Shah!  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 3:182  
 
+P42 
If thou showest enmity unto Him Who is His Remembrance, 
God will, on the Day of Resurrection, condemn 
thee, before the kings, unto hell-fire, and thou shalt not, in 
very truth, find on that Day any helper except God, the 
Exalted.  Purge thou, O &amp;Shah, the Sacred Land [&amp;Tihran] 
from such as have repudiated the Book, ere the day whereon 
the Remembrance of God cometh, terribly and of a sudden, 
with His potent Cause, by the leave of God, the Most High.  
God, verily, hath prescribed to thee to submit unto Him 
Who is His Remembrance, and unto His Cause, and to 
subdue, with the truth and by His leave, the countries, for 
in this world thou hast been mercifully invested with 
sovereignty, and wilt, in the next, dwell, nigh unto the Seat 
of Holiness, with the inmates of the Paradise of His good-pleasure...  
     By God!  If ye do well, to your own behoof will ye do 
well; and if ye deny God and His signs, We, in very truth, 
having God, can well dispense with all creatures and all 
earthly dominion.  Chapter I.  
 
 
     BE thou content with the commandment of God, the 
True One, inasmuch as sovereignty, as recorded in the 
Mother Book by the hand of God, is surely invested in Him 
Who is His Remembrance...  
     O Minister of the &amp;Shah!  Fear thou God, besides Whom 
there is none other God but Him, the Sovereign Truth, the 
Just, and lay aside thy dominion, for We, by the leave of 
God, the All-Wise, inherit the earth and all who are upon 
it,+F1 and He shall rightfully be a witness unto thee and unto 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 19:41  
 
+P43 
the &amp;Shah.  Were ye to obey the Remembrance of God with 
absolute sincerity, We guarantee, by the leave of God, that 
on the Day of Resurrection, a vast dominion shall be yours 
in His eternal Paradise.  
     Vain indeed is your dominion, for God hath set aside 
earthly possessions for such as have denied Him; for unto 
Him Who is your Lord shall be the most excellent abode, 
He Who is, in truth, the Ancient of Days....  
     O concourse of kings!  Deliver with truth and in all haste 
the verses sent down by Us to the peoples of Turkey and of 
India, and beyond them, with power and with truth, to 
lands in both the East and the West....  And know that if ye 
aid God, He will, on the Day of Resurrection, graciously 
aid you, upon the Bridge, through Him Who is His Most 
Great Remembrance...  
     O people of the earth!  Whoso obeyeth the Remembrance 
of God and His Book hath in truth obeyed God and His 
chosen ones and he will, in the life to come, be reckoned in 
the presence of God among the inmates of the Paradise of 
His good-pleasure.  Chapter I.  
 
 
     VERILY We made the revelation of verses to be a testimony 
for Our message unto you.  Can ye produce a single 
letter to match these verses?  Bring forth, then, your proofs, 
if ye be of those who can discern the one true God.  I 
solemnly affirm before God, should all men and spirits 
combine to compose the like of one chapter of this Book, 
they would surely fail, even though they were to assist one 
another.+F1  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 17:90  
 
+P44 
     O concourse of divines!  Fear God from this day onwards 
in the views ye advance, for He Who is Our Remembrance 
in your midst, and Who cometh from Us, is, 
in very truth, the Judge and Witness.  Turn away from that 
which ye lay hold of, and which the Book of God, the True 
One, hath not sanctioned, for on the Day of Resurrection 
ye shall, upon the Bridge, be, in very truth, held answerable 
for the position ye occupied....  And unto you We have 
sent down this Book which truly none can mistake...  
     O concourse of the people of the Book!  Fear ye God 
and pride not yourselves in your learning.  Follow ye the 
Book which His Remembrance hath revealed in praise of 
God, the True One.  He Who is the Eternal Truth beareth 
me witness, whoso followeth this Book hath indeed followed 
all the past Scriptures which have been sent down 
from heaven by God, the Sovereign Truth.  Verily, He is 
well informed of what ye do...  Such as are the true followers 
of &amp;Islam would say:  `O Lord our God!  We have 
hearkened to the call of Thy Remembrance and obeyed 
Him.  Forgive us our sins.  Thou art, verily, the Eternal 
Truth, and unto Thee, our infallible Retreat, must we all 
return.'+F1  Chapter II.  
 
 
     AS to those who deny Him Who is the Sublime Gate of 
God, for them We have prepared, as justly decreed by God, 
a sore torment.  And He, God, is the Mighty, the Wise.  
     We have, of a truth, sent down this divinely-inspired 
Book unto Our Servant...  Ask ye then Him Who is Our 
Remembrance of its interpretation, inasmuch as He, as 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 2:285  
 
+P45 
divinely-ordained and through the grace of God, is invested 
with the knowledge of its verses...  
     O children of men!  If ye believe in the one True God, 
follow Me, this Most Great Remembrance of God sent 
forth by your Lord, that He may graciously forgive you 
your sins.  Verily He is forgiving and compassionate toward 
the concourse of the faithful.  We, of a truth, choose the 
Messengers through the potency of Our Word, and We 
exalt Their offspring, some over others, through the Great 
Remembrance of God as decreed in the Book and concealed 
therein...  
     Some of the people of the city have declared:  `We are 
the helpers of God', but when this Remembrance came 
suddenly upon them, they turned aside from helping Us.  
Verily God is My Lord and your true Lord, therefore 
worship Him, while this Path from &amp;Ali [the &amp;Bab] is none 
but the straight Path+F1 in the estimation of your Lord.  
Chapter III.  
 
 
     UNTO every people We have sent down the Book in 
their own language.+F2  This Book We have, verily, revealed 
in the language of Our Remembrance and it is in truth a 
wondrous language.  He is, verily, the eternal Truth come 
from God, and according to the divine judgement given in 
the Mother Book, He is the most distinguished among the 
writers of Arabic and most eloquent in His utterance.  He 
is in truth the Supreme Talisman and is endowed with 
supernatural powers, as set forth in the Mother Book...  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 3:50  
+F2 cf. ibid. 14:4  
 
+P46 
     O people of the city!  Ye have disbelieved your Lord.  If 
ye are truly faithful to &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God 
and the Seal of the Prophets, and if ye follow His Book, 
the &amp;Qur'an, which is free from error, then here is the like 
of it--this Book, which We have, in truth and by the leave 
of God, sent down unto Our Servant.  If ye fail to believe 
in Him, then your faith in &amp;Muhammad and His Book which 
was revealed in the past will indeed be treated as false in the 
estimation of God.  If ye deny Him, the fact of your having 
denied &amp;Muhammad and His Book will, in very truth and 
with absolute certainty, become evident unto yourselves.  
Chapter IV.  
 
 
     FEAR ye God and breathe not a word concerning His 
Most Great Remembrance other than what hath been 
ordained by God, inasmuch as We have established a 
separate covenant regarding Him with every Prophet and 
His followers.  Indeed, We have not sent any Messenger 
without this binding covenant and We do not, of a truth, 
pass judgement upon anything except after the covenant 
of Him Who is the Supreme Gate hath been established.  
Ere long the veil shall be lifted from your eyes at the 
appointed time.  Ye shall then behold the sublime Remembrance 
of God, unclouded and vivid.  Chapter V.  
 
 
     DO men imagine that We are far distant from the people 
of the world?  Nay, the day We cause them to be assailed 
 
+P47 
by the pangs of death+F1 they shall, upon the plain of Resurrection, 
behold how the Lord of Mercy and His Remembrance 
were near.  Thereupon they shall exclaim:  `Would 
that we had followed the path of the &amp;Bab!  Would that we 
had sought refuge only with Him, and not with men of 
perversity and error!  For verily the Remembrance of God 
appeared before us,+F2 behind us, and on all sides, yet we 
were, in very truth, shut out as by a veil from Him.'  
Chapter VII.  
 
 
     DO not say, `How can He speak of God while in truth 
His age is no more than twenty-five?'  Give ye ear unto 
Me.  I swear by the Lord of the heavens and of the earth:  I 
am verily a servant of God.  I have been made the Bearer of 
irrefutable proofs from the presence of Him Who is the 
long-expected Remnant of God.  Here is My Book before 
your eyes, as indeed inscribed in the presence of God in the 
Mother Book.  God hath indeed made Me blessed, wheresoever 
I may be, and hath enjoined upon Me to observe 
prayer and fortitude so long as I shall live on earth amongst 
you.  Chapter IX.  
 
 
     GLORIFIED is He besides Whom there is none other God.  
In His grasp He holdeth the source of authority, and 
verily God is powerful over all things.  We have decreed 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 68:42  
+F2 cf. ibid. 7:63, 69  
 
+P48 
that every long life shall in truth suffer decline+F1 and 
that every hardship shall be followed by ease,+F2 that perchance 
men may recognise the Gate of God as He Who is 
the eternal Truth, and verily God shall stand as witness unto 
those that have believed.  Chapter XIII.  
 
 
     O YE servants of God!  Verily, be not grieved if a thing ye 
asked of Him remaineth unanswered, inasmuch as He hath 
been commanded by God to observe silence, a silence 
which is in truth praiseworthy.  We have indeed enabled 
Thee to truly see in Thy dream a measure of Our Cause, 
but wert Thou to acquaint them with the hidden Mystery, 
they would dispute its truth among themselves.  Verily Thy 
Lord, the God of truth, knoweth the very secrets of 
hearts+F3...  
     O peoples of the world!  Whatsoever ye have offered 
up in the way of the One True God, ye shall indeed find 
preserved by God, the Preserver, intact at God's Holy 
Gate.  O peoples of the earth!  Bear ye allegiance unto this 
resplendent light wherewith God hath graciously invested 
Me through the power of infallible Truth, and walk not in 
the footsteps of the Evil One,+F4 inasmuch as he prompteth 
you to disbelieve in God, your Lord, and verily God will 
not forgive disbelief in Himself, though He will forgive 
other sins to whomsoever He pleaseth.+F5  Indeed His knowledge 
embraceth all things...  Chapter XVII.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 36:68  
+F2 cf. ibid. 65:7; 94:5  
+F3 cf. ibid. 8:45  
+F4 cf. ibid. 2:204  
+F5 cf. ibid. 4:51  
 
+P49 
     O PEOPLES of the East and the West!  Be ye fearful of God 
concerning the Cause of the true Joseph and barter Him 
not for a paltry price+F1 established by yourselves, or for a 
trifle of your earthly possessions, that ye may, in very truth, 
be praised by Him as those who are reckoned among the 
pious who stand nigh unto this Gate.  Verily God hath 
deprived of His grace him who martyred &amp;Husayn, Our 
forefather, lonely and forsaken as He was upon the land of 
&amp;Taff [&amp;Karbila].  &amp;Yazid, the son of &amp;Mu'aviyih, out of corrupt 
desire, bartered away the head of the true Joseph to the 
fiendish people for a trifling price and a petty sum from his 
property.  Verily they repudiated God by committing a 
grievous error.  Erelong will God wreak His vengeance 
upon them, at the time of Our Return, and He hath, in very 
truth, prepared for them, in the world to come, a severe 
torment.  Chapter XXI.  
 
 
     O &amp;QURRATU'L-'AYN!+F2  We have, verily, dilated Thine 
heart in this Revelation, which stands truly unique from all 
created things, and have exalted Thy name through the 
manifestation of the &amp;Bab, so that men may become aware 
of Our transcendent power, and recognize that God is immeasurably 
sanctified above the praise of all men.  He is 
verily independent of the whole of creation.  Chapter XXIII.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 12:20  
+F2 In these passages of the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma' the name &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn 
+F2 (Solace of the Eyes) refers to the &amp;Bab Himself.  
 
+P50 
     THE angels and the spirits, arrayed rank upon rank, 
descend, by the leave of God, upon this Gate+F1 and circle 
round this Focal Point in a far-stretching line.  Greet them 
with salutations, O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn, for the dawn hath indeed 
broken; then proclaim unto the concourse of the 
faithful:  `Is not the rising of the Morn, foreshadowed in the 
Mother Book, to be near at hand?+F2...'  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Turn Thou eagerly unto God in 
Thy Cause, for the peoples of the world have risen in 
iniquity, and but for the outpouring of the grace of God 
and Thy mercy unto them, no one could purge even a 
single soul for evermore.+F3  O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  The life to 
come is indeed far more advantageous unto Thee and unto 
such as follow Thy Cause than this earthly life and its 
pleasures.  This is what hath been foreordained according to 
the dispensations of Providence...  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Say:  Verily I am the `Gate of God' 
and I give you to drink, by the leave of God, the sovereign 
Truth, of the crystal-pure waters of His Revelation which 
are gushing out from the incorruptible Fountain situate 
upon the Holy Mount.  And those who earnestly strive 
after the One True God, let them then strive to attain this 
Gate.+F4  Verily God is potent over all things...  
     O peoples of the earth!  Give ear unto God's holy Voice 
proclaimed by this Arabian Youth Whom the Almighty 
hath graciously chosen for His Own Self.  He is indeed none 
other than the True One, Whom God hath entrusted with 
this Mission from the midst of the Burning Bush.  O 
&amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Unravel what Thou pleasest from the 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 78:38  
+F2 cf. ibid. 11:83  
+F3 cf. ibid. 24:21  
+F4 cf. ibid. 83:25-26  
 
+P51 
secrets of the All-Glorious, for the ocean is surging high+F1 
at the behest of the incomparable Lord.  Chapter XXIV.  
     Are ye wickedly scheming, according to your selfish 
fancies, an evil plot against Him Who is the Most Great 
Remembrance of God?  By the righteousness of God, all 
who are in the heaven and on earth and whatsoever lieth 
between them are regarded in My sight even as a spider's 
web,+F2 and verily God beareth witness unto all things.  Indeed 
they will not lay plots but against themselves.  God 
hath caused this Remembrance to be, in very truth, independent 
of all the dwellers of earth and heaven.  Chapter 
XXV.  
 
 
     O YE peoples of the earth!  During the time of My 
absence I sent down the Gates unto you.  However the 
believers, except for a handful, obeyed them not.  Formerly 
I sent forth unto you &amp;Ahmad and more recently &amp;Kazim, 
but apart from the pure in heart amongst you no one followed 
them.  What hath befallen you, O people of the 
Book?  Will ye not fear the One true God, He Who is your 
Lord, the Ancient of Days?...  O ye who profess belief in 
God!  I adjure you by Him Who is the Eternal Truth, have 
ye discerned among the precepts of these Gates anything 
inconsistent with the commandments of God as set forth 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 52:6  
+F2 cf. ibid. 29:40  
 
+P52 
in this Book?  Hath your learning deluded you by reason of 
your impiety?  Take ye heed then, for verily your God, the 
Lord of Eternal Truth, is with you and in very truth is 
watchful over you...  Chapter XXVII.  
 
 
     O YE kinsmen of the Most Great Remembrance!  This 
Tree of Holiness, dyed crimson with the oil of servitude, 
hath verily sprung forth out of your own soil in the midst 
of the Burning Bush, yet ye comprehend nothing whatever 
thereof, neither of His true, heavenly attributes, nor of the 
actual circumstances of His earthly life, nor of the evidences 
of His powerful and unblemished behaviour.  
Actuated by your own fancies, you consider Him to be 
alien to the sovereign Truth, while in the estimation of God 
He is none other than the Promised One Himself, invested 
with the power of the sovereign Truth, and verily He is, as 
decreed in the Mother Book, held answerable in the midst 
of the Burning Bush...  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Deliver the summons of the most 
exalted Word unto the handmaids among Thy kindred, 
caution them against the Most Great Fire and announce 
unto them the joyful tidings that following this mighty 
Covenant there shall be everlasting reunion with God in 
the Paradise of His good-pleasure, nigh unto the Seat of 
Holiness.  Verily God, the Lord of creation, is potent over 
all things.  
     O Thou Mother of the Remembrance!  May the peace 
and salutation of God rest upon thee.  Indeed thou hast 
endured patiently in Him Who is the sublime Self of God.  
Recognize then the station of thy Son Who is none other 
 
+P53 
than the mighty Word of God.  He hath verily pledged 
Himself to be answerable for thee both in thy grave and 
on the Judgement Day, while thou hast, in the Preserved 
Tablet of God, been immortalized as the `Mother of the 
Faithful' by the Pen of His Remembrance.  Chapter XXVIII.  
 
 
     O &amp;QURRATU'L-'AYN!  Stretch not Thy hands wide open 
in the Cause, inasmuch as the people would find themselves 
in a state of stupor by reason of the Mystery, and I 
swear by the true, Almighty God that there is yet for Thee 
another turn after this Dispensation.  
     And when the appointed hour hath struck, do Thou, by 
the leave of God, the All-Wise, reveal from the heights of 
the Most Lofty and Mystic Mount a faint, an infinitesimal 
glimmer of Thy impenetrable Mystery, that they who have 
recognized the radiance of the Sinaic Splendour may faint 
away and die as they catch a lightning glimpse of the fierce 
and crimson Light that envelops Thy Revelation.  And God 
is, in very truth, Thine unfailing Protector.  Chapter XXVIII.  
 
 
     O PEOPLE of Persia!  Are ye not satisfied with this glorious 
honour which the supreme Remembrance of God hath 
conferred upon you?  Verily ye have been especially 
favoured by God through this mighty Word.  Then do not 
withdraw from the sanctuary of His presence, for, by the 
righteousness of the One true God, He is none other than 
the sovereign Truth from God; He is the most exalted One 
 
+P54 
and the Source of all wisdom, as decreed in the Mother 
Book...  
     O peoples of the earth!  Cleave ye tenaciously to the 
Cord of the All-Highest God, which is but this Arabian 
Youth, Our Remembrance--He Who standeth concealed 
at the point of ice amidst the ocean of fire.  Chapter XXIX.  
 
 
     O PEOPLE of the earth!  By the righteousness of the One 
true God, I am the Maid of Heaven begotten by the Spirit 
of &amp;Baha, abiding within the Mansion hewn out of a mass of 
ruby, tender and vibrant; and in this mighty Paradise 
naught have I ever witnessed save that which proclaimeth 
the Remembrance of God by extolling the virtues of this 
Arabian Youth.  Verily there is none other God but your 
Lord, the All-Merciful.  Magnify ye, then, His station, for 
behold, He is poised in the midmost heart of the All-Highest 
Paradise as the embodiment of the praise of God 
in the Tabernacle wherein His glorification is intoned.  
     At one time I hear His Voice as He acclaimeth Him Who 
is the Ever-Living, the Ancient of Days, and at another 
time as He speaketh of the mystery of His most august 
Name.  And when He intoneth the anthems of the greatness 
of God all Paradise waileth in its longing to gaze on 
His Beauty, and when He chanteth words of praise and 
glorification of God all Paradise becomes motionless like 
unto ice locked in the heart of a frost-bound mountain.  
Methinks I visioned Him moving along a straight middle 
path wherein every paradise was His Own paradise, every 
heaven His Own heaven, while the whole earth and all that 
is therein appeared but as a ring upon the finger of His 
 
+P55 
servants.  Glorified be God, His Creator, the Lord of everlasting 
sovereignty.  Verily He is none other but the servant 
of God, the Gate of the Remnant of God your Lord, the 
Sovereign Truth.  Chapter XXIX.  
 
 
     O THOU the Supreme Word of God!  Fear not, nor be 
Thou grieved, for indeed unto such as have responded to 
Thy Call, whether men or women, We have assured forgiveness 
of sins, as known in the presence of the Best 
Beloved and in conformity with what Thou desirest.  Verily 
His knowledge embraceth all things.  I adjure Thee by My 
life, set Thy face towards Me and be not apprehensive.  
Verily Thou art the Exalted One among the Celestial Concourse, 
and Thy hidden Mystery hath, of a truth, been 
recorded upon the Tablet of creation in the midst of the 
Burning Bush.  Ere long God will bestow upon Thee rulership 
over all men, inasmuch as His rule transcendeth the 
whole of creation.  Chapter XXXI.  
 
 
     O CONCOURSE of &amp;Shi'ihs!  Fear ye God and Our Cause 
which concerneth Him Who is the Most Great Remembrance 
of God.  For great is its fire, as decreed in the Mother 
Book.  Chapter XL.  
 
 
     RECITE ye as much as convenient from this &amp;Qur'an both 
 
+P56 
at morn and at eventide, and chant the verses of this Book, 
by the leave of the eternal God, in the sweet accents of this 
Bird which warbleth its melody in the vault of heaven.  
Chapter XLI.  
 
 
     ISSUE forth from your cities, O peoples of the West and 
aid God ere the Day when the Lord of mercy shall come 
down unto you in the shadow of the clouds with the angels 
circling around Him,+F1 exalting His praise and seeking forgiveness 
for such as have truly believed in Our signs.  
Verily His decree hath been issued, and the command of 
God, as given in the Mother Book, hath indeed been revealed...  
     Become as true brethren in the one and indivisible religion 
of God, free from distinction, for verily God 
desireth that your hearts should become mirrors unto your 
brethren in the Faith, so that ye find yourselves reflected in 
them, and they in you.  This is the true Path of God, the 
Almighty, and He is indeed watchful over your actions.  
Chapter XLVI.  
 
 
     O YE peoples of the earth!  Hearken unto My call, ringing 
forth from the precincts of this sacred Tree--a Tree set 
ablaze by the pre-existent Fire:  There is no God but Him; 
He is the Exalted, the All-Wise.  O ye the servants of the 
Merciful One!  Enter ye, one and all, through this Gate and 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 2:206  
 
+P57 
follow not the steps of the Evil One, for he prompteth you 
to walk in the ways of impiety and wickedness; he is, in 
truth, your declared enemy.+F1  Chapter LI.  
 
 
     BE Thou patient, O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn, for God hath indeed 
pledged to establish Thy sovereignty throughout all 
countries and over the people that dwell therein.  He is God 
and verily He is powerful over all things.  Chapter LIII.  
 
 
     BY My glory!  I will make the infidels to taste, with the 
hands of My power, retributions unknown of any one 
except Me, and will waft over the faithful those musk-scented 
breaths which I have nursed in the midmost heart 
of My throne; and verily the knowledge of God embraceth 
all things.  
     O concourse of light!  By the righteousness of God, We 
speak not according to selfish desire, nor hath a single letter 
of this Book been revealed save by the leave of God, the 
Sovereign Truth.  Fear ye God and entertain no doubts 
regarding His Cause, for verily, the Mystery of this Gate 
is shrouded in the mystic utterances of His Writ and hath 
been written beyond the impenetrable veil of concealment by 
the hand of God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible.  
     Indeed God hath created everywhere around this Gate 
oceans of divine elixir, tinged crimson with the essence of 
existence and vitalized through the animating power of the 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 2:163-164  
 
+P58 
desired fruit; and for them God hath provided Arks of 
ruby, tender, crimson-coloured, wherein none shall sail 
but the people of &amp;Baha, by the leave of God, the Most 
Exalted; and verily He is the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.  
Chapter LVII.  
 
 
     THE Lord hath, in truth, inspired Me:  Verily, verily, I am 
God, He besides Whom there is none other God, and I am 
indeed the Ancient of Days...  
     O people of the Kingdom!  By the righteousness of the 
true God, if ye remain steadfast upon this line which 
standeth upright between the two lines, ye shall, in very 
truth, quaff the living waters from the Fountain of this 
wondrous Revelation as proffered by the hand of His 
Remembrance...  
     I swear by your true Lord, by Him Who is the Lord of 
the heavens and of the earth, that the divine Promise concerning 
His Remembrance is naught but the sovereign 
truth and, as decreed in the Mother Book, it shall come to 
pass...  
     Say, O peoples of the earth!  Were ye to assemble together 
in order to produce the like of a single letter of My 
Works, ye would never be able to do so,+F1 and verily God 
is cognizant of all things...  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Say:  Behold!  Verily the Moon hath 
faded; verily the night hath retreated; verily the dawn 
hath brightened;+F2 verily the command of God, your true 
Lord, hath been accomplished...  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 17:88  
+F2 cf. ibid. 74:35-37  
 
+P59 
     Out of utter nothingness, O great and omnipotent 
Master, Thou hast, through the celestial potency of Thy 
might, brought me forth and raised me up to proclaim this 
Revelation.  I have made none other but Thee my trust; I 
have clung to no will but Thy Will.  Thou art, in truth, the 
All-Sufficing and behind Thee standeth the true God, He 
Who overshadoweth all things.  Indeed sufficient unto Me 
is God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Sustainer.  Chapter 
LVIII.  
 
 
     O THOU Remnant of God!  I have sacrificed myself wholly 
for Thee; I have accepted curses for Thy sake, and have 
yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of Thy 
love.  Sufficient witness unto me is God, the Exalted, the 
Protector, the Ancient of Days.  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  The words Thou hast uttered in this 
momentous Call have grieved Me bitterly.  However, the 
irrevocable decision resteth with none but God and the 
decree proceedeth from none save Him alone.  By My life, 
Thou art the Well-Beloved in the sight of God and His 
creation.  Verily, there is no power except in God, and 
sufficient witness unto Me is your Lord, Who is, in very 
truth, the Omnipotent Avenger.  Chapter LVIII.  
 
 
     O PEOPLES of the earth!  By the righteousness of God, this 
Book hath, through the potency of the sovereign Truth, 
pervaded the earth and the heaven with the mighty Word 
 
+P60 
of God concerning Him Who is the supreme Testimony, 
the Expected &amp;Qa'im, and verily God hath knowledge of all 
things.  This divinely-inspired Book hath firmly established 
His Proof for all those who are in the East and in the West, 
hence beware lest ye utter aught but the truth regarding 
God, for I swear by your Lord that this supreme Proof of 
Mine beareth witness unto all things...  
     O servants of God!  Be ye patient, for, God grant, He 
Who is the sovereign Truth will suddenly appear amongst 
you, invested with the power of the mighty Word, and ye 
shall then be confounded by the Truth itself, and ye shall 
have no power to ward it off;+F1 and verily I am a witness 
over all mankind.  Chapter LIX.  
 
 
     VERILY such as ridicule the wondrous, divine Verses 
revealed through His Remembrance, are but making themselves 
the objects of ridicule, and We, in truth, aid them to 
wax in their iniquity.+F2  Indeed God's knowledge transcendeth 
all created things...  
     The infidels, of a truth, seek to separate God from His 
Remembrance,+F3 but God hath determined to perfect His 
Light+F4 through His Remembrance, and indeed He is 
potent over all things...  
     Verily, Christ is Our Word which We communicated 
unto Mary;+F5 and let no one say what the Christians term 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 21:40  
+F2 cf. ibid. 2:14  
+F3 cf. ibid. 4:149  
+F4 cf. ibid. 9:32  
+F5 cf. ibid. 4:169  
 
+P61 
as `the third of three',+F1 inasmuch as it would amount to 
slandering the Remembrance Who, as decreed in the 
Mother Book, is invested with supreme authority.  Indeed 
God is but one God, and far be it from His glory that there 
should be aught else besides Him.  All those who shall 
attain unto Him on the Day of Resurrection are but His 
servants, and God is, of a truth, a sufficient Protector.  
Verily I am none other but the servant of God and His 
Word, and none but the first one to bow down in supplication 
before God, the Most Exalted; and indeed God witnesseth 
all things.  Chapter LXI.  
 
 
     O PEOPLE of the &amp;Qur'an!  Ye are as nothing unless ye 
submit unto the Remembrance of God and unto this Book.  
If ye follow the Cause of God, We will forgive you your 
sins, and if ye turn aside from Our command, We will, in 
truth, condemn your souls in Our Book, unto the Most 
Great Fire.  We, verily, do not deal unjustly with men, even 
to the extent of a speck on a date-stone.  Chapter LXII.  
 
 
     O PEOPLES of the earth!  Verily the resplendent Light of 
God hath appeared in your midst, invested with this unerring 
Book, that ye may be guided aright to the ways of 
peace and, by the leave of God, step out of the darkness into 
the light and onto this far-extended Path of Truth+F2...  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 5:77  
+F2 cf. ibid. 5:15-18  
 
+P62 
     God hath, out of sheer nothingness and through the 
potency of His command, created the heavens and the 
earth and whatever lieth between them.  He is single and 
peerless in His eternal unity with none to join partner with 
His holy Essence, nor is there any soul, except His Own 
Self, who can befittingly comprehend Him...  
     O peoples of the earth!  Verily His Remembrance is 
come to you from God after an interval during which 
there were no Messengers,+F1 that He may purge and purify 
you from uncleanliness in anticipation of the Day of the 
One true God; therefore seek ye whole-heartedly divine 
blessings from Him, inasmuch as We have, in truth, 
chosen Him to be the Witness and the Source of wisdom 
unto all that dwell on earth...  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Proclaim that which hath been sent 
down unto Thee as a token of the grace of the merciful 
Lord, for if Thou do it not, Our secret will never be made 
known to the people,+F2 while the purpose of God in creating 
man is but for him to know Him.  Indeed God hath 
knowledge of all things and is self-sufficient above the need 
of all mankind.  Chapter LXII.  
 
 
     WHENEVER the faithful hear the verses of this Book 
being recited, their eyes will overflow with tears and their 
hearts will be deeply touched by Him Who is the Most 
Great Remembrance for the love they cherish for God, the 
All-Praised.  He is God, the All-Knowing, the Eternal.  They 
are indeed the inmates of the all-highest Paradise wherein 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 5:22  
+F2 cf. ibid. 5:71  
 
+P63 
they will abide for ever.  Verily they will see naught therein 
save that which hath proceeded from God, nothing that 
will lie beyond the compass of their understanding.  There 
they will meet the believers in Paradise, who will address 
them with the words `Peace, Peace' lingering on their 
lips...  
     O concourse of the faithful!  Incline your ears to My 
Voice, proclaimed by this Remembrance of God.  Verily 
God hath revealed unto Me that the Path of the Remembrance 
which is set forth by Me is, in very truth, the straight 
Path of God, and that whoever professeth any religion 
other than this upright Faith, will, when called to account 
on the Day of Judgement, discover that as recorded in the 
Book no benefit hath he reaped out of God's Religion...  
     Fear ye God, O concourse of kings, lest ye remain afar 
from Him Who is His Remembrance [the &amp;Bab], after the 
Truth hath come unto you with a Book and signs from 
God, as spoken through the wondrous tongue of Him 
Who is His Remembrance.  Seek ye grace from God, for 
God hath ordained for you, after ye have believed in Him, 
a Garden the vastness of which is as the vastness of the 
whole of Paradise.  Therein ye shall find naught save the 
gifts and favours which the Almighty hath graciously 
bestowed by virtue of this momentous Cause, as decreed 
in the Mother Book.  Chapter LXIII.  
 
 
     O SPIRIT of God!  Call Thou to mind the bounty which 
I bestowed upon Thee when I conversed with Thee in the 
midmost heart of My Sanctuary and aided Thee through 
the potency of the Holy Spirit that Thou mightest, as the 
 
+P64 
peerless Mouthpiece of God, proclaim unto men the commandments 
of God which lie enshrined within the divine 
Spirit.  
     Verily God hath inspired Thee with divine verses and 
wisdom while still a child and hath graciously deigned to 
bestow His favour upon the peoples of the world through 
the influence of Thy Most Great Name, for indeed men 
have not the least knowledge of the Book.  Chapter LXIII.  
 
 
     O PEOPLE of the earth!  To attain the ultimate retreat in 
God, the True One, are we to seek a Gate other than this 
exalted Being?...  
     When God created the Remembrance He presented 
Him to the assemblage of all created beings upon the altar 
of His Will.  Thereupon the concourse of the angels bowed 
low in adoration to God, the Peerless, the Incomparable; 
while Satan waxed proud, refusing to submit to His 
Remembrance; hence he is identified in the Book of God 
as the arrogant one and the accursed.+F1  Chapter LXVII.  
 
 
     GOD, besides Whom there is none other true God, saith:  
Indeed, whoso visiteth the Remembrance of God after 
His passing, it is as though he hath attained the presence of 
the Lord, seated upon His mighty Throne.  Verily this is 
the Way of God, the Most Exalted, which hath been irrevocably 
decreed in the Mother Book...  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 2:32; 38:74-78  
 
+P65 
     Say, O peoples of the world!  Do ye dispute with Me 
about God by virtue of the names which ye and your 
fathers have adopted for Him at the promptings of the 
Evil One?+F1  God hath indeed sent down this Book unto Me 
with truth that ye may be enabled to recognize the true 
names of God, inasmuch as ye have strayed in error far 
from the Truth.  Verily We have taken a covenant from 
every created thing upon its coming into being concerning 
the Remembrance of God, and there shall be none to avert 
the binding command of God for the purification of mankind, 
as ordained in the Book which is written by the hand 
of the &amp;Bab.  Chapter LXVIII.  
 
 
     THE people, during the absence of the &amp;Bab, re-enacted 
the episode of the Calf by setting up a blaring figure which 
embodied animal features in human form+F2...  
     Whenever the people ask Thee of the appointed Hour 
say:  Verily the knowledge of it is only with My Lord,+F3 
Who is the Knower of the unseen.  There is none other 
God but Him--He Who hath created you from a single 
soul,+F4 and I have no control over what profiteth Me or 
harmeth Me, but as My Lord pleaseth.+F5  Indeed God is 
Self-Sufficient and He, My Lord, standeth supreme over all 
things.  Chapter LXIX.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 7:69; 12:40  
+F2 cf. ibid. 7:146; 20:90  
+F3 cf. ibid. 7:186  
+F4 cf. ibid. 4:1  
+F5 cf. ibid. 10:50  
 
+P66 
     DOTH it seem strange to the people that We should have 
revealed the Book to a man from among themselves in 
order to purge them and give them the good tidings that 
they shall be rewarded with a sure stance in the presence of 
their Lord?  He indeed beareth witness unto all things...  
     When the verses of this Book are recited to the infidels 
they say:  `Give us a book like the &amp;Qur'an and make changes 
in the verses.'  Say:  `God hath not given Me that I should 
change them at My pleasure.'  I follow only what is revealed 
unto Me.  Verily, I shall fear My Lord on the Day of 
Separation, whose advent He hath, in very truth, irrevocably 
ordained.+F1  Chapter LXXI.  
 
 
     O PEOPLES of the earth!  Verily the true God calleth 
saying:  He Who is the Remembrance is indeed the 
sovereign Truth from God, and naught remaineth beyond 
truth but error,+F2 and naught is there beyond error save fire, 
irrevocably ordained...  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Point to Thy truthful breast through 
the power of truth and exclaim:  I swear by the One true 
God, herein lieth the vicegerency of God; I am indeed the 
One Who is regarded as the Best Reward+F3 and I am indeed 
He Who is the Most Excellent Abode.  Chapter LXXII.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 10:16  
+F2 cf. ibid. 10:33  
+F3 cf. ibid. 18:42  
 
+P67 
     O YE concourse of the believers!  Utter not words of 
denial against Me once the Truth is made manifest, for 
indeed the mandate of the &amp;Bab hath befittingly been proclaimed 
unto you in the &amp;Qur'an aforetime.  I swear by your 
Lord, this Book is verily the same &amp;Qur'an which was sent 
down in the past.  Chapter LXXXI.  
 
 
     O THOU cherished Fruit of the heart!  Give ear to the 
melodies of this mystic Bird warbling in the loftiest heights 
of heaven.  The Lord hath, in truth, inspired Me to proclaim:  
Verily, verily, I am God, He besides Whom there is 
none other God.  He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.  
     O My servants!  Seek ye earnestly this highest reward, 
as I have indeed created for the Remembrance of God 
gardens which remain inscrutable to anyone save Myself, 
and naught therein hath been made lawful unto anyone 
except those whose lives have been sacrificed in His Path.  
Hence beseech ye God, the Most Exalted, that He may 
grant you this meritorious reward, and He is in truth the 
Most High, the Most Great.  Had it been Our wish, We 
would have brought all men into one fold round Our 
Remembrance, yet they will not cease to differ,+F1 unless 
God accomplish what He willeth through the power of 
truth.  In the estimation of the Remembrance this commandment 
hath, in very truth, been irrevocably ordained...  
     God hath indeed chosen Thee to warn the people, to 
guide the believers aright and to elucidate the secrets of the 
Book.  Chapter LXXXV.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 11:120  
 
+P68 
     SHOULD it be Our wish, it is in Our power to compel, 
through the agency of but one letter of Our Revelation, 
the world and all that is therein to recognize, in less than 
the twinkling of an eye, the truth of Our Cause....  
     Truly other apostles have been laughed to scorn before 
Thee,+F1 and Thou art none other but the Servant of God, 
sustained by the power of Truth.  Ere long We shall prolong 
the days of such as have rejected the Truth by reason 
of that which their hands have wrought,+F2 and verily God 
will not deal unjustly with anyone, even to the extent of a 
speck on a date-stone.  Chapter LXXXVII.  
 
 
     O YE peoples of the earth!  By the righteousness of God, 
the True One, the testimony shown forth by His Remembrance 
is like unto a sun which the hand of the merciful 
Lord hath raised high in the midmost heart of the heaven, 
wherefrom it shineth in the plenitude of its meridian 
splendour...  
     With each and every Prophet Whom We have sent 
down in the past, We have established a separate Covenant 
concerning the Remembrance of God and His Day.  
Manifest, in the realm of glory and through the power of 
truth, are the Remembrance of God and His Day before 
the eyes of the angels that circle His mercy-seat.  Chapter 
XCI.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 6:10  
+F2 cf. ibid. 3:172  
 
+P69 
     O HOUR of the Dawn!  Ere the resplendent glory of the 
divine Luminary sheddeth its radiance from the Dayspring 
of this Gate, call thou to mind that the appointed 
Day of God will indeed be at hand in less than the twinkling 
of an eye.  Thus hath the decree of God been issued in the 
Mother Book.  Chapter XCIV.  
 
 
     O CONCOURSE of the faithful!  Verily the object of each 
and every sign revealed by God in the Scriptures or in the 
world at large or in the hearts of men is but to make them 
fully realize that this Remembrance is indeed the True One 
from God.  Verily God is cognizant of all things through the 
power of eternal Truth...  
     O ye that circle the throne of glory!  Hearken unto My 
Call which is raised from the midst of the Burning Bush, 
`Verily I am God and there is none other God but Me.  
Hence worship Me, and for the sake of Him Who is the 
Most Great Remembrance, offer ye prayers, purged from 
the insinuations of the people, for verily your Lord, the 
One true God, is none other than the Sovereign Truth.  
Indeed such as invoke others besides Him are deservedly 
numbered among the inmates of the fire, while He Who is 
the Remembrance of God verily abideth, firm and undeviating, 
on the Path of Truth amidst the Burning Bush.'...  
     O peoples of the earth!  Inflict not upon the Most Great 
Remembrance what the Umayyads cruelly inflicted upon 
&amp;Husayn in the Holy Land.  By the righteousness of God, the 
True One, He is indeed the Eternal Truth, and unto Him 
God, verily, is a witness.  Chapter XVII.  
 
+P70 
     GOD had, in truth, proposed Our Mission unto the 
heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused 
to bear it and were afraid thereof.  However, Man, this 
&amp;Ali, Who is none other but the Great Remembrance of 
God, undertook to bear it.  Hence God, the All-Encompassing, 
hath referred to Him in His Preserved Book as the 
`Wronged One', and by reason of His being undistinguished 
before the eyes of men, He hath, according to the 
judgement of the Book, been entitled `the Unknown'...+F1  
     Erelong We will, in very truth, torment such as waged 
war against &amp;Husayn [&amp;Imam &amp;Husayn], in the Land of the 
Euphrates, with the most afflictive torment, and the most 
dire and exemplary punishment....  
     God knoweth well the heart of &amp;Husayn, the heat of His 
burning thirst and His long-suffering for the sake of God, 
the Incomparable, the Ancient of Days; and unto Him 
God is verily a witness.  Chapter XII.  
 
 
     HEARKEN unto the Voice of Thy Lord calling from 
Mount Sinai, `Verily there is no God but Him, and I am 
the Most Exalted One Who hath been veiled in the Mother 
Book according to the dispensations of Providence.'  
Chapter XIX.  
 
 
     THIS Book which We have sent down is indeed abounding 
in blessings+F2 and beareth witness to the Truth, so that 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 33:72  
+F2 cf. ibid. 6:93  
 
+P71 
the people may realize that the conclusive Proof of God in 
favour of His Remembrance is similar to the one wherewith 
&amp;Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, was invested, 
and verily great is the Cause as ordained in the Mother 
Book.  Chapter LXVI.  
 
 
     THIS Remembrance is indeed the glorious Remnant of 
the Light of God, and He will be best for you,+F1 if ye in very 
truth remain faithful to God, the Most Exalted...  
     We have in truth sent Thee forth unto all men, by the 
leave of God, invested with Our signs and reinforced by 
Our unsurpassed sovereignty.  He is indeed the appointed 
Bearer of the Trust of God...  
     O &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!  Persevere steadfastly as Thou art 
bidden and let not the faithless amongst men nor their 
utterances grieve Thee, since Thy Lord shall, by the 
righteousness of God, the Most Great, pass judgement upon 
them on the Day of Resurrection, and surely God witnesseth 
all things.  Chapter LXXXIV.  
 
 
     THIS Religion is indeed, in the sight of God, the essence 
of the Faith of &amp;Muhammad; haste ye then to attain the 
celestial Paradise and the all-highest Garden of His good-pleasure 
in the presence of the One True God, could ye 
but be patient and thankful before the evidences of the 
signs of God.  Chapter XLVIII.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 11:87  
 
+P72 
     O MY servants!  This is God's appointed Day which the 
merciful Lord hath promised you in His Book; wherefore, 
in very truth, glorify ye abundantly the name of God 
while treading the Path of the Most Great Remembrance...  
     Verily God hath granted leave to His Remembrance to 
say whatsoever He willeth in whatever manner He pleaseth.  
Indeed whatsoever He chooseth is none other than what is 
chosen by Us.  The Lord, in truth, witnesseth all things.  
Chapter LXXXVII.  
 
 
     INDEED We conversed with Moses by the leave of God 
from the midst of the Burning Bush in the Sinai and revealed 
an infinitesimal glimmer of Thy Light upon the 
Mystic Mount and its dwellers, whereupon the Mount 
shook to its foundations and was crushed into dust...  
     O peoples of the earth!  I swear by your Lord!  Ye shall 
act as former generations have acted.  Warn ye, then, 
yourselves of the terrible, the most grievous vengeance of 
God.  For God is, verily, potent over all things.  Chapter LIII.  
 
 
     O &amp;QURRATU'L-'AYN!  I recognize in Thee none other 
except the `Great Announcement'--the Announcement 
voiced by the Concourse on high.  By this name, I bear 
witness, they that circle the Throne of Glory have ever 
known Thee.  
     O concourse of the believers!  Do ye harbour any doubt 
 
+P73 
as to that whereunto the Remembrance of God doth 
summon you?  By the righteousness of the One true God, 
He is none other than the sovereign Truth Who hath been 
made manifest through the power of Truth.  Are ye in 
doubt concerning the &amp;Bab?  Verily He is the One Who 
holdeth, by Our leave, the kingdoms of earth and heaven 
in His grasp, and the Lord is in truth fully aware of what 
ye are doing...  
     Indeed I am but a man like unto you.  However, God 
bestoweth upon Me whatever favours He willeth as He 
pleaseth, and that which your Lord hath decreed in the 
Mother Book is unbounded.  Chapter LXXXVIII.  
 
 
     GOD, of a truth, revealed unto Me in the sacred house of 
the &amp;Ka'bah, `Verily, I am God, no God is there but Me.  I 
have singled Thee out for Myself and have chosen Thee as 
the Remembrance.  Indeed, whosoever beareth allegiance 
unto Thee by walking in the way of the &amp;Bab, for him the 
recompense of the next world hath surely been prescribed...'  
It is ordained in the Book that upon the realization of 
the Cause of the Remembrance, the Most Great Event will 
have come to pass according to the dispensation of Providence, 
and God, truly, is potent over all things.  Chapter 
LXXIX.  
 
+P74 
     O &amp;QURRATU'L-'AYN!  Say:  Verily I am the One Who is 
hailed in the Mother Book as the `Great Announcement'.  
Say:  The people have grievously differed over Me, whereas 
in truth there is no difference between Me and the &amp;Bab; and 
God, the Eternal Truth, is sufficient witness.  Chapter 
LXXVII.  
 
 
     I AM the Mystic Fane which the Hand of Omnipotence 
hath reared.  I am the Lamp which the Finger of God hath 
lit within its niche and caused to shine with deathless 
splendour.  I am the Flame of that supernal Light that 
glowed upon Sinai in the gladsome Spot, and lay concealed 
in the midst of the Burning Bush.  Chapter XCIV.  
 
 
     AS a token of pure justice, We have indeed sent tidings 
unto every Prophet concerning the Cause of Our Remembrance, 
and verily God is supreme over all the peoples of the 
world.  Chapter LXXXIII.  
 
+P75 
                              3 
                        EXCERPTS FROM 
                      THE PERSIAN &amp;BAYAN 
 
+P76 
 
+P77 
     IT is better to guide one soul than to possess all 
that is on earth, for as long as that guided soul is 
under the shadow of the Tree of Divine Unity, 
he and the one who hath guided him will both 
be recipients of God's tender mercy, whereas possession of 
earthly things will cease at the time of death.  The path to 
guidance is one of love and compassion, not of force and 
coercion.  This hath been God's method in the past, and 
shall continue to be in the future!  He causeth him whom He 
pleaseth to enter the shadow of His Mercy.  Verily, He is 
the Supreme Protector, the All-Generous.  
     There is no paradise more wondrous for any soul than 
to be exposed to God's Manifestation in His Day, to hear 
His verses and believe in them, to attain His presence, 
which is naught but the presence of God, to sail upon the 
sea of the heavenly kingdom of His good-pleasure, and to 
partake of the choice fruits of the paradise of His divine 
Oneness. II, 16.+F1  
 
 
     WORSHIP thou God in such wise that if thy worship lead 
thee to the fire, no alteration in thine adoration would be 
produced, and so likewise if thy recompense should be 
paradise.  Thus and thus alone should be the worship which 
befitteth the one True God.  Shouldst thou worship Him 
because of fear, this would be unseemly in the sanctified 
Court of His presence, and could not be regarded as an act 
by thee dedicated to the Oneness of His Being.  Or if thy 
 
+F1 The &amp;Bayan is divided into &amp;vahids and chapters, to which these 
+F1 numbers refer.  
 
+P78 
gaze should be on paradise, and thou shouldst worship 
Him while cherishing such a hope, thou wouldst make 
God's creation a partner with Him, notwithstanding the 
fact that paradise is desired by men.  
     Fire and paradise both bow down and prostrate themselves 
before God.  That which is worthy of His Essence is to 
worship Him for His sake, without fear of fire, or hope of 
paradise.  
     Although when true worship is offered, the worshipper is 
delivered from the fire, and entereth the paradise of God's 
good-pleasure, yet such should not be the motive of his 
act.  However, God's favour and grace ever flow in accordance 
with the exigencies of His inscrutable wisdom.  
     The most acceptable prayer is the one offered with the 
utmost spirituality and radiance; its prolongation hath not 
been and is not beloved by God.  The more detached and 
the purer the prayer, the more acceptable is it in the presence 
of God. VII, 19.  
 
 
     THE Day of Resurrection is a day on which the sun riseth 
and setteth like unto any other day.  How oft hath the Day 
of Resurrection dawned, and the people of the land where 
it occurred did not learn of the event.  Had they heard, they 
would not have believed, and thus they were not told!  
     When the Apostle of God [&amp;Muhammad] appeared, He 
did not announce unto the unbelievers that the Resurrection 
had come, for they could not bear the news.  That Day is 
indeed an infinitely mighty Day, for in it the Divine Tree 
proclaimeth from eternity unto eternity, `Verily, I am God.  
No God is there but Me'.  Yet those who are veiled believe 
 
+P79 
that He is one like unto them, and they refuse even to call 
Him a believer, although such a title in the realm of His 
heavenly Kingdom is conferred everlastingly upon the 
most insignificant follower of His previous Dispensation.  
Thus, had the people in the days of the Apostle of God 
regarded Him at least as a believer of their time how would 
they have debarred Him, for seven years while He was in 
the mountain, from access to His Holy House [&amp;Ka'bah]?  
Likewise in this Dispensation of the Point of the &amp;Bayan, 
if the people had not refused to concede the name believer 
unto Him, how could they have incarcerated Him on this 
mountain, without realizing that the quintessence of belief 
oweth its existence to a word from Him?  Their hearts are 
deprived of the power of true insight, and thus they cannot 
see, while those endowed with the eyes of the spirit 
circle like moths round the Light of Truth until they are 
consumed.  It is for this reason that the Day of Resurrection 
is said to be the greatest of all days, yet it is like unto any 
other day.  VIII, 9.  
 
 
     THERE is no paradise, in the estimation of the believers in 
the Divine Unity, more exalted than to obey God's 
commandments, and there is no fire in the eyes of those 
who have known God and His signs, fiercer than to transgress 
His laws and to oppress another soul, even to the 
extent of a mustard seed.  On the Day of Resurrection God 
will, in truth, judge all men, and we all verily plead for 
His grace.  V, 19.  
 
+P80 
     GOD loveth those who are pure.  Naught in the &amp;Bayan and 
in the sight of God is more loved than purity and immaculate 
cleanliness....  
     God desireth not to see, in the Dispensation of the 
&amp;Bayan, any soul deprived of joy and radiance.  He indeed 
desireth that under all conditions, all may be adorned with 
such purity, both inwardly and outwardly, that no 
repugnance may be caused even to themselves, how much 
less unto others.  V, 14.  
 
 
     LIKEWISE consider the manifestation of the Point of the 
&amp;Bayan.  There are people who every night until morning 
busy themselves with the worship of God, and even at 
present when the Day-Star of Truth is nearing its zenith 
in the heaven of its Revelation, they have not yet left their 
prayer-rugs.  If any one of them ever heard the wondrous 
verses of God recited unto him, he would exclaim:  `Why 
dost thou keep me back from offering my prayers?'  O thou 
who are wrapt in veils!  If thou makest mention of God, 
wherefore sufferest thou thyself to be shut out from Him 
Who hath kindled the light of worship in thy heart?  If He 
had not previously revealed the injunction:  `Verily, make 
ye mention of God'+F1, what would have prompted thee to 
offer devotion unto God, and whereunto wouldst thou 
turn in prayer?  
     Know thou of a certainty that whenever thou makest 
mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest, only 
then art thou making mention of God.  In like manner 
shouldst thou hearken unto the verses of the &amp;Bayan and 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 8:47; 33:41; 62:10  
 
+P81 
acknowledge its truth, only then would the revealed 
verses of God profit thee.  Otherwise what benefit canst 
thou derive therefrom?  For wert thou to prostrate thyself 
in adoration from the beginning of life till the end and to 
spend thy days for the sake of God's remembrance, but 
disbelieve in the Exponent of His Revelation for the age, 
dost thou imagine that thy deeds would confer any benefit 
upon thee?  On the other hand, if thou believest in Him 
and dost recognize Him with true understanding, and He 
saith:  `I have accepted thine entire life spent in My adoration', 
then assuredly hast thou been worshipping Him most 
ardently.  Thy purpose in performing thy deeds is that God 
may graciously accept them; and divine acceptance can in 
no wise be achieved except through the acceptance of Him 
Who is the Exponent of His Revelation.  For instance, if the 
Apostle of God--may divine blessings rest upon Him-- 
accepted a certain deed, in truth God accepted it; otherwise 
it hath remained within the selfish desires of the person who 
wrought it, and did not reach the presence of God.  Likewise, 
any act which is accepted by the Point of the &amp;Bayan 
is accepted by God, inasmuch as the contingent world hath 
no other access unto the presence of the Ancient of Days.  
Whatever is sent down cometh through the Exponent of 
His Revelation, and whatever ascendeth, ascendeth unto 
the Exponent of His Revelation.  VIII, 19.  
 
 
     THERE is no doubt that the Almighty hath sent down 
these verses unto Him [the &amp;Bab], even as He sent down 
unto the Apostle of God.  Indeed no less than a hundred 
thousand verses similar to these have already been disseminated 
 
+P82 
among the people, not to mention His Epistles, 
His Prayers or His learned and philosophical treatises.  He 
revealeth no less than a thousand verses within the space of 
five hours.  He reciteth verses at a speed consonant with the 
capacity of His amanuensis to set them down.  Thus, it may 
well be considered that if from the inception of this 
Revelation until now He had been left unhindered, how 
vast then would have been the volume of writings disseminated 
from His pen.  
     If ye contend that these verses cannot, of themselves, 
be regarded as a proof, scan the pages of the &amp;Qur'an.  If 
God hath established therein any evidence other than the 
revealed verses to demonstrate the validity of the prophethood 
of His Apostle--may the blessings of God rest 
upon Him--ye may then have your scruples about Him...  
     Concerning the sufficiency of the Book as a proof, God 
hath revealed:  `Is it not enough for them that We have sent 
down unto Thee the Book to be recited to them?  In this 
verily is a mercy and a warning to those who believe.'+F1  
When God hath testified that the Book is a sufficient 
testimony, as is affirmed in the text, how can one dispute 
this truth by saying that the Book in itself is not a conclusive 
proof?...  II, 1.  
 
 
     SINCE that Day is a great Day it would be sorely trying 
for thee to identify thyself with the believers.  For the 
believers of that Day are the inmates of Paradise, while the 
unbelievers are the inmates of the fire.  And know thou of a 
certainty that by Paradise is meant recognition of and submission 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 29:50  
 
+P83 
unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and 
by the fire the company of such souls as would fail to 
submit unto Him or to be resigned to His good-pleasure.  
On that Day thou wouldst regard thyself as the inmate of 
Paradise and as a true believer in Him, whereas in reality 
thou wouldst suffer thyself to be wrapt in veils and thy 
habitation would be the nethermost fire, though thou thyself 
wouldst not be cognizant thereof.  
     Compare His manifestation with that of the Point of 
the &amp;Qur'an.  How vast the number of the Letters of the 
Gospel who eagerly expected Him, yet from the time of 
His declaration up to five years no one became an inmate of 
Paradise, except the Commander of the Faithful [&amp;Imam 
&amp;Ali], and those who secretly believed in Him.  All the rest 
were accounted as inmates of the fire, though they considered 
themselves as dwellers in Paradise.  
     Likewise behold this Revelation.  The essences of the 
people have, through divinely-conceived designs, been 
set in motion and until the present day three hundred and 
thirteen disciples have been chosen.  In the land of &amp;Sad 
[&amp;Isfahan], which to outward seeming is a great city, in 
every corner of whose seminaries are vast numbers of 
people regarded as divines and doctors, yet when the time 
came for inmost essences to be drawn forth, only its sifter 
of wheat donned the robe of discipleship.  This is the 
mystery of what was uttered by the kindred of the Prophet 
&amp;Muhammad--upon them be the peace of God-- 
concerning this Revelation, saying that the abased shall be 
exalted and the exalted shall be abased.  
     Likewise is the Revelation of Him Whom God shall 
make manifest.  Among those to whom it will never occur 
that they might merit the displeasure of God, and whose 
pious deeds will be exemplary unto everyone, there will 
 
+P84 
be many who will become the personification of the nethermost 
fire itself, when they fail to embrace His Cause; 
while among the lowly servants whom no one would 
imagine to be of any merit, how great the number who 
will be honoured with true faith and on whom the 
Fountainhead of generosity will bestow the robe of authority.  
For whatever is created in the Faith of God is created 
through the potency of His Word.  VIII, 14.  
 
 
     IN the manifestation of the Apostle of God all were eagerly 
awaiting Him, yet thou hast heard how He was treated at 
the time of His appearance, in spite of the fact that if ever 
they beheld Him in their dreams they would take pride in 
them.  
     Likewise in the manifestation of the Point of the &amp;Bayan, 
the people stood up at the mention of His Name and fervently 
implored His advent night and day, and if they 
dreamt of Him they gloried in their dreams; yet now that 
He hath revealed Himself, invested with the mightiest 
testimony, whereby their own religion is vindicated, and 
despite the incalculable number of people who yearningly 
anticipate His coming, they are resting comfortably in 
their homes, after having hearkened to His verses; while 
He at this moment is confined in the mountain of &amp;Maku, 
lonely and forsaken.  
     Take good heed of yourselves, O people of the &amp;Bayan, 
lest ye perform such deeds as to weep sore for His sake 
night and day, to stand up at the mention of His Name, yet 
on this Day of fruition--a Day whereon ye should not only 
arise at His Name, but seek a path unto Him Who personifies 
 
+P85 
that Name--ye shut yourselves out from Him as 
by as veil.  VI, 15.  
 
 
     AT the time of the manifestation of Him Whom God 
shall make manifest everyone should be well trained in the 
teachings of the &amp;Bayan, so that none of the followers may 
outwardly cling to the &amp;Bayan and thus forfeit their allegiance 
unto Him.  If anyone does so, the verdict of `disbeliever 
in God' shall be passed upon him.  
     I swear by the holy Essence of God, were all in the &amp;Bayan 
to unite in helping Him Whom God shall make manifest 
in the days of His Revelation, not a single soul, nay, not a 
created thing would remain on earth that would not gain 
admittance into Paradise.  Take good heed of yourselves, 
for the sum total of the religion of God is but to help Him, 
rather than to observe, in the time of His appearance, such 
deeds as are prescribed in the &amp;Bayan.  Should anyone, 
however, ere He manifesteth Himself, transgress the 
ordinances, were it to the extent of a grain of barley, he 
would have trangressed His command.  
     Seek ye refuge in God from whatsoever might lead you 
astray from the Source of His Revelation and hold fast 
unto His Cord, for whoso holdeth fast unto His allegiance, 
he hath attained and will attain salvation in all the worlds.  
     `Such is the bounty of God; to whom He will, He giveth 
it, and God is the Lord of grace abounding.'+F1  V, 5.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 57:21  
 
+P86 
     YE perform your works for God from the beginning of 
your lives till the end thereof, yet not a single act is for the 
sake of Him Who is the Manifestation of God, to Whom 
every good deed reverteth.  Had ye acted in such manner, 
ye would not have suffered so grievously on the Day of 
Resurrection.  
     Behold how great is the Cause, and yet how the people 
are wrapt in veils.  I swear by the sanctified Essence of God 
that every true praise and deed offered unto God is naught 
but praise and deed offered unto Him Whom God shall 
make manifest.  
     Deceive not your own selves that you are being virtuous 
for the sake of God when you are not.  For should ye truly 
do your works for God, ye would be performing them for 
Him Whom God shall make manifest and would be magnifying 
His Name.  The dwellers of this mountain who are 
bereft of true understanding unceasingly utter the words, 
`No God is there but God'; but what benefit doth it yield 
them?  Ponder awhile that ye may not be shut out as by a veil 
from Him Who is the Dayspring of Revelation.  VIII, 19.  
 
 
     GOD hath, at all times and under all conditions, been 
wholly independent of His creatures.  He hath cherished 
and will ever cherish the desire that all men may attain 
His gardens of Paradise with utmost love, that no one 
should sadden another, not even for a moment, and that all 
should dwell within His cradle of protection and security 
until the Day of Resurrection which marketh the dayspring 
of the Revelation of Him Whom God will make 
manifest.  
 
+P87 
     The Lord of the universe hath never raised up a prophet 
nor hath He sent down a Book unless He hath established 
His covenant with all men, calling for their acceptance of 
the next Revelation and of the next Book; inasmuch as 
the outpourings of His bounty are ceaseless and without 
limit.  VI, 16.  
 
 
     HOW veiled are ye, O My creatures,+F1 ... who, without 
any right, have consigned Him unto a mountain [&amp;Maku], 
not one of whose inhabitants is worthy of mention...  
With Him, which is with Me, there is no one except him 
who is one of the Letters of the Living of My Book.  In 
His presence, which is My Presence, there is not at night 
even a lighted lamp!  And yet, in places [of worship] which 
in varying degrees reach out unto Him, unnumbered lamps 
are shining!  All that is on earth hath been created for Him, 
and all partake with delight of His benefits, and yet they 
are so veiled from Him as to refuse Him even a lamp!  
     In this Day therefore I bear witness unto My creatures, 
for the witness of no one other than Myself hath been or shall 
ever be worthy of mention in My presence.  I affirm that no 
Paradise is more sublime for My creatures than to stand 
before My face and to believe in My holy Words, while 
no fire hath been or will be fiercer for them than to be 
veiled from the Manifestation of My exalted Self and to disbelieve 
in My Words.  
     Ye may contend:  `How doth He speak on our behalf?'  
 
+F1 In The Promised Day is Come on page 7 Shoghi Effendi affirms 
+F1 that this passage was revealed by the &amp;Bab speaking with the voice 
+F1 of God.  
 
+P88 
Have ye not perused the unseemly words ye uttered in the 
past, as reflected in the text of My Book, and still ye feel 
not ashamed?  Ye have now seen the truth of My Book 
conclusively established and today every one of you doth 
profess belief in Me through that Book.  The day is not far 
distant when ye shall readily realize that your glory lieth 
in your belief in these holy verses.  Today, however, when 
only belief in this Faith truly profiteth you, ye have debarred 
yourselves therefrom by reason of the things which 
are disadvantageous unto you and will inflict harm upon 
you, whereas He Who is the Manifestation of My Self 
hath been and shall ever remain immune from any harm 
whatever, and any loss that hath appeared or will appear 
shall eventually revert unto yourselves.  II, 1.  
 
 
     HOW vast the number of people who are well versed in 
every science, yet it is their adherence to the holy Word of 
God which will determine their faith, inasmuch as the 
fruit of every science is none other than the knowledge of 
divine precepts and submission unto His good-pleasure.  II, 1.  
 
 
     NO created thing shall ever attain its paradise unless it 
appeareth in its highest prescribed degree of perfection.  
For instance, this crystal representeth the paradise of the 
stone whereof its substance is composed.  Likewise there 
are various stages in the paradise for the crystal itself...  
So long as it was stone it was worthless, but if it attaineth 
 
+P89 
the excellence of ruby--a potentiality which is latent in it-- 
how much a carat will it be worth?  Consider likewise every 
created thing.  
     Man's highest station, however, is attained through 
faith in God in every Dispensation and by acceptance of 
what hath been revealed by Him, and not through learning; 
inasmuch as in every nation there are learned men who 
are versed in divers sciences.  Nor is it attainable through 
wealth; for it is similarly evident that among the various 
classes in every nation there are those possessed of riches.  
Likewise are other transitory things.  
     True knowledge, therefore, is the knowledge of God, 
and this is none other than the recognition of His Manifestation 
in each Dispensation.  Nor is there any wealth 
save in poverty in all save God and sanctity from aught else 
but Him--a state that can be realized only when demonstrated 
towards Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation.  
This doth not mean, however, that one ought not 
to yield praise unto former Revelations.  On no account is 
this acceptable, inasmuch as it behooveth man, upon 
reaching the age of nineteen, to render thanksgiving for the 
day of his conception as an embryo.  For had the embryo 
not existed, how could he have reached his present state?  
Likewise had the religion taught by Adam not existed, 
this Faith would not have attained its present stage.  Thus 
consider thou the development of God's Faith until the 
end that hath no end.  V, 4.  
 
 
     TWELVE hundred and seventy years have elapsed since 
the declaration of &amp;Muhammad, and each year unnumbered 
 
+P90 
people have circumambulated the House of God [Mecca].  
In the concluding year of this period He Who is Himself 
the Founder of the House went on pilgrimage.  Great God!  
There was a vast concourse of pilgrims from every sect.  
Yet not one recognized Him, though He recognized every 
one of them--souls tightly held in the grasp of His former 
commandment.  The only person who recognized Him and 
performed pilgrimage with Him is the one round whom 
revolve eight &amp;Vahids,+F1 in whom God hath gloried before 
the Concourse on high by virtue of his absolute detachment 
and for his being wholly devoted to the Will of God.  
This doth not mean that he was made the object of a special 
favour, nay, this is a favour which God hath vouchsafed 
unto all men, yet they have suffered themselves to be veiled 
from it.  The Commentary on the &amp;Surih of Joseph had, in 
the first year of this Revelation, been widely distributed.  
Nevertheless, when the people realized that fellow supporters 
were not forthcoming they hesitated to accept it; 
while it never occurred to them that the very &amp;Qur'an 
whereunto unnumbered souls bear fealty today, was 
revealed in the midmost heart of the Arab world, yet to 
outward seeming for no less than seven years no one acknowledged 
its truth except the Commander of the Faithful 
[&amp;Imam &amp;Ali]--may the peace of God rest upon him--who, 
in response to the conclusive proofs advanced by God's 
supreme Testimony, recognized the Truth and did not fix 
his eyes on others.  Thus on the Day of Resurrection God 
will ask everyone of his understanding and not of his 
following in the footsteps of others.  How often a person, 
having inclined his ears to the holy verses, would bow 
 
+F1 This is a reference to &amp;Quddus, `whom the Persian &amp;Bayan extolled 
+F1 as that fellow-pilgrim round whom mirrors to the number of 
+F1 eight &amp;Vahids revolve'.  (God Passes By, p. 49).  
 
+P91 
down in humility and would embrace the Truth, while his 
leader would not do so.  Thus every individual must bear 
his own responsibility, rather than someone else bearing 
it for him.  At the time of the appearance of Him Whom 
God will make manifest the most distinguished among the 
learned and the lowliest of men shall both be judged alike.  
How often the most insignificant of men have acknowledged 
the truth, while the most learned have remained 
wrapt in veils.  Thus in every Dispensation a number of 
souls enter the fire by reason of their following in the footsteps 
of others.  IV, 18.  
 
 
     BETTER is it for a person to write down but one of His 
verses than to transcribe the whole of the &amp;Bayan and all the 
books which have been written in the Dispensation of the 
&amp;Bayan.  For everything shall be set aside except His 
Writings, which will endure until the following Revelation.  
And should anyone inscribe with true faith but one letter 
of that Revelation, his recompense would be greater than 
for inscribing all the heavenly Writings of the past and all 
that has been written during previous Dispensations.  Likewise 
continue thou to ascend through one Revelation after 
another, knowing that thy progress in the Knowledge of 
God shall never come to an end, even as it can have no 
beginning.  VII, 13.  
 
+P92  
     O PEOPLE of the &amp;Bayan!  Be on your guard; for on the 
Day of Resurrection no one shall find a place to flee to.  
He will shine forth suddenly, and will pronounce judgement 
as He pleaseth.  If it be His wish He will cause the 
abased to be exalted, and the exalted to be abased, even as 
He did in the &amp;Bayan, couldst thou but understand.  And no 
one but Him is equal unto this.  Whatever He ordaineth 
will be fulfilled, and nothing will remain unfulfilled.  VII, 9.  
 
 
     SINCE all men have issued forth from the shadow of the 
signs of His Divinity and Lordship, they always tend to 
take a path, lofty and high.  And because they are bereft of a 
discerning eye to recognize their Beloved, they fall short 
of their duty to manifest meekness and humility towards 
Him.  Nevertheless, from the beginning of their lives till 
the end thereof, in conformity with the laws established in 
the previous religion, they worship God, piously adore 
Him, bow themselves before His divine Reality and show 
submissiveness toward His exalted Essence.  At the hour of 
His manifestation, however, they all turn their gaze toward 
their own selves and are thus shut out from Him, inasmuch 
as they fancifully regard Him as one like unto themselves.  
Far from the glory of God is such a comparison.  Indeed 
that august Being resembleth the physical sun, His verses 
are like its rays, and all believers, should they truly believe 
in Him, are as mirrors wherein the sun is reflected.  Their 
light is thus a mere reflection.  VII, 15.  
 
+P93 
     O PEOPLE of the &amp;Bayan!  If ye believe in Him Whom God 
shall make manifest, to your own behoof do ye believe.  He 
hath been and ever will remain independent of all men.  
For instance, were ye to place unnumbered mirrors before 
the sun, they would all reflect the sun and produce impressions 
thereof, whereas the sun is in itself wholly independent 
of the existence of the mirrors and of the suns which 
they reproduce.  Such are the bounds of the contingent 
beings in their relation to the manifestation of the Eternal 
Being...  
     In this day no less than seventy thousand people make 
pilgrimage every year to the holy House of God in compliance 
with the bidding of the Apostle of God; while He 
Himself Who ordained this ordinance took refuge for 
seven years in the mountains of Mecca.  And this notwithstanding 
that the One Who enjoined this commandment is 
far greater than the commandment itself.  Hence all this 
people who at this time go on pilgrimage do not do so with 
true understanding, otherwise in this Day of His Return 
which is mightier than His former Dispensation, they 
would have followed His commandment.  But now behold 
what hath happened.  People who profess belief in His 
former religion, who in the daytime and in the night 
season bow down in worship in His Name, have assigned 
Him to a dwelling place in a mountain, while each one of 
them would regard attaining recognition of Him as an 
honour.  VII, 15.  
 
 
     THE reason why privacy hath been enjoined in moments 
of devotion is this, that thou mayest give thy best attention 
 
+P94 
to the remembrance of God, that thy heart may at all times 
be animated with His Spirit, and not be shut out as by a veil 
from thy Best Beloved.  Let not thy tongue pay lip service 
in praise of God while thy heart be not attuned to the 
exalted Summit of Glory, and the Focal Point of communion.  
Thus if haply thou dost live in the Day of Resurrection, 
the mirror of thy heart will be set towards Him 
Who is the Day-Star of Truth; and no sooner will His 
light shine forth than the splendour thereof shall forthwith 
be reflected in thy heart.  For He is the Source of all goodness, 
and unto Him revert all things.  But if He appeareth 
while thou hast turned unto thyself in meditation, this shall 
not profit thee, unless thou shalt mention His Name by 
words He hath revealed.  For in the forthcoming Revelation 
it is He Who is the Remembrance of God, whereas the 
devotions which thou art offering at present have been 
prescribed by the Point of the &amp;Bayan, while He Who will 
shine resplendent in the Day of Resurrection is the Revelation 
of the inner reality enshrined in the Point of the &amp;Bayan 
--a Revelation more potent, immeasurably more potent, 
than the one which hath preceded it.  IX, 4.  
 
 
     IT is seemly that the servant should, after each prayer, 
supplicate God to bestow mercy and forgiveness upon his 
parents.  Thereupon God's call will be raised:  `Thousand 
upon thousand of what thou hast asked for thy parents shall 
be thy recompense!'  Blessed is he who remembereth his 
parents when communing with God.  There is, verily, no 
God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.  VIII, 16.  
 
+P95 
     AS this physical frame is the throne of the inner temple, 
whatever occurs to the former is felt by the latter.  In 
reality that which takes delight in joy or is saddened by 
pain is the inner temple of the body, not the body itself.  
Since this physical body is the throne whereon the inner 
temple is established, God hath ordained that the body be 
preserved to the extent possible, so that nothing that causeth 
repugnance may be experienced.  The inner temple beholdeth 
its physical frame, which is its throne.  Thus, if the 
latter is accorded respect, it is as if the former is the recipient.  
The converse is likewise true.  
     Therefore, it hath been ordained that the dead body 
should be treated with the utmost honour and respect.  V, 12.  
 
 
     AT the time of the appearance of Him Whom God shall 
make manifest, wert thou to perform thy deeds for the sake 
of the Point of the &amp;Bayan, they would be regarded as performed 
for one other than God, inasmuch as on that Day 
the Point of the &amp;Bayan is none other than Him Whom God 
shall make manifest...  
     It is for this reason that at the beginning of every Dispensation 
a vast multitude, who fondly imagine that their 
deeds are for God, become drowned and ungodly, and 
perceive this not, except such as He guideth at His behest.  
     It is better for a man to guide a soul than to possess all 
that lies between East and West.  Likewise better is guidance 
for him who is guided than all the things that exist on 
earth, for by reason of this guidance he will, after his death, 
gain admittance into Paradise, whereas by reason of the 
things of the world below, he will, after his death, receive 
 
+P96 
his deserts.  Hence God desireth that all men should be 
guided aright through the potency of the Words of Him 
Whom God shall make manifest.  However, such as are 
conceited will not suffer themselves to be guided.  They will 
be debarred from the Truth, some by reason of their learning, 
others on account of their glory and power, and still 
others due to reasons of their own, none of which shall be 
of any avail at the hour of death.  
     Take thou good heed that ye may all, under the leadership 
of Him Who is the Source of Divine Guidance, be enabled 
to direct thy steps aright upon the Bridge, which is sharper 
than the sword and finer than a hair, so that perchance the 
things which from the beginning of thy life till the end 
thou hast performed for the love of God, may not, all at 
once and unrealized by thyself, be turned to acts not acceptable 
in the sight of God.  Verily God guideth whom He will 
into the path of absolute certitude.  VII, 2.  
 
 
     EVERYONE is eagerly awaiting His appearance, yet since 
their inner eyes are not directed towards Him sorrow must 
needs befall Him.  In the case of the Apostle of God--may 
the blessings of God rest upon Him--before the revelation 
of the &amp;Qur'an everyone bore witness to His piety and noble 
virtues.  Behold Him then after the revelation of the 
&amp;Qur'an.  What outrageous insults were levelled against 
Him, as indeed the pen is ashamed to recount.  Likewise 
behold the Point of the &amp;Bayan.  His behaviour prior to the 
declaration of His mission is clearly evident unto those who 
knew Him.  Now, following His manifestation, although 
He hath, up to the present, revealed no less than five 
 
+P97 
hundred thousand verses on different subjects, behold what 
calumnies are uttered, so unseemly that the pen is stricken 
with shame at the mention of them.  But if all men were to 
observe the ordinances of God no sadness would befall that 
heavenly Tree.  VI, 11.  
 
 
     THE acts of Him Whom God shall make manifest are like 
unto the sun, while the works of men, provided they conform 
to the good-pleasure of God, resemble the stars or the 
moon...  Thus, should the followers of the &amp;Bayan observe 
the precepts of Him Whom God shall make manifest at 
the time of His appearance, and regard themselves and 
their own works as stars exposed to the light of the sun, 
then they will have gathered the fruits of their existence; 
otherwise the title of `starship' will not apply to them.  Rather 
it will apply to such as truly believe in Him, to those who 
pale into insignificance in the day-time and gleam forth with 
light in the night season.  
     Such indeed is the fruit of this precept, should anyone 
observe it on the Day of Resurrection.  This is the essence 
of all learning and of all righteous deeds, should anyone but 
attain unto it.  Had the peoples of the world fixed their gaze 
upon this principle, no Exponent of divine Revelation 
would ever have, at the inception of any Dispensation, 
regarded them as things of naught.  However, the fact is 
that during the night season everyone perceiveth the light 
which he himself, according to his own capacity, giveth 
out, oblivious that at the break of day this light shall fade 
away and be reduced to utter nothingness before the 
dazzling splendour of the sun.  
 
+P98 
     The light of the people of the world is their knowledge 
and utterance; while the splendours shed from the glorious 
acts of Him Whom God shall make manifest are His 
Words, through whose potency He rolleth up the whole 
world of existence, sets it under His Own authority by 
relating it unto Himself, then as the Mouthpiece of God, 
the Source of His divine light--exalted and glorified be He 
--proclaimeth:  `Verily, verily, I am God, no God is there 
but Me; in truth all others except Me are My creatures.  
Say, O My creatures!  Me alone, therefore, should ye fear'.  
VIII, 1.  
 
 
     KNOW thou that in the &amp;Bayan purification is regarded as 
the most acceptable means for attaining nearness unto God 
and as the most meritorious of all deeds.  Thus purge thou 
thine ear that thou mayest hear no mention besides God, 
and purge thine eye that it behold naught except God, and 
thy conscience that it perceive naught other than God, and 
thy tongue that it proclaim nothing but God, and thy hand 
to write naught but the words of God, and thy knowledge 
that it comprehend naught except God, and thy heart that 
it entertain no wish save God, and in like manner purge all 
thine acts and thy pursuits that thou mayest be nurtured in 
the paradise of pure love, and perchance mayest attain the 
presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, adorned 
with a purity which He highly cherisheth, and be sanctified 
from whosoever hath turned away from Him and doth 
not support Him.  Thus shalt thou manifest a purity that 
shall profit thee.  
     Know thou that every ear which hearkeneth unto His 
 
+P99 
Words with true faith shall be immune from the fire.  Thus 
the believer, through his recognition of Him will appreciate 
the transcendent character of His heavenly Words, will 
whole-heartedly choose Him over others, and will refuse to 
incline his affections towards those who disbelieve in Him.  
Whatever one gaineth in the life to come is but the fruit of 
this faith.  Indeed any man whose eye gazeth upon His 
Words with true faith well deserveth Paradise; and one 
whose conscience beareth witness unto His Words with 
true faith shall abide in Paradise and attain the presence of 
God; and one whose tongue giveth utterance to His Words 
with true faith shall have his abode in Paradise, wherein he 
will be seized with ecstasy in praise and glorification of 
God, the Ever-Abiding, Whose revelations of glory never 
end and the reviving breaths of Whose holiness never fail.  
Every hand which setteth down His Words with true faith 
shall be filled by God, both in this world and in the next, 
with things that are highly prized; and every breast which 
committeth His Words to memory, God shall cause, if it 
were that of a believer, to be filled with His love; and every 
heart which cherisheth the love of His Words and manifesteth 
in itself the signs of true faith when His Name is 
mentioned, and exemplifieth the words, `their hearts are 
thrilled with awe at the mention of God',+F1 that heart will 
become the object of the glances of divine favour and on 
the Day of Resurrection will be highly praised by God.  
IX, 10.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 8:2  
 
+P100 
     IF at the time of the appearance of Him Whom God will 
make manifest all the dwellers of the earth were to bear 
witness unto a thing whereunto He beareth witness differently, 
His testimony would be like unto the sun, while 
theirs would be even as a false image produced in a mirror 
which is not facing the sun.  For had it been otherwise their 
testimony would have proved a faithful reflection of His 
testimony.  
     I swear by the most sacred Essence of God that but one 
line of the Words uttered by Him is more sublime than the 
words uttered by all that dwell on earth.  Nay, I beg forgiveness 
for making this comparison.  How could the reflections 
of the sun in the mirror compare with the wondrous rays 
of the sun in the visible heaven?  The station of one is that of 
nothingness, while the station of the other, by the righteousness 
of God--hallowed and magnified be His Name--is 
that of the Reality of things....  
     If in the Day of His manifestation a king were to make 
mention of his own sovereignty, this would be like unto a 
mirror challenging the sun, saying:  `The light is in me'.  It 
would be likewise, if a man of learning in His Day were to 
claim to be an exponent of knowledge, or if he who is 
possessed of riches were to display his affluence, or if a 
man wielding power were to assert his own authority, or 
if one invested with grandeur were to show forth his glory.  
Nay, such men would become the object of the derision of 
their peers, and how would they be judged by Him Who 
is the Sun of Truth!  III, 12.  
 
+P101 
     IT is not permissible to ask questions from Him Whom 
God will make manifest, except that which well beseemeth 
Him.  For His station is that of the Essence of divine Revelation...  
Whatever evidence of bounty is witnessed in the 
world, is but an image of His bounty; and every thing owes 
its existence to His Being...  The &amp;Bayan is, from beginning 
to end, the repository of all of His attributes, and the 
treasury of both His fire and His light.  Should anyone desire 
to ask questions, he is allowed to do so only in writing, that 
he may derive ample understanding from His written reply 
and that it may serve as a sign from his Beloved.  However, 
let no one ask aught that may prove unworthy of His lofty 
station.  For instance, were a person to inquire the price of 
straw from a merchant of rubies, how ignorant would he 
be and how unacceptable.  Similarly unacceptable would 
be the questions of the highest-ranking people of the world 
in His presence, except such words as He Himself would 
utter about Himself in the Day of His manifestation.  
     Methinks I visualize those who would, prompted by 
their own deluded conceptions, write to Him and ask Him 
questions about that which hath been revealed in the &amp;Bayan, 
and He would answer them with words not of His Own, 
but divinely inspired, saying:  `Verily, verily, I am God; no 
God is there but Me.  I have called into being all the created 
things, I have raised up divine Messengers in the past and 
have sent down Books unto Them.  Take heed not to worship 
anyone but God, He Who is My Lord and your Lord.  
This indeed is the undoubted truth.  However, alike shall it 
be to Me; if ye believe in Me, ye will provide good for 
your own souls, and if ye believe not in Me, nor in that 
which God hath revealed unto Me, ye will suffer yourselves 
to be shut out as by a veil.  For verily I have been independent 
of you heretofore, and shall remain independent hereafter.  
 
+P102 
Therefore it behooveth you, O creatures of God, to 
help your own selves and to believe in the Verses revealed 
by Me...'  III, 13.  
 
 
     THE &amp;Bayan shall constitute God's unerring balance till the 
Day of Resurrection which is the Day of Him Whom God 
will make manifest.  Whoso acteth in conformity with that 
which is revealed therein will abide in Paradise, under the 
shadow of His affirmation and reckoned among the most 
sublime Letters in the presence of God; while whoso 
deviateth, were it even so much as the tip of a grain of 
barley, will be consigned to the fire and will be assembled 
neath the shadow of negation.  This truth hath likewise been 
laid bare in the &amp;Qur'an where in numerous instances God 
hath set down that whoever should pass judgement contrary 
to the bounds fixed by Him, would be deemed an 
infidel...  
     In these days how few are those who abide by the 
standard laid down in the &amp;Qur'an.  Nay, nowhere are they 
to be found, except such as God hath willed.  Should 
there be, however, such a person, his righteous deeds would 
prove of no avail unto him, if he hath failed to follow the 
standard revealed in the &amp;Bayan; even as the pious deeds of 
the Christian monks profited them not, inasmuch as at the 
time of the manifestation of the Apostle of God--may the 
blessings of God rest upon Him--they contented themselves 
with the standard set forth in the Gospel.  
     Had the divine standard laid down in the &amp;Qur'an been 
truly observed, adverse judgements would not have been 
pronounced against Him Who is the Tree of divine Truth.  
 
+P103 
As it hath been revealed:  `Almost might the heavens be 
rent and the earth be cleft asunder and the mountains fall 
down in fragments.'+F1  And yet how much harder than these 
mountains their hearts must be to have remained unmoved!  
Indeed no paradise is more glorious in the sight of 
God than attainment unto His good-pleasure.  II, 6.  
 
 
     THE One true God may be compared unto the sun and 
the believer unto a mirror.  No sooner is the mirror placed 
before the sun than it reflects its light.  The unbeliever may 
be likened unto a stone.  No matter how long it is exposed 
to the sunshine, it cannot reflect the sun.  Thus the former 
layeth down his life as a sacrifice, while the latter doeth 
against God what he committeth.  Indeed, if God willeth, 
He is potent to turn the stone into a mirror, but the person 
himself remaineth reconciled to his state.  Had he wished to 
become a crystal, God would have made him to assume 
crystal form.  For on that Day whatever cause prompteth 
the believer to believe in Him, the same will also be available 
to the unbeliever.  But when the latter suffereth himself 
to be wrapt in veils, the same cause shutteth him out as by a 
veil.  Thus, as is clearly evident today, those who have set 
their faces toward God, the True One, have believed in Him 
because of the &amp;Bayan, while such as are veiled have 
been deprived because of it.  VI, 4.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 19:92  
 
+P104 
     I SWEAR by the most holy Essence of God--exalted and 
glorified be He--that in the Day of the appearance of Him 
Whom God shall make manifest a thousand perusals of the 
&amp;Bayan cannot equal the perusal of a single verse to be 
revealed by Him Whom God shall make manifest.  
     Ponder a while and observe that everything in &amp;Islam hath 
its ultimate and eventual beginning in the Book of God.  
Consider likewise the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom 
God shall make manifest, He in Whose grasp lieth the 
source of proofs, and let not erroneous considerations shut 
thee out from Him, for He is immeasurably exalted above 
them, inasmuch as every proof proceedeth from the Book 
of God which is itself the supreme testimony, as all men are 
powerless to produce its like.  Should myriads of men of 
learning, versed in logic, in the science of grammar, in law, 
in jurisprudence and the like, turn away from the Book of 
God, they would still be pronounced unbelievers.  Thus the 
fruit is within the supreme testimony itself, not in the things 
derived therefrom.  And know thou of a certainty that 
every letter revealed in the &amp;Bayan is solely intended to 
evoke submission unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, 
for it is He Who hath revealed the &amp;Bayan prior to His 
Own manifestation.  V, 8.  
 
 
     IN this Revelation the Lord of the universe hath deigned 
to bestow His mighty utterances and resplendent signs 
upon the Point of the &amp;Bayan, and hath ordained them as 
His matchless testimony for all created things.  Were all the 
people that dwell on earth to assemble together, they would 
be unable to produce a single verse like unto the ones which 
 
+P105 
God hath caused to stream forth from the tongue of the 
Point of the &amp;Bayan.  Indeed, if any living creature were to 
pause to meditate he would undoubtedly realize that these 
verses are not the work of man, but are solely to be ascribed 
unto God, the One, the Peerless, Who causeth them to 
flow forth from the tongue of whomsoever He willeth, 
and hath not revealed nor will He reveal them save through 
the Focal Point of God's Primal Will.  He it is, through 
Whose dispensations divine Messengers are raised up and 
heavenly Books are sent down.  Had human beings been 
able to accomplish this deed surely someone would have 
brought forth at least one verse during the period of twelve 
hundred and seventy years which hath elapsed since the 
revelation of the &amp;Qur'an until that of the &amp;Bayan.  However, 
all men have proved themselves impotent and have utterly 
failed to do so, although they endeavoured, with their 
vehement might, to quench the flame of the Word of God.  
II, 1.  
 
 
     THOU beholdest how vast is the number of people who 
go to Mecca each year on pilgrimage and engage in circumambulation, 
while He, through the potency of Whose 
Word the &amp;Ka'bah [the sanctuary in Mecca] hath become 
the object of adoration, is forsaken in this mountain.  He is 
none other but the Apostle of God Himself, inasmuch as 
the Revelation of God may be likened to the sun.  No matter 
how innumerable its risings, there is but one sun, and upon 
it depends the life of all things.  It is clear and evident that 
the object of all preceding Dispensations hath been to pave 
the way for the advent of &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God.  
 
+P106 
These, including the &amp;Muhammadan Dispensation, have 
had, in their turn, as their objective the Revelation proclaimed 
by the &amp;Qa'im.  The purpose underlying this 
Revelation, as well as those that preceded it, has, in like 
manner, been to announce the advent of the Faith of Him 
Whom God will make manifest.  And this Faith--the Faith 
of Him Whom God will make manifest--in its turn, together 
with all the Revelations gone before it, have as their 
object the Manifestation destined to succeed it.  And the 
latter, no less than all the Revelations preceding it, prepare 
the way for the Revelation which is yet to follow.  The 
process of the rise and setting of the Sun of Truth will thus 
indefinitely continue--a process that hath had no beginning 
and will have no end.  
     Well is it with him who in every Dispensation recognizeth 
the Purpose of God for that Dispensation, and is not 
deprived therefrom by turning his gaze towards the things 
of the past.  IV, 12.  
 
 
     THE substance of this chapter is this, that what is intended 
by the Day of Resurrection is the Day of the appearance of 
the Tree of divine Reality, but it is not seen that any one of 
the followers of &amp;Shi'ih &amp;Islam hath understood the meaning 
of the Day of Resurrection; rather have they fancifully 
imagined a thing which with God hath no reality.  In the 
estimation of God and according to the usage of such as 
are initiated into divine mysteries, what is meant by the 
Day of Resurrection is this, that from the time of the 
appearance of Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality, at 
whatever period and under whatever name, until the 
 
+P107 
moment of His disappearance, is the Day of Resurrection.  
     For example, from the inception of the mission of Jesus 
--may peace be upon Him--till the day of His ascension 
was the Resurrection of Moses.  For during that period the 
Revelation of God shone forth through the appearance of 
that divine Reality, Who rewarded by His Word everyone 
who believed in Moses, and punished by His Word everyone 
who did not believe; inasmuch as God's Testimony for 
that Day was that which He had solemnly affirmed in the 
Gospel.  And from the inception of the Revelation of the 
Apostle of God--may the blessings of God be upon Him-- 
till the day of His ascension was the Resurrection of Jesus-- 
peace be upon Him--wherein the Tree of divine Reality 
appeared in the person of &amp;Muhammad, rewarding by His 
Word everyone who was a believer in Jesus, and punishing 
by His Word everyone who was not a believer in Him.  
And from the moment when the Tree of the &amp;Bayan 
appeared until it disappeareth is the Resurrection of the 
Apostle of God, as is divinely foretold in the &amp;Qur'an; the 
beginning of which was when two hours and eleven 
minutes had passed on the eve of the fifth of &amp;Jamadiyu'l-Avval, 
1260 A.H.,+F1 which is the year 1270 of the Declaration 
of the Mission of &amp;Muhammad.  This was the beginning 
of the Day of Resurrection of the &amp;Qur'an, and until the 
disappearance of the Tree of divine Reality is the Resurrection 
of the &amp;Qur'an.  The stage of perfection of everything is 
reached when its resurrection occurreth.  The perfection of 
the religion of &amp;Islam was consummated at the beginning 
of this Revelation; and from the rise of this Revelation until 
its setting, the fruits of the Tree of &amp;Islam, whatever they 
are, will become apparent.  The Resurrection of the &amp;Bayan 
will occur at the time of the appearance of Him Whom 
 
+F1 22 May 1844  
 
+P108 
God shall make manifest.  For today the &amp;Bayan is in the 
stage of seed; at the beginning of the manifestation of Him 
Whom God shall make manifest its ultimate perfection 
will become apparent.  He is made manifest in order to 
gather the fruits of the trees He hath planted; even as the 
Revelation of the &amp;Qa'im [He Who ariseth], a descendant of 
&amp;Muhammad--may the blessings of God rest upon Him-- 
is exactly like unto the Revelation of the Apostle of God 
Himself [&amp;Muhammad].  He appeareth not, save for the 
purpose of gathering the fruits of &amp;Islam from the &amp;Qur'anic 
verses which He [&amp;Muhammad] hath sown in the hearts of 
men.  The fruits of &amp;Islam cannot be gathered except through 
allegiance unto Him [the &amp;Qa'im] and by believing in Him.  
At the present time, however, only adverse effects have 
resulted; for although He hath appeared in the midmost 
heart of &amp;Islam, and all people profess it by reason of their 
relationship to Him [the &amp;Qa'im], yet unjustly have they 
consigned Him to the Mountain of &amp;Maku, and this notwithstanding 
that in the &amp;Qur'an the advent of the Day of 
Resurrection hath been promised unto all by God.  For on 
that Day all men will be brought before God and will attain 
His Presence; which meaneth appearance before Him Who 
is the Tree of divine Reality and attainment unto His 
presence; inasmuch as it is not possible to appear before the 
Most Holy Essence of God, nor is it conceivable to seek reunion 
with Him.  That which is feasible in the matter of 
appearance before Him and of meeting Him is attainment 
unto the Primal Tree.  II, 7.  
 
+P109 
     THE evidence set forth by God can never be compared 
with the evidences produced by any one of the peoples and 
kindreds of the earth; and beyond a shadow of doubt no 
evidence is set forth by God save through the One Who is 
appointed as His supreme Testimony.  Moreover, the proof 
of revealed verses doth, alone and of itself, conclusively 
demonstrate the utter impotence of all created things on 
earth, for this is a proof which hath proceeded from God 
and shall endure until the Day of Resurrection.  
     And if anyone should reflect on the appearance of this 
Tree, he will undoubtedly testify to the loftiness of the 
Cause of God.  For if one from whose life only twenty-four 
years have passed, and who is devoid of those sciences 
wherein all are learned, now reciteth verses after such 
fashion without thought or hesitation, writes a thousand 
verses of prayer in the course of five hours without pause 
of the pen, and produceth commentaries and learned 
treatises on such lofty themes as the true understanding of 
God and of the oneness of His Being, in a manner which 
doctors and philosophers confess surpasseth their power of 
understanding, then there is no doubt that all that hath 
been manifested is divinely inspired.  Notwithstanding their 
life-long diligent study, what pains do these divines take 
when writing a single line in Arabic!  Yet after such efforts 
the result is but words which are unworthy of mention.  
All these things are for a proof unto the people; otherwise 
the religion of God is too mighty and glorious for anyone 
to comprehend through aught but itself; rather by it all else 
is understood.  II, 1.  
 
+P110 
     PRAISE be to God that He hath enabled us to become 
cognizant of Him Whom God shall make manifest in the 
Day of Resurrection, so that we may derive benefit from 
the fruit of our existence and be not deprived of attaining 
the presence of God.  For indeed this is the object of our 
creation and the sole purpose underlying every virtuous 
deed we may perform.  Such is the bounty which God hath 
conferred upon us; verily He is the All-Bountiful, the 
Gracious.  Know thou, that thou wilt succeed in doing so if 
thou believest with undoubting faith.  However, since thou 
canst not attain the state of undoubting faith, due to the 
intervening veils of thy selfish desires, therefore thou wilt 
tarry in the fire, though realizing it not.  On the Day of His 
manifestation, unless thou truly believest in Him, naught 
can save thee from the fire, even if thou dost perform every 
righteous deed.  If thou embracest the Truth, everything 
good and seemly shall be set down for thee in the Book of 
God, and by virtue of this thou wilt rejoice in the all-highest 
Paradise until the following Resurrection.  
     Consider with due attention, for the path is very strait, 
even while it is more spacious than the heavens and the 
earth and what is between them.  For instance, if all those 
who were expecting the fulfilment of the promise of Jesus 
had been assured of the manifestation of &amp;Muhammad, the 
Apostle of God, not one would have turned aside from the 
sayings of Jesus.  So likewise in the Revelation of the Point 
of the &amp;Bayan, if all should be assured that this is that same 
Promised &amp;Mihdi [One Who is guided] whom the Apostle 
of God foretold, not one of the believers in the &amp;Qur'an 
would turn aside from the sayings of the Apostle of God.  So 
likewise in the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make 
manifest, behold the same thing; for should all be assured 
that He is that same `He Whom God shall make manifest' 
 
+P111 
whom the Point of the &amp;Bayan hath foretold, not one would 
turn aside.  IX, 3.  
 
 
     IN the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy.  
All praise and glory befitteth the sacred and glorious court 
of the sovereign Lord, Who from everlasting hath dwelt, 
and unto everlasting will continue to dwell within the 
mystery of His Own divine Essence, Who from time immemorial 
hath abided and will forever continue to abide 
within His transcendent eternity, exalted above the reach 
and ken of all created beings.  The sign of His matchless 
Revelation as created by Him and imprinted upon the realities 
of all beings, is none other but their powerlessness to 
know Him.  The light He hath shed upon all things is none 
but the splendour of His Own Self.  He Himself hath at all 
times been immeasurably exalted above any association 
with His creatures.  He hath fashioned the entire creation in 
such wise that all beings may, by virtue of their innate 
powers, bear witness before God on the Day of Resurrection 
that He hath no peer or equal and is sanctified from 
any likeness, similitude or comparison.  He hath been and 
will ever be one and incomparable in the transcendent 
glory of His divine being and He hath ever been indescribably 
mighty in the sublimity of His sovereign Lordship.  
No one hath ever been able befittingly to recognize Him 
nor will any man succeed at any time in comprehending 
Him as is truly meet and seemly, for any reality to which 
the term `being' is applicable hath been created by the 
sovereign Will of the Almighty, Who hath shed upon it the 
radiance of His Own Self, shining forth from His most 
 
+P112 
august station.  He hath moreover deposited within the 
realities of all created things the emblem of His recognition, 
that everyone may know of a certainty that He is the 
Beginning and the End, the Manifest and the Hidden, the 
Maker and the Sustainer, the Omnipotent and the All-Knowing, 
the One Who heareth and perceiveth all things, 
He Who is invincible in His power and standeth supreme 
in His Own identity, He Who quickeneth and causeth to 
die, the All-Powerful, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, 
the Most High.  Every revelation of His divine Essence betokens 
the sublimity of His glory, the loftiness of His 
sanctity, the inaccessible height of His oneness and the 
exaltation of His majesty and power.  His beginning hath 
had no beginning other than His Own firstness and His end 
knoweth no end save His Own lastness.  I, 1.  
 
 
     THE revelation of the Divine Reality hath everlastingly 
been identical with its concealment and its concealment 
identical with its revelation.  That which is intended by 
`Revelation of God' is the Tree of divine Truth that betokeneth 
none but Him, and it is this divine Tree that hath 
raised and will raise up Messengers, and hath revealed and 
will ever reveal Scriptures.  From eternity unto eternity this 
Tree of divine Truth hath served and will ever serve as the 
throne of the revelation and concealment of God among 
His creatures, and in every age is made manifest through 
whomsoever He pleaseth.  At the time of the revelation of 
the &amp;Qur'an He asserted His transcendent power through 
the advent of &amp;Muhammad, and on the occasion of the 
revelation of the &amp;Bayan He demonstrated His sovereign 
 
+P113 
might through the appearance of the Point of the &amp;Bayan, 
and when He Whom God shall make manifest will shine 
forth, it will be through Him that He will vindicate the 
truth of His Faith, as He pleaseth, with whatsoever He 
pleaseth and for whatsoever He pleaseth.  He is with all 
things, yet nothing is with Him.  He is not within a thing 
nor above it nor beside it.  Any reference to His being 
established upon the throne implieth that the Exponent of 
His Revelation is established upon the seat of transcendent 
authority...  
 
     He hath everlastingly existed and will everlastingly 
continue to exist.  He hath been and will ever remain 
inscrutable unto all men, inasmuch as all else besides Him 
have been and shall ever be created through the potency of 
His command.  He is exalted above every mention or praise 
and is sanctified beyond every word of commendation or 
every comparison.  No created thing comprehendeth Him, 
while He in truth comprehendeth all things.  Even when it 
is said `no created thing comprehendeth Him', this refers 
to the Mirror of His Revelation, that is Him Whom God 
shall make manifest.  Indeed too high and exalted is He 
for anyone to allude unto Him.  II, 8.

recognition of His divine unity, which in turn reacheth its 
fulfilment in acclaiming that His hallowed and exalted 
Sanctuary, the Seat of His transcendent majesty, is sanctified 
from all attributes.  And know thou that in this world 
of being the knowledge of God can never be attained save 
through the knowledge of Him Who is the Dayspring of 
divine Reality.  
 
 
     GRACIOUS God!  Within the domains of &amp;Islam there are 
at present seven powerful sovereigns ruling the world.  
None of them hath been informed of His [the &amp;Bab's] 
Manifestation, and if informed, none hath believed in Him.  
Who knoweth, they may leave this world below full of 
desire, and without having realized that the thing for which 
they were waiting had come to pass.  This is what happened 
to the monarchs that held fast unto the Gospel.  They awaited 
the coming of the Prophet of God [&amp;Muhammad], and 
when He did appear, they failed to recognize Him.  Behold 
how great are the sums which these sovereigns expend 
without even the slightest thought of appointing an official 
charged with the task of acquainting them in their own 
realms with the Manifestation of God!  They would thereby 
have fulfilled the purpose for which they have been created.  
All their desires have been and are still fixed upon leaving 
behind them traces of their names.  
 
+P118 
     PONDER likewise the Dispensation of the Apostle of God 
which lasted twelve hundred and seventy years+F1 till the 
dawn of the manifestation of the &amp;Bayan.  He directed everyone 
to await the advent of the Promised &amp;Qa'im.  All deeds 
which in the Islamic Dispensation began with &amp;Muhammad 
should find their consummation through the appearance 
of the &amp;Qa'im.  God hath made Him manifest invested with 
the proof wherewith the Apostle of God was invested, so 
that none of the believers in the &amp;Qur'an might entertain 
doubts about the validity of His Cause, for it is set down in 
the &amp;Qur'an that none but God is capable of revealing verses.  
During the period of 1270 years no one among the followers 
of the &amp;Qur'an ever witnessed a person appearing with 
conclusive proofs.  Now the Ever-Living Lord hath made 
manifest and invested with supreme testimony this long-awaited 
Promised One from a place no one could imagine 
and from a person whose knowledge was deemed of no 
account.  His age is no more than twenty-five years, yet 
His glory is such as none of the learned among the people 
of &amp;Islam can rival; inasmuch as man's glory lieth in his 
knowledge.  Behold the learned who are honoured by 
virtue of their ability to understand the Holy Writings, 
and God hath exalted them to such a degree that in referring 
to them He saith:  `None knoweth the meaning thereof 
except God and them that are well-grounded in knowledge.'+F2  
How strange then that this twenty-five-year-old 
untutored one should be singled out to reveal His verses 
in so astounding a manner.  If the Muslim divines have 
cause for pride in understanding the meaning of the Holy 
 
+F1 From the Declaration of &amp;Muhammad; this occurred ten years 
+F1 before the Hijrah which marks the starting point of the Muslim 
+F1 calendar.  
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 3:5  
 
+P119 
Writings, His glory is in revealing the Writings, that none 
of them may hesitate to believe in His Words.  So great is the 
celestial might and power which God hath revealed in Him 
that if it were His will and no break should intervene He 
could, within the space of five days and nights, reveal the 
equivalent of the &amp;Qur'an which was sent down in twenty-three 
years.  Ponder thou and reflect.  Hath anyone like unto 
Him ever appeared in former times, or is this characteristic 
strictly confined unto Him?  
 
 
     CONSIDER the manifold favours vouchsafed by the 
Promised One, and the effusions of His bounty which have 
pervaded the concourse of the followers of &amp;Islam to enable 
them to attain unto salvation.  Indeed observe how He Who 
representeth the origin of creation, He Who is the Exponent 
of the verse, `I, in very truth, am God', identified 
Himself as the Gate [&amp;Bab] for the advent of the promised 
&amp;Qa'im, a descendant of &amp;Muhammad, and in His first Book 
enjoined the observance of the laws of the &amp;Qur'an, so that 
the people might not be seized with perturbation by reason 
of a new Book and a new Revelation and might regard 
His Faith as similar to their own, perchance they would 
not turn away from the Truth and ignore the thing for 
which they had been called into being.  
 
 
     LET Me set forth some rational arguments for thee.  If 
someone desireth to embrace the Faith of &amp;Islam today, 
would the testimony of God prove conclusive for him?  If 
 
+P120 
thou dost contend that it would not, then how is it that 
God will chastise him after death, and that, while he lives, 
the verdict of `non-believer' is passed upon him?  If thou 
affirmest that the testimony is conclusive, how wouldst 
thou prove this?  If thy assertion is based on hearsay, then 
mere words are unacceptable as a binding testimony; but 
if thou deemest the &amp;Qur'an as the testimony, this would be a 
weighty and evident proof.  
     Now consider the Revelation of the &amp;Bayan.  If the 
followers of the &amp;Qur'an had applied to themselves proofs 
similar to those which they advance for the non-believers 
in &amp;Islam, not a single soul would have remained deprived of 
the Truth, and on the Day of Resurrection everyone would 
have attained salvation.  
     Should a Christian contend, `How can I deem the &amp;Qur'an 
a testimony while I am unable to understand it?' such a 
contention would not be acceptable.  Likewise the people 
of the &amp;Qur'an disdainfully observe, `We are unable to comprehend 
the eloquence of the verses in the &amp;Bayan, how can 
we regard it as a testimony?'  Whoever uttereth such words, 
say unto him, `O thou untutored one!  By what proof hast 
thou embraced the Religion of &amp;Islam?  Is it the Prophet on 
whom thou hast never set eyes?  Is it the miracles which 
thou hast never witnessed?  If thou hast accepted &amp;Islam unwittingly, 
wherefore hast thou done so?  But if thou hast 
embraced the Faith by recognizing the &amp;Qur'an as the testimony, 
because thou hast heard the learned and the faithful 
express their powerlessness before it, or if thou hast, upon 
hearing the divine verses and by virtue of thy spontaneous 
love for the True Word of God, responded in a spirit of 
utter humility and lowliness--a spirit which is one of the 
mightiest signs of true love and understanding--then such 
proofs have been and will ever be regarded as sound.'  
 
+P121 
     THE recognition of Him Who is the Bearer of divine 
Truth is none other than the recognition of God, and 
loving Him is none other than loving God.  However, I 
swear by the sublime Essence of God--exalted and glorified 
be He--that I did not wish my identity to be known by 
men, and gave instructions that My name should be concealed, 
because I was fully aware of the incapacity of this 
people, who are none other than those who have, in 
reference to no less a person than the Apostle of God-- 
incomparable as He hath ever been--remarked, `He is 
certainly a lunatic'.+F1  If they now claim to be other than 
those people, their deeds bear witness to the falsity of their 
assertions.  That which God testifieth is none other than 
what His supreme Testimony testifieth.  Were all the 
peoples of the world to testify unto a thing and were He to 
testify unto another, His testimony will be regarded as 
God's testimony, while aught else but Him hath been and 
will ever be as naught; for it is through His might that a 
thing assumeth existence.  
     Consider the extent of the adherence of these people to 
matters of faith.  When dealing with their own affairs 
they are well content with the testimony of two just 
witnesses, and yet despite the testimony of so many 
righteous men they hesitate to believe in Him Who is the 
Bearer of the divine Truth.  
 
 
     THE evidences which the people demanded from the 
Apostle of God through their idle fancy have mostly been 
rejected in the &amp;Qur'an, even as in the &amp;Surih of the Children 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 68:51  
 
+P122 
of Israel [&amp;Surih XVII] it hath been revealed:  `And they say, 
by no means will we believe on thee till thou cause a fountain 
to gush forth for us from the earth; or till thou have a 
garden of palm trees and vines, and thou cause rivers to 
spring forth from the midst thereof in abundance; or thou 
cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as thou hast given 
out, in pieces; or thou bring God and the angels to vouch 
for thee; or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend to 
heaven nor will we believe in thine ascension, till thou send 
down to us a book which we may read.  Say, Praise be to my 
Lord!  Am I more than a man, an apostle?'  
     Now be fair!  The Arabs uttered such words, and now, 
prompted by thy desire, thou dost demand yet other things?  
What is the difference between thee and them?  If thou dost 
ponder a while, it will be evident that it is incumbent upon 
a lowly servant to acquiesce to whatever proof God hath 
appointed, and not to follow his own idle fancy.  If the 
wishes of the people were to be gratified not a single disbeliever 
would remain on earth.  For once the Apostle of 
God had fulfilled the wishes of the people they would unhesitatingly 
have embraced His Faith.  May God save thee, 
shouldst thou seek any evidence according to thy selfish 
desire; rather it behooveth thee to uphold the unfailing 
proof which God hath appointed.  The object of thy belief 
in God is but to secure His good-pleasure.  How then dost 
thou seek as a proof of thy faith a thing which hath been 
and is contrary to His good-pleasure?  
 
 
+P123 
     RID thou thyself of all attachments to aught except God, 
enrich thyself in God by dispensing with all else besides 
Him, and recite this prayer:  
 
          Say:  God sufficeth all things above all things, and 
     nothing in the heavens or in the earth or in whatever 
     lieth between them but God, thy Lord, sufficeth.  
     Verily, He is in Himself the Knower, the Sustainer, 
     the Omnipotent.  
 
     Regard not the all-sufficing power of God as an idle 
fancy.  It is that genuine faith which thou cherishest for the 
Manifestation of God in every Dispensation.  It is such faith 
which sufficeth above all the things that exist on the 
earth, whereas no created thing on earth besides faith would 
suffice thee.  If thou art not a believer, the Tree of divine 
Truth would condemn thee to extinction.  If thou art a 
believer, thy faith shall be sufficient for thee above all 
things that exist on earth, even though thou possess 
nothing.  
 
 
     IT is recorded in a tradition that of the entire concourse of 
the Christians no more than seventy people embraced the 
Faith of the Apostle of God.  The blame falleth upon their 
doctors, for if these had believed, they would have been 
followed by the mass of their countrymen.  Behold, then, 
that which hath come to pass!  The learned men of Christendom 
are held to be learned by virtue of their safeguarding 
the teaching of Christ, and yet consider how 
they themselves have been the cause of men's failure to 
accept the Faith and attain unto salvation!  Is it still thy 
wish to follow in their footsteps?  The followers of Jesus 
 
+P124 
submitted to their clerics to be saved on the Day of Resurrection, 
and as a result of this obedience they eventually entered 
into the fire, and on the Day when the Apostle of God 
appeared they shut themselves out from the recognition 
of His exalted Person.  Dost thou desire to follow such 
divines?  
     Nay, by God, be thou neither a divine without discernment 
nor a follower without discernment, for both of 
these shall perish on the Day of Resurrection.  Rather it 
behooveth thee to be a discerning divine, or to walk with 
insight in the way of God by obeying a true leader of 
religion.  
     In every nation thou beholdest unnumbered spiritual 
leaders who are bereft of true discernment, and among 
every people thou dost encounter myriads of adherents 
who are devoid of the same characteristic.  Ponder for a 
while in thy heart, have pity on thyself and turn not aside 
thine attention from proofs and evidences.  However, seek 
not proofs and evidences after thine idle fancy; but rather 
base thy proofs upon what God hath appointed.  Moreover, 
know thou that neither being a man of learning nor 
being a follower is in itself a source of glory.  If thou art a 
man of learning, thy knowledge becometh an honour, and 
if thou art a follower, thine adherence unto leadership 
becometh an honour, only when these conform to the 
good-pleasure of God.  And beware lest thou regard as an 
idle fancy the good-pleasure of God; it is the same as the 
good-pleasure of His Messenger.  Consider the followers 
of Jesus.  They were eagerly seeking the good-pleasure of 
God, yet none of them attained the good-pleasure of His 
Apostle which is identical with God's good-pleasure, except 
such as embraced His Faith.  
 
+P125 
     THY letter hath been perused.  Were the truth of this 
Revelation to be fully demonstrated with elaborate proofs, 
all the scrolls that exist in the heaven and on the earth 
would be insufficient to contain them.  
     However, the substance and essence of the subject is this, 
that there can be no doubt that from everlasting God hath 
been invested with the independent sovereignty of His 
exalted Being, and unto everlasting He will remain inaccessible 
in the transcendent majesty of His holy Essence.  
No creature hath ever recognized Him as befitteth His 
recognition, nor hath any created being ever praised Him 
as is worthy of His praise.  He is exalted above every name, 
and is sanctified from every comparison.  Through Him all 
things are made known, while too lofty is His reality to be 
known through anyone but Him.  The process of His creation 
hath had no beginning and can have no end, otherwise it 
would necessitate the cessation of His celestial grace.  God 
hath raised up Prophets and revealed Books as numerous as 
the creatures of the world, and will continue to do so to 
everlasting.  
     If thou art sailing upon the sea of God's Names, which 
are reflected in all things, know thou that He is exalted and 
sanctified from being known through His creatures, or 
being described by His servants.  Everything thou beholdest 
hath been called into being through the operation of 
His Will.  How can such a created thing, therefore, be indicative 
of His essential oneness?  God's existence in itself 
testifieth to His Own oneness, while every created thing, 
by its very nature, beareth evidence that it hath been 
fashioned by God.  Such is the proof of consummate wisdom 
in the estimation of those who sail the ocean of divine 
Truth.  
     If, however, thou art sailing upon the sea of creation, 
 
+P126 
know thou that the First Remembrance, which is the Primal 
Will of God, may be likened unto the sun.  God hath created 
Him through the potency of His might, and He hath, 
from the beginning that hath no beginning, caused Him to 
be manifested in every Dispensation through the compelling 
power of His behest, and God will, to the end that 
knoweth no end, continue to manifest Him according to 
the good-pleasure of His invincible Purpose.  
     And know thou that He indeed resembleth the sun.  
Were the risings of the sun to continue till the end that 
hath no end, yet there hath not been nor ever will be more 
than one sun; and were its settings to endure for evermore, 
still there hath not been nor ever will be more than one 
sun.  It is this Primal Will which appeareth resplendent in 
every Prophet and speaketh forth in every revealed Book.  
It knoweth no beginning, inasmuch as the First deriveth its 
firstness from It; and knoweth no end, for the Last oweth its 
lastness unto It.  
     In the time of the First Manifestation the Primal Will 
appeared in Adam; in the day of Noah It became known 
in Noah; in the day of Abraham in Him; and so in the day 
of Moses; the day of Jesus; the day of &amp;Muhammad, the 
Apostle of God; the day of the `Point of the &amp;Bayan'; the 
day of Him Whom God shall make manifest; and the day 
of the One Who will appear after Him Whom God shall 
make manifest.  Hence the inner meaning of the words 
uttered by the Apostle of God, `I am all the Prophets', 
inasmuch as what shineth resplendent in each one of Them 
hath been and will ever remain the one and the same sun.

                     EXCERPTS FROM THE

+P128 
 
+P129 
     O ye that are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Denounce 
ye not one another, ere the Day-Star of ancient 
eternity shineth forth above the horizon of His 
sublimity.  We have created you from one tree 
and have caused you to be as the leaves and fruit of the same 
tree, that haply ye may become a source of comfort to one 
another.  Regard ye not others save as ye regard your own 
selves, that no feeling of aversion may prevail amongst you 
so as to shut you out from Him Whom God shall make 
manifest on the Day of Resurrection.  It behooveth you all 
to be one indivisible people; thus should ye return unto 
Him Whom God shall make manifest.  
     Those who have deprived themselves of this Resurrection 
by reason of their mutual hatreds or by regarding 
themselves to be in the right and others in the wrong, were 
chastised on the Day of Resurrection by reason of such 
hatreds evinced during their night.+F1  Thus they deprived 
themselves of beholding the countenance of God, and this 
for no other reason than mutual denunciations.  
     O ye that are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Ye should perform 
such deeds as would please God, your Lord, earning 
thereby the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make 
manifest.  Turn not your religion into a means of material 
 
+F1 By `night' is meant the period between two divine Revelations 
+F1 when the Sun of Truth is not manifest among men.  In the Persian 
+F1 &amp;Bayan, II, 7, the &amp;Bab says, `O people of the &amp;Bayan!  Act not as 
+F1 the people of the &amp;Qur'an have acted, for if you do so the fruits 
+F1 of your night will come to naught'.  
 
+P130 
gain, spending your life on vanities, and inheriting thereby 
on the Day of Resurrection that which would displease 
Him Whom God shall make manifest, while ye deem that 
what ye do is right.  If, however, ye observe piety in your 
Faith, God will surely nourish you from the treasuries of 
His heavenly grace.  
     Be ye sincere in your allegiance to Him Whom God 
shall make manifest, for the sake of God, your Lord, that 
perchance ye may, through devotion to His Faith, be 
redeemed on the Day of Resurrection.  Beware lest ye 
suffer one another to be wrapt in veils by reason of the 
disputes which may, during your night, arise among you 
as a result of the problems ye encounter or in consideration 
of such matters as your loftiness or lowliness, your nearness 
or remoteness.  
     Thus have We firmly exhorted you--a befitting exhortation 
indeed--that haply ye may cleave tenaciously unto it 
and attain thereby salvation on the Day of Resurrection.  
The time is approaching when ye will be at peace with 
yourselves in your homes, and lo, Him Whom God shall 
make manifest will have appeared, and God wisheth you 
to return unto Him, even as God called you into being 
through the Primal Point.  However, all of you will seek 
guidance while pursuing the promptings of your own 
desires.  Some of you are filled with pride by reason of your 
religion, others because of your learning.  Ye will, one and 
all, cling unto some part of the &amp;Bayan as a means of self-glorification.  
XVI, 19.+F1  
 
+F1 The &amp;Kitab-i-Asma' is divided into &amp;vahids and chapters, to which 
+F1 these numbers refer.  
 
+P131 
     GOD is sanctified from His servants and no direct relationship 
ever existeth between Him and any created thing, 
while ye have all arisen at His bidding.  Verily He is your 
Lord and your God, your Master and your King.  He 
ordaineth your movements at His behest throughout the 
day-time and in the night season.  
     Say, He Whom God shall make manifest is indeed the 
Primal Veil of God.  Above this Veil ye can find nothing 
other than God, while beneath it ye can discern all things 
emanating from God.  He is the Unseen, the Inaccessible, 
the Most Exalted, the Best Beloved.  
     If ye seek God, it behooveth you to seek Him Whom 
God shall make manifest, and if ye cherish the desire to 
dwell in the Ark of Names, ye will be distinguished as the 
guides to Him Whom God shall make manifest, did ye but 
believe in Him.  Verily then make your hearts the daysprings 
of His exalted Names as recorded in the Book, and 
ye shall, even as mirrors placed before the sun, be able to 
receive enlightenment.  XVI, 17.  
 
 
     SHOULD a person lay claim to a cause and produce his 
proofs, then those who seek to repudiate him are required 
to produce proofs like unto his.  If they succeed in doing so, 
his words will prove vain and they will prevail; otherwise 
neither his words will cease nor the proofs he hath set forth 
will become void.  I admonish you, O ye who are invested 
with the &amp;Bayan, if ye would fain assert your ascendancy, 
confront not any soul unless ye give proofs similar to that 
which he hath adduced; for Truth shall be firmly established, 
while aught else besides it is sure to perish.  
 
+P132 
     How numerous the people who engaged in contests 
with &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and were eventually 
reduced to naught, inasmuch as they were powerless to 
bring forth proofs similar to that which God had sent 
down unto Him.  Had they been abashed and modest, and 
had they realized the nature of the proofs wherewith He 
was invested, they would never have challenged Him.  But 
they regarded themselves as champions of their own 
religion.  Therefore God laid hold on them according to 
their deserts and vindicated the Truth through the power 
of Truth.  This is what ye clearly perceive today in the 
&amp;Muhammadan Revelation.  
     Who is the man amongst you who can challenge the 
exalted Thrones of Reality in every Dispensation, while all 
existence is wholly dependent upon Them?  Indeed, God 
hath wiped out all those who have opposed Them from the 
beginning that hath no beginning until the present day and 
hath conclusively demonstrated the Truth through the 
power of Truth.  Verily, He is the Almighty, the Omnipotent, 
the All-Powerful.  XVII, 11.  
 
 
     O YE who are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Be ye watchful 
on the Day of Resurrection, for on that Day ye will 
firmly believe in the &amp;Vahid of the &amp;Bayan, though this, 
even as your past religion which proved of no avail, can 
in no wise benefit you, unless ye embrace the Cause of 
Him Whom God shall make manifest and believe in that 
which He ordaineth.  Therefore take ye good heed lest ye 
shut yourselves out from Him Who is the Fountain-head 
of all Messengers and Scriptures, while ye hold fast to parts 
 
+P133 
of the teachings which have emanated from these sources.  
XVII, 15.  
 
 
     CONSIDER how at the time of the appearance of every 
Revelation, those who open their hearts to the Author of 
that Revelation recognize the Truth, while the hearts of 
those who fail to apprehend the Truth are straitened by 
reason of their shutting themselves out from Him.  However, 
openness of heart is bestowed by God upon both 
parties alike.  God desireth not to straiten the heart of 
anyone, be it even an ant, how much less the heart of a 
superior creature, except when he suffereth himself to be 
wrapt in veils, for God is the Creator of all things.  
     Wert thou to open the heart of a single soul by helping 
him to embrace the Cause of Him Whom God shall make 
manifest, thine inmost being would be filled with the inspirations 
of that august Name.  It devolveth upon you, 
therefore, to perform this task in the Days of Resurrection, 
inasmuch as most people are helpless, and wert thou to 
open their hearts and dispel their doubts, they would gain 
admittance into the Faith of God.  Therefore, manifest thou 
this attribute to the utmost of thine ability in the days of 
Him Whom God shall make manifest.  For indeed if thou 
dost open the heart of a person for His sake, better will it 
be for thee than every virtuous deed; since deeds are 
secondary to faith in Him and certitude in His Reality.  
XVII, 15.  
 
+P134 
     TAKE heed to carefully consider the words of every soul, 
then hold fast to the proofs which attest the truth.  If ye fail 
to discover truth in a person's words, make them not the 
object of contention, inasmuch as ye have been forbidden in 
the &amp;Bayan to enter into idle disputation and controversy, 
that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may not 
engage in argumentation, and dispute with Him Whom 
God shall make manifest.  XVII, 16.  
 
 
     ON the Day of Resurrection when He Whom God will 
make manifest cometh unto you, invested with conclusive 
proofs, ye shall hold His Cause as being devoid of truth, 
whereas God hath apprised you in the &amp;Bayan that no 
similarity existeth between the Cause of Him Whom God 
will make manifest and the cause of others.  How can anyone 
besides God reveal a verse such as to overwhelm all 
mankind?  Say, great is God!  Who else but Him Whom 
God will make manifest can spontaneously recite verses 
which proceed from His Lord--a feat that no mortal man 
can ever hope to accomplish?  
     Truth can in no wise be confounded with aught else 
except itself; would that ye might ponder His proof.  Nor 
can error be confused with Truth, if ye do but reflect upon 
the testimony of God, the True One.  
     How great hath been the number of those who have 
falsely laid claim to a cause within &amp;Islam, and ye followed 
in their footsteps without having witnessed a single proof.  
What evidence can ye then produce in the presence of 
your Lord, if ye do but meditate a while?  
     Take ye good heed in your night+F1 lest ye be a cause of 
 
+F1 See footnote on page 129  
 
+P135 
sadness to any soul, whether ye be able to discover proofs 
in him or not, that haply on the Day of Resurrection ye 
may not grieve Him within Whose grasp lieth every proof.  
And when ye do not discern God's testimony in a person, 
he will verily fail in manifesting the power of Truth; and 
God is sufficient to deal with him.  Indeed on no account 
should ye sadden any person; surely God will put him to 
the proof and bring him to account.  It behooveth you to 
cling to the testimony of your own Faith and to observe 
the ordinances laid down in the &amp;Bayan.  
     You are like unto the man who layeth out an orchard 
and planteth all kinds of fruit trees therein.  When the time 
is at hand for him, the lord, to come, ye will have taken 
possession of the orchard in his name, and when he doth 
come in person, ye will shut him out from it.  
     Verily We planted the Tree of the &amp;Qur'an and provided 
its Orchard with all kinds of fruit, whereof ye all have been 
partaking.  Then when We came to take over that which 
We had planted, ye pretended not to know Him Who is 
the Lord thereof.  
     Be ye not a cause of grief unto Us, nor withhold Us 
from this Orchard which belongeth unto Us, though independent 
are We of all that ye possess.  Moreover, unto 
none of you shall We make this property lawful, were it 
even to the extent of a mustard seed.  Verily, the Reckoner 
are We.  
     We have planted the Garden of the &amp;Bayan in the name 
of Him Whom God will make manifest, and have granted 
you permission to live therein until the time of His 
manifestation; then from the moment the Cause of Him 
Whom God will make manifest is inaugurated, We forbid 
you all the things ye hold as your own, unless ye may, by 
the leave of your Lord, be able to regain possession thereof.  
XVIII, 3.  
 
+P136 
     O YE unto whom the &amp;Bayan is given!  Be ye vigilant lest 
in the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest, while 
ye consider yourselves as seeking God's pleasure, in reality 
ye persist in that which would only displease Him, even as 
did those who lived in the days of the Primal Point, to 
whom it never occurred that they were seeking things 
which ran counter to that which God had purposed.  They 
shut themselves out as by a veil from God and failed to 
observe that which He had desired for them to perform as 
true believers.  They pondered not upon such people as 
lived in the days of &amp;Muhammad, who believed likewise 
that they were seeking the good-pleasure of God, while 
they had actually cut themselves off therefrom, once they 
had failed to secure the good-pleasure of &amp;Muhammad.  
Nevertheless they comprehended not.  
     O ye who are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Regard not 
yourselves as being like unto the people to whom the 
&amp;Qur'an or the Gospel or other Scriptures of old were given, 
since at the time of His manifestation ye shall stray farther 
from God than did they.  If ye happen to shut yourselves 
out it would never cross your minds that ye were shut out 
from Him.  It behooveth you to consider how the people 
unto whom the &amp;Qur'an was given were debarred from the 
Truth, for indeed ye will act in a like manner, thinking 
that ye are doers of good.  If ye perceive the degree of your 
deprivation of God, ye will wish to have perished from the 
face of the earth and to have sunk into oblivion.  The day 
will come when ye will earnestly desire to know that which 
would meet with the good-pleasure of God but, alas, ye 
shall find no path unto Him.  Ye, even as camels that wander 
aimlessly, will not find a pasture wherein ye may gather 
and unite upon a Cause in which ye can assuredly believe.  
At that time God shall cause the Sun of Truth to shine 
 
+P137 
forth and the oceans of His bounty and grace to surge, 
while ye will have chosen droplets of water as the object of 
your desire, and will have deprived yourselves of the 
plenteous waters in His oceans.  
     If ye entertain any doubts in this matter consider the 
people unto whom the Gospel was given.  Having no access 
to the apostles of Jesus, they sought the pleasure of the Lord 
in their churches, hoping to learn that which would be 
acceptable unto God, but they found therein no path unto 
Him.  Then when God manifested &amp;Muhammad as His Messenger 
and as the Repository of His good-pleasure, they 
neglected to quicken their souls from the Fountain of living 
waters which streamed forth from the presence of their 
Lord and continued to rove distraught upon the earth seeking 
a mere droplet of water and believing that they were 
doing righteous deeds.  They behaved as the people unto 
whom the &amp;Qur'an was given are now behaving.  
     O ye who are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Ye can act 
similarly.  Take ye heed, therefore, lest ye deprive yourselves 
of attaining the presence of Him Who is the Manifestation 
of God, notwithstanding that ye have been day 
and night praying to behold His countenance; and be ye 
careful lest ye be deterred from attaining unto the ocean 
of His good-pleasure, when perplexed and to no avail ye 
roam the earth in search of a drop of water.  
     Say, the testimony of God hath been fulfilled in the 
&amp;Bayan, and through its revelation the grace of God hath 
attained its highest consummation for all mankind.  Let no 
one among you say that God hath withheld the outpouring 
of His bounty unto you, for assuredly God's mercy unto 
those to whom the &amp;Bayan is given hath been fulfilled and 
completed until the Day of Resurrection.  Would that ye 
might believe in the signs of God.  XVI, 13.  
 
+P138 
     VERILY God hath caused the people of the &amp;Bayan to be 
called into being through the power of Him unto Whom 
the &amp;Bayan was revealed, in preparation for the Day when 
they will return to their Lord.  
     Indeed those who will bear allegiance unto Him Whom 
God shall make manifest are the ones who have grasped the 
meaning of that which hath been revealed in the &amp;Bayan; 
they are indeed the sincere ones, while those who turn away 
from Him at the time of His appearance will have utterly 
failed to comprehend a single letter of the &amp;Bayan, even 
though they profess belief and assurance in whatever is 
revealed in it or observe its precepts.  
     Say, every favourable and praiseworthy designation in 
the &amp;Bayan is but an allusion to those who recognize Him 
Whom God shall make manifest, and who believe with 
certainty in God and in His holy Writings, while every 
unfavourable designation therein is meant to refer to such 
as repudiate Him Whom God shall make manifest, though 
they may act uprightly within the bounds laid down in the 
&amp;Bayan.  Say, if ye embrace the truth on the Day of 
Resurrection, God will assuredly pardon you for your 
night+F1 and will grant you forgiveness.  
     As to those who have faithfully observed the ordinances 
in the &amp;Bayan from the inception of its revelation until the 
Day when Him Whom God shall make manifest will 
appear, these are indeed the companions of the paradise of 
His good-pleasure who will be glorified in the presence of 
God and will dwell in the pavilions of His celestial Garden.  
Yet, within less than a tiny fraction of an instant from the 
moment God will have revealed Him Who is the Manifestation 
of His Own Self, the entire company of the 
followers of the &amp;Bayan shall be put to proof.  XVII, 1.  
 
+F1 See footnote on page 129  
 
+P139 
     SINCE thou hast faithfully obeyed the true religion of God 
in the past, it behooveth thee to follow His true religion 
hereafter, inasmuch as every religion proceedeth from God, 
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  
     He Who hath revealed the &amp;Qur'an unto &amp;Muhammad, 
the Apostle of God, ordaining in the Faith of &amp;Islam that 
which was pleasing unto Him, hath likewise revealed the 
&amp;Bayan, in the manner ye have been promised, unto Him 
Who is your &amp;Qa'im,+F1 your Guide, your &amp;Mihdi,+F2 your 
Lord, Him Whom ye acclaim as the manifestation of God's 
most excellent titles.  Verily the equivalent of that which 
God revealed unto &amp;Muhammad during twenty-three years, 
hath been revealed unto Me within the space of two days 
and two nights.  However, as ordained by God, no distinction 
is to be drawn between the two.  He, in truth, hath 
power over all things.  
     I swear by the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest!  
My Revelation is indeed far more bewildering than 
that of &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, if thou dost but 
pause to reflect upon the days of God.  Behold, how strange 
that a person brought up amongst the people of Persia 
should be empowered by God to proclaim such irrefutable 
utterances as to silence every man of learning, and be enabled 
to spontaneously reveal verses far more rapidly than 
anyone could possibly set down in writing.  Verily, no God 
is there but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  
XVI, 18.  
 
+F1 He Who ariseth (God Passes By, p. 57)  
+F2 One Who is guided (God Passes By, p. 58)  
 
+P140 
     AS to those who have debarred themselves from the 
Revelation of God, they have indeed failed to understand 
the significance of a single letter of the &amp;Qur'an, nor have 
they obtained the slightest notion of the Faith of &amp;Islam, 
otherwise they would not have turned away from God, 
Who hath brought them into being, Who hath nurtured 
them, hath caused them to die and hath proffered life unto 
them, by clinging to parts of their religion, thinking that 
they are doing righteous work for the sake of God.  
     How numerous the verses which have been revealed 
concerning the grievous tests ye shall experience on the Day 
of Judgement, yet it appeareth that ye have never perused 
them; and how vast the number of revealed traditions 
regarding the trials which will overtake you on the Day of 
Our Return, and yet ye seem never to have set your eyes 
upon them.  
     Ye spend all your days contriving forms and rules for 
the principles of your Faith, while that which profiteth 
you in all this is to comprehend the good-pleasure of your 
Lord and unitedly to become well-acquainted with His 
supreme Purpose.  
     God hath made His Own Self known unto you, but ye 
have failed to recognize Him; and the thing which will, on 
the Day of Judgement, turn you aside from God is the 
specious character of your deeds.  Throughout your lives 
ye follow your religion in order to attract the good-pleasure 
of God, yet on the Last Day ye shut yourselves out 
from God and turn away from Him Who is your Promised 
One.  XVII, 2.  
 
+P141 
     O YE who are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Ye shall be put 
to proof, even as those unto whom the &amp;Qur'an was given.  
Have pity on yourselves, for ye shall witness the Day when 
God will have revealed Him Who is the Manifestation of 
His Own Self, invested with clear and irrefutable proofs, 
while ye will cling tenaciously to the words the Witnesses 
of the &amp;Bayan have uttered.  On that Day ye will continue 
to rove distraught, even as camels, seeking a drop of the 
water of life.  God will cause oceans of living water to 
stream forth from the presence of Him Whom God shall 
make manifest, while ye will refuse to quench your thirst 
therefrom, notwithstanding that ye regard yourselves as 
the God-fearing witnesses of your Faith.  Nay, and yet 
again, nay!  Ye will go astray far beyond the peoples unto 
whom the Gospel, or the &amp;Qur'an or any other Scripture 
was given.  Take good heed to yourselves, inasmuch as the 
Cause of God will come upon you at a time when you 
will all be entreating and tearfully imploring God for the 
advent of the Day of His Manifestation; yet when He 
cometh ye will tarry and will fail to be of those who are 
well-assured in His Faith.  
     Beware lest ye grieve Him Who is the Supreme 
Manifestation of your Lord; verily, He can well afford to 
dispense with your allegiance unto Him.  Be ye careful and 
bring not despondency upon any soul, for surely ye shall be 
put to proof.  XVII, 2.  
 
 
     SAY, He Whom God shall make manifest will surely 
redeem the rights of those who truly believe in God and in 
His signs, for they are the ones who merit reward from His 
 
+P142 
presence.  Say, it is far from the glory of Him Whom God 
shall make manifest that anyone should in this wise make 
mention of His name, if ye ponder the Cause of God in 
your hearts.  Say, He shall vindicate the Cause through the 
potency of His command and shall bring to naught all 
perversion of truth by virtue of His behest.  Verily God is 
potent over all things.  
     If ye wish to distinguish truth from error, consider those 
who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and 
those who disbelieve Him at the time of His appearance.  
The former represent the essence of truth, as attested in the 
Book of God, while the latter the essence of error, as 
attested in that same Book.  Fear ye God that ye may not 
identify yourselves with aught but the truth, inasmuch as 
ye have been exalted in the &amp;Bayan for being recognized as 
the bearers of the name of Him Who is the eternal Truth.  
     Say, were He Whom God shall make manifest to pronounce 
a pious and truthful follower of the &amp;Bayan as false, 
it is incumbent upon you to submit to His decree, as this 
hath been affirmed by God in the &amp;Bayan; verily God is able 
to convert light into fire whenever He pleaseth; surely He 
is potent over all things.  And were He to declare a person 
whom ye regard alien to the truth as being akin thereto, 
err not by questioning His decision in your fancies, for He 
Who is the Sovereign Truth createth things through the 
power of His behest.  Verily God transmuteth fire into 
light as He willeth, and indeed potent is He over all things.  
Consider ye how the truth shone forth as truth in the First 
Day and how error became manifest as error; so likewise 
shall ye distinguish them from each other on the Day of 
Resurrection.  XVII, 4.  
 
+P143 
     PONDER upon the people unto whom the Gospel was 
given.  Their religious leaders were considered as the true 
Guides of the Gospel, yet when they shut themselves out 
from &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, they turned into 
guides of error, notwithstanding that all their lives they 
had faithfully observed the precepts of their religion in 
order to attain unto Paradise; then when God made 
Paradise known unto them, they would not enter therein.  
Those unto whom the &amp;Qur'an is given have wrought likewise.  
They performed their acts of devotion for the sake of 
God, hoping that He might enable them to join the 
righteous in Paradise.  However, when the gates of Paradise 
were flung open to their faces, they declined to enter.  They 
suffered themselves to enter into the fire, though they had 
been seeking refuge therefrom in God.  
     Say, verily, the criterion by which truth is distinguished 
from error shall not appear until the Day of Resurrection.  
This ye will know, if ye be of them that love the Truth.  
And ere the advent of the Day of Resurrection ye shall 
distinguish truth from aught else besides it according to that 
which hath been revealed in the &amp;Bayan.  
     How vast the number of people who will, on the Day of 
Resurrection, regard themselves to be in the right, while 
they shall be accounted as false through the dispensation of 
Providence, inasmuch as they will shut themselves out as 
by a veil from Him Whom God shall make manifest and 
refuse to bow down in adoration before Him Who, as 
divinely ordained in the Book, is the Object of their 
creation.  XVII, 4.  
 
+P144 
     SAY, ye will be unable to recognize the One True God or 
to discern clearly the words of divine guidance, inasmuch 
as ye seek and tread a path other than His.  Whenever ye 
learn that a new Cause hath appeared, ye must seek the 
presence of its author and must delve into his writings that 
haply ye may not be debarred from attaining unto Him 
Whom God shall make manifest at the hour of His 
manifestation.  Wert thou to walk in the way of truth as 
handed down by them that are endowed with the knowledge 
of the inmost reality, God, thy Lord, will surely 
redeem thee on the Day of Resurrection.  Verily He is 
potent over all things.  
     In the &amp;Bayan God hath forbidden everyone to pronounce 
judgement against any soul, lest he may pass sentence upon 
God, his Lord, while regarding himself to be of the 
righteous, inasmuch as no one knoweth how the Cause of 
God will begin or end.  
     O ye who are invested with the &amp;Bayan!  Should ye be 
apprised of a person laying claim to a Cause and revealing 
verses which to outward seeming are unlikely to have been 
revealed by anyone else save God, the Help in Peril, the 
Self-Subsisting, do not pass sentence against him, lest ye 
may inadvertently pass sentence against Him Whom God 
shall make manifest.  Say, He Whom God shall make manifest 
is but one of you; He will make Himself known unto 
you on the Day of Resurrection.  Ye shall know God when 
the Manifestation of His Own Self is made known unto 
you, that perchance ye may not stray far from His Path.  
     Verily God will raise up Him Whom God shall make 
manifest, and after Him Whomsoever He willeth, even as 
He hath raised up prophets before the Point of the &amp;Bayan.  
He in truth hath power over all things.  XVII, 4.  
 
+P145 
     VERILY, on the First Day We flung open the gates of 
Paradise unto all the peoples of the world, and exclaimed:  
`O all ye created things!  Strive to gain admittance into 
Paradise, since ye have, during all your lives, held fast unto 
virtuous deeds in order to attain unto it.'  Surely all men 
yearn to enter therein, but alas, they are unable to do so by 
reason of that which their hands have wrought.  Shouldst 
thou, however, gain a true understanding of God in thine 
heart of hearts, ere He hath manifested Himself, thou 
wouldst be able to recognize Him, visible and resplendent, 
when He unveileth Himself before the eyes of all men.  
XVII, 11.  
 
 
     SAY, by reason of your remembering Him Whom God 
shall make manifest and by extolling His name, God will 
cause your hearts to be dilated with joy, and do ye not wish 
your hearts to be in such a blissful state?  Indeed the hearts 
of them that truly believe in Him Whom God shall make 
manifest are vaster than the expanse of heaven and earth 
and whatever is between them.  God hath left no hindrance 
in their hearts, were it but the size of a mustard seed.  He 
will cheer their hearts, their spirits, their souls and their 
bodies and their days of prosperity or adversity, through 
the exaltation of the name of Him Who is the supreme 
Testimony of God and the promotion of the Word of Him 
Who is the Dayspring of the glory of their Creator.  
     Verily, these are souls who take delight in the remembrance 
of God, Who dilates their hearts through the 
effulgence of the light of knowledge and wisdom.  They 
seek naught but God and are oft engaged in giving praise 
 
+P146 
unto Him.  They desire naught except whatever He desireth 
and stand ready to do His bidding.  Their hearts are mirrors 
reflecting whatsoever He Whom God shall make manifest 
willeth.  Thus God will cheer the hearts of those who truly 
believe in Him and in His signs and who are well assured 
of the life to come.  Say, the life to come is none other than 
the days associated with the coming of Him Whom God 
will make manifest.  
     Reduce not the ordinances of God to fanciful imaginations 
of your own; rather observe all the things which God 
hath created at His behest with the eye of the spirit, even as 
ye see things with the eyes of your bodies.  XVII, 15.  
 
 
     THE divine Revelation associated with the advent of Him 
Who is your promised &amp;Mihdi hath proved far more 
wondrous than the Revelation wherewith &amp;Muhammad, the 
Apostle of God, was invested.  Would that ye might ponder.  
Verily, God raised up &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, 
from among the people of Arabia after he had reached 
forty years of age--a fact which every one of you affirmeth 
and upholdeth--while your Redeemer was raised up by 
God at the age of twenty-four amidst people none of 
whom can speak or understand a single word of Arabic.  
Thus God layeth bare the glory of His Cause and demonstrateth 
the Truth through the potency of His revealed 
Word.  He is indeed the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the 
Help in Peril, the Best Beloved.  XVII, 4.  
 
+P147 
     SAY, verily God hath caused all created things to enter 
beneath the shade of the tree of affirmation, except those 
who are endowed with the faculty of understanding.  Theirs 
is the choice either to believe in God their Lord, and put 
their whole trust in Him, or to shut themselves out from 
Him and refuse to believe with certitude in His signs.  
These two groups sail upon two seas:  the sea of affirmation 
and the sea of negation.  
     They that truly believe in God and in His signs, and 
who in every Dispensation faithfully obey that which hath 
been revealed in the Book--such are indeed the ones whom 
God hath created from the fruits of the Paradise of His 
good-pleasure, and who are of the blissful.  But they who 
turn away from God and His signs in each Dispensation, 
those are the ones who sail upon the sea of negation.  
     God hath, through the potency of His behest, ordained 
for Himself the task of ensuring the ascendancy of the sea 
of affirmation and of bringing to naught the sea of negation 
through the power of His might.  He is in truth potent over 
all things.  
     Verily it is incumbent upon you to recognize your Lord 
at the time of His manifestation, that haply ye may not 
enter into negation, and that, ere a prophet is raised by 
God, ye may find yourselves securely established upon the 
sea of affirmation.  For if a prophet cometh to you from 
God and ye fail to walk in His Way, God will, thereupon, 
transform your light into fire.  Take heed then that perchance 
ye may, through the grace of God and His signs, be 
enabled to redeem your souls.  XVIII, 13.  
 
+P148 
     SAY, God shall of a truth cause your hearts to be given to 
perversity if ye fail to recognize Him Whom God shall 
make manifest; but if ye do recognize Him God shall 
banish perversity from your hearts...  
     That day whereon ye were, by God's Will, initiated into 
the &amp;Bayan, did any of you know who were the Letters of 
the Living or the Witnesses or the Testimonies or what the 
names of the believers?  Likewise doth God wish you to 
recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest on the 
Day of Resurrection.  Beware lest ye shut yourselves out as 
by a veil from Him Who hath created you, by reason of 
your regard for those who were called into being at the 
bidding of the Point of the &amp;Bayan for the exaltation of His 
Word.  Did ye possess, ere the Point of the &amp;Bayan had called 
you into existence, any trace of identity, how much less a 
writ or authority?  Disregard then your beginnings, perchance 
ye may be saved on the day of your return.  Indeed 
had it not been for the exaltation of the name of the Primal 
Point, God would not have ordained for you the Letters of 
the Living, nor those who are the Testimonies of His 
Truth, nor the Witnesses of His Justice; could ye but heed 
a little.  All this is to glorify the Cause of Him Whom God 
shall make manifest at the time of His manifestation; 
would that ye might ponder a while.  
     Therefore it behooveth you to return unto God even as 
ye were brought forth into existence, and to utter not such 
words as why or nay, if ye wish your creation to yield 
fruit at the time of your return.  For none of you who have 
been born in the &amp;Bayan shall gain the fruit of your beginning 
unless ye return unto Him Whom God shall make 
manifest.  He it is Who caused your beginning to proceed 
from God, and your return to be unto Him, did ye but 
know.  XVI, 15.  
 
+P149 
     HOW great the number of people who deck themselves 
with robes of silk all their lives, while clad in the garb of 
fire, inasmuch as they have divested themselves of the 
raiment of divine guidance and righteousness; and how 
numerous are those who wear clothes made of cotton or 
coarse wool throughout their lives, and yet by reason of 
their being endowed with the vesture of divine guidance 
and righteousness, are truly attired with the raiment of 
Paradise and take delight in the good-pleasure of God.  
Indeed it would be better in the sight of God were ye to 
combine the two, adorning yourselves with the raiment of 
divine guidance and righteousness and wearing exquisite 
silk, if ye can afford to do so.  If not, at least act ye not unrighteously, 
but rather observe piety and virtue...  
     But for the sole reason of His being present amongst this 
people, We would have neither prescribed any law nor laid 
down any prohibition.  It is only for the glorification of His 
Name and the exaltation of His Cause that We have enunciated 
certain laws at Our behest, or forbidden the acts to 
which We are averse, so that at the hour of His manifestation 
ye may attain through Him the good-pleasure of God and 
abstain from the things that are abhorrent unto Him.  
     Say, verily, the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall 
make manifest is the good-pleasure of God, while the displeasure 
of Him Whom God shall make manifest is none 
other than the displeasure of God.  Avoid ye His displeasure, 
and flee for refuge unto His good-pleasure.  Say, the living 
guides to His good-pleasure are such as truly believe in 
Him and are well-assured in their faith, while the living 
testimonies of His displeasure are those who, when they 
hear the verses of God sent forth from His presence, or 
read the divine words revealed by Him, do not instantly 
embrace the Faith and attain unto certitude.  XVI, 14.

                      EXCERPTS FROM 
                     VARIOUS WRITINGS 
 
+P152 
 
+P153 
     SAY, God is the Lord and all are worshippers unto 
Him.  
     Say, God is the True One and all pay homage 
unto Him.  
     This is God, your Lord, and unto Him shall ye return.  
     Is there any doubt concerning God?  He hath created you 
and all things.  The Lord of all worlds is He.  
 
 
     SAY, verily any one follower of this Faith can, by the leave 
of God, prevail over all who dwell in heaven and earth 
and in whatever lieth between them; for indeed this is, 
beyond the shadow of a doubt, the one true Faith.  Therefore 
fear ye not, neither be ye grieved.  
     Say, God hath, according to that which is revealed in the 
Book, taken upon Himself the task of ensuring the ascendancy 
of any one of the followers of the Truth, over and 
above one hundred other souls, and the supremacy of one 
hundred believers over one thousand non-believers and the 
domination of one thousand of the faithful over all the 
peoples and kindreds of the earth; inasmuch as God calleth 
into being whatsoever He willeth by virtue of His behest.  
Verily He is potent over all things.  
     Say, the power of God is in the hearts of those who 
believe in the unity of God and bear witness that no God 
is there but Him, while the hearts of them that associate 
partners with God are impotent, devoid of life on this 
earth, for assuredly they are dead.  
     The Day is approaching when God will render the hosts 
 
+P154 
of Truth victorious, and He will purge the whole earth in 
such wise that within the compass of His knowledge not a 
single soul shall remain unless he truly believeth in God, 
worshippeth none other God but Him, boweth down by 
day and by night in His adoration, and is reckoned among 
such as are well assured.  
     Say, God indeed is the Sovereign Truth, Who is manifestly 
Supreme over His servants; He is the Help in Peril, 
the Self-Subsisting.  
 
 
     GOD testifieth that there is none other God but Him.  His 
are the kingdoms in the heavens and on the earth and all 
that is between them.  He is exalted above the comprehension 
of all things, and is inscrutable to the mind of every 
created being; none shall be able to fathom the oneness of 
His Being or to unravel the nature of His Existence.  No 
peer or likeness, no similitude or equal can ever be joined 
with Him.  Yield ye praise then unto Him and glorify Him 
and bear ye witness to the sanctity and oneness of His Being 
and magnify His might and majesty with wondrous 
glorification.  This will enable you to gain admittance into 
the all-highest Paradise.  Would that ye had firm faith in 
the revelation of the signs of God.  
     This is the divinely-inscribed Book.  This is the outspread 
Tablet.  Say, this indeed is the Frequented Fane, the sweet-scented 
Leaf, the Tree of divine Revelation, the surging 
Ocean, the Utterance which lay concealed, the Light above 
every light...  Indeed every light is generated by God 
through the power of His behest.  He of a truth is the Light 
in the kingdom of heaven and earth and whatever is between 
 
+P155 
them.  Through the radiance of His light God imparteth 
illumination to your hearts and maketh firm your 
steps, that perchance ye may yield praise unto Him.  
     Say, this of a certainty is the Garden of Repose, the 
loftiest Point of adoration, the Tree beyond which there is 
no passing, the blessed Lote-Tree, the Most Mighty Sign, 
the most beauteous Countenance and the most comely Face.  
 
 
     FROM the beginning that hath no beginning all men have 
bowed in adoration before Him Whom God shall make 
manifest and will continue to do so until the end that hath 
no end.  How strange then that at the time of His appearance 
ye should pay homage by day and night unto that 
which the Point of the &amp;Bayan hath enjoined upon you and 
yet fail to worship Him Whom God shall make manifest.  
 
 
     CONSECRATE Thou, O my God, the whole of this Tree 
unto Him, that from it may be revealed all the fruits 
created by God within it for Him through Whom God 
hath willed to reveal all that He pleaseth.  By Thy glory!  
I have not wished that this Tree should ever bear any 
branch, leaf, or fruit that would fail to bow down before 
Him, on the day of His Revelation, or refuse to laud Thee 
through Him, as beseemeth the glory of His all-glorious 
Revelation, and the sublimity of His most sublime Concealment.  
And shouldst Thou behold, O my God, any branch, 
leaf, or fruit upon Me that hath failed to bow down before 
 
+P156 
Him, on the day of His Revelation, cut it off, O My God, 
from that Tree, for it is not of Me, nor shall it return unto 
Me.  
 
 
     HE--glorified be His mention--resembleth the sun.  
Were unnumbered mirrors to be placed before it, each 
would, according to its capacity, reflect the splendour of 
that sun, and were none to be placed before it, it would still 
continue to rise and set, and the mirrors alone would be 
veiled from its light.  I, verily, have not fallen short of My 
duty to admonish that people, and to devise means 
whereby they may turn towards God, their Lord, and 
believe in God, their Creator.  If, on the day of His Revelation, 
all that are on earth bear Him allegiance, Mine inmost 
being will rejoice, inasmuch as all will have attained 
the summit of their existence, and will have been brought 
face to face with their Beloved, and will have recognized, 
to the fullest extent attainable in the world of being, the 
splendour of Him Who is the Desire of their hearts.  If not, 
My soul will indeed be saddened.  I truly have nurtured all 
things for this purpose.  How, then, can anyone be veiled 
from Him?  For this have I called upon God, and will continue 
to call upon Him.  He, verily, is nigh, ready to answer.  
 
 
     THE glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest is 
immeasurably above every other glory, and His majesty is 
far above every other majesty.  His beauty excelleth every 
 
+P157 
other embodiment of beauty, and His grandeur immensely 
exceedeth every other manifestation of grandeur.  Every 
light paleth before the radiance of His light, and every other 
exponent of mercy falleth short before the tokens of His 
mercy.  Every other perfection is as naught in face of His 
consummate perfection, and every other display of might is 
as nothing before His absolute might.  His names are 
superior to all other names.  His good-pleasure taketh 
precedence over any other expression of good-pleasure.  
His pre-eminent exaltation is far above the reach of every 
other symbol of exaltation.  The splendour of His appearance 
far surpasseth that of any other appearance.  His divine 
concealment is far more profound than any other concealment.  
His loftiness is immeasurably above every other 
loftiness.  His gracious favour is unequalled by any other 
evidence of favour.  His power transcendeth every power.  
His sovereignty is invincible in the face of every other 
sovereignty.  His celestial dominion is exalted far above 
every other dominion.  His knowledge pervadeth all created 
things, and His consummate power extendeth over all 
beings.  
 
 
     ALL men have proceeded from God and unto Him shall 
all return.  All shall appear before Him for judgement.  He 
is the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, of Regeneration and 
of Reckoning, and His revealed Word is the Balance.  
 
     True death is realized when a person dieth to himself at 
the time of His Revelation in such wise that he seeketh 
naught except Him.  
 
+P158 
     True resurrection from the sepulchres means to be 
quickened in conformity with His Will, through the power 
of His utterance.  
 
     Paradise is attainment of His good-pleasure and everlasting 
hell-fire His judgement through justice.  
 
     The Day He revealeth Himself is Resurrection Day 
which shall last as long as He ordaineth.  
 
     Everything belongeth unto Him and is fashioned by 
Him.  All besides Him are His creatures.  
 
 
 
          In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High.  
 
     VERILY I am God, no God is there but Me, and aught 
except Me is but My creation.  Say, worship Me then, O ye, 
My creatures.  
     I have called Thee into being, have nurtured Thee, protected 
Thee, loved Thee, raised Thee up and have graciously 
chosen Thee to be the manifestation of Mine Own Self, 
that Thou mayest recite My verses as ordained by Me, and 
may summon whomsoever I have created unto My 
Religion which is none other than this glorious and exalted 
Path.  
     I have fashioned all created things for Thy sake, and I 
have, by virtue of My Will, set Thee sovereign Ruler over 
all mankind.  Moreover, I have decreed that whoso embraceth 
My religion shall believe in My unity, and I have 
linked this belief with remembrance of Thee, and after 
 
+P159 
Thee the remembrance of such as Thou hast, by My leave, 
caused to be the `Letters of the Living', and of whatever 
hath been revealed from My religion in the &amp;Bayan.  This, 
indeed, is what will enable the sincere among My servants 
to gain admittance into the celestial Paradise.  
     Verily, the sun is but a token from My presence so that 
the true believers among My servants may discern in its 
rising the dawning of every Dispensation.  
     In truth I have created Thee through Thyself, then at 
My Own behest I have fashioned all things through the 
creative power of Thy Word.  We are All-Powerful.  I have 
appointed Thee to be the Beginning and the End, the Seen 
and the Hidden.  Verily We are the All-Knowing.  
     No one hath been or will ever be invested with prophethood 
other than Thee, nor hath any sacred Book been or 
will be revealed unto any one except Thee.  Such is the 
decree ordained by Him Who is the All-Encompassing, the 
Best Beloved.  
     The &amp;Bayan is in truth Our conclusive proof for all 
created things, and all the peoples of the world are powerless 
before the revelation of its verses.  It enshrineth the sum 
total of all the Scriptures, whether of the past or of the 
future, even as Thou art the Repository of all Our proofs 
in this Day.  We cause whomsover We desire to be 
admitted into the gardens of our most holy, most sublime 
Paradise.  Thus is divine revelation inaugurated in each 
Dispensation at Our behest.  We are truly the supreme 
Ruler.  Indeed no religion shall We ever inaugurate unless 
it be renewed in the days to come.  This is a promise We 
solemnly have made.  Verily We are supreme over all 
things...  
 
+P160 
          He is God, the Sovereign Lord, the All-Glorious.  
 
     SAY:  Praise be to God Who graciously enableth whomsoever 
He willeth to adore Him.  Verily no God is there but 
Him.  His are the most excellent titles; it is He Who 
causeth His Word to be fulfilled as He pleaseth and it is He 
Who leadeth those who have received illumination and 
seek the way of righteousness.  
     Fear thou God, thy Lord, and make mention of His 
Name in the day-time and at eventide.  Follow not the 
promptings of the faithless, lest thou be reckoned among 
the exponents of idle fancies.  Faithfully obey the Primal 
Point Who is the Lord Himself, and be of the righteous.  
Let nothing cause thee to be sore shaken, neither let the 
things which have been destined to take place in this Cause 
disturb thee.  Strive earnestly for the sake of God and walk 
in the path of righteousness.  Shouldst thou encounter the 
unbelievers, place thy whole trust in God, thy Lord, saying, 
Sufficient is God unto me in the kingdoms of both this 
world and the next.  
     The Day is approaching when God shall bring the faithful 
together.  In truth no God is there other than Him.  
     May the peace of God be with those who have been 
guided aright through the power of divine guidance.  
 
 
 
          He is God, the Supreme Ruler, the Sovereign Truth, 
                 He Whose help is implored by all.  
 
     GLORIFIED is He to Whom pertaineth the dominion of 
the heavens and of the earth, in Whose hand lieth the 
 
+P161 
kingdom of all created things and unto Whom shall all 
return.  It is He Who setteth the measure assigned to each 
and every thing and revealeth His goodly gifts and blessings 
in His sacred Book for the benefit of those who offer 
gratitude for His Cause.  
     Say, this earthly life shall come to an end, and everyone 
shall expire and return unto my Lord God Who will 
reward with the choicest gifts the deeds of those who 
endure with patience.  Verily thy God assigneth the measure 
of all created things as He willeth, by virtue of His behest; 
and those who conform to the good-pleasure of your Lord, 
they are indeed among the blissful.  
     Thy Lord hath never raised up a prophet in the past who 
failed to summon the people to His Lord, and today is truly 
similar to the times of old, were ye to ponder over the 
verses revealed by God.  
     When God sent forth His Prophet &amp;Muhammad, on that 
day the termination of the prophetic cycle was foreordained 
in the knowledge of God.  Yea, that promise hath 
indeed come true and the decree of God hath been accomplished 
as He hath ordained.  Assuredly we are today living 
in the Days of God.  These are the glorious days on the like 
of which the sun hath never risen in the past.  These are the 
days which the people in bygone times eagerly expected.  
What hath then befallen you that ye are fast asleep?  These 
are the days wherein God hath caused the Day-Star of 
Truth to shine resplendent.  What hath then caused you to 
keep your silence?  These are the appointed days which ye 
have been yearningly awaiting in the past--the days of the 
advent of divine justice.  Render ye thanks unto God, O ye 
concourse of believers.  
     Let not the deeds of those who reject the Truth shut you 
out as by a veil.  Such people have warrant over your 
 
+P162 
bodies only, and God hath not reposed in them power over 
your spirits, your souls and your hearts.  Fear ye God that 
haply it may be well with you.  All things have been created 
for your sakes, and for the sake of naught else hath your 
creation been ordained.  Fear ye God and take heed lest 
forms and apparels debar you from recognizing Him.  Render 
ye thanksgiving unto God that perchance He may deal 
mercifully with you.  
     This mortal life is sure to perish; its pleasures are bound to 
fade away and ere long ye shall return unto God, distressed 
with pangs of remorse, for presently ye shall be roused 
from your slumber, and ye shall soon find yourselves in the 
presence of God and will be asked of your doings.  
     Say, how dare ye flagrantly deny the verses sent down 
from the heaven of justice, yet ye read the Books of God 
revealed in the past?  How do ye repudiate the meeting with 
your Lord which was appointed with you aforetime, and 
fail in this Day to heed His warning?  Indeed, by adhering 
to forms and by following the promptings of your selfish 
desires, ye have deprived yourselves of the good-pleasure 
of your Lord, except those whom their Lord hath endowed 
with knowledge and who in this Day render thanks unto 
Him for the bounty of being identified with the true Faith 
of God.  Therefore announce ye the Message unto those 
who manifest virtue and teach them the ways of the One 
True God, that haply they may comprehend.  
     Withhold thy tongue from uttering that which might 
grieve thee and beseech God for mercy.  Verily He is fully 
cognizant of the righteous, for He is with such of His 
servants as truly believe in Him, and He is not unaware of 
the actions of the mischief-makers, inasmuch as nothing 
whatever in the heavens or on the earth can escape His 
knowledge.  
 
+P163 
     These verses, clear and conclusive, are a token of the 
mercy of thy Lord and a source of guidance for all mankind.  
They are a light unto those who believe in them and 
a fire of afflictive torment for those who turn away and 
reject them.  
 
 
     O THOU who art the chosen one among women!  
     He is God; glorified is the splendour of His light.  
     The verses in this Tablet are revealed for the one who 
hath believed in the signs of her Lord and is reckoned 
among such as are wholly devoted unto Him.  Bear thou 
witness that verily no God is there but Him, Who is both 
my Lord and thine, and that no other God besides Him 
existeth.  He is the Bountiful, the Almighty.  
     Yield thee thanks unto God, for He hath graciously 
aided thee in this Day, revealed for thee the clear verses of 
this Tablet, and hath numbered thee among such women as 
have believed in the signs of God, have taken Him as their 
guardian and are of the grateful.  Verily God shall soon 
reward thee and those who have believed in His signs with 
an excellent reward from His presence.  Assuredly no God 
is there other than Him, the All-Possessing, the Most 
Generous.  The revelations of His bounty pervade all 
created things; He is the Merciful, the Compassionate.  
 
 
     GOD testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the 
Almighty, the Best Beloved.  
 
+P164 
     Fix your gaze upon Him Whom God shall make manifest 
in the Day of Resurrection, then firmly believe in that 
which is sent down by Him.  
     Say, God hath undisputed triumph over every victorious 
one.  There is no one in heaven or earth or in whatever 
lieth between them who can frustrate the transcendent 
supremacy of His triumph.  He calleth into being whatsoever 
He willeth through the potency of His behest.  Verily 
God is the mightiest Sustainer, the Helper and the Defender.  
 
 
     WHEN the Day-Star of &amp;Baha will shine resplendent above 
the horizon of eternity it is incumbent upon you to present 
yourselves before His Throne.  Beware lest ye be seated in 
His presence or ask questions without His leave.  Fear ye 
God, O concourse of the Mirrors.  
     Beg ye of Him the wondrous tokens of His favour that 
He may graciously reveal for you whatever He willeth 
and desireth, inasmuch as on that Day all the revelations of 
divine bounty shall circle around the Seat of His glory and 
emanate from His presence, could ye but understand it.  
     It behooveth you to remain silent before His Throne, for 
indeed of all the things which have been created between 
heaven and earth nothing on that Day will be deemed 
more fitting than the observance of silence.  Moreover, take 
ye good heed not to be reckoned among those of the past 
who were invested with knowledge, yet by reason of their 
learning waxed proud before God, the Transcendent, the 
Self-Subsisting, inasmuch as on that Day it is He Who is 
the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, the Source of all knowledge, 
far above such as are endued with learning; and it is 
 
+P165 
He Who is the Potent, the All-Compelling, the Lord of 
power, in the face of those who wield power; and it is He 
Who is the Mighty, the Most August, the Most Glorious 
before such as display glory; and on that Day it is He Who 
is the Lofty, the All-Highest, the Source of exaltation, far 
above those who are elevated in rank; and it is He Who 
is the Almighty, the Source of glory and grandeur, far 
above the pomp of the mighty; and it is He Who is the 
Omnipotent, the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of judgement, 
transcending all such as are invested with authority; and it 
is He Who is the Generous, the Most Benevolent, the 
Essence of bounty, Who standeth supreme in the face of 
such as show benevolence; and it is He Who is the Ordainer 
and the Supreme Wielder of authority and power, inconceivably 
high above those who hold earthly dominion; 
and it is He Who is the Most Excellent, the Unsurpassed, the 
Pre-eminent in the face of every man of accomplishment.  
     Ye have, one and all, been called into being to seek His 
presence and to attain that exalted and glorious station.  
Indeed, He will send down from the heaven of His mercy 
that which will benefit you, and whatever is graciously 
vouchsafed by Him shall enable you to dispense with all 
mankind.  Verily on that Day the learning of the learned 
shall prove of no avail, neither the accomplishments of the 
exponents of knowledge, nor the pomp of the highly 
honoured, nor the power of the mighty, nor the remembrance 
of the devout, nor the deeds of the righteous, nor 
the genuflexion of the kneeling worshipper, nor his prostration 
or turning towards the Qiblih, nor the honour of 
the honoured, nor the kinship of the highly born, nor the 
nobility of those of noble descent, nor the discourse of the 
eloquent, nor the titles of the prominent--none of these 
shall be of any avail unto them--inasmuch as all these and 
 
+P166 
whatever else ye have known or comprehended were 
created by His word of command `Be' and it is.  Indeed if 
it be His Will He can assuredly bring about the resurrection 
of all created things through a word from Himself.  He is, 
in truth, over and above all this, the All-Powerful, the 
Almighty, the Omnipotent.  
     Beware, O concourse of Mirrors, lest on that Day titles 
make you vainglorious.  Know ye of a certainty that ye, 
together with all those who stand above you or below you, 
have been created for that Day.  Fear ye God and commit 
not that which would grieve His heart, nor be of them that 
have gone astray.  Perchance He will appear invested with 
the power of Truth while ye are fast asleep on your couches, 
or His messengers will bring glorious and resplendent 
Tablets from Him while ye turn away disdainfully from 
Him, pronounce sentence against Him--such sentence as ye 
would never pass on yourselves--and say, `This is not 
from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Existent'.  
     Glory be unto Thee, O my God, Thou art well aware 
that I have proclaimed Thy Word and have not failed in 
the mission Thou didst enjoin upon me.  I entreat Thee to 
guard the people of the &amp;Bayan on that Day in order that 
they may not pronounce censure against Thee nor contend 
with Thy signs.  Protect them then, O my God, through the 
power of Thy might which pervadeth all mankind.  
 
 
 
                    He is the Almighty.  
 
     GLORY be unto Him Who is the Lord of all that are in 
the heavens and on the earth; He is the All-Wise, the All-Informed.  
 
+P167 
It is He Who calleth into being whatsoever He 
willeth at His behest; He is indeed the Clement, the 
Fashioner.  Say, verily He is equal to His purpose; whomsoever 
He willeth, He maketh victorious through the power 
of His hosts; there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, 
the Wise.  His is the kingdom of earth and heaven and He is 
the Lord of power and glory.  Such as have believed in God 
and in His signs are indeed the followers of truth and shall 
abide in the gardens of delight, while those who have disbelieved 
in God and have rejected that which He hath 
revealed, these shall be the inmates of the fire wherein they 
shall remain forever.  Say, most people have openly repudiated 
God and have followed the rebellious wicked 
doers.  Such people resemble those who have gone before 
them, upholding every hostile oppressor.  Verily no God 
is there but God; His is the kingdom of heaven and earth 
and He is the Clement, the All-Knowing.  God testifieth 
that there is no God but Him, and He Who speaketh at the 
bidding of His Lord is but the First to worship Him.  He is 
the peerless Creator Who hath created the heavens and the 
earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and all do His 
bidding.  He is the One Whose grace hath encompassed all 
that are in the heavens, on earth or elsewhere, and everyone 
abideth by His behest.  
 
 
     IT behooveth you to await the Day of the appearance of 
Him Whom God shall manifest.  Indeed My aim in planting 
the Tree of the &amp;Bayan hath been none other than to enable 
you to recognize Me.  In truth I Myself am the first to bow 
down before God and to believe in Him.  Therefore let 
 
+P168 
not your recognition become fruitless, inasmuch as the 
&amp;Bayan, notwithstanding the sublimity of its station, beareth 
fealty to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and it is 
He Who beseemeth most to be acclaimed as the Seat of 
divine Reality, though indeed He is I and I am He.  However, 
when the Tree of the &amp;Bayan attaineth its highest 
development, We shall bend it low as a token of adoration 
towards its Lord Who will appear in the person of Him 
Whom God shall make manifest.  Perchance ye may be 
privileged to glorify God as it befitteth His august Self.  
     Indeed ye have been called into being through the power 
of the Point of the &amp;Bayan while the Point Himself is resigned 
to the Will of Him Whom God shall make manifest, 
is exalted through His transcendent sublimity, is sustained 
by the evidences of His might, is glorified by the majesty 
of His oneness, is adorned by the beauty of His singleness, is 
empowered by His eternal dominion and is invested with 
authority through His everlasting sovereignty.  How then 
could they, who are but the creation of the Point, be justified 
in saying `why or wherefore'?  
     O congregation of the &amp;Bayan, and all who are therein!  
Recognize ye the limits imposed upon you, for such a One 
as the Point of the &amp;Bayan Himself hath believed in Him 
Whom God shall make manifest, before all things were 
created.  Therein, verily, do I glory before all who are in the 
kingdom of heaven and earth.  Suffer not yourselves to be 
shut out as by a veil from God after He hath revealed 
Himself.  For all that hath been exalted in the &amp;Bayan is but 
as a ring upon My hand, and I Myself am, verily, but a ring 
upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest-- 
glorified be His mention!  He turneth it as He pleaseth, for 
whatsoever He pleaseth, and through whatsoever He 
pleaseth.  He, verily, is the Help in Peril, the Most High.

          In the Name of God, the Lord of overpowering majesty, 
                       the All-Compelling.  
 
     HALLOWED be the Lord in Whose hand is the 
source of dominion.  He createth whatsoever He 
willeth by His Word of command `Be', and it 
is.  His hath been the power of authority heretofore 
and it shall remain His hereafter.  He maketh victorious 
whomsoever He pleaseth, through the potency of His 
behest.  He is in truth the Powerful, the Almighty.  Unto 
Him pertaineth all glory and majesty in the kingdoms of 
Revelation and Creation and whatever lieth between them.  
Verily He is the Potent, the All-Glorious.  From everlasting 
He hath been the Source of indomitable strength 
and shall remain so unto everlasting.  He is indeed the Lord 
of might and power.  All the kingdoms of heaven and earth 
and whatever is between them are God's, and His power 
is supreme over all things.  All the treasures of earth and 
heaven and everything between them are His, and His 
protection extendeth over all things.  He is the Creator of 
the heavens and the earth and whatever lieth between them 
and He truly is a witness over all things.  He is the Lord of 
Reckoning for all that dwell in the heavens and on earth 
and whatever lieth between them, and truly God is swift 
to reckon.  He setteth the measure assigned to all who are in 
the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them.  
Verily He is the Supreme Protector.  He holdeth in His 
grasp the keys of heaven and earth and of everything between 
them.  At His Own pleasure doth He bestow gifts, 
through the power of His command.  Indeed His grace 
encompasseth all and He is the All-Knowing.  
 
+P172 
     Say:  God sufficeth unto me; He is the One Who holdeth 
in His grasp the kingdom of all things.  Through the power 
of His hosts of heaven and earth and whatever lieth between 
them, He protecteth whomsoever among His servants He 
willeth.  God, in truth, keepeth watch over all things.  
     Immeasurably exalted art Thou, O Lord!  Protect us 
from what lieth in front of us and behind us, above our 
heads, on our right, on our left, below our feet and every 
other side to which we are exposed.  Verily Thy protection 
over all things is unfailing.+F1  
 
 
     SEND down Thy blessings, O my God, upon the Tree of 
the &amp;Bayan, upon its root and its branch, its boughs, its 
leaves, its fruits and upon whatsoever it beareth or sheltereth.  
Cause this Tree then to be made into a magnificent 
Scroll to be offered to the presence of Him Whom Thou 
wilt make manifest on the Day of Judgement, that He may 
graciously allow the entire company of the followers of the 
&amp;Bayan to be restored to life and that He may, through His 
bounty, inaugurate a new creation.  
     Indeed all are but paupers in the face of Thy tender 
mercy, and lowly servants before the tokens of Thy loving-kindness.  
I beg of Thee, by Thy bounty, O my God, and 
by the outpourings of Thy mercy and bestowals, O my 
Lord, and by the evidences of Thy heavenly favours and 
grace, O my Best Beloved, to watch over Him Whom 
God shall make manifest that no trace of despondency may 
ever touch Him.

     IMMEASURABLY glorified and exalted art Thou.  How 
can I make mention of Thee, O Thou the Beloved of the 
entire creation; and how can I acknowledge Thy claim, O 
Thou, before Whom every created thing standeth in awe.  
The loftiest station to which human perception can soar 
and the utmost height which the minds and souls of men 
can scale are but signs created through the potency of Thy 
command and tokens manifested through the power of 
Thy Revelation.  Far be it from Thy glory that anyone other 
than Thee should make mention of Thee or should 
attempt to voice Thy praise.  The very essence of every 
reality beareth witness to its debarment from the precincts 
of the court of Thy nearness, and the quintessence of every 
being testifieth to its failure to attain Thy holy Presence.  
Immeasurably glorified and exalted art Thou!  That which 
alone beseemeth Thee is the befitting mention made by 
Thine Own Self, and that only which is worthy of Thee 
is the anthem of praise voiced by Thine Own Essence...  
     Through the revelation of Thy grace, O Lord, Thou 
didst call Me into being on a night such as this,+F1 and lo, I 
am now lonely and forsaken in a mountain.  Praise and 
thanksgiving be unto Thee for whatever conformeth to 
Thy pleasure within the empire of heaven and earth.  And 
all sovereignty is Thine, extending beyond the uttermost 
range of the kingdoms of Revelation and Creation.  
     Thou didst create Me, O Lord, through Thy gracious 
favour and didst protect Me through Thy bounty in the 
darkness of the womb and didst nourish Me, through Thy 
loving-kindness, with life-giving blood.  After having 
fashioned Me in a most comely form, through Thy tender 
providence, and having perfected My creation through

+P174 
Thine excellent handiwork and breathed Thy Spirit into 
My body through Thine infinite mercy and by the revelation 
of Thy transcendent unity, Thou didst cause Me to 
issue forth from the world of concealment into the visible 
world, naked, ignorant of all things, and powerless to 
achieve aught.  Thou didst then nourish Me with refreshing 
milk and didst rear Me in the arms of My parents with 
manifest compassion, until Thou didst graciously acquaint 
Me with the realities of Thy Revelation and apprised Me 
of the straight path of Thy Faith as set forth in Thy Book.  
And when I attained full maturity Thou didst cause Me to 
bear allegiance unto Thine inaccessible Remembrance, and 
enabled Me to advance towards the designated station, 
where Thou didst educate Me through the subtle operations 
of Thy handiwork and didst nurture Me in that land with 
Thy most gracious gifts.  When that which had been preordained 
in Thy Book came to pass Thou didst cause Me, 
through Thy kindness, to reach Thy holy precincts and 
didst suffer Me, through Thy tender mercy, to dwell 
within the court of fellowship, until I discerned therein 
that which I witnessed of the clear tokens of Thy mercifulness, 
the compelling evidences of Thy oneness, the 
effulgent splendours of Thy majesty, the source of Thy 
supreme singleness, the heights of Thy transcendent 
sovereignty, the signs of Thy peerlessness, the manifestations 
of Thine exalted glory, the retreats of Thy sanctity, 
and whatsoever is inscrutable to all but Thee.  
 
 
     VERILY I am Thy servant, O my God, and Thy poor 
one and Thy suppliant and Thy wretched creature.  I 
 
+P175 
have arrived at Thy gate, seeking Thy shelter.  I have found 
no contentment save in Thy love, no exultation except in 
Thy remembrance, no eagerness but in obedience to Thee, 
no joy save in Thy nearness, and no tranquillity except in 
reunion with Thee, notwithstanding that I am conscious 
that all created things are debarred from Thy sublime 
Essence and the entire creation is denied access to Thine 
inmost Being.  Whenever I attempt to approach Thee, I 
perceive nothing in myself but the tokens of Thy grace and 
behold naught in my being but the revelations of Thy 
loving-kindness.  How can one who is but Thy creature seek 
reunion with Thee and attain unto Thy presence, whereas 
no created thing can ever be associated with Thee, nor can 
aught comprehend Thee?  How is it possible for a lowly 
servant to recognize Thee and to extol Thy praise, notwithstanding 
that Thou hast destined for him the revelations 
of Thy dominion and the wondrous testimonies of 
Thy sovereignty?  Thus every created thing beareth witness 
that it is debarred from the sanctuary of Thy presence by 
reason of the limitations imposed upon its inner reality.  
It is undisputed, however, that the influence of Thine 
attraction hath everlastingly been inherent in the realities 
of Thy handiwork, although that which beseemeth the 
hallowed court of Thy providence is exalted beyond the 
attainment of the entire creation.  This indicateth, O my 
God, my utter powerlessness to praise Thee and revealeth 
my utmost impotence in yielding thanks unto Thee; and 
how much more to attain the recognition of Thy divine 
unity or to succeed in reaching the clear tokens of Thy 
praise, Thy sanctity and Thy glory.  Nay, by Thy might, I 
yearn for naught but Thine Own Self and seek no one 
other than Thee.  
 
+P176 
     MAGNIFIED be Thy Name, O God.  Thine in truth are the 
Kingdoms of Creation and Revelation, and verily in our 
Lord have we placed our whole trust.  All praise be unto 
Thee, O God; Thou art the Maker of the heavens and the 
earth and that which is between them, and Thou in truth 
art the supreme Ruler, the Fashioner, the All-Wise.  
Glorified art Thou, O Lord!  Thou wilt surely gather mankind 
for the Day of whose coming there is no doubt--the 
Day whereon everyone shall appear before Thee and find 
life in Thee.  This is the Day of the One true God--the 
Day Thou shalt bring about as Thou pleasest through the 
power of Thy behest.  
     Thou art the Sovereign, the wondrous Creator, the 
Mighty, the Best Beloved.  
 
 
     LAUDED be Thy Name, O God.  Thou art in truth our 
Lord; Thou art aware of whatsoever is in the heavens and 
on the earth.  Send down then upon us a token of Thy 
mercy.  Verily Thou art unsurpassed among them that 
show mercy.  All praise be unto Thee, O Lord.  Ordain for 
us from Thy presence that which will comfort the hearts 
of the sincere among Thy servants.  Glorified art Thou, O 
God, Thou art the Creator of the heavens and the earth and 
that which lieth between them.  Thou art the sovereign 
Lord, the Most Holy, the Almighty, the All-Wise.  Magnified 
be Thy Name, O God, send down upon them who 
have believed in God and in His signs a mighty succour 
from Thy presence such as to enable them to prevail over 
the generality of mankind.  
 
+P177 
     GLORY be unto Thee, O God.  How can I make mention 
of Thee while Thou art sanctified from the praise of all 
mankind.  Magnified be Thy Name, O God, Thou art the 
King, the Eternal Truth; Thou knowest what is in the 
heavens and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return.  
Thou hast sent down Thy divinely-ordained Revelation 
according to a clear measure.  Praised art Thou, O Lord!  
At Thy behest Thou dost render victorious whomsoever 
Thou willest, through the hosts of heaven and earth and 
whatsoever existeth between them.  Thou art the Sovereign, 
the Eternal Truth, the Lord of invincible might.  
     Glorified art Thou, O Lord, Thou forgivest at all times 
the sins of such among Thy servants as implore Thy pardon.  
Wash away my sins and the sins of those who seek Thy 
forgiveness at dawn, who pray to Thee in the day-time and 
in the night season, who yearn after naught save God, who 
offer up whatsoever God hath graciously bestowed upon 
them, who celebrate Thy praise at morn and eventide, and 
who are not remiss in their duties.  
 
 
     PRAISE be unto Thee, O Lord.  Forgive us our sins, have 
mercy upon us and enable us to return unto Thee.  Suffer 
us not to rely on aught else besides Thee, and vouchsafe 
unto us, through Thy bounty, that which Thou lovest 
and desirest and well beseemeth Thee.  Exalt the station of 
them that have truly believed and forgive them with Thy 
gracious forgiveness.  Verily Thou art the Help in Peril, the 
Self-Subsisting.  
 
+P178 
     O GOD our Lord!  Protect us through Thy grace from 
whatsoever may be repugnant unto Thee and vouchsafe 
unto us that which well beseemeth Thee.  Give us more out 
of Thy bounty and bless us.  Pardon us for the things we 
have done and wash away our sins and forgive us with Thy 
gracious forgiveness.  Verily Thou art the Most Exalted, the 
Self-Subsisting.  
     Thy loving providence hath encompassed all created 
things in the heavens and on the earth, and Thy forgiveness 
hath surpassed the whole creation.  Thine is sovereignty; in 
Thy hand are the Kingdoms of Creation and Revelation; 
in Thy right hand Thou holdest all created things and 
within Thy grasp are the assigned measures of forgiveness.  
Thou forgivest whomsoever among Thy servants Thou 
pleasest.  Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving.  
Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge, and 
naught is there which is hidden from Thee.  
     O God our Lord!  Protect us through the potency of Thy 
might, enable us to enter Thy wondrous surging ocean, 
and grant us that which well befitteth Thee.  
     Thou art the Sovereign Ruler, the Mighty Doer, the 
Exalted, the All-loving.  
 
 
     GLORY be unto Thee, O Lord my God!  Nothing whatsoever 
escapeth Thy knowledge, nor is there anything 
that could slip from Thy grasp, or anything that could 
thwart Thy Purpose, whether in the heavens or on the 
earth, of the past or of the future.  
     Thou seest Paradise and the inmates thereof; Thou 
beholdest the realm below and the dwellers thereof.  All 
are but Thy servants and are held within Thy grasp.  
 
+P179 
     O Lord!  Render victorious Thy forbearing servants in 
Thy days by granting them a befitting victory, inasmuch 
as they have sought martyrdom in Thy path.  Send down 
upon them that which will bring comfort to their minds, 
will rejoice their inner beings, will impart assurance to their 
hearts and tranquillity to their bodies and will enable their 
souls to ascend to the presence of God, the Most Exalted, 
and to attain the supreme Paradise and such retreats of 
glory as Thou hast destined for men of true knowledge and 
virtue.  Verily Thou knowest all things, while we are but 
Thy servants, Thy thralls, Thy bondsmen and Thy poor 
ones.  No Lord but Thee do we invoke, O God our Lord, 
nor do we implore blessings or grace from anyone but 
Thee, O Thou Who art the God of mercy unto this world 
and the next.  We are but the embodiments of poverty, of 
nothingness, of helplessness and of perdition, while Thy 
whole Being betokeneth wealth, independence, glory, 
majesty and boundless grace.  
     Turn our recompense, O Lord, into that which well 
beseemeth Thee of the good of this world and of the next, 
and of the manifold bounties which extend from on high 
down to the earth below.  
     Verily Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all things.  
Into Thy hands do we surrender ourselves, yearning for the 
things that pertain unto Thee.  
 
 
     GLORIFIED be Thy Name, O Lord!  In whom shall I 
take refuge while Thou art in truth my God and my 
Beloved; unto whom shall I turn for shelter while Thou 
art my Lord and my Possessor; and towards whom shall I 
 
+P180 
flee while Thou art in truth my Master and my Sanctuary; 
and whom shall I implore while Thou art in truth my 
Treasure and the Goal of my desire; and through whom 
shall I plead before Thee, while Thou art in truth my 
highest aspiration and supreme desire?  Every hope hath 
been frustrated save the yearning for Thy heavenly grace, 
and every door is barred except the portal leading to the 
well-spring of Thy blessings.  
     I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy most effulgent 
splendour, before whose brightness every soul humbly 
boweth down and prostrateth itself in adoration for Thy 
sake--a splendour before whose radiance fire is turned into 
light, the dead are brought to life and every difficulty is 
changed into ease.  I entreat Thee by this great, this wondrous 
splendour and by the glory of Thine exalted 
sovereignty, O Thou Who art the Lord of indomitable 
power, to transform us through Thy bounty into that which 
Thou Thyself dost possess and enable us to become fountains 
of Thy light, and graciously vouchsafe unto us that 
which beseemeth the majesty of Thy transcendent dominion.  
For unto Thee have I raised my hands, O Lord, and 
in Thee have I found sheltering support, O Lord, and unto 
Thee have I resigned myself, O Lord, and upon Thee have 
I placed my whole reliance, O Lord, and by Thee am I 
strengthened, O Lord.  
     Verily there is no power nor strength except in Thee.  
 
 
     THOU art aware, O My God, that since the day Thou 
didst call Me into being out of the water of Thy love till I 
reached fifteen years of age I lived in the land which 
 
+P181 
witnessed My birth [&amp;Shiraz].  Then Thou didst enable Me 
to go to the seaport [&amp;Bushihr] where for five years I was 
engaged in trading with the goodly gifts of Thy realm and 
was occupied in that with which Thou hast favoured Me 
through the wondrous essence of Thy loving-kindness.  
I proceeded therefrom to the Holy Land [&amp;Karbila] where 
I sojourned for one year.  Then I returned to the place of 
My birth.  There I experienced the revelation of Thy sublime 
bestowals and the evidences of Thy boundless grace.  
I yield Thee praise for all Thy goodly gifts and I render 
Thee thanksgiving for all Thy bounties.  Then at the age of 
twenty-five I proceeded to thy sacred House [Mecca], and 
by the time I returned to the place where I was born, a 
year had elapsed.  There I tarried patiently in the path of Thy 
love and beheld the evidences of Thy manifold bounties 
and of Thy loving-kindness until Thou didst ordain for Me 
to set out in Thy direction and to migrate to Thy presence.  
Thus I departed therefrom by Thy leave, spending six 
months in the land of &amp;Sad [&amp;Isfahan] and seven months in 
the First Mountain [&amp;Maku], where Thou didst rain down 
upon Me that which beseemeth the glory of Thy heavenly 
blessings and befitteth the sublimity of Thy gracious gifts 
and favours.  Now, in My thirtieth year, Thou beholdest 
Me, O My God, in this Grievous Mountain [&amp;Chihriq] 
where I have dwelt for one whole year.  
     Praise be unto Thee, O My Lord, for all times, heretofore 
and hereafter; and thanks be unto Thee, O My God, 
under all conditions, whether of the past or the future.  
The gifts Thou hast bestowed upon Me have reached their 
fullest measure and the blessings Thou hast vouchsafed 
unto Me have attained their consummation.  Naught do I 
now witness but the manifold evidences of Thy grace and 
loving-kindness, Thy bounty and gracious favours, Thy 
 
+P182 
generosity and loftiness, Thy sovereignty and might, 
Thy splendour and Thy glory, and that which befitteth 
the holy court of Thy transcendent dominion and majesty 
and beseemeth the glorious precincts of Thine eternity 
and exaltation.  
 
 
     I AM aware, O Lord, that my trespasses have covered my 
face with shame in Thy presence, and have burdened my 
back before Thee, have intervened between me and 
Thy beauteous countenance, have compassed me from 
every direction and have hindered me on all sides from 
gaining access unto the revelations of Thy celestial power.  
     O Lord!  If Thou forgivest me not, who is there then to 
grant pardon, and if Thou hast no mercy upon me who is 
capable of showing compassion?  Glory be unto Thee, Thou 
didst create me when I was non-existent and Thou didst 
nourish me while I was devoid of any understanding.  
Praise be unto Thee, every evidence of bounty proceedeth 
from Thee and every token of grace emanateth from the 
treasuries of Thy decree.  
 
 
     I BEG Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every mention 
but the mention of Thee, and for every praise but the 
praise of Thee, and for every delight but delight in Thy 
nearness, and for every pleasure but the pleasure of communion 
with Thee, and for every joy but the joy of Thy 
love and of Thy good-pleasure, and for all things pertaining 
 
+P183 
unto me which bear no relationship unto Thee, O Thou 
Who art the Lord of lords, He Who provideth the means 
and unlocketh the doors.  
 
 
     HOW can I praise Thee, O Lord, for the evidences of Thy 
mighty splendour and for Thy wondrous sweet savours 
which Thou hast imparted to Me in this fortress, in such 
measure that nothing in the heavens or on the earth can 
compare with them?  Thou hast watched over Me in the 
heart of this mountain where I am compassed by mountains 
on all sides.  One hangeth above Me, others stand on My 
right and My left and yet another riseth in front of Me.  
Glory be unto Thee, no God is there but Thee.  How often 
have I seen rocks from the mountain hurtling down upon 
Me, and Thou didst protect Me therefrom and preserved 
Me within the stronghold of Thy divine Unity.  
     Glorified and exalted art Thou, and praise be unto Thee 
for whatsoever Thou lovest and desirest, and thanks be 
unto Thee for that which Thou hast decreed and preordained.  
From time immemorial Thy tender mercy hath 
been sent down and the process of Thy creation hath been 
and ever is ceaseless.  Thy handiwork is unlike the work of 
anyone besides Thee, and Thy goodly gifts are unparalleled 
by the gifts of anyone other than Thyself.  
     Praise be unto Thee, O My Beloved, and magnified be 
Thy Name.  Ever since the hour I set foot upon this fortress 
till the moment I shall have departed therefrom, I 
behold Thee established upon Thy seat of glory and 
majesty, sending down upon Me the manifold tokens of 
Thy bountiful favour and grace.  Thou beholdest that My 
 
+P184 
dwelling place is but the heart of the mountains, and Thou 
discernest naught in My Person except the evidences of 
abasement and loneliness.  
     Lauded be Thy Name; I render Thee thanks for every 
instance of Thine inscrutable Decree and offer My praise 
for every token of Thy tribulations.  Having suffered Me 
to be cast into the prison, Thou didst turn it into a garden 
of Paradise for Me and caused it to become a chamber of 
the court of everlasting fellowship.  
     How numerous the verses Thou didst send down unto 
Me, and the prayers Thou didst hear Me offer unto Thee.  
How diverse the revelations which Thou didst call into 
being through Me and the experiences Thou didst witness 
in Me.  
     Magnified be Thy Name.  Manifold trials have been 
powerless to deter Me from yielding thanks unto Thee and 
My shortcomings have failed to keep Me back from extolling 
Thy virtues.  The infidels had purposed to turn My 
abode into one of disgrace and humiliation.  But Thou hast 
glorified Me through My remembrance of Thee, hast 
exalted Me through My praise of Thee, hast graciously 
aided Me through the revelations of Thy oneness, and 
hast conferred upon Me a great honour through the effulgent 
splendours of Thine ancient eternity.  To the fire Thou 
dost command, `Be thou a soothing balm unto My 
Servant', and to the prison, `Be thou a seat of tender compassion 
to My Servant, as a token from My presence'.  Yea, 
I swear by Thy glory; to Me the prison hath proved to be 
naught but the most delightful garden of Paradise and hath 
served as the noblest spot in the realm above.  
     Praised and glorified art Thou.  How often did adversities 
descend upon Me and Thou didst temper them and 
avert them through Thy gracious favour; and how many 
 
+P185 
times were commotions stirred up against Me at the hand 
of the people, while Thou didst cause them to subside 
through Thy tender mercy.  How numerous the occasions 
when the Nimrods kindled fires wherewith to burn Me, 
but Thou didst make them balm for Me; and how manifold 
the instances when the infidels decreed My humiliation 
and Thou didst turn them into marks of honour for 
Me...  
     Verily Thou art the highest aspiration of every earnest 
seeker and the Goal of the desire of them that yearn after 
Thee.  Thou art He Who is ready to answer the call of such 
as recognize Thy divine unity, and He before Whom the 
faint-hearted stand in awe.  Thou art the Helper of the 
needy, the Deliverer of the captives, the Abaser of the 
oppressors, the Destroyer of the wrong-doers, the God of 
all men, the Lord of all created things.  Thine are the kingdoms 
of Creation and Revelation, O Thou Who art the 
Lord of all the worlds.  
     O All-Sufficient One!  Thou dost suffice Me in every 
hardship that may descend upon Me and in every affliction 
that may wax great before Me.  Thou art My sole Companion 
in My loneliness, the Delight of My heart in My 
solitude and My Best Beloved in My prison and in My 
Abode.  No God is there but Thee!  
     Whomsoever Thou dost suffice shall not be put to grief; 
whomsoever Thou dost protect shall never perish; whomsoever 
Thou dost help shall never be abased; and he unto 
whom Thou turnest Thy gaze shall never be far removed 
from Thee.  
     Write down for us then whatsoever is of Thee, and forgive 
us for what we are.  Verily Thou art the Lord of power 
and glory, the Lord of all the worlds.  `Far be the glory of 
Thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they impute 
 
+P186 
to Him, and peace be upon His Apostles, and praise be 
unto God, the Lord of all the worlds.'+F1  
 
 
     GLORY be to Thee, O God!  Thou art the God Who hath 
existed before all things, Who will exist after all things and 
will last beyond all things.  Thou art the God Who knoweth 
all things, and is supreme over all things.  Thou art the God 
Who dealeth mercifully with all things, Who judgeth 
between all things and Whose vision embraceth all things.  
Thou art God my Lord, Thou art aware of my position, 
Thou dost witness my inner and outer being.  
     Grant Thy forgiveness unto me and unto the believers 
who responded to Thy Call.  Be Thou my sufficing helper 
against the mischief of whosoever may desire to inflict 
sorrow upon me or wish me ill.  Verily Thou art the Lord 
of all created things.  Thou dost suffice everyone, while no 
one can be self-sufficient without Thee.  
 
 
     I IMPLORE Thee by the splendour of the light of Thy 
glorious face, the majesty of Thine ancient grandeur and 
the power of Thy transcendent sovereignty to ordain for 
us at this moment every measure of that which is good and 
seemly and to destine for us every portion of the outpourings 
of Thy grace.  For granting of gifts doth not cause Thee 
loss, nor doth the bestowing of favours diminish Thy 
wealth.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 37:180-182  
 
+P187 
     Glorified art Thou, O Lord!  Verily I am poor while in 
truth Thou art rich; verily I am lowly while in truth Thou 
art mighty; verily I am impotent while in truth Thou art 
powerful; verily I am abased while in truth Thou art the 
most exalted; verily I am distressed while in truth Thou 
art the Lord of might.  
 
 
     DO Thou ordain for me, O Lord, every good thing Thou 
hast created or wilt create, and shield me from whatever 
evil Thou abhorrest from among the things Thou hast 
caused or wilt cause to exist.  In truth Thy knowledge embraceth 
all things.  Praised be Thou, verily no God is there 
but Thee, and nothing whatsoever in the heavens or on 
the earth and all that is between them can ever thwart Thy 
Purpose.  Indeed potent art Thou over all things.  
     Far be it from the sublimity of Thy Being, O my God, 
that anyone seek Thy loving-kindness or favour.  Far be it 
from Thy transcendent glory that anyone entreat Thee for 
the evidences of Thy bestowals and tender mercy.  Too high 
art Thou for any soul to beseech the revelation of Thy 
gracious providence and loving care, and too sanctified is 
Thy glory for anyone to beg of Thee the outpourings of 
Thy blessings and of Thy heavenly bounty and grace.  
Throughout Thy kingdom of heaven and earth, which is 
endowed with manifold bounties, Thou art immeasurably 
glorified above aught whereunto any identity could be 
ascribed.  
     All that I beg of Thee, O my God, is to enable me, ere 
my soul departeth from my body, to attain Thy good-pleasure, 
even were it granted to me for a moment tinier 
 
+P188 
than the infinitesimal fraction of a mustard seed.  For if it 
departeth while Thou art pleased with me, then I shall be 
free from every concern or anxiety; but if it abandoneth 
me while Thou art displeased with me, then, even had I 
wrought every good deed, none would be of any avail, 
and had I earned every honour and glory, none would serve 
to exalt me.  
     I earnestly beseech Thee then, O my God, to graciously 
bestow Thy good-pleasure upon me when Thou dost cause 
me to ascend unto Thee and make me appear before Thy 
holy presence, inasmuch as Thou hast, from everlasting, 
been the God of immense bounty unto the people of Thy 
realm, and the Lord of most excellent gifts to all that dwell 
in the exalted heaven of Thine omnipotence.  
 
 
     HOW numerous the souls raised to life who were exposed 
to dire humiliation in Thy Path for exalting Thy Word and 
for glorifying Thy divine Unity!  How profuse the blood 
that hath been shed for the sake of Thy Faith to vindicate 
the authenticity of Thy divine Mission and to celebrate 
Thy praise!  How vast the possessions that were wrongfully 
seized in the Path of Thy love in order to affirm the loftiness 
of Thy sanctity and to extol Thy glorious Name!  How 
many the feet that have trodden upon the dust in order to 
magnify Thy holy Word and to extol Thy glory!  How 
innumerable the voices that were raised in lamentation, the 
hearts that were struck with terror, the grievous woes that 
none other than Thee can reckon, and the adversities and 
afflictions that remain inscrutable to anyone except Thyself; 
all this to establish, O my God, the loftiness of Thy sanctity 
 
+P189 
and to demonstrate the transcendent character of Thy glory.  
     These decrees were ordained by Thee so that all created 
things might bear witness that they have been brought into 
being for the sake of naught else but Thee.  Thou hast withheld 
from them the things that bring tranquillity to their 
hearts, that they might know of a certainty that whatever 
is associated with Thy holy Being is far superior to and 
exalted above aught else that would satisfy them; inasmuch 
as Thine indomitable power pervadeth all things, and 
nothing can ever frustrate it.  
     Indeed Thou hast caused these momentous happenings 
to come to pass that those who are endued with perception 
may readily recognize that they were ordained by Thee to 
demonstrate the loftiness of Thy divine Unity and to affirm 
the exaltation of Thy sanctity.  
 
 
     GLORY be unto Thee, O Lord!  Although Thou mayest 
cause a person to be destitute of all earthly possessions, and 
from the beginning of his life until his ascension unto Thee 
he may be reduced to poverty through the operation of Thy 
decree, yet wert Thou to have brought him forth from the 
Tree of Thy love, such a bounty would indeed be far 
better for him than all the things Thou hast created in 
heaven and earth and whatsoever lieth between them; inasmuch 
as he will inherit the heavenly home, through the 
revelation of Thy favours, and will partake of the goodly 
gifts Thou hast provided therein; for the things which are 
with Thee are inexhaustible.  This indeed is Thy blessing 
which according to the good-pleasure of Thy Will Thou 
dost bestow on those who tread the path of Thy love.  
 
+P190 
     How numerous the souls who in former times were put 
to death for Thy sake, and in whose names all men now 
pride themselves; and how vast the number of those whom 
Thou didst enable to acquire earthly fortunes, and who 
amassed them while they were deprived of Thy Truth, and 
who in this day have passed into oblivion.  Theirs is a 
grievous chastisement and a dire punishment.  
     O Lord!  Provide for the speedy growth of the Tree of 
Thy divine Unity; water it then, O Lord, with the flowing 
waters of Thy good-pleasure, and cause it, before the 
revelations of Thy divine assurance, to yield such fruits as 
Thou desirest for Thy glorification and exaltation, Thy 
praise and thanksgiving, and to magnify Thy Name, to 
laud the oneness of Thine Essence and to offer adoration 
unto Thee, inasmuch as all this lieth within Thy grasp and 
in that of none other.  
     Great is the blessedness of those whose blood Thou hast 
chosen wherewith to water the Tree of Thine affirmation, 
and thus to exalt Thy holy and immutable Word.  
     Ordain for me, O my Lord, and for those who believe 
in Thee that which is deemed best for us in Thine estimation, 
as set forth in the Mother Book, for within the grasp 
of Thy hand Thou holdest the determined measures of all 
things.  
     Thy goodly gifts are unceasingly showered upon such as 
cherish Thy love and the wondrous tokens of Thy heavenly 
bounties are amply bestowed on those who recognize Thy 
divine Unity.  We commit unto Thy care whatsoever Thou 
hast destined for us, and implore Thee to grant us all the 
good that Thy knowledge embraceth.  
     Protect me, O my Lord, from every evil that Thine 
omniscience perceiveth, inasmuch as there is no power nor 
strength but in Thee, no triumph is forthcoming save from 
 
+P191 
Thy presence, and it is Thine alone to command.  Whatever 
God hath willed hath been, and that which He hath 
not willed shall not be.  
     There is no power nor strength except in God, the Most 
Exalted, the Most Mighty.  
 
 
     O LORD!  Enable all the peoples of the earth to gain 
admittance into the Paradise of Thy Faith, so that no 
created being may remain beyond the bounds of Thy good-pleasure.  
     From time immemorial Thou hast been potent to do 
what pleaseth Thee and transcendent above whatsoever 
Thou desirest.  
 
 
     VOUCHSAFE unto me, O my God, the full measure of 
Thy love and Thy good-pleasure, and through the attractions 
of Thy resplendent light enrapture our hearts, O Thou 
Who art the Supreme Evidence and the All-Glorified.  
Send down upon me, as a token of Thy grace, Thy vitalizing 
breezes, throughout the day-time and in the night season, 
O Lord of bounty.  
     No deed have I done, O my God, to merit beholding 
Thy face, and I know of a certainty that were I to live as 
long as the world lasts I would fail to accomplish any deed 
such as to deserve this favour, inasmuch as the station of a 
servant shall ever fall short of access to Thy holy precincts, 
unless Thy bounty should reach me and Thy tender mercy 
pervade me and Thy loving-kindness encompass me.  
 
+P192 
     All praise be unto Thee, O Thou besides Whom there is 
none other God.  Graciously enable me to ascend unto Thee, 
to be granted the honour of dwelling in Thy nearness and 
to have communion with Thee alone.  No God is there but 
Thee.  
     Indeed shouldst Thou desire to confer blessing upon a 
servant Thou wouldst blot out from the realm of his heart 
every mention or disposition except Thine Own mention; 
and shouldst Thou ordain evil for a servant by reason of 
that which his hands have unjustly wrought before Thy 
face, Thou wouldst test him with the benefits of this world 
and of the next that he might become preoccupied therewith 
and forget Thy remembrance.  
 
 
     GLORY be unto Thee, O Lord, Thou Who hast brought 
into being all created things, through the power of Thy 
behest.  
     O Lord!  Assist those who have renounced all else but 
Thee, and grant them a mighty victory.  Send down upon 
them, O Lord, the concourse of the angels in heaven and 
earth and all that is between, to aid Thy servants, to 
succour and strengthen them, to enable them to achieve 
success, to sustain them, to invest them with glory, to 
confer upon them honour and exaltation, to enrich them 
and to make them triumphant with a wondrous triumph.  
     Thou art their Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the 
earth, the Lord of all the worlds.  Strengthen this Faith, O 
Lord, through the power of these servants and cause them 
to prevail over all the peoples of the world; for they, of a 
truth, are Thy servants who have detached themselves from 
 
+P193 
aught else but Thee, and Thou verily art the protector of 
true believers.  
     Grant Thou, O Lord, that their hearts may, through 
allegiance to this, Thine inviolable Faith, grow stronger 
than anything else in the heavens and on earth and in whatsoever 
is between them; and strengthen, O Lord, their 
hands with the tokens of Thy wondrous power that they 
may manifest Thy power before the gaze of all mankind.  
 
 
     O LORD!  Unto Thee I repair for refuge and toward all 
Thy signs I set my heart.  
     O Lord!  Whether travelling or at home, and in my 
occupation or in my work, I place my whole trust in Thee.  
     Grant me then Thy sufficing help so as to make me 
independent of all things, O Thou Who art unsurpassed in 
Thy mercy!  
     Bestow upon me my portion, O Lord, as Thou pleasest, 
and cause me to be satisfied with whatsoever Thou hast 
ordained for me.  
     Thine is the absolute authority to command.  
 
 
     O LORD!  Thou art the Remover of every anguish and the 
Dispeller of every affliction.  Thou art He Who banisheth 
every sorrow and setteth free every slave, the Redeemer of 
every soul.  O Lord!  Grant deliverance through Thy mercy 
and reckon me among such servants of Thine as have gained 
salvation.  
 
+P194 
     THROUGHOUT eternity Thou hast been, O my Lord, 
and wilt ever remain the One true God, while all else save 
Thee are needy and poor.  Having clung tenaciously to Thy 
Cord, O my God, I have detached myself from all mankind, 
and having set my face towards the habitation of Thy 
tender mercy, I have turned away from all created things.  
Graciously inspire me, O my God, through Thy grace and 
bounty, Thy glory and majesty, and Thy dominion and 
grandeur, for no one mighty and all-knowing can I find 
beside Thee.  Protect me, O my God, through the potency 
of Thy transcendent and all-sufficing glory and by the hosts 
of the heavens and the earth, inasmuch as in no one can I 
wholly place my trust but in Thee and no refuge is there 
but Thee.  
     Thou art God, my Lord, Thou knowest my needs, Thou 
seest my state and art well aware of what hath befallen me 
by reason of Thy decree, and of the earthly sufferings I have 
endured by Thy leave and as a token of Thy bounty and 
favour.  
 
 
     THE glory of glories and the most resplendent light rest 
upon Thee, O my God.  Thy majesty is so transcendent that 
no human imagination can reach it and Thy consummate 
power is so sublime that the birds of men's hearts and minds 
can never attain its heights.  All beings acknowledge their 
powerlessness to praise Thee as beseemeth Thy station.  
Immeasurably exalted art Thou.  No one can glorify Thy 
Being, or fathom the evidences of Thy bounty as it exists 
in Thine inmost Essence, since Thou alone knowest Thyself 
as Thou art in Thyself.  
 
+P195 
     I yield praise unto Thee, O Lord our God, for the bounty 
of having called into being the realm of creation and invention 
--a praise which shineth resplendent through the 
potency of Thine inspiration which none other but Thee 
can befittingly appraise.  I glorify Thee moreover and render 
Thee thanks as beseemeth Thine awe-inspiring presence 
and the glory of Thine overpowering majesty, for this 
sublime blessing, this wondrous sign which is manifest in 
Thy kingdoms of Revelation and Creation.  
     All glory be unto Thee.  Immeasurably exalted is that 
which beseemeth Thee.  Verily no one hath ever adequately 
grasped the loftiness of Thy station, nor hath any one 
except Thee recognized Thee as beseemeth Thee.  Thou 
art manifest through the outpourings of Thy bounty, while 
no one besides Thee can fathom the sublimity of Thy 
Revelation.  
     Magnified be Thy name.  Hath aught else save Thee any 
independent existence so as to be capable of hinting at Thy 
nature, and doth anyone but Thee possess any trace of 
identity wherewith I could recognize Thee?  All that is 
known owes its renown to the splendour of Thy Name, 
the Most Manifest, and every object is deeply stirred by the 
vibrating influence emanating from Thine invincible Will.  
Thou art nearer unto all things than all things.  
     Lauded and glorified art Thou.  Too exalted is Thy loftiness 
for the hands of such as are endued with understanding 
to reach unto Thee, and too profound is Thy fathomless 
depth for the rivers of men's minds and perceptions to flow 
out therefrom.  
 
+P196 
          In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.  
 
     ALL praise be unto God Who was Ever-Existent ere 
created things were called into being, when there was no 
one else besides Him.  He is the One Who hath been Ever-Abiding 
while no element of His creation did yet exist.  
Indeed the souls of them that are endued with understanding 
fail to comprehend the least manifestation of His 
attributes, and the minds of those who have acknowledged 
His unity are unable to perceive the most insignificant 
token of His omnipotence.  
     Sanctified art Thou, O Lord my God.  The tongues of 
men fall short in extolling Thy glorious handiwork, how 
much more then would they falter in lauding the majesty 
of Thy transcendent power; and since human understanding 
is sore perplexed to fathom the mystery of a single 
object of Thy creation, how can anyone ever attain the 
recognition of Thine Own Being?  
     I have known Thee by Thy making known unto me 
that Thou art unknowable to anyone save Thyself.  I have 
become apprised by the creation Thou hast fashioned out of 
sheer non-existence that the way to attain the comprehension 
of Thine Essence is barred to everyone.  Thou art God, 
besides Whom there is none other God.  No one except 
Thine Own Self can comprehend Thy nature.  Thou art 
without peer or partner.  From everlasting Thou hast been 
alone with no one else besides Thee and unto everlasting 
Thou wilt continue to be the same, while no created thing 
shall ever approach Thine exalted position.  
     All men, O my God, confess their powerlessness to know 
Thee as Thou knowest Thine Own Being; the generative 
impulse Thou hast released is manifest throughout the 
entire creation, and all created things which Thou hast 
 
+P197 
fashioned are but expressions of Thy wondrous signs.  
Magnified be Thy name; Thou art immeasurably exalted 
above the strivings of anyone among Thy creatures to 
attain Thy recognition as is befitting and worthy of Thee.  
     Praise be unto Thee!  The way in which Thou hast 
called into being Thy creation out of non-existence preventeth 
all created things from recognizing Thee, and the 
manner in which Thou hast fashioned the creatures, with 
the limitations imposed upon them, proclaimeth their utter 
nothingness before the revelations of Thine attributes.  
     Exalted art Thou, O my God!  All mankind are powerless 
to celebrate Thy glory and the minds of men fall short 
of yielding praise unto Thee.  I bear witness in Thy presence, 
O my God, that Thou art made known by Thy wondrous 
tokens and art recognized through the revelations of Thy 
signs.  The fact that Thou hast brought us forth into existence 
prompteth me to acknowledge before Thee that Thou 
art immeasurably exalted above our praise, and by virtue 
of the qualities wherewith Thou hast endowed our beings 
I testify unto Thee that Thou art transcendent beyond our 
comprehension.  
     Grant that I may soar to the noblest heights in approaching 
Thee, and enable me to draw nigh unto Thee through 
the fragrance of Thy holiness.  Thus may all impediments 
be dissolved by the light of ecstasy, and all remoteness from 
Thee be dissipated by my attainment unto the seats of 
reunion, and the subtle veils which have hindered me 
from entering Thy mansion of glory become so 
rarified that I may gain admittance into Thy presence, take 
up my abode near Thee, and voice the expressions of praise 
wherewith Thou hast described Thine Own Self unto 
me, bearing witness that Thou art God, that there is no 
God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, 
 
+P198 
that Thou dost not beget, neither art Thou begotten, 
that Thou hast no offspring, no partner, nor is 
there any protector against humiliation but Thee, and 
Thou art the Lord of all worlds.  I bear witness also that 
all besides Thee are but Thy creatures, and are held within 
Thy grasp.  No one is favoured with means or liveth in 
want except by Thy Will.  Thou art the King of everlasting 
days and the supreme Ruler.  Thy might is potent 
over all things and all created things exist by Thy Will.  
All mankind recognize their lowly servitude and confess 
their shortcomings and naught is there which doth not 
celebrate Thy praise.  
     I beseech Thee, O my God, by the glory of Thy merciful 
Countenance and by the majesty of Thine ancient Name 
not to deprive me of the vitalizing fragrance of the evidences 
of Thy Days--such Days as Thou Thyself hast inaugurated 
and brought forth.  
 
 
 
          Thou art God, no God is there but Thee.  
 
     LAUDED and glorified art Thou, O Lord my God!  Thou 
art supreme over the realm of being and Thy power pervadeth 
all created things.  Thou holdest the kingdom of 
creation within Thy grasp and dost call into being in conformity 
with Thy pleasure.  
     All praise be unto Thee, O Lord my God!  I beseech 
Thee by such souls as are eagerly waiting at Thy gate and 
by those holy beings who have attained the court of Thy 
presence, to cast upon us the glances of Thy tender compassion 
and to regard us with the eye of Thy loving providence.  
 
+P199 
Cause our souls to be enkindled with the fire of Thy 
tender affection and give us to drink of the living waters of 
Thy bounty.  Keep us steadfast in the path of Thine ardent 
love and enable us to abide within the precincts of Thy 
holiness.  Verily Thou art the Giver, the Most Generous, 
the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.  
     Glorified art Thou, O my God!  I invoke Thee by Thy 
Most Great Name through which the hidden secrets of 
God, the Most Exalted, were divulged and the kindreds of 
all nations converged toward the focal centre of faith and 
certitude, through which Thy luminous Words streamed 
forth for the quickening of mankind and the essence of all 
knowledge was revealed from that Embodiment of bounty.  
May my life, my inmost being, my soul and my body be 
offered up as a sacrifice for the dust ennobled by His footsteps.  
     I earnestly beg Thee, O Lord my God, by Thy most 
glorious Name whereby Thy sovereignty hath been established 
and the tokens of Thy might have been manifested, 
and whereby the oceans of life and of holy ecstasy have 
surged for the reviving of the mouldering bones of all Thy 
creatures and for the stirring of the limbs of such as have 
embraced Thy Cause--I earnestly beg Thee to graciously 
ordain for us the good of this world and of the next, to enable 
us to gain admission into the court of Thy mercy and 
loving-kindness and to kindle in our hearts the fire of joy 
and ecstasy in such wise that the hearts of all men may 
thereby be attracted.  
     Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Protector, the 
Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.  
 
+P200 
     GLORY be unto Thee, O Lord my God!  I beg Thee to 
forgive me and those who support Thy Faith.  Verily Thou 
art the sovereign Lord, the Forgiver, the Most Generous.  
O my God!  Enable such servants of Thine as are deprived 
of knowledge to be admitted into Thy Cause; for once they 
learn of Thee, they bear witness to the truth of the Day of 
Judgement and do not dispute the revelations of Thy 
bounty.  Send down upon them the tokens of Thy grace 
and grant them, wherever they reside, a liberal share of that 
which Thou hast ordained for the pious among Thy 
servants.  Thou art in truth the Supreme Ruler, the All-Bounteous, 
the Most Benevolent.  
     O my God!  Let the outpourings of Thy bounty and 
blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have embraced 
Thy Faith, as a token of Thy grace and as a mark of 
loving-kindness from Thy presence.  Verily unsurpassed art 
Thou in granting forgiveness.  Should Thy bounty be withheld 
from anyone, how could he be reckoned among the 
followers of the Faith in Thy Day?  
     Bless me, O my God, and those who will believe in Thy 
signs on the appointed Day, and such as cherish my love 
in their hearts--a love which Thou dost instil into them.  
Verily Thou art the Lord of righteousness, the Most 
Exalted.  
 
 
     IMMEASURABLY exalted art Thou, O my God, above the 
endeavours of all beings and created things to praise Thee 
and recognize Thee.  No creature can ever comprehend 
Thee as beseemeth the reality of Thy holy Being and no 
servant can ever worship Thee as is worthy of Thine unknowable 
 
+P201 
Essence.  Praise be unto Thee; too high is Thine 
exalted Self for any allusions proceeding from Thy creatures 
ever to gain access unto Thy presence.  
     Whenever, O my God, I soared into Thy holy atmosphere 
and attained the inmost spirit of prayerfulness unto 
Thee, I was led to recognize that Thou art inaccessible and 
that no mention of Thee can ever reach Thy transcendent 
court.  Therefore I turn towards Thy Loved Ones--They 
upon Whom Thou hast graciously conferred Thine Own 
station that They might manifest Thy love and Thy true 
knowledge.  Bless Them then, O my God, with every 
distinction and goodly gift which Thy knowledge may 
reckon within the domain of Thy power.  
     O my God, my Lord and my Master!  I swear by Thy 
might and glory that Thou alone and no one else besides 
Thee art the ultimate Desire of all men, and that Thou 
alone and none other save Thee art the Object of adoration.  
O my God!  The paths of Thine inaccessible glory have 
prompted me to voice these words and the ways of Thine 
unattainable heights have guided me to make these allusions.  
Exalted art Thou, O my God!  The evidences of Thy 
revelation are too manifest for me to need to refer to aught 
else save Thyself, and the love I cherish for Thee is far 
sweeter to my taste than the knowledge of all things and 
freeth me from the need to seek anyone's knowledge other 
than Thine.  
     All praise be unto Thee, O my Lord.  I verily believe in Thee, 
as Thou art in Thyself; and of Thee, as Thou art in Thyself, 
I beg forgiveness for myself and on behalf of all mankind.  
     O my God!  Wholly have I fled unto Thy face and have 
cast myself before Thee and no power have I over aught in 
Thy holy presence.  Shouldst Thou chastise me with Thy 
might, Thou wouldst assuredly be just in Thy decree; and 
 
+P202 
wert Thou to bestow every goodly gift on me, Thou 
wouldst indeed be most generous and bountiful.  Verily 
Thou art independent of all the peoples of the world.  
     I have sought reunion with Thee, O my Master, yet 
have I failed to attain thereto save through the knowledge of 
detachment from aught save Thee.  I have yearned for Thy 
love, but failed to find it except in renouncing everything 
other than Thyself.  I have been eager to worship Thee, yet 
have I failed to achieve Thy adoration, except by loving 
those who cherish Thy love.  No one do I recognize, O my 
God, except Thee.  Thou art incomparable and hast no 
partner.  Thou alone knowest our shortcomings and none 
other hath this knowledge.  I beg Thy forgiveness for whatever 
doth displease Thee.  
     I call upon Thee at all times with the tongue of Thine 
inspiration, saying:  `Thou art in truth the All-Possessing, 
the Peerless.  No God is there but Thee.  Immeasurably far 
and exalted art Thou above the descriptions of those who 
arrogantly assign peers unto Thee.'  
 
 
     ALL majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion and 
light and grandeur and splendour be unto Thee.  Thou 
bestowest sovereignty on whom Thou willest and dost 
withhold it from whom Thou desirest.  No God is there but 
Thee, the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.  Thou art He 
Who createth from naught the universe and all that dwell 
therein.  There is nothing worthy of Thee except Thyself, 
while all else but Thee are as outcasts in Thy holy presence 
and are as nothing when compared to the glory of Thine 
Own Being.  
 
+P203 
     Far be it from me to extol Thy virtues save by what 
Thou hast extolled Thyself in Thy weighty Book where 
Thou sayest, `No vision taketh in Him but He taketh in all 
vision.  He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.'+F1  Glory be 
unto Thee, O my God, indeed no mind or vision, however 
keen or discriminating, can ever grasp the nature of 
the most insignificant of Thy signs.  Verily Thou art God, 
no God is there besides Thee.  I bear witness that Thou 
Thyself alone art the sole expression of Thine attributes, 
that the praise of no one besides Thee can ever attain to 
Thy holy court nor can Thine attributes ever be fathomed 
by anyone other than Thyself.  
     Glory be unto Thee, Thou art exalted above the 
description of anyone save Thyself, since it is beyond 
human conception to befittingly magnify Thy virtues or to 
comprehend the inmost reality of Thine Essence.  Far be it 
from Thy glory that Thy creatures should describe Thee 
or that any one besides Thyself should ever know Thee.  I 
have known Thee, O my God, by reason of Thy making 
Thyself known unto me, for hadst Thou not revealed Thyself 
unto me, I would not have known Thee.  I worship 
Thee by virtue of Thy summoning me unto Thee, for had 
it not been for Thy summons I would not have worshipped 
Thee.  Lauded art Thou, O my God, my trespasses have 
waxed mighty and my sins have assumed grievous proportions.  
How disgraceful my plight will prove to be in 
Thy holy presence.  I have failed to know Thee to the 
extent Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me; I have failed to 
worship Thee with a devotion worthy of Thy summons; 
I have failed to obey Thee through not treading the path of 
Thy love in the manner Thou didst inspire me.  
     Thy might beareth me witness, O my God, what 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 6:103  
 
+P204 
befitteth Thee is far greater and more exalted than any 
being could attempt to accomplish.  Indeed nothing can 
ever comprehend Thee as is worthy of Thee nor can any 
servile creature worship Thee as beseemeth Thine adoration.  
So perfect and comprehensive is Thy proof, O my 
God, that its inner essence transcendeth the description of 
any soul and so abundant are the outpourings of Thy gifts 
that no faculty can appraise their infinite range.  
     O my God!  O my Master!  I beseech Thee by Thy manifold 
bounties and by the pillars which sustain Thy throne 
of glory, to have pity on these lowly people who are 
powerless to bear the unpleasant things of this fleeting life, 
how much less then can they bear Thy chastisement in the 
life to come--a chastisement which is ordained by Thy 
justice, called forth by Thy wrath and will continue to 
exist for ever.  
     I beg Thee by Thyself, O my God, my Lord and my 
Master, to intercede in my behalf.  I have fled from Thy 
justice unto Thy mercy.  For my refuge I am seeking Thee 
and such as turn not away from Thy path, even for a 
twinkling of an eye--they for whose sake Thou didst 
create the creation as a token of Thy grace and bounty.  
 
 
     O MY God!  There is no one but Thee to allay the anguish 
of my soul, and Thou art my highest aspiration, O my 
God.  My heart is wedded to none save Thee and such as 
Thou dost love.  I solemnly declare that my life and death 
are both for Thee.  Verily Thou art incomparable and hast 
no partner.  
     O my Lord!  I beg Thee to forgive me for shutting myself 
 
+P205 
out from Thee.  By Thy glory and majesty, I have 
failed to befittingly recognize Thee and to worship Thee, 
while Thou dost make Thyself known unto me and callest 
me to remembrance as beseemeth Thy station.  Grievous 
woe would betide me, O my Lord, wert Thou to take hold 
of me by reason of my misdeeds and trespasses.  No helper 
do I know of other than Thee.  No refuge do I have to flee 
to save Thee.  None among Thy creatures can dare to 
intercede with Thyself without Thy leave.  I hold fast to 
Thy love before Thy court, and, according to Thy bidding, 
I earnestly pray unto Thee as befitteth Thy glory.  I beg 
Thee to heed my call as Thou hast promised me.  Verily 
Thou art God; no God is there but Thee.  Alone and unaided, 
Thou art independent of all created things.  Neither 
can the devotion of Thy lovers profit Thee, nor the evil 
doings of the faithless harm Thee.  Verily Thou art my 
God, He Who will never fail in His promise.  
     O my God!  I beseech Thee by the evidences of Thy 
favour, to let me draw nigh to the sublime heights of Thy 
holy presence, and protect me from inclining myself toward 
the subtle allusions of aught else but Thee.  Guide my 
steps, O my God, unto that which is acceptable and pleasing 
to Thee.  Shield me, through Thy might, from the fury 
of Thy wrath and chastisement, and hold me back from 
entering habitations not desired by Thee.  
 
 
     O MY God!  I have failed to know Thee as is worthy of 
Thy glory, and I have failed to fear Thee as befitteth my 
station.  How can I make mention of Thee when I am in 
this condition, and how can I set my face towards Thee 
 
+P206 
when I have fallen short of my duty in worshipping Thee?  
     Thou didst not call me into being to demonstrate the 
potency of Thy might which is unmistakably manifest and 
evident; for Thou art God Who everlastingly existed when 
there was naught.  Rather Thou didst create us through Thy 
transcendent power that a bare mention may be graciously 
made of us before the resplendent manifestation of Thy 
Remembrance.  
     I have no knowledge of Thee, O my God, but that 
which Thou hast taught me whereby I might recognize 
Thy Self--a knowledge which reflecteth only my failure 
and sinfulness.  Here am I then, O my God, wholly consecrated 
unto Thee, willing to do what Thou desirest.  
Humbly I cast myself before the revelations of Thy mercy, 
confessing that Thou art God, no God is there but Thee, and 
that Thou art incomparable, hast no partner and naught is 
there like Thee.  Unto this Thou Thyself bearest witness, as 
well becometh Thy glory.  
 
 
 
          He is God, the Sovereign Ruler, the Ever-Living, 
                  He Whose help all men implore.  
 
     LAUDED and glorified art Thou, O Lord!  Both the world 
of existence and the souls of men bear witness that Thou 
art transcendent above the revelations of Thy handiwork, 
and the bearers of Thy names and attributes proclaim that 
Thou art immeasurably exalted above such praise as the 
dwellers of the dominions of creation and invention may 
render unto Thee.  All appearances and realities indicate the 
oneness of Thine Essence, and all evidences and signs reflect 
 
+P207 
the truth that Thou art God and there is no peer or partner 
for Thee throughout the kingdoms of heaven and earth.  
     Immensely high and sanctified art Thou, O Lord!  Thy 
divine Being testifieth that Thou art inscrutable to all that 
dwell in Thy realm of existence, and Thine inmost Essence 
proclaimeth that Thou art far above the description of those 
who reveal Thy glory.  
     The signs which the sanctified essences reveal and the 
words which the exalted realities express and the allusions 
manifested by the ethereal entities all proclaim that Thou 
art immeasurably exalted above the reach of the embodiments 
of the realm of being, and all solemnly affirm that 
Thou art immensely high above the description of such as 
are wrapt in the veils of fancy.  
     Praise be unto Thee, O Lord!  Thy divine Being is a sure 
testimony of the oneness of Thine inmost Essence and Thy 
supreme divinity beareth witness to the unity of Thy Self, 
and the realities of all created things testify that no tie of 
intercourse bindeth Thee to anything in the kingdom of 
creation which Thou hast fashioned.  
     Every man of perception who hath scaled the noble 
heights of detachment, and every man of eloquence who 
hath attained the most sublime station, beareth witness that 
Thou art God, the Incomparable, and that Thou hast assigned 
no associate unto Thyself in the kingdom of creation, 
nor is there anyone to compare with Thee in the realm of 
invention.  Men of wisdom, who had but a notion of the 
revelation of Thy glory, conceived a likeness of Thee according 
to their own understanding, and men of erudition, 
who had gained but a glimpse of the manifold evidences of 
Thy loving-kindness and glory, have contrived peers for 
Thee in conformity with their own imaginations.  
     Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou, O Lord!  
 
+P208 
Every man of insight is far astray in his attempt to recognize 
Thee, and every man of consummate learning is sore 
perplexed in his search after Thee.  Every evidence falleth 
short of Thine unknowable Essence and every light retreateth 
and sinketh below the horizon when confronted 
with but a glimmer of the dazzling splendour of Thy might.  
     Bestow on me, O my Lord, Thy gracious bounty and 
benevolent gifts and grant me that which beseemeth the 
sublimity of Thy glory.  Aid me, O my Lord, to achieve a 
singular victory.  Open Thou the door of unfailing success 
before me and grant that the things Thou hast promised 
may be close at hand.  Thou art in truth potent over all 
things.  Refresh my heart, O my God, with the living 
waters of Thy love and give me a draught, O my Master, 
from the chalice of Thy tender mercy.  Let me abide, O my 
Lord, within the habitation of Thy glory, and suffer me, 
O my God, to emerge from the darkness in which Thy 
divine obscurity is shrouded.  Enable me to partake of every 
good Thou hast vouchsafed unto Him Who is the Point 
and unto such as are the exponents of His Cause, and ordain 
for me that which beseemeth Thee and well becometh Thy 
station.  Do Thou graciously forgive me for the things that 
I have wrought in Thy holy presence, and look not upon 
me with the glance of justice, but rather deliver me through 
Thy grace, treat me with Thy mercy and deal with me 
according to Thy bountiful favours, as is worthy of Thy 
glory.  
     Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Glorious, the 
Bestower of favours and gifts, the Lord of grace abounding.  
Verily no God is there but Thee.  Thou art the All-Possessing, 
the Most High.  
     Sanctified art Thou, O Lord, Thou unto Whom all 
render thanksgiving.  Whatever I may affirm of Thee 
 
+P209 
would be but a wanton crime before Thee, and whatever 
mention I may choose to make of Thee would be the 
essence of transgression, and whatever the praise whereby 
I may glorify Thee, it would amount to sheer blasphemy.  
No one else besides Thee hath been or will ever be able to 
fathom Thy mystery, neither hath any one succeeded nor 
will anyone succeed at any time in discovering Thine 
Essence.  
     Magnified art Thou!  No God is there but Thee.  Thou 
art in truth the Supreme Ruler, the Help in Peril, the Most 
High, the Incomparable, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.  
Verily Thou art mighty in Thy prowess, the 
Lord of transcendent glory and majesty.  
     Protect Thou, O God, whosoever learneth this prayer 
by heart and reciteth it in the day-time and in the night 
season.  Verily Thou art God, the Lord of creation, the All-Sufficing.  
Thou art faithful to Thy promise and doest whatsoever 
Thou pleasest.  Thou art the One Who holdeth in 
His hands the dominions of earth and heaven.  Verily Thou 
art the Almighty, the Inaccessible, the Help in Peril, the 
All-Compelling.  
 
 
     O MY God, my Lord and my Master!  I have detached 
myself from my kindred and have sought through Thee to 
become independent of all that dwell on earth and ever 
ready to receive that which is praiseworthy in Thy sight.  
Bestow on me such good as will make me independent of 
aught else but Thee, and grant me an ampler share of Thy 
boundless favours.  Verily Thou art the Lord of grace 
abounding.  
 
+P210 
     I ADJURE Thee by Thy might, O my God!  Let no harm 
beset me in times of tests, and in moments of heedlessness 
guide my steps aright through Thine inspiration.  Thou art 
God, potent art Thou to do what Thou desirest.  No one 
can withstand Thy Will or thwart Thy Purpose.  
 
 
     I BEG Thy forgiveness, O my God, and implore pardon 
after the manner Thou wishest Thy servants to direct themselves 
to Thee.  I beg of Thee to wash away our sins as 
befitteth Thy Lordship, and to forgive me, my parents, and 
those who in Thy estimation have entered the abode of 
Thy love in a manner which is worthy of Thy transcendent 
sovereignty and well beseemeth the glory of Thy celestial 
power.  
     O my God!  Thou hast inspired my soul to offer its 
supplication to Thee, and but for Thee, I would not call 
upon Thee.  Lauded and glorified art Thou; I yield Thee 
praise inasmuch as Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me, and 
I beg Thee to forgive me, since I have fallen short in my 
duty to know Thee and have failed to walk in the path of 
Thy love.  
 
 
     LAUDED be Thy Name, O Lord our God!  Thou art in 
truth the Knower of things unseen.  Ordain for us such 
good as Thine all-embracing knowledge can measure.  
Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the Best 
Beloved.  
 
+P211 
     All praise be unto Thee, O Lord!  We shall seek Thy 
grace on the appointed Day and shall put our whole 
reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord.  Glorified art Thou, O 
God!  Grant us that which is good and seemly that we may 
be able to dispense with everything but Thee.  Verily Thou 
art the Lord of all worlds.  
     O God!  Recompense those who endure patiently in Thy 
days and strengthen their hearts to walk undeviatingly in 
the path of Truth.  Grant then, O Lord, such goodly gifts as 
would enable them to gain admittance into Thy blissful 
Paradise.  Exalted art Thou, O Lord God.  Let Thy heavenly 
blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have believed 
in Thee.  Verily, unsurpassed art Thou in sending down 
divine blessings.  Send forth, O God, such hosts as would 
render Thy faithful servants victorious.  Thou dost fashion 
the created things through the power of Thy decree as 
Thou pleasest.  Thou art in truth the Sovereign, the 
Creator, the All-Wise.  
     Say:  God is indeed the Maker of all things.  He giveth 
sustenance in plenty to whomsoever He willeth.  He is the 
Creator, the Source of all beings, the Fashioner, the Almighty, 
the Maker, the All-Wise.  He is the Bearer of the 
most excellent titles throughout the heavens and the earth 
and whatever lieth between them.  All do His bidding, and 
all the dwellers of earth and heaven celebrate His praise, 
and unto Him shall all return.  
 
 
     THROUGH Thy revelation, O my God, Thou hast enabled 
me to know Thee, and through the radiance of Thine 
effulgent splendour Thou hast inspired me with Thy 
 
+P212 
remembrance.  Thou art the One nearest to me with naught 
else between Thee and me, and Thou art the One Whose 
power nothing whatsoever can frustrate.  Far be it then 
from Thine Essence that the mightiest birds of the souls of 
men or of human imaginings should ever scale its heights, 
and too exalted is Thy holy Being for the loftiest sentiments 
of men of understanding to attain unto Thee.  From 
everlasting no one hath comprehended Thine Own Self, 
and unto everlasting Thou shalt remain what Thou hast 
been since time immemorial with no one else besides Thee.  
     Magnified be Thy Name, Thou art the Best Beloved 
Who hast enabled me to know Thee and Thou art that All-Renowned 
One Who hast graciously favoured me with 
Thy love.  Thou art the Ancient of Days Whom none can 
ever describe through the evidences of Thy glory and 
majesty, and Thou art the mighty One Whom none can 
ever comprehend through the revelations of Thy greatness 
and beauty, inasmuch as the expressions of majesty and 
grandeur and the attributes of dominion and beauty are 
but the tokens of Thy divine Will and the effulgent reflections 
of Thy sovereignty which, by reason of their very 
essence and nature, proclaim that the way is barred and bear 
witness that the pathway is inaccessibly beyond the reach 
of men.  
 
 
 
          In the Name of Thy Lord, the Creator, the Sovereign, the 
     All-Sufficing, the Most Exalted, He Whose help is implored 
     by all men.  
 
     SAY:  O my God!  O Thou Who art the Maker of the 
 
+P213 
heavens and of the earth, O Lord of the Kingdom!  Thou 
well knowest the secrets of my heart, while Thy Being is 
inscrutable to all save Thyself.  Thou seest whatsoever is of 
me, while no one else can do this save Thee.  Vouchsafe 
unto me, through Thy grace, what will enable me to 
dispense with all except Thee, and destine for me that which 
will make me independent of everyone else besides Thee.  
Grant that I may reap the benefit of my life in this world 
and in the next.  Open to my face the portals of Thy grace 
and graciously confer upon me Thy tender mercy and 
bestowals.  
     O Thou Who art the Lord of grace abounding!  Let Thy 
celestial aid surround those who love Thee and bestow 
upon us the gifts and the bounties Thou dost possess.  Be 
Thou sufficient unto us of all things, forgive our sins and 
have mercy upon us.  Thou art Our Lord and the Lord of 
all created things.  No one else do we invoke but Thee and 
naught do we beseech but Thy favours.  Thou art the Lord 
of bounty and grace, invincible in Thy power and the most 
skilful in Thy designs.  No God is there but Thee, the All-Possessing, 
the Most Exalted.  
     Confer Thy blessings, O my Lord, upon the Messengers, 
the holy ones and the righteous.  Verily Thou art God, the 
Peerless, the All-Compelling.  
 
 
     GLORIFIED art Thou, O Lord my God!  Thou art in truth 
the King of kings.  Thou dost confer sovereignty upon 
whomsoever Thou willest and dost seize it from whomsoever 
Thou willest.  Thou dost exalt whomsoever Thou 
willest and dost abase whomsoever Thou willest.  Thou dost 
 
+P214 
render victorious whomsoever Thou willest and dost bring 
humiliation upon whomsoever Thou willest.  Thou dost bestow 
wealth upon whomsoever Thou willest and dost reduce 
to poverty whomsoever Thou willest.  Thou dost cause 
whomsoever Thou willest to prevail over whomsoever 
Thou willest.  Within Thy grasp Thou dost hold the empire 
of all created things and through the potency of Thy 
sovereign behest Thou dost call into being whomsoever 
Thou willest.  Verily Thou art the Omniscient, the Omnipotent, 
the Lord of power.  
 
 
     PRAISED and glorified art Thou, O God!  Grant that the 
day of attaining Thy holy presence may be fast approaching.  
Cheer our hearts through the potency of Thy love and 
good-pleasure and bestow upon us steadfastness that we 
may willingly submit to Thy Will and Thy Decree.  Verily 
Thy knowledge embraceth all the things Thou hast created 
or wilt create and Thy celestial might transcendeth whatsoever 
Thou hast called or wilt call into being.  There is none 
to be worshipped but Thee, there is none to be desired 
except Thee, there is none to be adored besides Thee and 
there is naught to be loved save Thy good-pleasure.  
     Verily Thou art the supreme Ruler, the Sovereign Truth, 
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  
 
 
     THOU knowest full well, O my God, that tribulations 
have showered upon me from all directions and that no one 
 
+P215 
can dispel or transmute them except Thee.  I know of a 
certainty, by virtue of my love for Thee, that Thou wilt 
never cause tribulations to befall any soul unless Thou 
desirest to exalt his station in Thy celestial Paradise and to 
buttress his heart in this earthly life with the bulwark of 
Thine all-compelling power, that it may not become 
inclined toward the vanities of this world.  Indeed Thou art 
well aware that under all conditions I would cherish the 
remembrance of Thee far more than the ownership of all 
that is in the heavens and on the earth.  
     Strengthen my heart, O my God, in Thine obedience 
and in Thy love and grant that I may be clear of the entire 
company of Thine adversaries.  Verily I swear by Thy glory 
that I yearn for naught besides Thyself, nor do I desire anything 
except Thy mercy, nor am I apprehensive of aught 
save Thy justice.  I beg Thee to forgive me as well as those 
whom Thou lovest, howsoever Thou pleasest.  Verily Thou 
art the Almighty, the Bountiful.  
     Immensely exalted art Thou, O Lord of the heavens and 
earth, above the praise of all men, and may peace be upon 
Thy faithful servants and glory be unto God, the Lord of all 
the worlds.  
 
 
     PRAISE be to Thee, O Lord, my Best Beloved!  Make me 
steadfast in Thy Cause and grant that I may be reckoned 
among those who have not violated Thy Covenant nor 
followed the gods of their own idle fancy.  Enable me, then, 
to obtain a seat of truth in Thy presence, bestow upon me a 
token of Thy mercy and let me join with such of Thy 
servants as shall have no fear nor shall they be put to grief.  
 
+P216 
Abandon me not to myself, O my Lord, nor deprive me of 
recognizing Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine Own 
Self, nor account me with such as have turned away from 
Thy holy presence.  Number me, O my God, with those 
who are privileged to fix their gaze upon Thy Beauty and 
who take such delight therein that they would not exchange 
a single moment thereof with the sovereignty of 
the kingdom of heavens and earth or with the entire realm 
of creation.  Have mercy on me, O Lord, in these days 
when the peoples of Thine earth have erred grievously; 
supply me then, O my God, with that which is good and 
seemly in Thine estimation.  Thou art verily the All-Powerful, 
the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving.  
     Grant, O my God, that I may not be reckoned among 
those whose ears are deaf, whose eyes are blind, whose 
tongues are speechless and whose hearts have failed to 
comprehend.  Deliver me, O Lord, from the fire of ignorance 
and of selfish desire, suffer me to be admitted into the 
precincts of Thy transcendent mercy and send down upon 
me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones.  
Potent art Thou to do what Thou willest.  Verily Thou art 
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  
 
 
     O MY God, O my Lord, O my Master!  I beg Thee to 
forgive me for seeking any pleasure save Thy love, or any 
comfort except Thy nearness, or any delight besides Thy 
good-pleasure, or any existence other than communion 
with Thee.  
 
+P217 
     THOU seest, O my Lord, my dwelling-place in the heart 
of this mountain and Thou dost witness my forbearance.  
Verily I have desired naught else but Thy love and the love 
of those who love Thee.  How can I extol the effulgent 
beauty of Thy Lordship, conscious as I am of my nothingness 
before the habitation of Thy glory?  Yet the sorrow of 
solitude and loneliness prompteth me to invoke Thee 
through this prayer, perchance Thy trusted servants may 
become aware of my lamentations, may supplicate unto 
Thee on my behalf, and Thou wouldst graciously answer 
their prayers as a token of Thy grace and Thy favour.  I 
bear witness that there is no God but Thee, inasmuch as 
Thou art invested with sovereignty, grandeur, glory and 
power which no one among Thy servants can visualize or 
comprehend.  Indeed Thou shalt, by virtue of that which is 
inherent in Thine Essence, ever remain inscrutable unto all 
except Thyself.  
 
 
     IS there any Remover of difficulties save God?  Say:  Praised 
be God!  He is God!  All are His servants and all abide by 
His bidding!
