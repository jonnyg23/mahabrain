                      I.  THE &amp;BAHA'I CONCEPT OF EQUALITY


Extracts From the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah:


     O Children of Men!  Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust?
That no one should exalt himself over the other.  Ponder at all times in your
hearts how ye were created.  Since We have created you all from one same
substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with the same
feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost
being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of
detachment may be made manifest.  Such is My counsel to you, O concourse of
light!  Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtain the fruit of holiness from the
tree of wondrous glory.
          ("The Hidden Words of &amp;Baha'u'llah", Arabic no. 68, rev. ed.
           (Wilmette:  &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 20)              [1]


     Exalted, immensely exalted is He Who hath removed differences and
established harmony.  Glorified, infinitely glorified is He Who hath caused
discord to cease, and decreed solidarity and unity.  Praised be God, the Pen of
the Most High hath lifted distinctions from between His servants and
handmaidens, and, through His consummate favours and all-encompassing mercy,
hath conferred upon all a station and rank of the same plane.  He hath broken
the back of vain imaginings with the sword of utterance and hath obliterated
the perils of idle fancies through the pervasive power of His might.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                     [2]


     This Wronged One hath heard thy voice and that which thy inner and outer
tongue hath uttered in praise of thy Lord.  By the righteousness of God!  That
which the people possess, and the treasures of the earth, and that which the
rulers and kings own, are not equal in this day to the singing of His praise.
The Lord of the Kingdom beareth witness unto this at this glorious moment.  And
having heard thy groaning and lamentation, We are responding with a Tablet
which calleth out betwixt earth and heaven and maketh mention of thee with
words that immortalize what hath appeared from thee in His love, in His
service, in His remembrance and in His praise.  And He hath made that which
hath issued forth from thy mouth a trust with Him for thee.  He is verily the
Most Bounteous, the Most Generous. If thou truly givest ear to that which hath
been revealed for thee from My Supreme Pen at this moment, thou shalt soar with
the wings of eagerness in the heaven of love for the Lord of the Day of the
+P 4

Covenant, and wilt say during all the days of thy life:  Thanks be unto Thee, O
Thou the Desire of the world, and praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of
the people of understanding.  May all existence be a sacrifice for Thy favour,
and all that hath been and will ever be, a ransom for Thy Word, O Thou the
Wronged One amongst the people of enmity, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins
of all who are in heaven and on earth....

     In this Day the Hand of divine grace hath removed all distinctions.  The
servants of God and His handmaidens are regarded on the same plane.  Blessed is
the servant who hath attained unto that which God hath decreed, and likewise
the leaf moving in accordance with the breezes of His will.  This favour is
great and this station lofty.  His bounties and bestowals are ever present and
manifest.  Who is able to offer befitting gratitude for His successive
bestowals and continuous favours?
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)          [3]


     By My Life!  The names of handmaidens who are devoted to God are written
and set down by the Pen of the Most High in the Crimson Book.  They excel over
men in the sight of God.  How numerous are the heroes and knights in the field
who are bereft of the True One and have no share in His recognition, but thou
hast attained and received thy fill.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                     [4]


     Verily the Pen of the Most High hath borne witness unto thy recognition of
Him, thy love for Him and thy turning towards the Ancient Countenance at a time
when the world hath rejected Him, save those whom God, the Most High, hath
willed....

Well is it with thee for having adorned thyself with the ornament of the love
of God and for having been enabled to make mention of Him and utter His praise.
Divine grace, in its entirety, is in the mighty grasp of God, exalted be He.
He conferreth it upon whomsoever He willeth.  How many a man considered himself
a celebrated divine and a repository of heavenly mysteries, and yet when the
slightest test visited him, he arose with such opposition and denial as to
cause the Concourse on high to moan and lament.  Through the bestowals of the
Lord, however, and His infinite favour, thou hast attained unto the hidden
secret and the well-guarded treasure.  Preserve then, in the name of God, this
lofty station and conceal it from the eyes of betrayers.  The glory shining
from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who hath
attained the splendours of My sublime Throne.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)          [5]

We beseech God to aid all the leaves to attain the knowledge of the Tree and
deprive them not of the ocean of His generosity.  In this day no regard is paid
to loftiness or lowliness, to poverty or wealth, to nobility and lineage, to
weakness or might.  Whosoever recognizeth the incomparable Beloved is the
possessor of true wealth and occupieth a divine station.  Today, in the court
of the True One, the queen of the world and her like are not worth a mustard
seed, because although she may speak in the name of God, invoke the Lord of
creation every day in the temple of her body, and spend large sums of earthly
wealth for the development of her nation, she is deprived of recognition of the
Sun of His Manifestation and is barred from the True One in Whose remembrance
she is engaged....
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)          [6]


     Throughout the centuries and ages many a man hath waited expectant for
God's Revelation, and yet when the Light shone forth from the horizon of the
world, all but a few turned their faces away from it.  Whosoever from amongst
the handmaidens hath recognized the Lord of all Names is recorded in the Book
as one of those men by the Pen of the Most High.  Offer thou praise to the
Beloved of the world for having aided thee to recognize the Dayspring of His
Signs and the Revealer of the evidences of His Glory.  This is a great bounty,
a bounteous favour.  Preserve it in the name of the True One....

Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:


From the beginning of existence until the Promised Day men retained superiority
over women in every respect.  It is revealed in the &amp;Qur'an:  "Men have
superiority over women." But in this wondrous Dispensation, the supreme
outpouring of the Glorious Lord became the cause of manifest achievements by
women.  Some handmaidens arose who excelled men in the arena of knowledge.
They arose with such love and spirituality that they became the cause of the
outpouring of the bounty of the Sovereign Lord upon mankind, and with their
sanctity, purity and attributes of the spirit led a great many to the shore of
unity.  They became a guiding torch to the wanderers in the wastes of
bewilderment, and enkindled the despondent in the nether world with the flame
of the love of the Lord.  This is a bounteous characteristic of this wondrous
Age which hath granted strength to the weaker sex and hath bestowed masculine
might upon womanhood....
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                     [8]

+P 6

     O handmaid of God!  In this wondrous dispensation in which the Ancient
Beauty and the Manifest Light -- may my spirit be sacrificed for His loved ones
-- hath risen from the horizon of age-old hopes, women have assumed the
attributes of men in showing forth steadfastness in the Cause of God, and
revealing the heroism and might of fearless men.  They invaded the arena of
mystic knowledge and hoisted aloft the banner on the heights of certitude.
Thou, too, must make a mighty effort and show forth supreme courage.  Exert
thyself and taste of the sweetness of a heavenly draught, for the sweet taste
of the love of God will linger on to the end that hath no end.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                     [9]


     Render thanks to the Lord that among that race thou art the first
believer,+F1 that thou hast engaged in spreading sweet-scented breezes, and hast
arisen to guide others.  It is my hope that through the bounties and favours of
the &amp;Abha Beauty thy countenance may be illumined, thy disposition pleasing,
and thy fragrance diffused, that thine eyes may be seeing, thine ears
attentive, thy tongue eloquent, thy heart filled with supreme glad-tidings, and
thy soul refreshed by divine fragrances, so that thou mayest arise among that
race and occupy thyself with the edification of the people, and become filled
with light.  Although the pupil of the eye is black, it is the source of light.
Thou shalt likewise be.  The disposition should be bright, not the appearance.
Therefore, with supreme confidence and certitude, say:  "O God!  Make me a
radiant light, a shining lamp, and a brilliant star, so that I may illumine the
hearts with an effulgent ray from Thy Kingdom of &amp;Abha...."
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                    [10]


The establishment of a women's assemblage for the promotion of knowledge is
entirely acceptable, but discussions must be confined to educational matters.
It should be done in such a way that differences will, day by day, be entirely
wiped out, not that, God forbid, it will end in argumentation between men and
women.  As in the question of the veil, nothing should be done contrary to
wisdom.  The individual women should, today, follow a course of action which
will be the cause of eternal glory to all womankind, so that all women will be
illumined.  And that lieth in gathering to learn how to teach, in holding

1.   This  Tablet was addressed to one Mrs. Pocohontas in Washington.
     According to &amp;Fadil &amp;Mazandarani, the recipient of the Tablet was
     a black woman.  See "&amp;Tarikh-i-Zuhuru'l-Haq", vol. 8, part 2,
     p. 1209 (&amp;Tihran:  &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust, 132 B.E.).  Additional
     information provided by the Archives of the National Spiritual
     Assembly of the United States indicates that Mr. Louis Gregory, in a
     history of the Washington, D.C. &amp;Baha'i community, mentions a black
     &amp;Baha'i, Mrs. Pocohontas Pope, who is likely the same person.
     Mrs. Pope learned of the &amp;Baha'i Faith through Alma and Fanny
     Knobloch and Joseph and Pauline Hannen.  There is, at present no
     other information on Mrs. Pope.

meetings to recite the verses, to offer supplications to the kingdom of the
Lord of evident signs, and to institute education for the girls.  Ponder the
manner in which &amp;Jinab-i-Tahirih used to teach.  She was free from every
concern, and for this reason she was resplendent.

     Now the world of women should be a spiritual world, not a political one,
so that it will be radiant.  The women of other nations are all immersed in
political matters.  Of what benefit is this, and what fruit doth it yield?  To
the extent that ye can, ye should busy yourselves with spiritual matters which
will be conducive to the exaltation of the Word of God and of the diffusion of
His fragrances.  Your demeanour should lead to harmony amongst all and to
coalescence and the good-pleasure of all....

     I am endeavouring, with &amp;Baha'u'llah's confirmations and assistance, so
to improve the world of the handmaidens that all will be astonished.  This
progress is intended to be in spirituality, in virtues, in human perfections
and in divine knowledge.  In America, the cradle of women's liberation, women
are still debarred from political institutions because they squabble.  They are
yet to have a member in the House of Representatives.  Also &amp;Baha'u'llah hath
proclaimed:  "O ye men of the House of Justice." Ye need to be calm and
composed, so that the work will proceed with wisdom, otherwise there will be
such chaos that ye will leave everything and run away. "This newly born babe is
traversing in one night the path that needeth a hundred years to tread." In
brief, ye should now engage in matters of pure spirituality and not contend
with men.  `Abdu'l-Baha will tactfully take appropriate steps.  Be assured.  In
the end thou wilt thyself exclaim, "This was indeed supreme wisdom!" I appeal
to you to obliterate this contention between men and women....

     No one can on his own achieve anything.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha must be well
pleased and assist.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                    [11]


     Know thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of &amp;Baha, women are accounted the
same as men, and God hath created all humankind in His own image, and after His
own likeness.  That is, men and women alike are the revealers of His names and
attributes, and from the spiritual viewpoint there is no difference between
them.  Whosoever draweth nearer to God, that one is the most favoured, whether
man or woman.  How many a handmaid, ardent and devoted, hath, within the
sheltering shade of &amp;Baha, proved superior to the men, and surpassed the
famous of the earth.

     The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the Law
of God, is confined to men;+F2 this for a wisdom of the Lord God's, which will
ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at high noon.

    to men applies only to the Universal House of Justice, and not to the
    National and Local Houses of Justice.
+P 8

     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the equality of women and
men.  The world of humanity has two wings -- one is women and the other men.
Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird fly.  Should one wing
remain weak, flight is impossible.  Not until the world of women becomes equal
to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and perfections, can success
and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 227, p. 302)
                                                                           [13]

Inasmuch as this is the century of light, it is evident that the Sun of
Reality, the Word, has revealed itself to all humankind.  One of the
potentialities hidden in the realm of humanity was the capability or capacity
of womanhood.  Through the effulgent rays of divine illumination the capacity
of woman has become so awakened and manifest in this age that equality of man
and woman is an established fact....

     ...

In this day man must investigate reality impartially and without prejudice
in order to reach the true knowledge and conclusions.  What, then, constitutes
the inequality between man and woman?  Both are human.  In powers and function
each is the complement of the other.  At most it is this:  that woman has been
denied the opportunities which man has so long enjoyed, especially the
privilege of education....

     ...

     The truth is that all mankind are the creatures and servants of one God,
and in His estimate all are human.  Man is a generic term applying to all
humanity.  The biblical statement "Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness" does not mean that woman was not created.  The image and likeness of
God apply to her as well.  In Persian and Arabic there are two distinct words
translated into English as man:  one meaning man and woman collectively, the
other distinguishing man as male from woman the female.  The first word and its
pronoun are generic, collective; the other is restricted to the male.  This is
the same in Hebrew.

     To accept and observe a distinction which God has not intended in creation
is ignorance and superstition....

     It is my hope that the banner of equality may be raised throughout the
five continents where as yet it is not fully recognized and established.  In
this enlightened world of the West woman has advanced an immeasurable degree
beyond the women of the Orient.  And let it be known once more that until woman
and man recognize and realize equality, social and political progress here or
anywhere will not be possible.  For the world of humanity consists of two parts
or members:  one is woman; the other is man.  Until these two members are equal
in strength, the oneness of humanity cannot be established, and the happiness
and felicity of mankind will not be a reality.  God willing, this is to be so.

     Today questions of the utmost importance are facing humanity, questions
peculiar to this radiant century....

     One of these questions concerns the rights of woman and her equality with
man.  In past ages it was held that woman and man were not equal -- that is to
say, woman was considered inferior to man, even from the standpoint of her
anatomy and creation.  She was considered especially inferior in intelligence,
and the idea prevailed universally that it was not allowable for her to step
into the arena of important affairs.  In some countries man went so far as to
believe and teach that woman belonged to a sphere lower than human.  But in
this century, which is the century of light and the revelation of mysteries,
God is proving to the satisfaction of humanity that all this is ignorance and
error; nay, rather, it is well established that mankind and womankind as parts
of composite humanity are coequal and that no difference in estimate is
allowable, for all are human.  The conditions in past centuries were due to
woman's lack of opportunity.  She was denied the right and privilege of
education and left in her undeveloped state.  Naturally, she could not and did
not advance.  In reality, God has created all mankind, and in the estimation of
God there is no distinction as to male and female.  The one whose heart is pure
is acceptable in His sight, be that one man or woman.  God does not inquire,
"Art thou woman or art thou man?" He judges human actions.  If these are
acceptable in the threshold of the Glorious One, man and woman will be equally
recognized and rewarded.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 133)                                                  [15]


     The world of humanity consists of two parts:  male and female.  Each is
the complement of the other.  Therefore, if one is defective, the other will
necessarily be incomplete, and perfection cannot be attained.  There is a right
hand and a left hand in the human body, functionally equal in service and
administration.  If either proves defective, the defect will naturally extend
to the other by involving the completeness of the whole; for accomplishment is
not normal unless both are perfect.  If we say one hand is deficient, we prove
the inability and incapacity of the other; for single-handed there is no full
accomplishment.  Just as physical accomplishment is complete with two hands, so
man and woman, the two parts of the social body, must be perfect.  It is not
natural that either should remain undeveloped; and until both are perfected,
the happiness of the human world will not be realized.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 134)                                                  [16]


     The status of woman in former times was exceedingly deplorable, for it was
the belief of the Orient that it was best for woman to be ignorant.  It was
considered preferable that she should not know reading or writing in order that
she might not be informed of events in the world.  Woman was considered to be

                                     - 7 -
+P 10

created for rearing children and attending to the duties of the household.  If
she pursued educational courses, it was deemed contrary to chastity; hence
women were made prisoners of the household.  The houses did not even have
windows opening upon the outside world.  &amp;Baha'u'llah destroyed these ideas
and proclaimed the equality of man and woman.  He made woman respected by
commanding that all women be educated, that there be no difference in the
education of the two sexes and that man and woman share the same rights.  In
the estimation of God there is no distinction of sex.  One whose thought is
pure, whose education is superior, whose scientific attainments are greater,
whose deeds of philanthropy excel, be that one man or woman, white or colored,
is entitled to full rights and recognition; there is no differentiation
whatsoever....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 166)                                                  [17]


Woman's lack of progress and proficiency has been due to her need of equal
education and opportunity.  Had she been allowed this equality, there is no
doubt she would be the counterpart of man in ability and capacity.  The
happiness of mankind will be realized when women and men coordinate and advance
equally, for each is the complement and helpmeet of the other.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in

     He establishes the equality of man and woman.  This is peculiar to the
teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, for all other religions have placed man above
woman.

           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in

     Women have equal rights with men upon earth; in religion and society they
are a very important element.  As long as women are prevented from attaining
their highest possibilities, so long will men be unable to achieve the
greatness which might be theirs.

In the world of humanity ... the female sex is treated as though inferior, and
is not allowed equal rights and privileges.  This condition is due not to
nature, but to education.  In the Divine Creation there is no such distinction.
Neither sex is superior to the other in the sight of God.  Why then should one
sex assert the inferiority of the other, withholding just rights and privileges

+P 11

as though God had given His authority for such a course of action?  If women
received the same educational advantages as those of men, the result would
demonstrate the equality of capacity of both for scholarship.

     In some respects woman is superior to man.  She is more tender-hearted,
more receptive, her intuition is more intense.
          ("Paris Talks:  Addresses given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in
           1911-1912", p. 161)                                             [21]


Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes should be equally
respected since neither is superior to the other in the eyes of Heaven.
Dignity before God depends, not on sex, but on purity and luminosity of heart.
Human virtues belong equally to all!
          ("Paris Talks:  Addresses given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in
           1911-1912", p. 162)                                             [22]


     In the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, women are advancing side by side with
men.  There is no area or instance where they will lag behind:  they have equal
rights with men, and will enter, in the future, into all branches of the
administration of society.  Such will be their elevation that, in every area of
endeavour, they will occupy the highest levels in the human world.  Rest thou
assured.  Look not upon their present state.  In future, the world of womankind
will shine with lustrous brilliance, for such is the will and purpose of
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  At the time of elections the right to vote is the inalienable
right of women, and the entrance of women into all human departments is an
irrefutable and incontrovertible question.  No soul can retard or prevent it.

     But there are certain matters, the participation in which is not worthy of
women.  For example, at the time when the community is taking up vigorous
defensive measures against the attack of foes, the women are exempt from
military engagements.  It may so happen that at a given time warlike and savage
tribes may furiously attack the body politic with the intention of carrying on
a wholesale slaughter of its members; under such a circumstance defence is
necessary, but it is the duty of men to organize and execute such defensive
measures and not the women -- because their hearts are tender and they cannot
endure the sight of the horror of carnage, even if it is for the sake of
defence.  From such and similar undertakings the women are exempt.

     As regards the constitution of the House of Justice, &amp;Baha'u'llah
addresses the men.  He says:  "O ye men of the House of Justice!"

     But when its members are to be elected, the right which belongs to women,
so far as their voting and their voice is concerned, is indisputable.  When the
women attain to the ultimate degree of progress, then, according to the
exigency of the time and place and their great capacity, they shall obtain

                                     - 9 -

extraordinary privileges.  Be ye confident on these accounts.  His Holiness
&amp;Baha'u'llah has greatly strengthened the cause of women, and the rights and
privileges of women is one of the greatest principles of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Rest
ye assured!  Ere long the days shall come when the men addressing the women,
shall say:  `Blessed are ye!  Blessed are ye!  Verily ye are worthy of every
gift.  Verily ye deserve to adorn your heads with the crown of everlasting
glory, because in sciences and arts, in virtues and perfections ye shall become
equal to man, and as regards tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy and
sympathy ye are superior'.

           Persian, published in "Paris Talks:  Addresses given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha

     The woman of the East has progressed.  Formerly in India, Persia and
throughout the Orient, she was not considered a human being.  Certain Arab
tribes counted their women in with the live stock.  In their language the noun
for woman also meant donkey; that is, the same name applied to both and a man's
wealth was accounted by the number of these beasts of burden he possessed.  The
worst insult one could hurl at a man was to cry out, "Thou woman!"

     From the moment &amp;Baha'u'llah appeared, this changed.  He did away with
the idea of distinction between the sexes, proclaiming them equal in every
capacity.

     In former times it was considered wiser that woman should not know how to
read or write; she should occupy herself only with drudgery. She was very
ignorant.  &amp;Baha'u'llah declares the education of woman to be of more
importance than that of man.  If the mother be ignorant, even if the father
have great knowledge, the child's education will be at fault, for education
begins with the milk.  A child at the breast is like a tender branch that the
gardener can train as he wills.

     The East has begun to educate its women.  Some there are in Persia who
have become liberated through this cause, whose cleverness and eloquence the
&amp;ulama cannot refute.  Many of them are poets.  They are absolutely
fearless.

     ...

     I hope for a like degree of progress among the women of Europe -- that
each may shine like unto a lamp; that they may cry out the proclamation of the
kingdom; that they may truly assist the men; nay, that they may be even
superior to the men, versed in sciences and yet detached, so that the whole
world may bear witness to the fact that men and women have absolutely the same
rights.  It would be a cause of great joy for me to see such women.  This is
useful work; by it woman will enter into the kingdom.  Otherwise, there will be
no results.

     The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has dominated over
woman by reason of his more forceful and aggressive qualities both of body and
mind.  But the balance is already shifting; force is losing its dominance, and
mental alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of love and service,
in which woman is strong, are gaining ascendancy.  Hence the new age will be an
age less masculine and more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to speak
more exactly, will be an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of
civilization will be more evenly balanced.

     As regards your question concerning the membership of the Universal House
of Justice:  there is a Tablet from &amp;Abdul-Baha in which He definitely states
that the membership of the Universal House is confined to men, and that the
wisdom of it will be fully revealed and appreciated in the future.  In the
local as well as the national Houses of Justice, however, women have the full
right of membership.  It is, therefore, only to the International House that
they cannot be elected.  The &amp;Baha'is should accept this statement of the
Master in a spirit of deep faith, confident that there is a divine guidance and
wisdom behind it which will be gradually unfolded to the eyes of the world.

     As regards the membership of the International House of Justice,
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha states in a Tablet that it is confined to men, and that the
wisdom of it will be revealed as manifest as the sun in the future.  In any
case the believers should know that, as &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself has explicitly
stated that sexes are equal except in some cases, the exclusion of women from
the International House of Justice should not be surprising.  From the fact
that there is no equality of functions between the sexes one should not,
however, infer that either sex is inherently superior or inferior to the other,
or that they are unequal in their rights.

Extracts From Letters Written by the Universal House of Justice:


     It is apparent from the Guardian's writings that where &amp;Baha'u'llah
has expressed a law as between a man and a woman it applies, mutatis
mutandis, between a woman and a man unless the context should make this
impossible.  For example, the text of the "&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas" forbids a man
to marry his father's wife (i.e. his step-mother), and the Guardian has
indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her step-father....

    Concerning your questions about the equality of men and women, this, as
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha has often explained, is a fundamental principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah;
therefore the Laws of the "Aqdas" should be studied in the light of it.
Equality between men and women does not, indeed physiologically it cannot, mean
identity of functions.  In some things women excel men, for others men are
better fitted than women, while in very many things the difference of sex is of
no effect at all.  The differences of function are most apparent in family
life.  The capacity for motherhood has many far-reaching implications which
are recognized in &amp;Baha'i Law.  For example, when it is not possible to
educate all one's children, daughters receive preference over sons, as mothers
are the first educators of the next generation.  Again, for physiological
reasons, women are granted certain exemptions from fasting that are not
applicable to men.

     The primary question to be resolved is how the present world, with its
entrenched pattern of conflict, can change to a world in which harmony and
co-operation will prevail.

     World order can be founded only on an unshakable consciousness of the
oneness of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences confirm.
Anthropology, physiology, psychology, recognize only one human species, albeit
infinitely varied in the secondary aspects of life.  Recognition of this truth
requires abandonment of prejudice -- prejudice of every kind -- race, class,
colour, creed, nation, sex, degree of material civilization, everything which
enables people to consider themselves superior to others.

     Acceptance of the oneness of mankind is the first fundamental prerequisite
for reorganization and administration of the world as one country, the home of
humankind.  Universal acceptance of this spiritual principle is essential to
any successful attempt to establish world peace....

     To the general premise that women and men have equality in the Faith,
this, as often explained by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, is a fundamental principle deriving
from &amp;Baha'u'llah and therefore His mention of the "Men of Justice" in the
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas should be considered in light of that principle....

...&amp;Abdu'l-Baha asserts:  "In this divine age the bounties of God have
encompassed the world of women.  Equality of men and women, except in some
negligible instances, has been fully and categorically announced.  Distinctions
have been utterly removed." That men and women differ from one another in
certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature; the
important thing is that He regards such inequalities as remain between the
sexes as being "negligible".

           States)                                                         [33]


     You are quite right in stating that men and women have basic and distinct
qualities.  The solution provided in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is not,
as you correctly observe, for men to become women, and for women to become men.
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha gave us the key to the problem when He taught that the qualities
and functions of men and women "complement" each other.  He further elucidated
this point when He said that the "new age" will be "an age in which the
masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more properly
balanced."

     It may be helpful to stress ... that the &amp;Baha'i principle of the
equality of men and women is clearly stated in the teachings, and the fact that
there is diversity of function between them in certain areas does not negate
this principle.

Praised be God, the women believers have organized meetings where they will
learn how to teach the Faith, will spread the sweet savours of the Teachings
and make plans for training the children.

...those present should concern themselves with every means of training the
girl children; with teaching the various branches of knowledge, good behaviour,
a proper way of life, the cultivation of a good character, chastity and
constancy, perseverance, strength, determination, firmness of purpose; with
household management, the education of children, and whatever especially
applieth to the needs of girls -- to the end that these girls, reared in the
stronghold of all perfections, and with the protection of a goodly character,
will, when they themselves become mothers, bring up their children from
earliest infancy to have a good character and conduct themselves well.

     Let them also study whatever will nurture the health of the body and its
physical soundness, and how to guard their children from disease.

Work ye for the guidance of the women in that land, teach the young girls and
the children, so that the mothers may educate their little ones from their
earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them to have a goodly character and
good morals, guide them to all the virtues of humankind, prevent the
development of any behaviour that would be worthy of blame, and foster them in
the embrace of &amp;Baha'i education.  Thus shall these tender infants be nurtured
at the breast of the knowledge of God and His love.  Thus shall they grow and
flourish, and be taught righteousness and the dignity of humankind, resolution
and the will to strive and to endure.  Thus shall they learn perseverance in
all things, the will to advance, high mindedness and high resolve, chastity and
purity of life.  Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a successful conclusion
whatsoever they undertake.

     Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of
children is of the first importance.  Let them put forth every effort in this
regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in whatever way ye
train it.  Therefore it is incumbent upon the mothers to rear their little ones
even as a gardener tendeth his young plants.  Let them strive by day and by
night to establish within their children faith and certitude, the fear of God,
the love of the Beloved of the worlds, and all good qualities and traits.
Whensoever a mother seeth that her child hath done well, let her praise and
applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the slightest undesirable trait should
manifest itself, let her counsel the child and punish him, and use means based
on reason, even a slight verbal chastisement should this be necessary.  It is
not, however, permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child's
character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal
abuse.

&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's supreme joy is in observing that a number of leaves from among

essence of detachment, and are well-informed of the mysteries of the world of
being; that they raise such a call in their glorification and praise of the
Greatest Name as to cause the inmates of the Fanes of the Kingdom to become
attracted and overjoyed, and that they recite prayers in prose and poetry, and
melodiously chant the divine verses.  I cherish the hope that thou wilt be one
of them, wilt cast forth pearls, wilt be constantly engaged in singing His
praise and wilt intone celestial strains in glorification of His attributes....

necessary, and are divinely trained.  For the day will come when these girls
will become mothers.  Mothers are the first educators of children, who
establish virtues in the child's inner nature.  They encourage the child to
acquire perfections and goodly manners, warn him against unbecoming qualities,
and encourage him to show forth resolve, firmness, and endurance under
hardship, and to advance on the high road to progress.  Due regard for the
education of girls is, therefore, necessary.  This is a very important subject,
and it should be administered and organized under the aegis of the Spiritual
Assembly....

     Furthermore, the education of woman is more necessary and important than
that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy.  If she be
defective and imperfect herself, the child will necessarily be deficient;
therefore, imperfection of woman implies a condition of imperfection in all

                                     - 15 -
+P 18

mankind, for it is the mother who rears, nurtures and guides the growth of the
child.  This is not the function of the father.  If the educator be
incompetent, the educated will be correspondingly lacking.  This is evident and
incontrovertible.  Could the student be brilliant and accomplished if the
teacher is illiterate and ignorant?  The mothers are the first educators of
mankind; if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the
race.

     ...

     It has been objected by some that woman is not equally capable with man
and that she is deficient by creation.  This is pure imagination.  The
difference in capability between man and woman is due entirely to opportunity
and education.  Heretofore woman has been denied the right and privilege of
equal development.  If equal opportunity be granted her, there is no doubt she
would be the peer of man. History will evidence this.  In past ages noted women
have arisen in the affairs of nations and surpassed men in their
accomplishments....

     ...

     The purpose, in brief, is this:  that if woman be fully educated and
granted her rights, she will attain the capacity for wonderful accomplishments
and prove herself the equal of man.  She is the coadjutor of man, his
complement and helpmeet.  Both are human; both are endowed with potentialities
of intelligence and embody the virtues of humanity.  In all human powers and
functions they are partners and coequals.  At present in spheres of human
activity woman does not manifest her natal prerogatives, owing to lack of
education and opportunity.  Without doubt education will establish her equality
with men....

     In proclaiming the oneness of mankind He taught that men and women are
equal in the sight of God and that there is no distinction to be made between
them.  The only difference between them now is due to lack of education and
training.  If woman is given equal opportunity of education, distinction and
estimate of inferiority will disappear....

     He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education for man and
woman.  Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study, thereby
promoting unity of the sexes.  When all mankind shall receive the same
opportunity of education and the equality of men and women be realized, the
foundations of war will be utterly destroyed....

Why should a woman be left mentally undeveloped?  Science is praiseworthy --
whether investigated by the intellect of man or woman.  So, little by little,
woman advanced, giving increasing evidence of equal capabilities with man --
whether in scientific research, political ability or any other sphere of human
activity.  The conclusion is evident that woman has been outdistanced through
lack of education and intellectual facilities.  If given the same educational
opportunities or course of study, she would develop the same capacity and
abilities.

     &amp;Baha'u'llah has announced that inasmuch as ignorance and lack of
education are barriers of separation among mankind, all must receive training
and instruction.  Through this provision the lack of mutual understanding will
be remedied and the unity of mankind furthered and advanced.  Universal
education is a universal law.  It is, therefore, incumbent upon every father to
teach and instruct his children according to his possibilities.  If he is
unable to educate them, the body politic, the representative of the people,
must provide the means for their education.

The sex distinction which exists in the human world is due to the lack of
education for woman, who has been denied equal opportunity for development and
advancement.  Equality of the sexes will be established in proportion to the
increased opportunities afforded woman in this age, for man and woman are
equally the recipients of powers and endowments from God, the Creator.  God has

     Our hearts rejoiced at thy letter concerning a school for girls.

     Praised be God that there is now a school of this type in &amp;Tihran where
young maidens can, through His bounty, receive an education and with all vigour
acquire the accomplishments of humankind.  Erelong will women in every field
keep pace with the men.

     Until now, in Persia, the means for women's advancement were non-existent.
But now, God be thanked, ever since the dawning of the Morn of Salvation, they
have been going forward day by day.  The hope is that they will take the lead
in virtues and attainments, in closeness to the Court of Almighty God, in faith
and certitude -- and that the women of the East will become the envy of the
women of the West.

Extract From a Letter Written by the Universal House of Justice:


     The cause of universal education, which has already enlisted in its
service an army of dedicated people from every faith and nation, deserves the
utmost support that the governments of the world can lend it.  For ignorance is
indisputably the principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples and the
perpetuation of prejudice.  No nation can achieve success unless education is
accorded all its citizens.  Lack of resources limits the ability of many
nations to fulfil this necessity, imposing a certain ordering of priorities.
The decision-making agencies involved would do well to consider giving first
priority to the education of women and girls, since it is through educated
mothers that the benefits of knowledge can be most effectively and rapidly
diffused throughout society.  In keeping with the requirements of the times,
consideration should also be given to teaching the concept of world citizenship
as part of the standard education of every child.

         III.  APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY TO FAMILY LIFE


Extracts From the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah:


     Steadfastness in the Cause is mentioned in the Tablets and set forth by
the Pen of the Ancient of Days.  Render thanks to the Beloved of the world that
thou hast set thy heart on Him and art uttering His praise.  Many a man hath in
this day been deprived of making mention of the All-Sufficing Lord and of
recognizing His truth; and many a woman hath fixed her gaze upon the Horizon of
the Most High, and hath adorned herself with the garb of the love of the Desire
of the world.  This is God's grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He
pleaseth.  By the Day-Star of ancient mysteries!  The sweet-scented fragrance
of every breath breathed in the love of God is wafted in the court of the
presence of the Lord of Revelation.  The reward of no good deed is or ever will
be lost.  Blessed art thou, doubly blessed art thou!  Thou art reckoned amongst
those handmaidens whose love for their kin hath not prevented them from
attaining the shores of the Sea of Grace and Mercy.  God willing, thou shalt
rest eternally neath the shade of the favours of the All-Merciful and shalt be
assured of His bounties.  Engage in the praise of the True One and rejoice in
His loving-kindness.

     The world passeth away, and that which is everlasting is the love of God.
God willing, thou shalt circumambulate the True One in every world of His
worlds and shalt be free from all else save Him....
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)         [53]


     All should know, and in this regard attain the splendours of the sun of
certitude, and be illumined thereby:  Women and men have been and will always
be equal in the sight of God.  The Dawning-Place of the Light of God sheddeth
its radiance upon all with the same effulgence.  Verily God created women for
men, and men for women.  The most beloved of people before God are the most
steadfast and those who have surpassed others in their love for God, exalted be
His glory....

     The friends of God must be adorned with the ornament of justice, equity,
kindness and love.  As they do not allow themselves to be the object of cruelty
and transgression, in like manner they should not allow such tyranny to visit
the handmaidens of God.  He, verily, speaketh the truth and commandeth that
which benefitteth His servants and handmaidens.  He is the Protector of all in
this world and the next.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)         [54]


Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:


     The Lord, peerless is He, hath made woman and man to abide with each other
in the closest companionship, and to be even as a single soul.  They are two
helpmates, two intimate friends, who should be concerned about the welfare of
each other.

     If they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect
contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine grace
and favour in the Kingdom of heaven.  But if they do other than this, they will
live out their lives in great bitterness, longing at every moment for death,
and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm.

     Strive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as two doves in
the nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.

...following the precepts of God and the holy Law, suckle your children from
their infancy with the milk of a universal education, and rear them so that
from their earliest days, within their inmost heart, their very nature, a way
of life will be firmly established that will conform to the divine Teachings in
all things.

     For mothers are the first educators, the first mentors; and truly it is
the mothers who determine the happiness, the future greatness, the courteous

envied by all.  Such a family but addeth to its stature and its lasting
honour, as day succeedeth day....

     You have asked whether a husband would be able to prevent his wife from
embracing the divine light or a wife dissuade her husband from gaining entry
into the Kingdom of God.  In truth neither of them could prevent the other from
entering into the Kingdom, unless the husband hath an excessive attachment to
the wife or the wife to the husband.  Indeed when either of the two worshippeth
the other to the exclusion of God, then each could prevent the other from
seeking admittance into His Kingdom.

     Question:  What is the attitude of your belief toward the family?

     Answer:  According to the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah the family, being a
human unit, must be educated according to the rules of sanctity.  All the
virtues must be taught the family.  The integrity of the family bond must be
constantly considered, and the rights of the individual members must not be
transgressed.  The rights of the son, the father, the mother -- none of them
must be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary.  Just as the son has
certain obligations to his father, the father, likewise, has certain
obligations to his son.  The mother, the sister and other members of the
household have their certain prerogatives.  All these rights and prerogatives
must be conserved, yet the unity of the family must be sustained.  The injury
of one shall be considered the injury of all; the comfort of each, the comfort
of all; the honor of one, the honor of all.

When such difference of opinion and belief occurs between husband and wife it
is very unfortunate for undoubtedly it detracts from that spiritual bond which
is the stronghold of the family bond, especially in times of difficulty.  The
way, however, that it could be remedied is not by acting in such wise as to
alienate the other party.  One of the objects of the Cause is actually to bring
about a closer bond in the homes.  In all such cases, therefore, the Master
used to advise obedience to the wishes of the other party and prayer.  Pray
that your husband may gradually see the light and at the same time so act as to
draw him nearer rather than prejudice him.  Once that harmony is secured then
you will be able to serve unhampered.
          (15 July 1928)                                                   [62]


     Shoghi Effendi trusts that as a result of his cable and this letter your
wife will be able to devote a little more time to her family, but he also hopes
that you will be able to assist her in obtaining the time and opportunity to
serve a Cause that is so dear and near to her heart and in which her services
are much appreciated.

     The Guardian, in his remarks ... about parents' and children's, wives' and
husbands' relations in America, meant that there is a tendency in that country
for children to be too independent of the wishes of their parents and lacking
in the respect due to them.  Also wives, in some cases, have a tendency to
exert an unjust degree of domination over their husbands, which, of course, is
not right, any more than that the husband should unjustly dominate his wife.
          (22 July 1943)                                                   [64]


     It is one of the essential teachings of the Faith that unity should be
maintained in the home.  Of course this does not mean that any member of the
family has a right to influence the faith of any other member; and if this is
realized by all the members, then it seems certain that unity would be
feasible.

     The Guardian fully appreciates your desire to go forth as a pioneer at
this time, and to help establish the Faith in the virgin areas, but you should
not go against the wishes of your husband, and force him to give up everything
in order that you might serve the Faith in this manner.  We must bear in mind
the wishes and the rights of those who are closely connected in our lives.

     Wherever there is a &amp;Baha'i family, those concerned should by all means
do all they can to preserve it, because divorce is strongly condemned in the
Teachings, whereas harmony, unity and love are held up as the highest ideals
in human relationships.  This must always apply to the &amp;Baha'is, whether they
are serving in the pioneering field or not.
          (9 November 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Central
           America)                                                        [67]

     That the first teacher of the child is the mother should not be startling,
for the primary orientation of the infant is to its mother.  This provision of
nature in no way minimizes the role of the father in the &amp;Baha'i family.
Again, equality of status does not mean identity of function.
          (23 June 1974)                                                   [68]


     In considering the problems that you and your wife are experiencing, the
House of Justice points out that the unity of your family should take priority
over any other consideration.  &amp;Baha'u'llah came to bring unity to the world,
and a fundamental unity is that of the family.  Therefore, we must believe that
the Faith is intended to strengthen the family, not weaken it.  For example,
service to the Cause should not produce neglect of the family.  It is important
for you to arrange your time so that your family life is harmonious and your
household receives the attention it requires.

     &amp;Baha'u'llah also stressed the importance of consultation.  We should not
think this worthwhile method of seeking solutions is confined to the
administrative institutions of the Cause.  Family consultation employing full
and frank discussion, and animated by awareness of the need for moderation and
balance, can be the panacea for domestic conflict.  Wives should not attempt to
dominate their husbands, nor husbands their wives....
          (1 August 1978)                                                  [69]


     Noting that you and your husband have consulted about your family problems
with your Spiritual Assembly but did not receive any advice, and also discussed
your situation with a family counsellor without success, the House of Justice
feels it most essential for your husband and you to understand that marriage
can be a source of well-being, conveying a sense of security and spiritual

happiness.  However, it is not something that just happens.  For marriage to
become a haven of contentment it requires the cooperation of the marriage
partners themselves, and the assistance of their families....
          (24 June 1979)                                                   [70]


The members of a family all have duties and responsibilities towards one
another and to the family as a whole, and these duties and responsibilities
vary from member to member because of their natural relationships.  The parents
have the inescapable duty to educate their children -- but not vice versa; the
children have the duty to obey their parents -- the parents do not obey the
children; the mother -- not the father -- bears the children, nurses them in
babyhood, and is thus their first educator; hence daughters have a prior right
to education over sons and, as the Guardian's secretary has written on his
behalf, "The task of bringing up a &amp;Baha'i child, as emphasized time and again
in &amp;Baha'i Writings, is the chief responsibility of the mother, whose unique
privilege is indeed to create in her home such conditions as would be most
conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and advancement.  The
training which a child first receives through his mother constitutes the
strongest foundation for his future development..." A corollary of this
responsibility of the mother is her right to be supported by her husband --
a husband has no explicit right to be supported by his wife....

     ...

In any group, however loving the consultation, there are nevertheless points on
which, from time to time, agreement cannot be reached.  In a Spiritual Assembly
this dilemma is resolved by a majority vote.  There can, however, be no
majority where only two parties are involved, as in the case of a husband and
wife.  There are, therefore, times when a wife should defer to her husband, and
times when a husband should defer to his wife, but neither should ever unjustly
dominate the other.  In short, the relationship between husband and wife should
be as held forth in the prayer revealed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha which is often read
at &amp;Baha'i weddings:  "Verily, they are married in obedience to Thy command.
Cause them to become the signs of harmony and unity until the end of time."

     These are all relationships within the family, but there is a much wider
sphere of relationships between men and women than in the home, and this too
we should consider in the context of &amp;Baha'i society, not in that of past or
present social norms.  For example, although the mother is the first educator
of the child, and the most important formative influence in his development,
the father also has the responsibility of educating his children, and this
responsibility is so weighty that &amp;Baha'u'llah has stated that a father who
fails to exercise it forfeits his rights of fatherhood.  Similarly, although
the primary responsibility for supporting the family financially is placed upon
the husband, this does not by any means imply that the place of woman is
confined to the home....
          (28 December 1980 to the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand)

You have asked, however, for specific rules of conduct to govern the
relationships of husbands and wives.  This the House of Justice does not wish
to do, and it feels that there is already adequate guidance included in the
compilation on this subject.  For example the principle that the rights of each
and all in the family unit must be upheld, and the advice that loving
consultation should be the keynote, that all matters should be settled in
harmony and love, and that there are times when the husband and the wife should
defer to the wishes of the other.  Exactly under what circumstances such
deference should take place, is a matter for each couple to determine....

     You ask about the admonition that everyone must work, and want to know if
this means that you, a wife and mother, must work for a livelihood as your
husband does.  We are requested to enclose for your perusal an excerpt, "The
twelfth Glad-Tidings", from &amp;Baha'u'llah's "Tablet of &amp;Bisharat".+F3  You
will see that the directive is for the friends to be engaged in an occupation
which will be of benefit to mankind.  Homemaking is a highly honourable and
responsible work of fundamental importance for mankind....
          (16 June 1982)                                                   [73]


     With regard to your question whether mothers should work outside the home,
it is helpful to consider the matter from the perspective of the concept of a
&amp;Baha'i family.  This concept is based on the principle that the man has
primary responsibility for the financial support of the family, and the woman
is the chief and primary educator of the children.  This by no means implies
that these functions are inflexibly fixed and cannot be changed and adjusted to
suit particular family situations, nor does it mean that the place of the woman
is confined to the home.  Rather, while primary responsibility is assigned, it
is anticipated that fathers would play a significant role in the education of
the children and women could also be breadwinners.  As you rightly indicated,
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha encouraged women to "participate fully and equally in the affairs
of the world".

     In relation to your specific queries, the decision concerning the amount
of time a mother may spend in working outside the home depends on circumstances
existing within the home, which may vary from time to time.  Family
consultation will help to provide the answers....
          (9 August 1984)                                                  [74]


     The great importance attached to the mother's role derives from the fact
that she is the first educator of the child.  Her attitude, her prayers,
even what she eats and her physical condition have a great influence on the
child when it is still in the womb.  When the child is born, it is she who has
been endowed by God with the milk which is the first food designed for it, and
it is intended that, if possible, she should be with the baby to train and

nurture it in its earliest days and months.  This does not mean that the
father does not also love, pray for, and care for his baby, but as he has the
primary responsibility of providing for the family, his time to be with his
child is usually limited, while the mother is usually closely associated with
the baby during this intensely formative time when it is growing and
developing faster than it ever will again during the whole of its life.  As
the child grows older and more independent, the relative nature of its
relationship with its mother and father modifies and the father can play a
greater role.

                       IV.  WOMEN IN THE WORLD AT LARGE


Extract From the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah:


     It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of occupation,
such as crafts, trades and the like.  We have graciously exalted your
engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, the True One.  Ponder
ye in your hearts the grace and the blessings of God and render thanks unto Him
at eventide and at dawn.  Waste not your time in idleness and sloth.  Occupy
yourselves with that which profiteth yourselves and others.  Thus hath it been
decreed in this Tablet from whose horizon the day-star of wisdom and utterance
shineth resplendent.

     The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idly and
beg.  Hold ye fast unto the cord of material means, placing your whole trust in
God, the Provider of all means.  When anyone occupieth himself in a craft or
trade, such occupation itself is regarded in the estimation of God as an act of
worship; and this is naught but a token of His infinite and all-pervasive
bounty.

Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:


     The handmaidens of God and the bondsmaids in His divine Court should
reveal such attributes and attitudes amongst the women of the world as would
cause them to stand out and achieve renown in the circles of women.  That is,
they should associate with them with supreme chastity and steadfast decency,
with unshakeable faith, articulate speech, an eloquent tongue, irrefutable
testimony and high resolve.  Beseech God that thou mayest attain unto all these
bounties.

Until the reality of equality between man and woman is fully established and
attained, the highest social development of mankind is not possible.  Even
granted that woman is inferior to man in some degree of capacity or
accomplishment, this or any other distinction would continue to be productive
of discord and trouble.  The only remedy is education, opportunity; for
equality means equal qualification....

And let it be known once more that until woman and man recognize and realize
equality, social and political progress here or anywhere will not be
possible....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", pp. 76-77)                                               [78]


...the principle of religion has been revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah that woman
must be given the privilege of equal education with man and full right to his
prerogatives.  That is to say, there must be no difference in the education of
male and female in order that womankind may develop equal capacity and
importance with man in the social and economic equation.  Then the world will
attain unity and harmony.  In past ages humanity has been defective and
inefficient because it has been incomplete.  War and its ravages have blighted
the world; the education of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition
and ending, for she will use her whole influence against war.  Woman rears the
child and educates the youth to maturity.  She will refuse to give her sons for
sacrifice upon the field of battle.  In truth, she will be the greatest factor
in establishing universal peace and international arbitration.  Assuredly,
woman will abolish warfare among mankind....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 108)                                                  [79]


     Again, it is well established in history that where woman has not
participated in human affairs the outcomes have never attained a state of
completion and perfection.  On the other hand, every influential undertaking of
the human world wherein woman has been a participant has attained importance.
This is historically true and beyond disproof even in religion.  Jesus Christ
had twelve disciples and among His followers a woman known as Mary Magdalene.
Judas Iscariot had become a traitor and hypocrite, and after the crucifixion
the remaining eleven disciples were wavering and undecided.  It is certain from
the evidence of the Gospels that the one who comforted them and reestablished
their faith was Mary Magdalene.

     ...

     The most momentous question of this day is international peace and
arbitration, and universal peace is impossible without universal suffrage....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 134)                                                  [80]

     Question:  Is it not a fact that universal peace cannot be accomplished
until there is political democracy in all the countries of the world?

     Answer:  It is very evident that in the future there shall be no
centralization in the countries of the world, be they constitutional in
government, republican or democratic in form.  The United States may be held up
as the example of future government -- that is to say, each province will be
independent in itself, but there will be federal union protecting the interests
of the various independent states.  It may not be a republican or a democratic
form.  To cast aside centralization which promotes despotism is the exigency of
the time.  This will be productive of international peace.  Another fact of
equal importance in bringing about international peace is woman's suffrage.
That is to say, when perfect equality shall be established between men and
women, peace may be realized for the simple reason that womankind in general
will never favor warfare.  Women will not be willing to allow those whom they
have so tenderly cared for to go to the battlefield.  When they shall have a
vote, they will oppose any cause of warfare.  Another factor which will bring
about universal peace is the linking together of the Orient and the Occident.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 167)                                                  [81]


When all mankind shall receive the same opportunity of education and the
equality of men and women be realized, the foundations of war will be utterly
destroyed.  Without equality this will be impossible because all differences
and distinction are conducive to discord and strife.  Equality between men and
women is conducive to the abolition of warfare for the reason that women will
never be willing to sanction it....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 175)                                                  [82]


Woman must especially devote her energies and abilities toward the industrial
and agricultural sciences, seeking to assist mankind in that which is most
needful.  By this means she will demonstrate capability and ensure recognition
of equality in the social and economic equation....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 283)                                                  [84]


     Therefore, strive to show in the human world that women are most capable
and efficient, that their hearts are more tender and susceptible than the
hearts of men, that they are more philanthropic and responsive toward the needy
and suffering, that they are inflexibly opposed to war and are lovers of peace.
Strive that the ideal of international peace may become realized through the
efforts of womankind, for man is more inclined to war than woman, and a real

                                     - 28 -
+P 31

evidence of woman's superiority will be her service and efficiency in the
establishment of universal peace.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 284)                                                  [85]


...imbued with the same virtues as man, rising through all the degrees of human
attainment, women will become the peers of men, and until this equality is
established, true progress and attainment for the human race will not be
facilitated.

     The evident reasons underlying this are as follows:  Woman by nature is
opposed to war; she is an advocate of peace.  Children are reared and brought
up by the mothers who give them the first principles of education and labor
assiduously in their behalf.  Consider, for instance, a mother who has tenderly
reared a son for twenty years to the age of maturity.  Surely she will not
consent to having that son torn asunder and killed in the field of battle.
Therefore, as woman advances toward the degree of man in power and privilege,
with the right of vote and control in human government, most assuredly war will
cease; for woman is naturally the most devoted and staunch advocate of
international peace.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 375)                                                  [86]


According to the spirit of this age, women must advance and fulfill their
mission in all departments of life, becoming equal to men.  They must be on the
same level as men and enjoy equal rights.  This is my earnest prayer and it is
one of the fundamental principles of &amp;Baha'u'llah.
          (J. E. Esslemont, "&amp;Baha'u'llah and the New Era", p. 147)        [87]


     ...The woman is indeed of the greater importance to the race. She has the
greater burden and the greater work.  Look at the vegetable and the animal
worlds.  The palm which carries the fruit is the tree most prized by the date
grower.  The Arab knows that for a long journey the mare has the longest wind.
For her greater strength and fierceness, the lioness is more feared by the
hunter than the lion.

The woman has greater moral courage than the man; she has also special gifts
which enable her to govern in moments of danger and crisis....

Exrtracts From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi:


Concerning &amp;Baha'i representation at the All-Asian Women's Conference:  this
is undoubtedly a most commendable thing to do especially as the Cause has so
much concerning the position of women in society.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that
the National Assembly will do its best to win the admiration of all the
assembled delegates for the teachings of the Cause along that line.  We should
always take such opportunities that present themselves.  Maybe we would succeed
to render some service to society and alleviate its ills.

           Burma)                                                          [89]


     What &amp;Abdu'l-Baha meant about the women arising for peace is that this a
matter which vitally affects women, and when they form a conscious and
overwhelming mass of public opinion against war there can be no war.  The
&amp;Baha'i women are already organized through being members of the Faith and the
Administrative Order.  No further organization is needed.  But they should,
through teaching and through the active moral support they give to every
movement directed towards peace, seek to exert a strong influence on other
women's minds in regard to this essential matter.

Extract From a Letter Written by the Universal House of Justice:


     The emancipation of women, the achievement of full equality between the
sexes, is one of the most important, though less acknowledged prerequisites of
peace.  The denial of such equality perpetrates an injustice against one half
of the world's population and promotes in men harmful attitudes and habits that
are carried from the family to the workplace, to political life, and ultimately
to international relations.  There are no grounds, moral, practical, or
biological, upon which such denial can be justified.  Only as women are
welcomed into full partnership in all fields of human endeavour will the moral
and psychological climate be created in which international peace can emerge.
          (October 1985 to the Peoples of the World)                       [91]



Extracts From Letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice:


...there is a much wider sphere of relationships between men and women than in
the home, and this too we should consider in the context of &amp;Baha'i society,
not in that of past or present social norms.  For example, although the mother
is the first educator of the child, and the most important formative influence
in his development, the father also has the responsibility of educating his

                                     - 30 -
+P 33

children, and this responsibility is so weighty that &amp;Baha'u'llah has stated
that a father who fails to exercise it forfeits his rights of fatherhood.
Similarly, although the primary responsibility for supporting the family
financially is placed upon the husband, this does not by any means imply that
the place of woman is confined to the home.  On the contrary, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has
stated:

          In the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, women are advancing side
     by side with men.  There is no area or instance where they will lag
     behind:  they have equal rights with men, and will enter, in the
     future, into all branches of the administration of society.  Such
     will be their elevation that, in every area of endeavour, they will
     occupy the highest levels in the human world....4

and again:

     So it will come to pass that when women participate fully and
     equally in the affairs of the world, when they enter confidently
     and capably the great arena of laws and politics, war will cease;...
     ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace", p. 135)


In the Tablet of the World, &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself has envisaged that women as
well as men would be breadwinners in stating:

     Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted
     person a portion of what he or she earneth through trade,
     agriculture or other occupation, for the training and education
     of children, to be spent for this purpose with the knowledge
     of the Trustees of the House of Justice.
     ("Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah Revealed after the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 90)
          (28 December 1980 to the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand)

     The duty of women in being the first educators of mankind is clearly set
forth in the Writings.  It is for every woman, if and when she becomes a
mother, to determine how best she can discharge on the one hand her chief
responsibility as a mother and on the other, to the extent possible, to
participate in other aspects of the activities of the society of which she
forms a part....

Extracts From the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah:


     In this Day the Blessed Tree of Remembrance speaketh forth in the Kingdom
of Utterance saying:  Well is it with the servant who hath turned his face
towards Him, and embraced His truth, and with the handmaiden who hath hearkened
to His Voice and become of the blissful.  Verily, she is a champion of the
field of true understanding.  To this the Tongue of Truth beareth witness from
His exalted Station.

     O My leaf, blessed art thou for having responded to My call when it was
raised in the name of the True One.  Thou didst recognize My Revelation when
men of renown were immersed in manifest idle fancies.  Thou hast verily
attained the mercy of thy Lord time and again.  Render thanks unto Him and
glorify Him with thy Praise.  He is, in truth, with His handmaidens and
servants who have turned towards Him.  The shining glory from the Horizon of My
Kingdom be upon thee and upon the one who hath guided thee to My straight path.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)         [94]


     We beseech the True One to adorn His handmaidens with the ornament of
chastity, of trustworthiness, of righteousness and of purity.  Verily, He is
the All-Bestowing, the All-Generous.  We make mention of the handmaidens of God
at this time and announce unto them the glad-tidings of the tokens of the mercy
and compassion of God and His consideration for them, glorified be He, and We
supplicate Him for all His assistance to perform such deeds as are the cause of
the exaltation of His Word.  He verily speaketh the truth and enjoineth upon
His servants and His handmaidens that which will profit them in every world of
His worlds.  He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:


     The effulgence of the rays of the Sun of Truth is abundant and the favours
of the Blessed Beauty surround the women believers and the handmaidens who have
attained unto certitude.  At every moment a bounteous bestowal is revealed.
The handmaidens of the Merciful should seize the opportunities afforded in
these days.  Each one should strive to draw nigh unto the divine Threshold and
seek bounties from the Source of existence.  She should attain such a state and
be confirmed with such a power as to make, with but the utterance of one word,
a lowly person to be held in reverence, initiate him who is deprived into the

world of the spirit, impart hope to the despondent, endow the portionless one
with a share of the great bestowal, and confer knowledge and insight upon the
ignorant and the blind, and alertness and vigilance on the indolent and
heedless.  This is the attribute of the handmaidens of the Merciful.  This is
the characteristic of the bondsmaids of God's Threshold.

     O ye leaves who have attained certitude!  In the countries of Europe and
America the maidservants of the Merciful have won the prize of excellence and
advancement from the arena of men, and in the fields of teaching and spreading
the divine fragrances they have shown a brilliant hand.  Soon they will soar
like the birds of the Concourse on high in the far corners of the world and
will guide the people and reveal to them the divine mysteries.  Ye, who are the
blessed leaves from the East, should burn more brightly, and engage in
spreading the sweet savours of the Lord and in reciting the verses of God.
Arise, therefore, and exert yourselves to fulfil the exhortations and counsels
of the Blessed Beauty, that all hopes may be realized and that the plain of
streams and orchards may become the garden of oneness.

     Upon ye, men and women, be the glory of glories.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                    [96]


     In this great Cycle and wondrous Dispensation some women have been raised
up who were the emblems of unity and ensigns of oneness, for the revelation of
divine bestowals is received by men and women in equal measure.  "Verily the
most honoured in the sight of God is the most virtuous amongst you"+F4 is
applicable to both men and women, to servants and handmaidens.  All are under
the shadow of the Word of God and all derive their strength from the bounties
of the Lord.  Therefore, do not consider thyself to be insignificant by
doubting what a handmaiden living behind the veil can do....

     With a firm heart, a steadfast step and an eloquent tongue arise to spread
the Word of God and say:  "O God, although I am sitting concealed behind the
screen of chastity and am restricted by the veil and exigencies of modesty, my
cherished hope is to raise the banner of service and to become a maidservant at
Thy Holy Threshold; to ride on a charger and penetrate the army of the
ignorant, defeat the mighty regiments and subvert the foundations of error and
violation.  Thou art the Helper of the weak, Thou art the Sustainer of the
poor, Thou art the Succourer of the handmaidens.  Verily, Thou art the Almighty
and All-Powerful."
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                    [97]


     Confirmations from the kingdom of God will assuredly be received, enabling
some radiant leaves to appear resplendent in the assemblage of this world with
clear proofs and convincing reasons, which will adorn the cause of womanhood.
They will prove that in this cycle women are equal to men, nay, in certain

respects they will excel.  Ponder ye:  in this wonderful Cause numerous were
the men who scaled the heights of knowledge; they had a brilliant utterance, a
convincing proof, an eloquent tongue and magnificent speech, but the blessed
leaf, &amp;Jinab-i-Tahirih, because she was a woman, emerged with immense
splendour and dumbfounded all the people.  If she were a man, this would not
have been so at all.  Therefore, ye should know that the greatness of the Cause
hath penetrated the nerves and veins of the world in such wise that if one of
the leaves is attracted and gains mastery in demonstrating reasons and proofs
and in uttering convincing evidences, she will shine resplendently.  O radiant
leaves, I swear by the Beauty of the Desired One and the Mystery of Existence
that if ye work actively in this realm, the outpourings of the Blessed Beauty
will reflect as the sun in the mirrors of the hearts.  Your progress will
astonish all.

     The attracted leaves should not, when associating with each other, talk
merely about the temperature of the weather, the coldness of the water, the
beauty of the flowers and gardens, the freshness of the grass and the flowing
water.  They should rather restrict their discussions to glorification and
praise and the uttering of proofs and reasons, to quoting verses and traditions
and putting forth clear testimonies, so that all the homes of the loved ones
will be converted into gathering places for lessons on teaching the Cause.

     If ye do so, in a short while the outpourings of the Kingdom will be so
manifested that each one of the handmaidens of the Merciful will become a
perspicuous book revealing the mysteries of the Lord of Mercy.

     Upon you be the glory of glories.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                    [98]


In this wondrous Dispensation the favours of the Glorious Lord are vouchsafed
unto the handmaidens of the Merciful.  Therefore, they should, like unto men,
seize the prize and excel in the field, so that it will be proven and made
manifest that the penetrative influence of the Word of God in this new
Dispensation hath caused women to be equal with men, and that in the arena of
tests they will outdo others.  Therefore, the true bondsmaids of the Blessed
Beauty must be revived by the spirit of detachment, and refreshed by the
breezes of attraction.  With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with
souls gladdened by the heavenly glad-tidings, and with extreme humility and
lowliness, let them speak out with eloquent speech, and praise and glorify the
Great Lord, for they are the manifestations of His bounty and adorned with the
crown of splendour.

     Blessed, blessed are ye for ye have arranged spiritual meetings and
engaged in propounding divine proofs and evidences.  Ye are intent on
vindicating truth in support of the manifest Light of the Cause, through

+P 37

conclusive arguments and proofs based on the sacred scriptures of the past.
This is a very noble aim, and this cherished hope a cause of the illumination
of all peoples and nations.

     From the beginning of existence until the present day, in any of the past
cycles and dispensations, no assemblies for women have ever been established
and classes for the purpose of spreading the teachings were never held by them.
This is one of the characteristics of this glorious Dispensation and this great
century.  Ye should, most certainly, strive to perfect this assemblage and
increase your knowledge of the realities of heavenly mysteries, so that, God
willing, in a short time, women will become the same as men; they will take a
leading position amongst the learned, will each have a fluent tongue and
eloquent speech, and shine like unto lamps of guidance throughout the world.
In some respects, women have astonishing capacities; they hasten in their
attraction to God, and are intense in their fiery ardour for Him.

     In brief, spend your nights and days in the study of the holy Utterances
and in acquiring perfections.  Occupy yourselves always in discussing these
matters.  When ye meet each other, convey the glad-tidings and impart hope to
one another because of the confirmations and bounties of the Ancient and
Ever-Living Lord.  Let each set forth proofs and evidences, and talk about the
mysteries of the Kingdom, so that the true and divine Spirit may permeate the
body of the contingent world and the secrets of all things, whether of the past
or of the future, may become openly manifest and resplendent.

     O loved handmaidens of God!  Consider not your present merits and
capacities, rather fix your gaze on the favours and confirmations of the
Blessed Beauty, because His everlasting grace will make of the insignificant
plant a blessed tree, will turn the mirage into cool water and wine; will cause
the forsaken atom to become the very essence of being, the puny one erudite in
the school of knowledge.  It enableth a thorny bush to give forth blossoms, and
the dark earth to produce fragrant and rich hyacinths.  It will transmute the
stone into a ruby of great price, and fill the sea shells with brilliant
pearls.  It will assist a fledgling schoolchild to become a learned teacher and
enable a frail embryo to reveal the reality of the verse:  "Hallowed be the
Lord, the Most Excellent of all creators."+F5 Verily, my Lord is powerful over
things.

In this day the duty of everyone, whether man or woman, is to teach the Cause.
In America, the women have outdone the men in this regard and have taken the
lead in this field.  They strive harder in guiding the peoples of the world,
and their endeavours are greater.  They are confirmed by divine bestowals and
blessings.  It is my hope that in the East the handmaids of the Merciful will
also exert such effort, reveal their powers, and manifest their capacities....

5.   &amp;Qur'an 23:14
+P 38

     Now is the time to speak forth and to deliver speeches, the time to teach
and to give testimony.  Loosen thy tongue, expound the truths, and establish
the validity of the verse:  "The All-Merciful hath taught the &amp;Qur'an."+F6 The
Holy Spirit speaketh through the innermost essence of the human tongue, God's
Spirit which desireth communion with the human soul unfoldeth the truths, the
Faithful Spirit writeth down and the Spirit of the Ancient of Days confirmeth.
I swear by that Peerless Beauty, Who is in the Unseen Kingdom, that when the
leaves loose their tongues in praise and glorification of the All-Loving Lord,
and in teaching the Cause of the Kind Lord, the concourse of the Kingdom and
the inmates of the Unseen Realms will give ear, and cry out with exclamations
of extreme joy and jubilation.

     Glory be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who is steadfast in the
Covenant.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [102]


     O handmaid of God!... To the mothers must be given the divine Teachings
and effective counsel, and they must be encouraged and made eager to train
their children, for the mother is the first educator of the child.  It is she
who must, at the very beginning, suckle the new-born at the breast of God's
Faith and God's Law, that divine love may enter into him even with his mother's
milk, and be with him till his final breath.

     So long as the mother faileth to train her children, and start them on a
proper way of life, the training which they receive later on will not take its
full effect.  It is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assemblies to provide the
mothers with a well-planned programme for the education of children, showing
how, from infancy, the child must be watched over and taught.  These
instructions must be given to every mother to serve her as a guide, so that
each will train and nurture her children in accordance with the Teachings.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa:
           &amp;Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 113, p. 138)                 [103]


...we must not make distinctions between individual members of the human
family.  We must not consider any soul as barren or deprived. Our duty lies in
educating souls so that the Sun of the bestowals of God shall become
resplendent in them, and this is possible through the power of the oneness of
humanity.  The more love is expressed among mankind and the stronger the power
of unity, the greater will be this reflection and revelation, for the greatest
bestowal of God is love.  Love is the source of all the bestowals of God.
Until love takes possession of the heart, no other divine bounty can be
revealed in it.

6.   &amp;Qur'an 55:2
+P 39

In brief, the assumption of superiority by man will continue to be depressing
to the ambition of woman, as if her attainment to equality was creationally
impossible; woman's aspiration toward advancement will be checked by it, and
she will gradually become hopeless.  On the contrary, we must declare that her
capacity is equal, even greater than man's.  This will inspire her with hope
and ambition, and her susceptibilities for advancement will continually
increase.  She must not be told and taught that she is weaker and inferior in
capacity and qualification.  If a pupil is told that his intelligence is less
than his fellow pupils, it is a very great drawback and handicap to his
progress.  He must be encouraged to advance by the statement, "You are most
capable, and if you endeavour, you will attain the highest degree."
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", pp. 76-77)                                              [105]


     The purpose, in brief, is this:  that if woman be fully educated and
granted her rights, she will attain the capacity for wonderful accomplishments
and prove herself the equal of man.  She is the coadjutor of man, his
complement and helpmeet....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 136)                                                 [106]


     The realities of things have been revealed in this radiant century, and
that which is true must come to the surface.  Among these realities is the
principle of the equality of man and woman -- equal rights and prerogatives in
all things appertaining to humanity.  &amp;Baha'u'llah declared this reality over
fifty years ago.  But while this principle of equality is true, it is likewise
true that woman must prove her capacity and aptitude, must show forth the
evidences of equality.  She must become proficient in the arts and sciences and
prove by her accomplishments that her abilities and powers have merely been
latent.  Demonstrations of force, such as are now taking place in England, are
neither becoming nor effective in the cause of womanhood and equality.  Woman
must especially devote her energies and abilities toward the industrial and
agricultural sciences, seeking to assist mankind in that which is most needful.
By this means she will demonstrate capability and ensure recognition of
equality in the social and economic equation.  Undoubtedly God will confirm her
in her efforts and endeavours, for in this century of radiance &amp;Baha'u'llah
has proclaimed the reality of the oneness of the world of humanity and
announced that all nations, peoples and races are one....
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
           &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", pp. 283-84)                                             [107]


Equality of the sexes will be established in proportion to the increased
opportunities afforded woman in this age, for man and woman are equally the

                                     - 37 -
+P 40

recipients of powers and endowments from God, the Creator.  God has not
ordained distinction between them in His consummate purpose.
          ("The Promulgation of Universal Peace:  Talks Delivered by
          &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in
           1912", p. 300)                                                 [108]


     Woman must endeavour then to attain greater perfection, to be man's equal
in every respect, to make progress in all in which she has been backward, so
that man will be compelled to acknowledge her equality of capacity and
attainment.

     In Europe women have made greater progress than in the East, but there is
still much to be done!  When students have arrived at the end of their school
term an examination takes place, and the result thereof determines the
knowledge and capacity of each student.  So will it be with woman; her actions
will show her power, there will no longer be any need to proclaim it by words.

     It is my hope that women of the East, as well as their Western sisters,
will progress rapidly until humanity shall reach perfection.

     God's Bounty is for all and gives power for all progress.  When men own
the equality of women there will be no need for them to struggle for their
rights!  One of the principles then of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the equality of sex.

     Women must make the greatest effort to acquire spiritual power and to
increase in the virtue of wisdom and holiness until their enlightenment and
striving succeeds in bringing about the unity of mankind.  They must work with
a burning enthusiasm to spread the Teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah among the peoples,
so that the radiant light of the Divine Bounty may envelop the souls of all the
nations of the world!

Extracts From Letters Written by Shoghi Effendi:


     Regarding the position of the &amp;Baha'i women in India and Burma, and their
future collaboration with the men in the administrative work of the Cause, I
feel that the time is now ripe that those women who have already conformed to
the prevailing custom in India and Burma by discarding the veil should not only
be given the right to vote for the election of their local and national
representatives, but should themselves be eligible to the membership of all
&amp;Baha'i Assemblies throughout India and Burma, be they local or national.

     This definite and most important step, however, should be taken with the
greatest care and caution, prudence and thoughtfulness.  Due regard must be
paid to their actual capacity and present attainments, and only those who are

                                     - 38 -
+P 41

best qualified for membership, be they men or women, and irrespective of social
standing, should be elected to the extremely responsible position of a member
of the &amp;Baha'i Assembly.

     This momentous decision, I trust, will prove to be a great incentive to
the women &amp;Baha'is throughout India and Burma who, I hope, will now bestir
themselves and endeavour to the best of their ability to acquire a better and
more profound knowledge of the Cause, to take a more active and systematic part
in the general affairs of the Movement, and prove themselves in every way
enlightened, responsible and efficient co-workers to their fellow-men in their
common task for the advancement of the Cause throughout their country.

     May they fully realize their high responsibilities in this day, may they
do all in their power to justify the high hopes we cherish for their future,
and may they prove themselves in every respect worthy of the noble mission
which the &amp;Baha'i world is now entrusting to their charge.
          (27 December 1923 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and
           Burma)                                                         [110]


Full rights have been accorded to &amp;Baha'i women residing in the cradle of the
Faith, to participate in the membership of both national and local &amp;Baha'i
Spiritual Assemblies, removing thereby the last remaining obstacle to the
enjoyment of complete equality of rights in the conduct of the administrative
affairs of the Persian &amp;Baha'i Community.

     That the members of this community, of either sex and of every age, of

ever-watchful, ever-sustaining Providence, and lend thereby a tremendous
impetus to the propelling forces mysteriously guiding the operations of this
newly-launched, unspeakably potent, world-encompassing Crusade, is one of the
dearest wishes which a loving and longing heart holds for them at this great

     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has pointed out that "Among the miracles which distinguish
this sacred dispensation is this, that women have evinced a greater boldness
than men when enlisted in the ranks of the Faith."  Shoghi Effendi has further
stated that this "boldness" must, in the course of time, "be more convincingly
demonstrated, and win for the beloved Cause victories more stirring than any it
has as yet achieved."  Although obviously the entire &amp;Baha'i world is
committed to encouraging and stimulating the vital &amp;role of women in the
&amp;Baha'i community as well as in society at large, the Five Year Plan calls
specifically on eighty National Spiritual Assemblies to organize &amp;Baha'i
activities for women.  In the course of the current year which has been
designated "International Women's Year" as a world-wide activity of the United
Nations, the &amp;Baha'is, particularly in these eighty national communities,
should initiate and implement programs which will stimulate and promote the
full and equal participation of women in all aspects of &amp;Baha'i community
life, so that through their accomplishments the friends will demonstrate the
distinction of the Cause of God in this field of human endeavour.

the life of &amp;Baha'i communities; the nurturing of a deeper understanding of
&amp;Baha'i family life; the &amp;Baha'i education of children, including the
holding of regular &amp;Baha'i classes and, where necessary, the establishment of
tutorial schools for the provision of elementary education; the encouragement
of &amp;Baha'i youth in study and service; and the encouragement of &amp;Baha'i
women to exercise to the full their privileges and responsibilities in the work

The equality of men and women is not, at the present time, universally applied.
In those areas where traditional inequality still hampers its progress we must

      The princip1e of the equality between women and men, like the other
teachings of the Faith, can be effectively and universally established among
the friends when it is pursued in conjunction with all the other aspects of
&amp;Baha'i life.  Change is an evolutionary process requiring patience with
one's self and others, loving education and the passage of time as the
believers deepen their knowledge of the principles of the Faith, gradually
discard long-held traditional attitudes and progressively conform their lives
to the unifying teachings of the Cause.
