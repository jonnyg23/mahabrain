         Hand of the Cause Miss Agnes B. Alexander 
                      (Circa 1900)  
 
     "Your name will forever remain associated with the rise of the 
Faith and its establishment in Japan and the record of your incessant 
and splendid endeavors will shed on its annals a lustre that time can 
never dim."  (Shoghi Effendi, June 8, 1933)  
 
+P5 
                              Introduction 
 
     As early as 1903 and for years thereafter, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha urged 
&amp;Baha'is to travel to Japan to spread the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  On 
occasion He said He Himself would like to go to Japan, and also to 
some other countries.  
     In 1908 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha wrote to an American believer, Mr. 
Howard McNutt+F1, "A trip of the believers of God to the Orient is of 
the utmost importance and it will become the cause of great connection 
between the two regions...  Perchance, God willing, in Japan, 
you may lay the foundation for the Kingdom!"  
     In 1910 He said to the first two &amp;Baha'is to visit Japan, "Blessed 
results will appear from the Holy Cause established in that land.  I 
have sent your letter regarding the work in Japan to Mr. McNutt in 
New York, that he may spread the word for some of the American 
&amp;Baha'is to go to Japan, and there serve and teach the Cause.  It is 
very good for teachers to travel, and, through the love of God, give 
life to the people.  American &amp;Baha'is should go to Oriental countries 
as teachers."  
     The first &amp;Baha'is to make the long voyage, Mr. Howard Struven+F2 
and Mr. C.M. Remey, 1909; Mme. Aurelia Bethlen, 1911; Mr. 
and Mrs. Dreyfus-Barney, 1914, stayed for brief periods of time and 
continued around the world.  Dr. George Augur and Miss Agnes 
Alexander both arrived in 1914--Miss Alexander shortly after Dr. 
Augur.  They sailed to Japan with the intention of residing there for 
some time.  All these believers traveled in response to the wishes of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Besides Japan, He also encouraged travel in those 
early days to China, India, Persia and other Asian countries.  
     In the Tablet of the Divine Plan written to the &amp;Baha'is of the 
United States and Canada, Japan is mentioned six times and the 
Japanese language itself once.  In those Tablets &amp;Abdu'l-Baha again 
urged travel.  "How good would it be were there any possibility of a 
commission composed of men and women, to travel together through 
China and Japan..."  
     In 1919 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha wrote to Mr. Roy Wilhelm+F1, "Attach great 
importance to the Japanese people.  Mrs. Magee should continually 
communicate with them."  And again, later in the year to the same 
believer, "Convey to Mr. Nasu+F3, the Japanese, my greeting and say:  
The world of nature is darkness but the heavenly Sun dissipates by 
its light this darkness that prevails over the world.  Likewise the world 
of mind and of souls is a dark one and nothing will illuminate it save 
 
+F1 Mr. McNutt, Mr. Wilhelm and Mr. Randall were staunch and devoted American 
+F1 &amp;Baha'is who tried to help the Faith in Japan as it was &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
+F1 wish.  
+F2 Mr. Struven was designated as Herald of the Kingdom by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.

the rays of the Sun of Truth.  My hope therefore is that thou mayest 
be the cause of the shining of the Divine Teachings in Japan, that thou 
mayest vivify the dead.  The people of Japan are intelligent but they 
are in need of a leader that he may awaken them.  I hope that thou 
mayest be the cause of their awakening and may vivify them."  
     To Mr. William Randall+F1, in 1920, He wrote, "The association 
which has been formed for promoting the relationship and love between 
America and Japan, will, God willing, be confirmed and assisted.  
This association is important.  It will unquestionably, bring 
forth great results."  
 
                  ***          ***          *** 
 
     "These are His very words, that still keep ringing in my ears:  
`Japan will turn ablaze!'"  
     The title of this book was taken from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's prophecy 
of the spiritual future of Japan as quoted by Shoghi Effendi, Guardian 
of the &amp;Baha'i Faith, in his first letter to the &amp;Baha'is of Japan, 
January 26, 1922.

     We have taken the liberty of adding a few words, for the sake of 
continuity, and also that the reader, knowing something of the individuals 
and circumstances might better observe the creative power in 
the words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi as reflected in the lives 
and actions of the recipients.

               Miss Agnes B. Alexander 
                      1875-1971 
 
     The year was 1913, and Miss Alexander recalls:  "My only desire 
was to serve His Cause.  The words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha rang in my 
ears:  `I have a lamp in My Hand searching through the lands and seas 
to find souls who can become heralds of the Cause.  Day and night I 
am engaged in this work.' 
     "I prayed that His lamp might find me.  For nearly twelve years 
I had been privileged to assist in establishing His Cause in Hawaii.  
Now the time had come when I was free to go forth to serve in other 
parts of His lands...  I received a Tablet from the Master which contained 
the first intimation that He wished me to travel to Japan.  He 
wrote in part:  `Therefore if thou travelest toward Japan unquestionably 
Divine confirmations shall descend upon thee.' 
     "Through the Divine favors all difficulties were overcome and I 
sailed ... reaching Japan November 1, 1914."  
     Between the time of her arrival and 1967 when she left for the 
last time, Miss Alexander spent a total of about 31 years in Japan.  
The rest of her time was spent in Hawaii or other parts of the world 
teaching the Faith.  
     Shoghi Effendi referred to Miss Alexander as a "distinguished 
pioneer" and wrote the following to her regarding her role in the development 
of the Faith.  
     "Your glorious services in those remote regions of the earth 
(China and Japan) are never to be forgotten.  I ever pray on your behalf 
and wish you to remember the sacred interests of the Cause in far-away 
Japan as you are that radiant herald who has raised the Call of 
Salvation in its very heart and to whom it owes a great debt of gratitude...  
I never, never forget you."  (January 27, 1924)  
     "I feel that your destiny lies in that far-off and promising country 
(Japan) where your noble and pioneer services future generations 
will befittingly glorify and thankfully remember."  (January 10, 1928)  
     Miss Alexander received thirteen Tablets from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
They are quoted below.  
 
+P10 
          Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to 
             Miss Agnes Alexander 
 
O thou maid-servant of God!  
     The tongues have spoken of thy attraction to God, and the pens 
have testified of thy burning by the Fire of the Love of God.  Indeed 
the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha approves of this because it feels its heat 
from this distant and Blessed Spot.  
     O maid-servant of God!  By God, the Truth, the Spirit of Christ 
from the Supreme Concourse doth in every time and aspect announce 
to thee this great good-news.  
     Be, therefore a divine bird, proceed to thy native country, spread 
the wings of sanctity over those spots and sing and chant and celebrate 
the name of thy Lord, that thou mayest gladden the Supreme Concourse 
and make the seeking souls hasten unto thee as moths hasten 
to the lamp and thus illumine that distant country by the Light of God.  
          (Translated by Anton Haddad.  Received in Paris, June, 1901)

+P11 
O thou bird warbling in the Garden of the Love of God!  
     Thank God that He has illumined thy insight, led thee unto the 
Fire glowing in the tree of man; caused thee to utter His Praise among 
the creatures and guided certain women to whom thou spoke the Word 
of God.  
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily thy Lord lighteth the lamp of Love 
in the heart of whomsoever He chooseth.  This is indeed the great 
happiness.  He confirmeth him in the service of the Supreme Vineyard.  
     I pray God to confirm the relatives in attaining to the Brilliant 
Light, to let the light of Insight shine forth to the hearts and sights; to 
aid thy friends in being illumined by the Light of El &amp;Baha and fed 
from the Heavenly Table, and to make thee empty, void from the 
thoughts of the life of this world and filled with the Love of thy Lord, 
ready for His service, uttering His Praise and demonstrating with 
proofs the appearance of the Kingdom of God.  
          (Translated by Mirza Ameen, Chicago, Illinois, January 25, 1903)  
 
O thou seeker of the Kingdom!  
     Thy letter was received.  I prayed at the Court of Holiness to 
deliver thee from the darkness of the attachment to this world, enlighten 
thee by the Divine Illumination and purify the mirror of thy 
heart, so that the Rays of the Sun of Truth may shine therein.  
     Permission is granted thee to marry Mr. W ... W ... but thou 
must try with heart and soul to guide him and cause him to enter under 
the Shade of the Covenant and Testament, so that ye may become 
united as one soul in two bodies and be engaged in the service of the 
Kingdom.  
          (Translated by Ahmad Sohrab, Chicago, August 14, 1909.  Received 
          in Honolulu, September 8, 1909)  
 
O maid-servant of God!  
     Thy letter was received.  Thou hast written something about Mr. 
Remey.  In reality that youth is the son of the Kingdom and the herald 
of the appearance of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  All the believers of God and 
the maid-servants of the Merciful must summon the people to the 
Kingdom and be the means of the guidance of their souls.  They must 
live and conduct themselves in such a manner so that they may become 
distinguished above other people in sanctity, prayerfulness and 
humility.  I hope that thou mayest attain to this station and become 
the cause of the diffusion of the Manifest Light.  
          (Translated by Ahmad Sohrab, August 16, 1913, Ramleh, Egypt.  
          Received in Honolulu, September 15, 1913)  
 
+P12 
O thou dear daughter!  
     Thy letter was received.  It became the cause of infinite rejoicing 
for it expressed eloquently thy faith and thy turning thy face toward 
the Kingdom of God.  This light of guidance which is ignited in 
the lamp of thy heart must become more brilliant day by day and shed 
its light to all parts.  Therefore, if thou travelest toward Japan 
unquestionably Divine confirmations shall descend upon thee.  
     Convey the utmost kindness to Mrs. ... on my behalf and say:  
The doors of the Kingdom of God are open, the Call of the Lord of 
the Kingdom is raised, the Bestowals of the Almighty are endless and 
the effulgence of the Sun of Reality has illumined the East and the 
West.  In such a time patience and tranquility are not allowable.  Thou 
must engage with infinite joy and happiness in the mention of the 
Forgiving Lord.  
          (Translated by Ahmad Sohrab, October 31, 1913, Ramleh, Egypt.  
          Received in Brooklyn, New York, January 1914)  
 
O thou my dear daughter!  
     Thy letter was received.  It imparted great happiness.  Praise be 
to God that that dear daughter is sacrificing herself in the path of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and enduring every difficulty.  
     It is now more advisable for thee to depart directly to Japan and 
while there be engaged in the diffusion of the fragrances of God.  From 
there thou mayest return to India and from India to the Holy Land.  
     Today the greatest of all divine bestowals is teaching the Cause 
of God for it is fraught with confirmations.  Every teacher is confirmed 
and is favored at the Divine Threshold.  In the estimation of the Ideal 
King, the army which is in the front of the battlefield is encircled with 
the glances of His mercifulness and in the sight of the Divine Farmer, 
the sower of the seed is accepted and favored.  
     I hope that thou mayest be like unto a realm conquering army 
and a farmer, therefore thy voyage to Japan is preferred to everything 
else.  Still thou are perfectly free.  
          (Mount Carmel, Haifa, August 4, 1914.  Received in Geneva, 
          Switzerland, August 22, 1914)  
 
O thou heavenly daughter!  
     Thy letter through Mr. Hannen was received from Japan; likewise 
the letters of Mr. Fukuta.  The contents of both letters imparted 
exceeding joy, for each word was an eloquent tongue explaining the 
wonders of the Love of God and elucidating the story of the attraction 
of the heart with the Breaths of the Holy Spirit.  
 
+P13 
     Praise be to God that thou hast become assisted to promulgate 
the Word of God in Japan.  Ere long this circle in Japan will be enlarged 
obtaining heavenly blessings.  
     God says in the glorious Qur'an:  "A seed, growing out of it seven 
ears, and God is able to double this for whomsoever He willeth."  This 
verse means:  Whenever the Word of Truth is proclaimed, it is like 
unto a seed, which sown in a pure soil brings forth seven ears and 
every ear produces one hundred kernels, and God says again that for 
whomsoever He desireth, He will double this number, that is, He will 
make the seven hundred kernels fourteen hundred.  
     Now I hope that thy call in Japan may be like unto that seed, so 
that it may obtain heavenly blessing and benediction, and the souls 
be educated and taught the oneness and singleness of God, the truthfulness 
of the prophets and the usefulness of the Divine Teachings.  
     An answer is written to the letters of Mr. Fukuta and forwarded.  
Present it to him.  
          (Translated by Ahmad Sohrab, Haifa, October 27, 1916.  Received in 
          Tokyo, February 7, 1917)  
 
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  
     Thy letter dated July 15, 1916 was received.  Its contents indicated 
that thou hast organized a meeting in Japan.  Consider thou 
what a great favor God hast bestowed that such spiritual meetings are 
being held in Tokyo and such heavenly gifts are being distributed.  
     God says in the Qur'an:  "The example of the people of faith is 
like unto a field which obtains freshness and verdancy from the rain 
descending from the clouds, attaining to full fruition and finding the 
blessings of the Kingdom.  There is no doubt that day by day it will 
grow and develop and in the end the ears of the sheaves will be laden 
with God's benediction bringing forth one hundred fold."  
     Now, ye are the fields of the plain of Reality and are under the 
protection of the educative rays of the Sun of Truth.  At every moment 
ye obtain a new vitality from the rain of divine bestowals and 
ere long ye will produce full grown seeds which are blessed by the 
care and attention of the Divine Farmer.  There is no doubt that such 
will be the end.  
     Convey on my behalf the utmost longing and greeting to the 
friends residing in Tokyo as well as the recently arrived travelers and 
say to them:  All the individuals of humanity are farmers.  Every soul 
sows a certain kind of seed, but at the season of the harvest there will 
be gathered no result except the seeds which are sown by the believers 
of God.  That alone will obtain heavenly blessings.  Reflect that 
 
+P14 
His Holiness Christ and His Holiness Muhammad scattered such holy 
seeds the fruits of which are being gathered until now, but all the other 
farmers were finally doomed to regret and disappointment.  
          (Translated by Ahmad Sohrab, Haifa, October 30, 1916.  Received in 
          Tokyo February 17, 1917)  
 
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  
     Although your letter has not yet been received, yet we do answer 
it.  Praise be to God, that in Japan thou hast been assisted in the 
accomplishment of a distinguished service.  Thou hast raised the Call of 
the Divine Kingdom and hast led the people to an illumined world and 
a heavenly Cause.  Thou hast become the cause of enlightenment and 
the wisher for the education of human souls.  For those regions are in 
sheer need of Divine Teachings and are endowed with sufficient capability.  
Those souls must be emancipated from the obscurity of blind 
imitations and be illumined by the light of heavenly instructions.  
Whosoever arises for such a work, divine confirmations shall assist 
him and the power of the Kingdom shall be made manifest.  
     Effort must be exerted that the East and West may be reconciled, 
that the darkness of bigotry may vanish, that the unity of mankind may 
be made manifest and that East and West, like unto two longing souls, 
may embrace each other in the utmost love, for all are the sheep of 
God and God is the Real Shepherd and is kind to every one.  
     In accordance with the wish of the attracted maid servant of God 
to the love of God, Mrs. Maxwell, go thou to Canada and stay there 
for a time and then hasten back to Japan for in Japan you will be assisted 
and exalted.  
     Some letters are enclosed for the friends in Japan.  Forward them.  
          (Translated by Shoghi Rabbani, Haifa, December 27, 1918.  Received 
          in Montclair, New Jersey, March 8, 1919)  
 
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  
     Thy letters were received.  The travel to Japan was in the utmost 
necessity.  Thou hast undoubtedly met the attracted maid servant of 
God, Mrs. Maxwell before sailing to Japan, for that maid servant of 
God is ablaze with the Fire of the love of God.  Whosoever meets her 
feels from her association the susceptibilities of the Kingdom.  Her 
company uplifts and develops the soul.  
     Thou didst well to travel to Japan for the seed thou hast sown 
needs watering.  Capable souls are found in Japan; the Breath of the 
Merciful is necessary to stir and enliven them and to bestow a spiritual 
liveliness.  A blind soul is there but is in the utmost enkindlement 
 
+P15 
and likewise a priest lives there and is endowed with great capacity.  
I hope that thou wilt find the doors flung open and become the cause 
of the guidance of souls.  
     Convey on my behalf the utmost love and kindness to the maid 
servants of God, Elizabeth Stevens and Maud Gaudreaux.  Through 
the bounties and blessings of God, I supplicate that Mr. Weirs may 
become attracted to the Divine Kingdom and may be so enkindled with 
the love of God that he may illumine the surrounding regions.  
     Of the death of Richard Potter we were made infinitely sad, but 
that nightingale of the Kingdom has flown to the rose garden of the 
Kingdom, and that drop returned to the limitless ocean.  That wanderer 
has ascended to his original abode.  On his behalf I supplicate 
from the Threshold of Oneness pardon and forgiveness.  
     Convey on my behalf to the maid servants of God, Miss Ragina 
Sunshine, Mrs. Louise Smith and Louise Bosch the wonderful &amp;Abha 
greetings.  I have entreated and supplicated to the &amp;Abha Kingdom 
and have begged for those maid servants of the Merciful unbounded 
blessings, that each may unloosen an eloquent tongue and engage in 
the commemoration of the Beloved of the world.  
     Convey to the friends of Geyserville the intensity of my love and 
my spiritual attachment.  At dawn I entreat at the Threshold of the 
All-Knowing God and beg for them the exaltation of the Kingdom.  
     Remain for some days in Honolulu and then immediately hasten 
to Japan.  
          (Translated by Shoghi Rabbani, Haifa, July 30, 1919.  Received in 
          Tokyo November 26, 1919)  
 
O thou who art the daughter of the Kingdom!  
     Thy letter has been received.  Praise be unto God that in those 
regions the Breezes of the Rose Garden of &amp;Abha are spreading.  It is 
my hope that they (those regions) would become perfumed; the 
Breezes of Favor would waft, the Lights of Guidance would radiate 
and the Graces of the Merciful would unveil.  
     Convey on my behalf respectful greetings to Mrs. Finch.  I hope 
that you two would in the utmost affection and union start in the service 
of the Kingdom, become the cause that that dark country may 
become illumined and that the Breezes of the Heavenly Rose Garden 
may be spread.  
     Convey my deepest love and affection to Mr. Torii and Mr. 
Inouye and Mr. Saiki, and also to all others.  Through the graces of 
the Beauty of &amp;Abha I cherish the hope that those souls will become 
sublime emblems and fruitful trees in this Supreme Paradise because 
 
+P16 
a productive man is like unto a tree which is fruitful and of large 
shadow and so he is the ornament of the garden of Paradise.  
     This world, though apparently ornamented, yet its ornamentation 
is like unto the freshness of the flowers on the meadow whose prosperity 
lasts but for a short time, fading speedily through the heat of the 
sun and the blowing of the wind.  The Heavenly Trees, however, are 
always green, fresh, full of blossoms and continually yielding fruits.  
They remain till Eternity in perfect fineness, freshness and vigor.  
     Extend my great kindness and praise to the maid servant of God, 
Fuyo (Yuri) Mochizuki, so that she may, with a divine power, a

O thou who wanderest in the divine Path!  
     In the path of God thou didst leave behind thy familiar country 
and traveled to those distant regions, so that thou mayest spread the 
Teachings of God and give the people the Glad Tidings of the Kingdom 
of God.  Be assured that confirmations will reach thee and thou 
wilt become assisted in accomplishing a great service to the world of 
humanity.  Thousand tidings may reach thee!  
     Thy brother Ono San, also will be confirmed and with utmost 
joy and happiness he will come back.

O thou who proclaimest the Kingdom of God!  
     Thy letter has been received and gave much joy.  Praise be to 
God that the confirmations of the Kingdom of &amp;Abha reached and thou 
becamest the cause of guidance of the souls.  It is my hope that in 
Korea thou wilt raise the banner of the Greatest Guidance.  Convey

     Dr. George Jacob Augur, a dedicated and deeply spiritual "Disciple 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha"+F1 received several Tablets from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
At the Master's summons Dr. Augur left his home in Honolulu and 
went to Japan.  He arrived the first time in June 1914 and stayed until 
April 1915.  He made several other trips to Japan with his wife, Ruth, 
also a firm believer.  The Augurs worked closely with Miss Alexander 
to establish the Faith in Japan.  While there Dr. Augur lived in the 
Japanese style, learned Japanese and wore the kimono.  With &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
permission he returned to Hawaii to stay in 1919.

O thou dear son!  
     From thy letter the fragrance of the rose garden of significances 
was inhaled, that praise be to God, thou art assisted by the Divine 
confirmations, hast found the way to the Kingdom of God and thy 
heart and soul are quickened.  Arise thou to perform the blessed intention 
thou art holding and travel thou to Japan and lay there the 
foundation of the Cause of God, that is, summon the people to the 
Kingdom of God.  Japan has great capacity, but there needs be a 
teacher who will speak by the confirmations of the Holy Spirit.  I hope 
thou wilt become assisted in this.  
          (Translated by Ahmad Sohrab, Ramleh, Egypt, November 21, 1913)  
 
O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom!  
     Thy letter was received.  It indicated, praise be to God, that in 
the matter of advancing toward the Kingdom of God thou art firm and 
steadfast and thou hast resolved to go to Japan to spread the Divine 
Teachings.  This lofty magnanimity befits praise.  I hope thou mayest 
become confirmed therein and in the affairs of the Kingdom thou 
mayest follow the inspiration and the teachings of God and not any 
human suggestion.  Rest assured that thou wilt become assisted.

O thou herald of the Kingdom of God!  
     Thy letter was received.  A thousand times bravo to thy magnanimity 
and exalted aim!  Trusting in God and while turning thy face 
toward the Kingdom of &amp;Abha, unfurl thou the divine Flag in Tokyo 
and cry at the top of thy voice:  "O ye people.  The Sun of Reality 
hath appeared and flooded all regions with its glorious light; it has 
upraised the Standard of Oneness of the world of humanity and summoned 
all mankind to the refulgent Truth.  The cloud of Mercy is 
pouring, the zephyr of Providence is wafting and the world of humanity 
is being stirred and moved.  The Divine Spirit is conferring 
eternal life, the heavenly lights are illumining the hearts, the table of 
the sustenance of the Kingdom is spread and adorned with all kinds 
of foods and victuals.  O ye concourses of men!  Awake!  Awake!  
Become mindful!  Become mindful!  Open ye the seeing eye!  Unstop 
the hearing ear!  Hark!  Hark!  The soft notes of the Heavenly Music 
are streaming down, ravishing the ears of the people of spiritual discernment.  
Ere long this transcendent Light will wholly enlighten the 
East and West!"
     In short, with a resounding voice, with a miraculous power, and 
with the magnetism of the Love of God, teach thou the Cause of God 
and rest assured that the Holy Spirit shall confirm thee.

     On August 8, 1915 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's secretary wrote:  "Your 
beautiful petition ... was read to the Beloved ... as He was walking 
to and fro in the parlor of the Pilgrim House.  His face beamed with 
a heavenly smile as he heard your name.  He said:  `Write to Dr. Augur 
to return to Japan as soon as the first opportunity offers itself to him.  
Great blessings will descend upon the soul who teaches the Cause in 
that country.  Its people are endowed with great capability.  Should 
five or six of them be thoroughly grounded in the teachings of this 
Cause and attracted with its fire, great results will be forthcoming.'"  
 
O ye the two doves nestling in the garden of the Love of God!  
     Your detailed letter was received.  Your services at this spot are 
recognized and appreciated, particularly (your services) in Tokyo.  
Praise be to God that in that region ye have been assisted in diffusing 
the musk-scented perfume, and this in future is pregnant with remarkable 
results.  These few seeds of corn that ye have sown in that 
soil shall lead to luxuriant crops, this limited number of souls will be 
converted into great cohorts, nay, rather into an imposing spiritual 
army, and that seed, under the Divine Direction, shall yield abundant 
and heavy clusters.  
     Praise ye God that ye have been assisted with such Divine 
Bounty.  Ye have sown some seeds and now watering is needed.  If 
souls should undertake a voyage from America or Honolulu to the land 
of Japan, the teachings of God shall thereby be swiftly propagated and 
important consequences shall result.  You two have fulfilled your roles 
and have striven within the limits of your capacity.  At present ye must 
rest for a time; the turn of others has arrived, that they may similarly 
travel to Japan, may water the seeds that have been sown and may 
serve and take care of the tender shrubs.  The days of life are swiftly 
going by, and eventually man will be confined into subterranean regions 
and his name shall perish, except those souls who become Divine 
gardeners and who sow seeds in the soil of hearts.  Those shall 
eternally remain shining and glittering like unto stars from the horizon 
of Truth.

     Mr. Kanichi+F1 Yamamoto has the distinction of being the first 
Japanese believer.  He immigrated from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, 
to Hawaii, where he worked in the home of the family of a believer.  
Also living there was one of the early &amp;Baha'is of Hawaii, Miss Elizabeth 
Muther.  
     Miss Muther wrote to a friend on September 8, 1902, "After I 
became a believer I felt that sometime I might tell (Mr. Yamamoto).  
I prayed that his heart might be prepared to receive the truth.  Although 
it was a little difficult to give him the Message because of his imperfect 
knowledge of English, yet God helped me so that he understands 
perfectly and is rejoicing in the Knowledge of His Truth.  I have just

had a little talk with him and he told me how happy he was and that 
he expects to write his letter to the Master this evening."  
     Mr. Yamamoto rewrote his letter four times before he was satisfied.  
"He felt that he could not write in English, so I told him that I 
thought it would be all right for him to write in Japanese.  I was sure 
the Master would understand the spirit of his letter.  Mr. Yamamoto 
said that although his letter was written in Japanese, the Master fully 
answered him."  
     Mr. Yamamoto wrote other letters to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Japanese.  
At the time no one in the Holy Land could read Japanese.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
secretary recorded that He said, "I will turn to &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and He will tell me what to say."  He always answered Mr. 
Yamamoto's questions.  
     Mr. Yamamoto later lived in the Berkeley-Oakland area of 
California.  When &amp;Abdu'l-Baha visited Oakland in 1912, Mr. Yamamoto 
had the privilege of arranging a meeting for him at the Japanese 
Independent Church.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's talk is quoted in Ch. 6.  
 
               Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to 
                  Mr. Kanichi Yamamoto 
 
O thou who art attracted by the Word of God to the Kingdom of God!  
     Turn with the whole of thy being to God, forget aught else save 
God, and supplicate God to make thee a sign of guidance in the midst 
of people who are veiled from God; perchance they may be guided to 
the Orb of all horizons, enter the kingdom of harmony, drink of the 
cup of the love of God, rejoice at the manifestation of the Kingdom 
of God, taste the delight of the mention of God, and shelter themselves 
in the shadow of the Tree of Life in the midst of the Paradise of God.  
     This beseemeth the believers; this is the qualification of the sincere; 
this is the path of the knowers; and this is the utmost aim of the 
faithful.  
     Exert thy utmost power that thou mayest share this great bounty.  
          (1902)  
 
O thou who hast addressed &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  
     Verily, I pray my Lord to teach thee a language and writing of 
the Kingdom which will satisfy thee, so as to dispense with all things; 
for that spiritual writing and instructive tongue are eloquent, clear, 
 
+P22 
laudable, legible, read by the tongue and preserved in the heart.  
Blessed is he who knows it in the world of man!  
     Know, verily, that the Ocean is waving, the Sun shining, the Stars 
dawning.  (Understand what I say!)  
     The tree will grow, the earth will send forth hyacinths+F1 and give 
blessings, and man will become of the heavenly angels.  Feed on the 
light of guidance and impart light to the people.  The bird will warble 
melodies unknown save by the birds of heaven; then tear asunder the 
veil and see the realities of things with the eye of God.  Verily, thy 
Lord guideth whomsoever He willeth unto the Straight Path!  
     The Promised Spot will be made a racecourse for the steeds of 
the race of Knowledge and the lights of the Merciful will shine upon 
it.  The dispersed ones will return to the Center of Gathering and the 
birds will return from the meadows of the world unto the Nest of 
Harmony.  This is a preordained matter.  
     As to thee:  Thou hast borne every difficulty and hardship and 
soon will be rewarded by God with a good reward.  He will destine to 
thee all that is good, and choose for thee the manifestation of His 
mercy among the servants; that they may thus see that the Sons of 
the Kingdom have gone out+F2, while there hath come a soul from the 
remotest horizon who hath entered the Kingdom of God.  
          (January 1903)  
 
O thou youth of God!  
     Thank God that thou hast found thy way to the Radiant Kingdom, 
torn asunder the veil of superstition and learned the reality of 
the mysteries.  
     All the people have formed a god in the world of thought, and 
that form of their own imagination they worship; when the fact is that 
the imagined form is finite and the human mind is infinite+F3.  Surely 
the infinite is greater than the finite, for imagination is accidental (or 
non-essential) while the mind is essential; surely the essential is greater 
than the accidental.  
     Therefore consider:  All the sects and peoples worship their own 
thought; they create a god in their own minds and acknowledge him 
to be the creator of all things, when that form is a superstition--thus 
people adore and worship imagination (or illusion).  
 
+F1 Hyacinth--the flower of knowledge.  
+F2 Comparing those near at hand who disobeyed the command of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
+F2 with the recipient of this Tablet, a Japanese.  
+F3 Infinite in regard to imagination, for without the mind there would be no 
+F3 imagination.  
 
+P23 
     The Essence of the Divine Entity and the Unseen of the unseen 
is holy above imagination and is beyond thought.  Consciousness doth 
not reach It.  Within the capacity of comprehension of a produced (or 
created) reality that Ancient Reality cannot be contained.  It is a different 
world; from it there is no information; arrival thereat is impossible; 
attainment thereto is prohibited and inaccessible.  This much is 
known:  It exists and Its existence is certain and proven--but the 
condition is unknown.  
     All the philosophers and the doctors know that It is, but they were 
perplexed in the comprehension of Its existence and were at last discouraged, 
and in great despair they left this world.  For the comprehension 
of the condition and mysteries of that Reality of realities and 
Mystery of mysteries there is need for another power and another 
sense.  That power and sense is not possessed by mankind, therefore 
they have not found any information.  For example:  If a man possess 
the power of hearing, the power of tasting, the power of smelling and 
the power of feeling but no power of seeing, he cannot see.  Hence, 
through the powers and senses present in man the realization of the 
Unseen Reality, which is pure and holy above the reach of doubts, is 
impossible.  Other powers are needed and other senses required.  If 
those powers and senses are obtained, then information can be had; 
otherwise, not.  
     As to the question of marriage, according to the law of God; First 
you must select one, and then it depends upon the consent of the father 
and mother.  Before your selection they have no right of interference.  
     Endeavor as much as thou canst to acquire the English language 
with the utmost eloquence and excellence, so that thou mayest be 
enabled to translate the Tablets into the Japanese tongue.  This is my 
advice.  Certainly exert thy utmost endeavor to attain this bounty.  
          (Date unknown)  
 
O thou who art the single one of Japan and the unique one of the 
extreme Orient!  
     That country hath been deprived of the divine breath until this 
time; now, God be praised! thou art initiated in the mysteries and 
conscious of the secrets of the lights.  
     Thou hast been earthly, I hope that thou wilt become heavenly; 
thou hast been gloomy, I desire that thou wilt become luminous.  Thou 
wert wandering in the wilderness, thou hast found a way to the abode 
of the Beloved One; thou wert a thirsty fish, thou hast attained to the 
endless Ocean; thou wert a roving bird, thou hast reached the divine 
 
+P24 
Rose Garden; thou wert spiritually sick and thou hast found real health!  
     Now is the time that thou shouldst entirely abandon the comfort, 
ease, enjoyment and the life of this transient world, and wholly 
arise to guide the people of Japan, illuminating faces, perfuming nostrils 
and conquering, through the heavenly hosts and divine reinforcements, 
the hearts of the people of that region.  
     Do not wonder at the favor and bounty of the Lord.  By the favor 
of God, how often a drop hath become undulating like a sea, and 
an atom become shining like the sun!  
     The Sun of Truth hath enlightened the divine world and illumined 
the universe.  The rays of His grace have shone upon the East and West, 
and His heat hath caused vegetation in all countries.  So the lights and 
the heat of the Sun of Truth being help and assistance, what more dost 
thou need?  
     Thou must warble, like the nightingale of significances, in the 
rose garden so that thou mayest inspire all the birds of the meadow 
to chant and to sing.

To Miss Elizabeth Muther in Hawaii 
     I have written a reply to the letter of Kwanichi Yamamoto and 
have enclosed it with this letter.  I ask God to make him a sign of 
guidance and to guide through him souls of his native land and of other 
people.  
          (January 25, 1903)  
 
To Mrs. Helen S. Goodall 
     The Japanese youth, K. Yamamoto should act in accord with the 
Law of God--namely--he must first choose a companion (wife) 
for himself and then his father and mother must sanction.  If their 
sanction and consent is not attained, that engagement is not completed.  
     He must acquire the English language well, so as to enable him 
to translate the Divine Tablets into the Japanese language.  
          (October 18, 1906)  
 
To Mrs. J. D. Brittingham 
     Announce greetings on My behalf, to the two young Japanese 
(Yamamoto and Fujita) and say:  His Imperial Majesty, Mikado, became 
the cause of the material progress of Japan.  I hope that you may 
become the cause of her spiritual development.  This is the principle 
of progress.  
 
+P25 
     Unless man makes spiritual progress in the world of spirit, intellect 
and heart, he cannot gather universal results from material advancements.  
Now, you must gird up the loins of endeavor, and reflect 
duly, so that ye may quicken the people of Japan through the 
Spirit of God.

To Mrs. Ella Goodall Cooper 
     It is written in Miss Barney's book that the human fetus is not 
an animal fetus although it has gone through various and complex 
transformations and metamorphosis in the womb until it has taken to 
itself human form and appearance.  Therefore that fetus was essentially 
human and the problem is solved when we realize that it has transformed 
from one form to another until it appears and manifests with 
the utmost beauty...  
     Concerning the marriage feast of the young Japanese, Kanichi 
Yamamoto.  It became the cause of great joy and I hope that this 
marriage will be conducive to great blessings.

                          1886-1976 
 
     Mr. Saichiro Fujita was the second Japanese to accept the Faith.  
Originally from Yanai, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, he immigrated 
to the United States when he was a teenager.  While he was attending 
school in Oakland, California in 1905 he was taught the Faith by Mrs. 
Kathryn Frankland.  
     He received two of the Tablets quoted below from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
in 1906 and 1907.  In 1911 he received a Tablet urging him to complete 
his professional training.  In 1912 Mr. Fujita had the privilege of 
meeting the Master and traveling with Him in the United States.  In this 
revised edition we have included one more Tablet by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
translated in 1913, because it contains a prediction about Mr. Fujita.  
     Between 1912 and 1919 there were several communications from 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha urging Mr. Fujita to study various aspects of engineering 
and also advising him to study flower culture.  In 1919 he had completed 
his studies and left for Haifa as instructed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Mr. Fujita served in the Holy Land until the end of his life except for 
the years between 1938 and 1955 which were spent in Japan.  
 
          Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to Mr. Saichiro Fujita 
 
O thou fresh plant in the garden of the Love of God!  
     What thou hast written was considered.  It was an evidence of 
following in the Pathway of Guidance, and a proof of the attraction 
of the heart to the Beauty of His Majesty, God.  
     Consider what bounty God has manifested for thee, whence thou 
art and from whence are we.  Yet, nevertheless, such a candle of love 
is burning in the hearts that its light is radiating from the East to the 
West and from the West extending to the East.  
     Rest assured thy name is registered in the Book of God, and it is 
hoped that thou mayest enter the Paradise of the Kingdom and find 
stability; to reach that which is the cause of the progress of the world 
of humanity in the world and in the Kingdom, and with perceiving eye, 
attentive ear, eloquent tongue and radiant face may serve in the 
Vineyard of God and spread the Divine Glad Tidings.  If thou art 
confirmed as thou oughtest to be, thou wilt certainly establish an 
eternal Kingdom.  This Kingdom is greater than that of Mikado, for the 
 
+P27 
sovereignty of the Emperor of Japan is for numbered days, but this 
sovereignty is lasting and will stand unto the Eternity of Eternities.  
     That sovereignty can be hidden under one handful of dust, that 
is when Mikado goes beneath the handful of dust, he is entirely effaced 
and erased, but this Kingdom withstands the greatest revolution 
of the worlds, and will stand with perfect stability unto eternity.  The 
former kingdom is established by the power of the sword, burning fire, 
devouring, and the shedding of blood, while this Kingdom is built upon 
freedom, glory, greatness and the love of God.  Consider how much 
difference there is between them.  
          (Translated by Ameen Fareed, November 10, 1906, Chicago)  
 
O thou spiritual Youth!  
     Japan has made wonderful progress in material civilization, but 
she will become perfect when she will also make spiritual developments 
and the Power of the Kingdom become manifest in her.  
     One will encounter a little difficulty in the beginning of the 
establishment of the Cause of God in that country, but later it will become 
very easy.  For the inhabitants of Japan are intelligent, sagacious, 
and have the power of rapid assimilation.  For the present a 
perfect youth like thee is favored by the Bounty of the Kingdom, and 
attained to the knowledge of the Lord of the Kingdom.  Show thou 
forth an effort that thou mayest finish that which is necessary in the 
acquisition and study of science and art; then travel thou toward the 
countries of Japan; so that thou mayest hoist the Ensign of Truth, 
waving upon the Apex of the Supreme Concourse.  Look thou not 
upon thine own capability, the Invisible Divine Confirmations are 
great, and the Protection and Providence of the Beauty of &amp;Abha is the 
helper and assistant.  When a drop draws help from the ocean, it is an 
ocean itself, and a little seed through the outpouring of rain, the favor 
of the sun, and the soul-refreshing breeze will become a tree with the 
utmost freshness, full of leaves, blossoms and fruits.  Therefore do 
not consider thy capacity and merit, but rely upon the infinite Bounty 
and trust to His Highness the Almighty.  Do not delay.  Undertake 
soon that which thou art intending.  
     There are prophecies concerning the Manifestation in the Buddhist 
books, but they are in symbols and metaphors, and some spiritual 
conditions are mentioned therein, but the leaders of religion do 
not understand.  They think these prophecies are material things, yet 
those signs are foreshadowing spiritual occurrence.

direction that thou mayest gain perfect efficiency in it--so that I may

run the electrical engines and dynamos, how to install electrical lights 
through the buildings and how to fill the batteries of the (automobile)

Faith in Japan, "After &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ascension every word He had 
written became a sacred treasure.  When I began collecting the Tablets 
He had revealed to Japanese living in Japan, and one to Koreans, 
I found there were nineteen in all."  These Tablets were published in 
1928, thus preserved for all time.  In the foreword to the book Miss 
Alexander wrote:  "The following are the Tablets which were revealed 
by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to friends residing in Japan and Korea.  There are 
nineteen Tablets revealed between the years 1916 and His passing in 
1921.  Eighteen of these Tablets were addressed to Japanese and one 
to Korean friends.  Seven of those to Japanese were to school girls in 
Tokyo, the others, with two exceptions, were to young men, and five 
of these were addressed to blind young men, three having found the 
true Light of this Day.  
     "The first supplication by a Japanese in Japan to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
was sent July, 1915 from a young student+F1 in Tokyo who wrote his 
supplication in Japanese on a scroll.  The following is the translation:  
`O my Master &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!...  Although I am a base and poor youth 
in this world, I have been awakened and bathed in the ocean of Thy 
mercy and am so happy that I pity the king and the prince who are 
wandering about in the dream of temporal variance.  Accept, O Master, 
my deep thankfulness from the bottom of the heart.  I am very 
sorry though, when I think of our fellow men who take no thought of 
real happiness and do not rely upon the warm hand of Thy love.  O 
my Lord, water me forever from the fountain of Thy mercy; I will 
never refuse Thy command whatsoever it may be.  Forgive my sins 
and allow me to awaken my fellow men.' 
     "In February 1917 a reply to this supplication was received in 
Japan from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  It had come in the contents of a letter from 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's secretary and had been passed by the censor.  This 
was the first Tablet received addressed to a Japanese resident in Japan 
and is the first herein published.  
     "The second supplication to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was sent September, 
1916 by a blind young Japanese+F2 who wrote in Esperanto.  After 
 
+F1 Mr. Kikutaro Fukuta  
+F2 Mr. Tokujiro Torii  
 
+P30 
receiving a reply from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the second Tablet herein published, 
he wrote again supplicating in English.  The following words 
are a portion of his supplication:  `O my &amp;Abdu'l-Baha whose image 
so calm and peaceful I dreamed of and it cannot be effaced from my 
heart; whose Name makes my withered heart fresh and strong and who 
makes the fountain of love and light spring up in the bottom of my 
heart whenever I think of Thee.  Make my heart to be always thirsty 
for the Fountain of Life.  Make me strong enough to be able steadily 
to hold Thy torch of love firm and high.  I confess to Thee that my 
heart sometimes withers like a flower in the day of summer, and loses 
its whole strength, nevertheless, my beloved Lord, give to me power 
that I can throw away every kind of prejudice and ignorance from my 
heart.  Make my heart as pure and fresh as green grass of the spring 
pastures and let my soul grow more and more by Thy shower of 
Mercy!'  In answer to this blind young man's supplication, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
revealed a Tablet which is the third published herein."  
     Most of the original Tablets were translated in Haifa and sent to 
the recipients in care of Miss Alexander.  One, to a group of students, 
was sent in care of Mr. Torii.  A search in later years located only 
those Tablets addressed to Mr. Torii himself.

O thou who art guided by the Light of Guidance!  (Mr. Kikutaro Fukuta)  
     Thy first and second letter was received.  Praise be to God that 
the light of Guidance shone forth, the glass of the heart became illumined 
and the darkness of ignorance dispelled.  The most Great 
Guidance is a crown the brilliant gems of which will shine upon the 
future ages and cycles.  If it is placed on the head of a servant, he 
will become the object of the envy of kings, for this is an imperishable 
crown and everlasting sovereignty.  God says in the great Qur'an, 
He particularizes with His Mercy whomsoever He desireth.  
     Praise be to God, that thou hast become especialized with Divine 
Favor and Bounty.  Thou didst become awake, beheld the lights 
and harkened unto the Melody of the Supreme Concourse.  
     In the Glorious Gospel it is said, "Freely ye have received, freely 
give."  That is, you have found this Bestowal, you have paid nothing 
for it, therefore give it to others without any exchange.  Now with a 
heavenly power, with a lordly gift, with spiritual morals, with Godlike 
deeds, and with supreme glad tidings be thou engaged in the 
promotion of the teachings of God in Japan.  The confirmations of 
the Kingdom shall encompass and the cohorts of the Realm of Might 
will grant triumph.  
          (October 28, 1916.  Translated by Ahmad Sohrab)  
 
O thou possessor of a seeing heart!  (Mr. Tokujiro Torii)  
     Although, materially speaking, thou are destitute of physical 
sight, yet, praise be to God, spiritual insight is thy possession.  Thy 
heart seeth and thy spirit heareth.  Bodily sight is subject to a thousand 
maladies and ultimately and assuredly will be obscured.  Thus 
no importance may be attached to it.  But the sight of the heart is illumined, 
it discerns and discovers the Divine Kingdom and is everlasting 
and eternal.  Praise be to God, therefore, that the sight of thy 
heart is illumined, and the hearing of thy thought responsive.  
     The meetings you have organized, wherein you feel heavenly 
emotions and comprehend realities and significances,--that meeting 
is like unto the firmament with those souls as resplendent stars 
shining with the light of guidance.  Happy is the soul that seeks, in 
this brilliant era, heavenly teachings, and blessed is the heart which 
is stirred and attracted by the love of God.  At present the Sun of Truth 
 
+P32 
has dawned upon the land of Japan and the hope is that it may be illumined 
by heavenly teachings.  
     Convey on my behalf the utmost love and longing to Mr. D. 
Inouye+F1 and Mr. S. Saiki+F1.  My hope is that those two blessed 
souls may shine like unto two heavenly stars from the horizon of Japan 
and may be the cause of its enlightenment.  That land has acquired 
material civilization and ephemeral advancement; we hope that it may 
acquire heavenly civilization.  
     Convey to thy respected wife my greetings and my message and 
the same to thy young babe, Akira+F2, whose name may be ever blessed 
for it is quite an appropriate one.  
          (December 27, 1918.  Translated by Shoghi Rabbani)  
 
O thou who hast turned thy attention to the Kingdom of God!  (Mr. 
Tokujiro Torii)  
     Thy letter arrived and imparted joy.  Thou hast been longing to 
spread the Light (the Teachings) in those regions.  My wish is also 
that the Musk of the love of God should be diffused in that land, and 
that Miss Alexander and Mrs. Finch may conjointly strive so that the 
rays of the Sun of Reality may be projected all over that country.  
     Whenever the means of travel is secured, thou art permitted to 
come.  I am supplicating God to strengthen thee and make thee grow 
like unto a lily in the Garden of the Kingdom.  
     O faithful friend!  The inhabitants of that region (Japan) are bright 
and noble-minded.  Through the great distance however, the musky 
Breeze has not yet reached their nostrils.  They know not of the rise 
of the Sun of Reality upon the horizon of Persia.  If you who are there 
be self-sacrificing and become enkindled with the love of God, and 
like unto stars shine from the horizon of Truth, that country will before 
long be turned into a paradise of comfort.  Japan will become 
illumined, and like unto a meadow and a rose-garden will invigorate 
the hearts of every assembly.  Do ye strive as hard as possible in order 
to be attracted to the Beauty of the Beloved of the world, and 
through the fire of His love inflame that Kingdom.

O thou beloved daughter!  (Miss Yuri Mochizuki)  
     Thy letter was received and was perused in the utmost joy, that, 
praise be to God, in the land of Japan, the light of the love of God 
has appeared resplendently and a torch such as thee, has been kindled, 
for thy heart overflows with the wine of the love of God and thy spirit 
is ablaze.  Like unto a shrub, thou art fresh and tender, growing and 
flourishing through the outpourings of the cloud of Bounty.  My hope 
is that thou mayest soon bud and blossom and bring forth delectable 
fruits.  
     The Real Shepherd is undoubtedly kind unto his flock and is in 
the utmost of attachment, mercy and solicitude.  This is only a natural 
fact.  Rest thou assured, therefore, that thou art always within sight 
and art encompassed by tender cares.  
     The people of Japan are like unto a soil that has been deprived 
of rain for cycles and generations and has had no share of the outpouring 
of rain and even of dew.  Certainly it is quite athirst.  Now 
thou shouldst become the divine gardener and should satisfy that 
thirsty soil with the water of divine teachings, so that heavenly bounties 
may be poured out and the flowers of reality and fragrant herbs 
of human perfections spring forth and that land turn into a paradise 
of Eden.  
          (December 17, 1918.  Translated by Shoghi Rabbani)  
 
O thou loved maid-servant of God!  (Miss Yuri Mochizuki)  
     Do thou observe the Divine Bounty!  We are in Haifa and thou 
in Tokyo, nevertheless how (our) hearts have become related to one 
another!  This is through the power of the Kingdom which has made 
the East and West embrace each other.  
     I feel the utmost kindness towards thee.  If thou art able to write 
the story of Qurratu'l-Ayn as a drama, thou art permitted to write it.

O thou who art a new grown tree on the meadow of Truth!+F1  (Miss 
Yuri Mochizuki)  
     Thy letter dated October 14, 1920 has been received.  As it was 
indicative of the susceptibilities of thy conscience it became the cause 
of joy.  
     Japan is like unto a farm whose soil is untouched.  Such a soil 
 
+F1 Accompanying this Tablet was a Japanese translation made by Mr. Saichiro 
+F1 Fujita at the command of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
 
+P34 
as this has great capacity.  One seed produces a hundred-fold.  Now, 
praise be unto God, ye have found such a farm.  Ye must develop the 
lands; ye must free them from thorns and weeds; ye should scatter 
the seeds of the love of God thereupon, and irrigate them with the 
rain of the knowledge of God.  Rest ye assured that heavenly blessing 
will be bestowed!  
     It is my hope that in that farm ye will become divine farmers.  
The enlightened people of Japan are tired and disgusted with the superannuated 
and putrefied blind imitations.  They are assured that these 
blind imitations are pure superstitions without any truth.  Therefore 
they have capacity to hear the Call of God.  The land is untouched.  
We will have to see what the divine farmers will do!  
     At present thou hast started a journal.  It is my hope that this 
journal will shine as the Star of the East.  In the journal write thus:  
     When the horizon of the East was covered with immense darkness; 
when dark clouds were predominant, and when all the heavenly 
stars were concealed to the eye, His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah, like unto 
 
[Photograph with the following caption:] 
     Mr. and Mrs. Tokujiro Torii with Miss Alexander in 1916.  
 
+P35 
the sun shone forth from the horizon of the East and with radiating 
splendor He illumined the Orient.  
     The light of the Sun of Reality consisted of heavenly teachings 
which were spread in the Orient, because there the obscurities of blind 
imitations of religions, sectarian, racial, political, economic and home 
prejudices were in ascendancy.  The darkness of these prejudices had 
dominated the Oriental world to such a degree that it had blinded all 
the eyes and deafened all the ears.  There prevailed quarrel and strife, 
warfare and bloodshed.  
     In short, it has a long description, but I mention it briefly.  When 
the Sun of Truth shone forth with all might and energy, these obscure 
and dark clouds dispersed and the splendid Day presented to the eye 
an aspect with such freshness and beauty that the wise became astonished; 
the sick were cured; the blind received sight; the deaf obtained 
hearing; the dumb proved eloquent, and the dead quickened.  A 
heavenly table was spread in the Orient.  The divine teachings like 
unto an unshakable edifice were instituted.  
     The first principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is independent investigation of 
truth, that is, all the nations of the world have to investigate after truth 
independently and turn their eyes from the moribund blind imitations 
of the past ages entirely.  Truth is one when it is independently investigated, 
it does not accept division.  Therefore the independent investigation 
of truth will lead to the oneness of the world of humanity.  
     Another one of these teachings is the oneness of the world of 
humanity.  All mankind are the trees of the divine garden and the 
Gardener of this orchard is the Most High, the All-Sustainer.  The hand 
of His favor hath planted these trees, irrigated them from the cloud 
of Mercy and reared them with the energy of the Sun of Truth.  
     Then there remains no doubt that this heavenly Farmer (Gardener)  
is kind to all these plants.  This truth cannot be denied.  It is 
shining like unto the sun.  This is the divine policy and unquestionably 
it is greater than the human policy.  We must follow the divine policy.  
     The point is this that some people are sick; some are immature 
and ignorant, and some without any knowledge of their beginning and 
of their end.  The sick should be cured; the immature should be brought 
to maturity, and the ignorant should be taught to become wise and 
not that enmity should be exercised toward them.  
     Similarly describe fully in that journal the other teachings which 
thou art acquainted with, one by one, a detailed description.  For example, 
that religion must be the cause of concord; that it should agree 
with science and reason; that it must be a factor of progress to the 
 
+P36 
world of humanity, that it should be free from blind imitations.  Another 
example is that all prejudices are destructive to the foundation 
of the world of humanity.  
     Other examples are:  The equality of men and women; the 
universalization of knowledge (education); the creation of one 
universal language; justice and righteousness; economic facilities 
among mankind; the need of the world of humanity of the breaths of 
the Holy Spirit; the establishment of universal peace; the institution of 
the Supreme Court of Arbitration; the freedom and equality of all 
mankind; the brotherhood of the world of humanity, and other teachings 
like these which are mentioned in the Tablets of God.  Describe 
all these teachings fully in the most eloquent and sweetest terms 
expressive of the most charming realities and insert them in the journal.  
     It is my hope that thou together with Miss Alexander will be 
confirmed to accomplish this service.  Miss Alexander is the herald of 
Truth in Japan.  Rest assured that she will be confirmed and assisted.

O thou wooer of Reality!  (Mr. Tomonaga Noto+F1)  
     Thy letter was received.  Praise be to God, the sight of thy mind 
has been opened and thou hast acquired the power of spiritual 
healing.  Thou hast sought and found the Truth and hast been aware 
of Heavenly Mysteries.  
     The teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah like unto the rays of 
the sun illumined the East as well as the West, vivify the dead and 
unite the various religions.  They prove the Oneness of God, for they 
gather all communities of the world under the pavilion of the oneness 
of the world of mankind.  
     Consider how stirred the world is and in what a commotion are 
the people of the world.  Heavenly Power is needed to do away with 
this stir and agitation.  Otherwise, this great Cause will not be 
realized through human power.  Human power, no matter how strong 
it may be, it illumines like unto an ignited lamp a limited space and 
trains a small number of souls.  It is the sun which illumines all 
regions, and it is the Heavenly Power which gathers around a single 
spot all the sects and communities.  Strive therefore, that thou mayest 
serve this remarkable Power and attain unto profitable and far reaching 
results.

its contents indicated that the Sun of Reality hath begun Its radiation 
upon those regions.  It is my hope that that region may get illumination 
and the Heavenly Dawn may break forth.  This will be attained 
through the power of Faith in the Covenant.  
     Therefore we are expecting that every one of those friends may 
in that country become like a brilliant and luminous candle, and so 
the Light of Guidance may emanate upon the hearts.  
     How often it hath happened that one blessed soul hath proved 
to become the cause of guidance unto a continent.  I also congratulate 
you on (the advent of) this Blessed Day.

with this great Bestowal among the women of the world.

life time.  Do not thou be grieved because of the loss of thy sight.  
Praise be unto God, that thy insight is keen.  Do not thou lament over 
thy poverty, for the Treasury of the Kingdom is thine.  Do not thou 
worry that thou couldst not study in the material schools, because thou 
hast received lessons in the Verses of the Oneness (of God) in the 
Divine University.  
     Offer thou thanks to God that thou couldst finally attain to Truth.  
Then be thou firm and steadfast so that the doors of the most Great 
Bestowals may be opened unto thy face.  The greatest of all questions 
is steadfastness and firmness.  Every tree which is firmly rooted 
grows.

longed-for Home!  
     You have sent me your congratulations for the Feast:  I was very 
much gratified at your feelings and at the fact that such a tie exists now 
between East and West, such friendship between different nations!  
     It is evident that, through your efforts, the inhabitants of those 
regions are now inhaling the fragrances of Musk from the Garden of 
the Kingdom.  In Japan the divine proclamation will be heard as a 
formidable explosion, so that those who are ready will become uplifted

be sacrificed for His friends--I cherish the hope that ye will, day by 
day, progress more and more in the Kingdom of God; that each one 
of you will shine like unto a brilliant star from the horizon of the 
supreme Guidance, thus proving to be the cause of guidance unto 
others, giving sight unto their eyes, hearing power unto their ears and 
quickening unto their hearts.

may be converted into a brasier of the fire of the love of God; that in 
every moment thou mayest find the Light of Truth radiating; that thou 
mayest kindle the lamp of Guidance; that thou mayest seek heavenly 
joy and happiness, and mayest consecrate thy life to the service of

     Today, however, there exist many kinds of writing.  That which 
is most necessary and is assisted by divine confirmations is the 
propagation of the heavenly Call.  It is this which energizes the world 
of existence.  It is this which bestoweth life unto the dead souls, which 
refresheth the dried tree and ornamenteth it with leaves, blossoms and 
fruits.  Concentrate all thine energy in this that thou mayest make 
heavenly progress, that thou mayest attain to the light of the Sun of 
Reality, that thou mayest become the cause that the dead body of Japan

a nest has been prepared.  Then soar, that thou mayest attain to that 
nest.  This is a divine nest in the Heavenly Kingdom.  Every bird that 
attained to this nest learned a melody and also taught the birds of the 
meadows the divine harmony which moves and enraptures the East 
and the West.  Do thou therefore strive with all thy heart and soul 
that thou mayest abide in this nest and thrive till eternity.

released from the darkness of the material world, like unto the bud

Ye are like seedlings which have been planted by the hand 
of Bestowal in His Spiritual Rose-Garden.  It is my hope that through 
the warmth of the Sun of Reality, the pouring down of the showers 
of mercy and the wafting of the breezes of bestowal, ye may progress

and flowers and throw your shade over great multitudes.

Reality.  It illumines the earth and heaven, makes the star a shining 
moon, turns the speck into a huge mountain, bestows strength to the 
weak, gives everlasting healing to the sick, grants heavenly treasures 
to the poor, confirms the oppressed ones to everlasting glory and turns 
the people of darkness to those of light.  
     O heavenly friends, the doors of heaven have been opened, the 
lights of God have shone forth and the heavenly Call has been raised.  
Summon ye all humanity to listen to this Heavenly Call and invite 
them to the Celestial World, so that they may find a new spirit and 
attain to a new life.  In all conditions my heart and spirit are with you.

                         Japanese Audience 
 
     Mr. Yamamoto, the first Japanese &amp;Baha'i, arranged for &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
to speak at the Japanese Independent Church, in Oakland, 
California.  It was the only talk given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to a Japanese 
audience.  It was translated from Persian into English and then into 
Japanese.  
 
                    Talk by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to the 
                    Japanese Independent Church, 
                 Oakland, California, October 1912 
 
     It is a great happiness to be here this evening, especially for the 
reason that the members of this Association have come from the region 
of the Orient.  For a long time I have entertained a desire to meet some 
of the Japanese friends.  That nation has achieved extraordinary 
progress in a short space of time; a progress and development which 
have astonished the world.  Inasmuch as they have advanced in 
material civilization they must assuredly possess the capacity for 
spiritual development.  For this reason I have an excessive longing to 
meet them.  Praise be to God! this pleasure is now afforded me, for 
here in this city I am face to face with a revered group of the Japanese.  
According to report the people of the Japanese nation are not 
prejudiced.  They investigate reality.  Wherever they find truth they 
prove to be its lovers.  They are not attached tenaciously to blind 
imitations of ancient beliefs and dogmas.  Therefore it is my great 
desire to discourse with them upon a subject in order that the unity 
and blending together of the nations of the east and the nations of the 
west may be furthered and accomplished.  In this way religious, racial 
and political prejudice, particularly bias and sectarianism will be 
dispelled amongst men.  Any kind of prejudice is destructive to the 
body-politic.  
     When we review history from the beginning of human existence 
to the present age in which we live, it is evident all war and conflict, 
bloodshed and battle, every form of sedition has been due to some 
form of prejudice, whether religious, racial or national, to partisan bias 
and selfish prejudice of some sort.  Even today we witness an upheaval 
 
+P43 
in the Balkans, a war of religious prejudice.  Some years ago when I 
was living in Roumelia, war broke out among the religious peoples.  
There was no attitude of justice or equity whatever amongst them.  
They pillaged the properties of each other, burning each other's homes 
and houses, slaughtering men, women and children, imagining that 
such warfare and bloodshed was the means of drawing near to God.  
This clearly proved that prejudice is a destroyer of the foundations of 
the world of humanity whereas religion was meant to be the cause of 
fellowship and agreement.  
     Religion must be the cause of love.  Religion must be the cause 
of justice, for the wisdom of the Manifestations of God is directed 
toward the establishing of the bond of a love which is indissoluble.  
The bonds which hold together the body-politic are not sufficient.  
These bonds may be mentioned; for instance the bond of patriotism.  
This is evidently not a sufficient bond, for how often it happens that 
people of the same nation wage civil war amongst themselves.  The 
bond of fellowship may be racial but history proves this is not sufficiently 
strong, for tremendous wars have broken out between peoples 
of the same racial lineage.  Again the bond holding men together may 
be political.  How often it happens that the diplomacy of nations makes 
a treaty of peace one day and on the morrow a declaration of war!  It 
is historically evident and manifest that these bonds are not self-sufficient.  
     The real bond of integrity is religious in character, for religion 
indicates the oneness of the world of humanity.  Religion serves the 
world of morality.  Religion purifies the hearts.  Religion impels men 
to achieve praiseworthy deeds.  Religion becomes the cause of love 
in human hearts, for religion is a divine foundation, the foundation 
ever conducive to life.  The teachings of God are the source of illumination 
to the people of the world.  Religion is ever constructive not 
destructive.  
     The foundation of all the divine religions is one.  All are based 
upon reality.  Reality does not admit plurality, yet amongst mankind 
there have arisen differences concerning the Manifestations of God.  
Some have been Zoroastrians, some are Buddhists, some Jews, 
Christians, Muhammadans and so on.  This has become a source of 
divergence whereas the teachings of the holy souls who founded the 
divine religions are one in essence and reality.  All these have served 
the world of humanity.  All have summoned souls to peace and accord.  
All have proclaimed the virtues of humanity.  All have guided 
souls to the attainment of perfections but among the nations certain 
 
+P44 
imitations of ancestral forms of worship have arisen.  These imitations 
are not the foundation and essence of the divine religions.  Inasmuch 
as they differ from the reality and the essential teachings of 
the Manifestations of God dissensions have arisen and prejudice has 
developed.  Religious prejudice thus becomes the cause of warfare and 
battle.  
     If we abandon these time-worn blind imitations and investigate 
reality all of us will be unified.  No discord will remain; antagonism 
will disappear.  All will associate in fellowship.  All will enjoy the 
cordial bonds of friendship.  The world of creation will then attain 
composure.  The dark and gloomy clouds of blind imitations and 
dogmatic variances will be scattered and dispelled; the Sun of Reality 
will shine most gloriously.  
     Verily we should consider the divine prophets as the intermediaries, 
but mankind has made use of them as causes of dissension 
and pretexts for warfare and strife.  In reality they were the intermediaries 
of love and reconciliation.  If they were not sources of love 
and fellowship amongst men, then undoubtedly they were not true, 
for the divine wisdom and purpose in sending the prophets was the 
manifestation of love in human hearts.  Therefore we must investigate 
reality.  First of all let us determine whether these prophets were 
valid or not by using rational proofs and shining arguments, not simply 
quoting traditionary evidences, because traditions are divergent and 
the source of dissension.  
     Among the holy, divine Manifestations of God was His Holiness 
Moses.  The sending of prophets has ever been for the training 
of humanity.  They are the first educators and trainers.  If Moses has 
developed the body-politic, there is no doubt that he was a true teacher 
and educator.  This will be proof and evidence that he was a prophet.  
We shall consider how His Holiness was sent to despair, in the lowest 
degree of ignorance, and heedlessness, degraded and under conditions 
of bondage.  His Holiness Moses rescued these degraded people of 
Israel from that state of bondage.  He raised them from that condition 
of ignorance, saved them from barbarism and led them into the Holy 
Land.  He educated them, endowed them with sagacious instincts, 
made them worthy and honorable.  He civilized them, raised them to 
a higher plane of existence until they were enabled to establish a 
national sovereignty, the great kingdom of Solomon.  This proves that 
His Holiness Moses was a teacher and an educator.  He had neither 
army nor dominion, neither did he possess wealth.  It was only through 
an idealistic power that he cemented them together proving that he 
 
+P45 
was a prophet of God, an educator and trainer.  
     Likewise must we set aside prejudice in considering other divine 
educators, by investigating reality.  For instance, let us take His 
Holiness Christ.  He achieved results greater than Moses.  He educated 
the body-politic, trained mighty nations.  There is no doubt whatever 
that such souls were prophets, for the mission of prophethood is 
education, and these wondrous souls trained and educated mankind.  
     His Holiness Christ was a unique personage without helper or 
assistant.  Single and solitary he arose to train great and mighty 
nations; the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians, Chaldeans and 
Assyrians came under his influence.  He was able to bind together 
many nations, melting them together as it were and pouring them into 
one mould, changing their enmity into love, war into peace.  Under 
his influence satanic souls became veritable angels, tyrannical rulers 
became just, the human moral standard was raised.  This proves that 
His Holiness Christ was an educator, a teacher and trainer of nations.  
If we deny this it is nought but injustice.  
     Blessed souls whether Moses, Jesus, Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, 
Confucius, or Muhammad were the cause of the illumination of the 
world of humanity.  How can we deny such irrefutable proof?  How can 
we be blind to such light?  How can we dispute the validity of His 
Holiness Christ?  This is injustice.  This is a denial of reality.  Man 
must be just.  We must set aside bias and prejudice.  We must abandon 
the imitations of ancestors and forefathers.  We ourselves must 
investigate reality and be fair in judgment.  
     The old nation of Persia denied all these facts, harboring the 
utmost hatred and enmity toward other religious beliefs besides their 
own.  We have investigated reality and found that these holy souls 
were all sent of God.  All of them have sacrificed life, endured ordeals 
and tribulations in order that they might educate us.  How can such 
love be forgotten?  The light of Christ is evident.  The candle of Buddha 
is shining.  The star of Moses is sparkling.  The flame ignited by 
Zoroaster is still burning.  How can we deny them?  It is injustice.  It 
is a denial of complete evidence.  If we forsake imitations all will 
become united and no differences will remain to separate us.  
     We entertain no prejudice against Muhammed.  Outwardly the 
Arabian nation was instrumental in overthrowing the Parsee dominion, 
the sovereignty of Persia.  Therefore the old Parsee nation manifested 
the utmost contempt toward the Arabs.  But we deal justly and 
will never abandon the standard of fairness.  The Arabians were in 
the utmost state of degradation.  They were blood-thirsty and barbarous, 
 
+P46 
so savage and degraded that the Arabian father often buried his 
own daughter alive.  Consider, could any barbarian be lower than this?  
The nation consisted of warring, hostile tribal peoples inhabiting the 
vast Arabian peninsula, and their business consisted in fighting and 
pillaging each other, making captive women and children, killing each 
other.  Muhammad appeared among such a people.  He educated and 
unified these barbarous tribes, put an end to their shedding of blood.  
Through his education they reached such a degree of civilization that 
they subdued and governed continents and nations.  What a great 
civilization was established in Spain by the Muhammadans!  What a 
marvelous civilization was founded in Morocco by the Moors!  What 
a powerful caliphate or successorship was set up in Baghdad!  How 
much Islam served and furthered the cause of science!  Why then 
should we deny Muhammad?  If we deny him we awaken enmity and 
hatred.  By our prejudice we become the cause of war and bloodshed; 
for prejudice was the cause of the tremendous storm which swept 
through human history for thirteen hundred years and still continues.  
Even now in the Balkans a commotion is apparent, reflecting it.  
     The Christian people number nearly three hundred millions and 
the Muhammadans about the same.  It is no small task to do away 
with such numbers.  And furthermore why should they be obliterated?  
For these are all servants of the one God.  Let us strive to establish 
peace between Christians and Muhammadans.  Is it not better?  What 
is the benefit of war?  What is its fruitage?  For thirteen hundred years 
there has been warfare and hostility.  What good result has been 
forthcoming?  Is it not folly?  Is God pleased with it?  Is His Holiness 
Christ pleased?  Is Muhammad?  It is evident that they are not.  The 
prophets have extolled each other to the utmost.  His Holiness 
Muhammad declares Christ to be the Spirit of God.  This is an explicit 
text of the Qur'an.  He declares Christ to be the Word of God.  He 
has eulogized the disciples of Christ to the utmost.  He has bestowed 
upon Her Grace Mary, the Mother of Christ, the highest praise.  
Likewise His Holiness Christ has extolled Moses.  He spread broadcast 
the old testament, the Torah, and caused the name of Moses to reach 
unto the east and the west.  The purpose is this:--that the prophets 
themselves have manifested the utmost love toward each other but the 
nations who believe and follow them are hostile and antagonistic 
among themselves.  
     The world was in this condition of darkness when His Holiness 
&amp;Baha'u'llah appeared upon the Persian horizon.  He hoisted the banner 
of the oneness of the world of humanity.  He proclaimed international 
 
+P47 
peace.  He admonished the Persian nation to investigate reality, announced  
that religion must be the cause of unity and love, that it must 
be the means of binding hearts together, the cause of life and illumination.  
If religion becomes the cause of enmity and bloodshed, then 
irreligion is to be preferred, for religion is the remedy for every ailment, 
and if a remedy should become the cause of ailment and difficulty, 
it is better to abandon it.  Today in Persia you will see Muhammadans, 
Christians, Zoroastrians, Buddhists assembled together 
in the same meeting, living in accordance with the teachings 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, manifesting utmost love and accord.  Rancor, hatred, 
antagonism and violence have disappeared; they live as one family.  
     And ye, who are the people of the Orient--the Orient which 
has ever been the dawning-point of lights--from whence the Sun of 
Reality has ever shone forth casting its effulgence upon the West--
ye therefore must become the manifestations of lights.  Ye must 
become brilliant lamps.  Ye must shine as stars radiating the light of 
love toward all mankind.  May you be the cause of love amongst the 
nations.  Thus may the world become witness that the Orient has ever 
been the dawning-point of illumination, the source of love and 
reconciliation.  Make peace with all the world.  Love everybody; serve 
everybody.  All are the servants of God.  God has created all.  He 
provideth for all.  He is kind to all.  Therefore must we be kind to all.  
     I am greatly pleased with this meeting.  I am joyous and happy, 
for here in these western regions I find Orientals seeking education, 
and who are free from prejudice.  May God assist you!

          Excerpt from a Tablet of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
 
O thou who art firm in the Covenant!+F1  
     The International Congress of Religions was organized this year 
(1906) in the capital of Japan.  Many souls hastened to that empire 
from different parts of the world, in order that they might talk of and 
discuss the principles of their own religions, each one longing to 
convert that assembly to his own religion and establish the validity 
of his own particular belief.  This congress had under discussion the 
politics of the religions.  In truth, it is a political affair and not the 
attraction of the heart, faith, advancement toward God nor 
enkindlement with the fire of the love of God.  This congress will not 
produce a lasting effect, for it is essentially politico-religious.  What 
is effective and conducive to the penetration of the Word of God and 
the attraction of hearts is the fragrances of holiness and the divine 
glad-tidings, which the members of the congress do not in the least 
comprehend.  
     Consequently, if the believers of God go to that country--not 
to the congress--and through the power of the Word of God, the 
breath of the Holy Spirit, the reading of the verses of Oneness and 
associating with the individual inhabitants of that kingdom, 
undoubtedly untold and tremendous results will be realized and the 
sweet fragrance of the rose-garden of mysteries will perfume the 
nostrils of the people of those regions.  It is significantly useful if some 
of the friends of God put forth an effort and hasten from America to 
those parts (Japan)...

               &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Meets President Naruse 
                    of Japan Women's College 
                   
                   By Miss Agnes B. Alexander 
 
     In the spring of 1912, in Tokyo, Viscount Shibusawa, an honored 
banker and financier, together with President Jinzo Naruse, the 
founder of the first Women's College in Japan, and Dr. Masaharu 
Anesaki of the Imperial University formed a nucleus of a movement 
called "Concordia".  Its object was to try to find a common ground 
on which all nations could harmonize.  President Naruse then undertook 
a journey around the world in the interest of the movement.  
He carried with him an autograph book in which he collected expressions 
of good-will from prominent people in the different countries 
he visited.  On his return to Japan these were translated into Japanese 
and published.  
     In London in 1912, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's secretary recorded the 
following:  "A distinguished Japanese, the president of the Women's 
University in Tokyo, who has been in the United States for many 
months, came to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and showed Him an article on the 
Concordia movement in Japan which appeared in the Oriental Review.  
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha spoke to him about the principles of the &amp;Baha'i Cause 
and how we are in need of Divine Power to put these principles into 
practice.  He said, `Just as the sun is the source of all light in the solar 
system, so today &amp;Baha'u'llah is the Center of unity of the human 
race and of the peace of the world.'  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha wrote a beautiful 
prayer in the autograph book and earnestly pleaded with him to go 
back to Japan and spread these lofty ideals."  
     The prayer follows:  "O God!  The darkness of contention, strife 
and warfare between the religions, the nations and peoples has 
beclouded the horizon of Reality and hidden the heaven of Truth.  The 
world is in need of the light of Guidance.  Therefore, O God, confer 
Thy favor, so that the Sun of Reality may illumine the East and the 
West."

             Blomfield, Concerning &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and the 
                      Japanese Diplomat (1912) 
 
     The Japanese Ambassador to a European capital (Viscount 
Arakawa--Madrid+F1) was staying at the Hotel &amp;d'Jena.  This gentleman 
and his wife had been told of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's presence in Paris, 
and the latter was anxious to have the privilege of meeting Him.  
     "I am very sad," said Her Excellency.  "I must not go out this 
evening as my cold is severe, and I leave early in the morning for 
Spain.  If only there were a possibility of seeing Him."  
     This was told to the Master, Who had just returned after a long, 
tiring day.  
     "Tell the lady and her husband that, as she is unable to come to 
me, I will call upon her."  
     Accordingly, though the hour was late, through the cold and rain 
He came, with His smiling courtesy, bringing joy to us all, as we 
awaited Him in the Tapestry Room of the Hotel &amp;d'Jena.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha talked with the Ambassador and his wife of conditions 
in Japan, of the great international importance of that country, 
of the vast service to mankind, of the work for the abolition of war, 
of the need for improving conditions of life for the worker, of the 
necessity of educating girls and boys equally.  
     "The religious ideal is the soul of all plans for the good of 
mankind.  Religion must never be used as a tool by party politicians.  
God's politics are mighty, man's politics are feeble."  
     Speaking of religion and science, the two great wings with which 
the bird of human kind is able to soar, He said:  "Scientific discoveries 
have increased material civilization.  There is in existence a stupendous 
force, as yet, happily undiscovered by man.  Let us supplicate 
God, the Beloved, that this force be not discovered by science until 
spiritual civilization shall dominate the human mind.  In the hands of 
men of lower nature, this power would be able to destroy the whole 
earth."

                    Alexander, 1923-1957 
 
     "The beloved Guardian continually sent reinforcements to me in 
his precious letters which were the joy and strength of my heart," Miss 
Alexander wrote.  
     Aside from her own inner conviction, the main source of positive 
guidance and direction, during her early years in the Orient were 
Shoghi Effendi's letters.  
     Of the first personal letter she received from the Guardian 
(December 2, 1923) she wrote, "The words penned by his hand at the 
end of the letter so affected me that for several days my heart was 
filled with joy and inspiration, and a realization came to me of the 
power with which God had endowed him."  
     Following are excerpts from some of the many letters written to 
Miss Alexander by the Guardian, or on his behalf, which give insights, 
not only into her role as a "distinguished pioneer", but also into her 
relationship with the Japanese, among whom she lived for so many 
years and whom she loved so dearly.  
       
My dear sister in God, 
     Your letter to our very dear Shoghi Effendi was most encouraging 
and created in him new hopes for the spread of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
great and noble Message after the painful calamity in Japan+F1.  It was 
indeed a miracle that amid a city all shaken to pieces and burned to 
ashes by the wild flames, the Lord should have kept you so safe and 
unscathed.  We can never doubt that this is a direct proof of the mighty 
task which the Lord has wanted you to take up and fulfill in that far 
away East.  Shoghi Effendi has always looked forward with great 
expectations at the progress of the Cause in Japan to which he attaches 
very great importance.  
     The Japanese are really progressive people and such vital 
teachings which comprise the principles of the &amp;Baha'i religion are sure 
to seize their attention and arouse a deep interest in them.  Your 
presence in Japan was always a means of comfort to Shoghi Effendi's 
heart because he fully realized the zeal and ardour with which you 
 
+F1 The Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1923.  
 
+P55 
had taken up your work there and although Japan might now miss you, 
he is sure that wherever you are you will strive to your utmost in 
spreading far and near this Message of Peace to humanity.  Furthermore 
he hopes that you will not give up altogether your interest in 
that promising country, but as long as you are away you will keep 
your tender plants all fresh and green with stimulating messages to 
them.  These are Shoghi Effendi's earnest hopes...

          (December 2, 1923)  
 
     In October 1923 Miss Alexander and her sister went to Beijing, 
stopping on their way in Seoul, Korea.  In China they joined Miss 
Martha Root and had an exceedingly fruitful time.  After about a three 
month visit Miss Alexander left to go to her home in Hawaii.  After 
she reached Hawaii she received a letter from the Guardian.  
 
My dear &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     Your letter to Shoghi Effendi was very gladly received and he 
was most delighted to hear of your activities in the wonderful country 
of China...  It is very unfortunate that you are forced to leave for the 
time being your work in (Japan) but Shoghi Effendi earnestly hopes 
that you will soon return and take up your blessed task.

My dear and esteemed &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     Your glorious services in those remote regions of the earth are 
never to be forgotten.  I ever pray on your behalf and wish you to 
remember the sacred interests of the Cause in far-away Japan as you 
are that radiant herald who has raised the Call of Salvation in its very 
heart and to whom it owes a great debt of gratitude.  Fujita is with us 
happy, active, and extremely helpful.  His presence is such a help and 
support to me in my work.  I never, never forget you.

+P56 
My dear &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     Our dear Guardian has instructed me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your welcomed letter dated June 3, 1927.  He is delighted to hear 
of your intended visit to Japan where he hopes and prays you will 
receive your full share of confirmations from the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  
     He cherishes great hopes for your future contributions to the 
progress of the Cause in that far away and promising country.  He 
wishes you to write to him frequently of the progress of your activities 
and of those whom you will interest in the Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     He would specially request you to prolong your stay in Japan as 
the soil is exceedingly fertile and the workers are so few in number.  
The hosts of the Supreme Concourse will surely aid you and assist 
you in your endeavor to spread the Faith which the world needs so 
vitally today.  
 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and precious sister:  
     Do not feel disheartened if you meet at first with trials and 
obstacles in His Path.  I will pray for their removal and will supplicate 
for you Divine Guidance and strength.  Your reward is indeed great 
and glorious in the world to come for all your endeavors and 
exemplary services to the sacred Threshold.  
                    Shoghi  
          (July 16, 1927)  
 
My dear and precious co-worker:  
     I cannot exaggerate the importance, nay the urgent necessity of 
your return to Japan.  Your place there is vacant, and the opportunities 
are varied and brilliant.  The few friends there have to be nursed and 
assisted to renew their activity and consolidate their work.  I will pray 
that you will be guided by our dear Master who loved you so dearly 
and wanted you so keenly to train and guide the rising generation in 
Japan into the light of this Divine Revelation.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (October 12, 1927)  
 
My dear and precious co-worker:  
     Though immersed in an ocean of activities and cares, I find always 
the time to think of you and express to you in writing my sentiments 
of love and appreciation of all you are doing for our beloved 
Cause.  I trust the way to Japan may open soon, and that you may 
 
+P57 
resume in that important field, the work so dear to your heart.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
                    
     Please assure dear Mrs. Augur of my tenderest brotherly sympathy 
in her affliction.+F1  The services of her dear husband are engraved 
upon my heart.  I will pray for him from the bottom of my heart at 
the Beloved's Shrine.  
                    Shoghi  
          (October 22, 1927)  
 
My dear and precious sister:  
     I am glad that the date of your voyage to Japan is at last settled 
and I hope and trust that you will be enabled to consolidate the great 
work you have initiated in Japan.  My prayers will accompany you 
wherever you go, and I ask you to assure the loved ones in Japan of 
my continued prayers for their progress and spiritual advancement.  
                    Shoghi  
          (October 31, 1927)  
 
My dear co-worker:  
     What a relief to learn that you are at last on your way to Japan 
where I trust and pray you may witness the growth of the Cause so 
dear to our hearts.  I will pray that your efforts may meet with the 
fullest success and that you may be enabled to establish a powerful 
centre in the heart of that promising country.  
                    Shoghi  
          (December 30, 1927)  
 
My dear and precious co-worker:  
     I rejoice to learn of the resumption of your most valuable and 
pioneer work in Japan, and I wish to assure you again and in person 
of my continued and fervent prayers at the Holy Shrines for your 
success in spreading and consolidating the Cause in that land.  I urge 
you to make a special effort to organize the believers there into a local 
&amp;Baha'i Spiritual Assembly as a nucleus round which will gather and 
flourish the future &amp;Baha'i community in Japan.  I trust that the Beloved 
may guide your steps and bless your efforts in this connection.  
Awaiting eagerly your good news.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (March 13, 1928)  
 
+F1  Dr. Augur passed away the previous month.  
 
+P58 
My dear &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     Our Guardian has received with extreme pleasure your letter of 
February nineteenth from Tokyo.  
     He is so glad to know that you are finally there and actively busy 
in a work to which he pays the greatest importance.  Being pioneer 
work it is bound to be slow, but he hopes that it will soon pass beyond 
the pioneer stage and that &amp;Baha'i Assemblies and groups composed 
of full fledged and confirmed &amp;Baha'is will replace your isolated 
individuals with whom you now communicate.  
          (signed by Soheil Afnan)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
My dear co-worker:  
     Please assure the dear friends in Tokyo of my brotherly affection, 
and sincere and continued prayers for the success of their efforts in 
the service of our beloved Cause.  May the Beloved aid you to assist 
them and guide them in their task, and strengthen you in your efforts 
to consolidate the work that has been started in that land.  
                  Your well-wisher, Shoghi  
          (March 29, 1928)  
 
     He (the Guardian) was very pleased to receive the encouraging 
news that (your letter) contained and to learn that an article had already 
appeared on the subject of the Cause in the press.  Perhaps you will 
make an effort that similar articles may appear in other papers so as 
to attract the attention of the reading and thinking public.  Of course 
your ultimate goal, Shoghi Effendi is sure, is nothing less than the 
establishment of a capable, devoted and progressive &amp;Baha'i center there.  
          (signed by Soheil Afnan)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
My dear and valued &amp;Baha'i sister:  
     I wish to assure you in person of my eagerness to hear from you 
regularly, frequently and in detail, of my continued prayers for you, 
and of my sense of pride and satisfaction in view of your devoted and 
pioneer services in that promising country.  Though trials, tests, anxieties 
and cares beset your path, yet you should never falter in your faith 
and hope that eventually, through you and those who after you will 
tread your path, the sovereignty of &amp;Baha'u'llah will be firmly established 
in that land and your heart's desire will in the end be fulfilled.  
                    Your true and affectionate brother, Shoghi  
          (May 20, 1928)  
 
+P59 
My dear and precious co-worker:  
     It always gives him (the Guardian) great pleasure to hear of the 
progress of the Cause in distant lands and he prays for those who are 
undertaking the task with great zeal and unfailing sacrifice.  The 
activities of such devoted souls will surely leave ever-lasting traces 
on the history of man.  The pioneer work is always the most difficult 
and entails the greatest sacrifice.  Be thankful to God for having chosen 
you to undertake such a task.  The Master always looked to the Eastern 
countries as a ready field of service and promised a great harvest to 
one who would sow the seed.  
          (signed by Soheil Afnan)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
My dear and precious co-worker:  
     Your letter has served to reveal once again the undying spirit of 
devotion that animates you in the service of the Cause.  My prayers 
will be offered again for you at His Holy Shrine that you may be 
assisted to establish permanently a &amp;Baha'i Spiritual Assembly in that 
land, and help that centre to get in close and constant touch with Assemblies 
both in the East and West.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (November 14, 1928)  
 
My dear and valued co-worker:  
     Your letters have gladdened my heart and fortified me in my task.  
I will continue to supplicate for you at His Shrine, that He may 
graciously assist you to make of those who are merely interested, 
active supporters of the Faith, recognizing fully the significance and 
station of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and who will form a nucleus of believers who 
will carry on the work, loyally and effectively after you and in your 
absence.  This is my fervent prayer for you.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (December 21, 1928)  
 
     Your perseverance and constancy in the service of the Cause in 
Japan, your effort to sow the seed among the educated and enlightened 
people and at the same time to carry the comforting and inspiring 
teachings of the Faith to the poor and blind, all these are the causes 
of deep satisfaction and pleasure to the heart of the Guardian.  
          (signed by Soheil Afnan)  
 
+P60 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     With the assurance of my keen appreciation of your devoted and 
constant efforts and of my fervent and continued prayers in your behalf 
at the Holy Shrines.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (April 19, 1929)  
 
     He (the Guardian) hopes that you will leave a wonderful group 
of &amp;Baha'is in that land.  Once they come to appreciate the futility of 
mere material progress and come to desire a spiritual impetus they 
will see that the source of all inspiration in this day is &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and His teachings.  
          (January 5, 1930)  
 
My dear co-worker:  
     Your separate messages have rejoiced my heart.  I will pray for 
each one of you that the Beloved may bless you, guide you and 
strengthen you to render notable services to the cause of world 
brotherhood and peace.  I deeply value your expressed sentiments and 
reciprocate your expressions of brotherly love.  
                    Praying for your spiritual advancement, 
                    Shoghi  
          (April 18, 1930)  
 
     He (the Guardian) sincerely hopes that the translation of Dr. 
Esslemont's book will proceed at a rapid pace, because no real advance 
can be made in the teaching work without proper literature, and this 
book is undoubtedly the most comprehensive exposition of the 
Teachings yet written.  The language should, however, be worthy of 
the theme otherwise it would not make the necessary appeal to the 
educated classes.  
     Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to hear that Keith (Ransom-Kehler) 
has achieved some success in Japan.  The explicit promise of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah is that God's spirit will assist all those who, with a sincere 
and detached heart, arise to spread the teachings.  There is no reason 
for astonishment therefore if the teachers of the Cause find success 
in their work.  May God's spirit continue to sustain them.  
          (signed by Ruhi Afnan)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am eagerly awaiting the news of the publication in Japanese 
 
+P61 
of that prized book which Dr. Esslemont has so wonderfully laboured 
to produce.  When received it will adorn the newly-restored mansion 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah adjoining His Shrine at Bahji.  May the Beloved sustain 
and bless your magnificent efforts.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (October 8, 1931)  
 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated December 29, 1931 bearing the sad news of the death of 
Mr. Susumu Aibara+F1.  It is surely a great loss to have a young man 
of his ability and standing leave the group.  Our sole comfort should 
be in this that he is at present in a higher spiritual realm enjoying a 
blissful being far beyond our powers to appreciate.  Shoghi Effendi 
hopes that the members of his family will view his passing in that light 
and appease their sorrows.  Please convey to them all Shoghi Effendi's 
sympathies.  
          (January 25, 1932)  
 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to ... inform you of the safe arrival 
of the one hundred copies of Dr. Esslemont's book that you sent him.  
The book surely looks beautiful and is fully befitting the message it 
conveys.  
     The Guardian hopes that now that this task is completed the 
friends in Japan will make a stupendous effort to spread it throughout 
the country and get it to the attention of those seeking souls who are 
yearning to find some source of spiritual light and help to which they 
can turn for guidance and salvation.  
     With such a comprehensive book at hand ready for distribution, 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah should spread in no time.  The friends should 
become conscious of this, and, uniting their efforts, arise in an unprecedented 
form to spread the Teachings.  
          (signed by Ruhi Afnan)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and much-prized co-worker:  
     With feelings of intense delight and gratitude, I have sent, this 
very afternoon the books you have sent me to the library of the Mansion 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah at &amp;Bahji.  They will be placed by myself side by 
side with the fourteen different printed versions of "The New Era", 
and will be a constant reminder of your perseverance, your magnificent 
 
+F1 Mr. Aibara, a vibrant &amp;Baha'i with leadership qualities, died suddenly at 
+F1 age 32.  
 
+P62 
efforts, your exemplary devotion to the Cause of God.  It is a 
historic service that you have rendered to the &amp;Abha Threshold.  I urge 
you to send one copy to each of the most important &amp;Baha'i centers in 
East and West.  Its effect, I feel, will be remarkable.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (February 11, 1933)  
 
     He (the Guardian) has directed me to thank you on his behalf 
and to assure you of his abiding appreciation of your unforgettable 
services to the Cause in Japan.  
     He was very glad to learn that you have decided to leave for 
Honolulu as he firmly believes that such a visit will give you a chance 
to rest and will enable you, on your return to Japan, to better serve 
the Cause.  There should always be a limit to self-sacrifice.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I immensely appreciate your outstanding services in those far-away 
islands, and I will pray that you may be assisted to resume in 
the not distant future your manifold and valued activities in the service 
of our beloved Faith.  Your name will forever remain associated with 
the rise of the Faith and its establishment in Japan, and the record of 
your incessant and splendid endeavors will shed on its annals a lustre 
that time can never dim.  
                    Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi  
          (June 8, 1933)  
 
     The gratifying news of your projected trip to Japan has particularly 
strengthened (the Guardian's) hopes for the future expansion of 
your labours in that country.  He trusts that on your return to that land 
you will find the friends more eager and ready than ever to carry on 
the teaching work which ever since your departure to the States seems 
to have been progressing slowly.  
     The Guardian will fervently pray for the success of your teaching 
trip, and he hopes that its results will be such as to encourage you to 
prolong your stay in Japan until a strong, active and well-united 
community of believers has been duly established.  Your patient, 
sustained and selfless efforts in this connection, he is convinced, are 
bound to produce satisfactory and abiding results.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
 
+P63 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dearly beloved co-worker:  
     I wish to add a few words in person in order to reaffirm my deep 
sense of gratitude to you for all that you have achieved and for your 
determination to carry on the work that you have so many years so 
splendidly initiated.  I trust and pray that you may be fully guided 
and assisted to fulfill your heart's dearest wish.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (November 1, 1934)  
 
     Shoghi Effendi also cherishes bright hopes for your future work 
in Japan, where, he trusts, you will this time succeed in laying 
foundations for the establishment of new centers and groups in a not 
too distant future.  He is fervently entreating &amp;Baha'u'llah to that end, 
and is confident that through His confirmations and guidance your 
work will be blessed, enriched and sustained.  
 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     May the Beloved, whose Cause you have promoted with such 
unswerving loyalty and devotion, continue to bless your manifold 
activities, and aid you to consolidate the foundations of His Cause in 
that promising country.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (April 17, 1935)  
 
     He (the Guardian) sincerely hopes that this trip to Japan will be 
quite successful, and that the results achieved will be most encouraging 
and stimulating to you, and will serve to bring to speedy and successful 
realization &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's deeply cherished hopes concerning the 
future of the Cause in these far-Eastern countries.  The ground, of 
course, is not yet quite prepared.  There is still a tremendous amount 
of publicity that has to be done before anything solid and enduring 
can be attained.  But the peoples, if not in the large industrial centers, 
at least in the villages and country, are, as the Master has often remarked, 
spiritually-minded and eager to absorb a message as sound 
and as inspiring as that which the Cause offers.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
     
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     May the Beloved of our hearts whose Cause you have served 
and are still serving with such zeal, devotion and constancy, reward 
 
+P64 
you a thousandfold for your ceaseless services, your high endeavors 
and historic accomplishments for the furtherance of His glorious Faith.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (July 6, 1935)  
 
     Regarding Mr. and Mrs. Torii, he (the Guardian) is immensely 
grieved to learn of the passing away of their son Akira+F1, and wishes 
you, therefore, to convey to them his heartfelt condolences and 
sympathy for this cruel and unexpected loss they have sustained.  Will 
you also assure them of his prayers for the soul of their departed son, 
that it may develop and receive its full share of Divine blessings in 
the next world.  
     The Guardian has been very pleased to learn of Mr. Torii's desire 
to put the Japanese translation of the "New Era" into Braille for use 
of his blind friends.  He would urge you to encourage him to complete 
the work as soon as possible, as it may prove of considerable help to 
the spread of the Teachings throughout Japan.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
     
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     Your past and present services are engraved upon my heart.  The 
Beloved is well-pleased with your constancy, your zeal and exemplary 
devotion.  I am proud of the spirit that so powerfully animates you in 
His service.  I will continue to pray for your success from the bottom 
of my heart.  Rest assured and persevere.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (September 23, 1935)  
 
Beloved &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     Shoghi Effendi was very happy to receive your letter of October 
2, and wishes me to congratulate you on having succeeded in getting 
the enclosed article on the Cause published in one of the leading 
Japanese newspapers.  He trusts that this important piece of publicity 
work will serve to attract the attention of a few competent and 
spiritually-minded people to the Teachings and thus gradually open the 
way for the wider penetration of the Message throughout Japan.

+P65 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     Do not feel discouraged if the work you are doing for His Cause 
does not bear rich and immediate fruit.  The seeds you are so patiently 
and devotedly sowing will assuredly germinate, and future generations 
will reap an abundant harvest.  The Master is watching over and 
blessing your historic services.  Rest assured.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (November 3, 1935)  
 
     He (the Guardian) is truly pleased to learn of the many contacts 
you have succeeded in forming with distinguished people and especially 
with young Japanese students...  (He) feels also deeply appreciative of 
Dr. Masujima's+F1 kind offer in presenting his library for the use of the 
&amp;Baha'is.  He hopes and fervently prays that this eminent friend of the 
Cause may become one day a confirmed and devoted believer and that 
through his services the Faith may rapidly spread throughout Japan.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     May the Beloved bless you and keep you, reward you abundantly 
for your manifold services, and enable you to extend the scope of 
your meritorious activities.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi

welcome.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     Your previous letters of May 21 and June 29 have also reached 
me, and I deeply appreciate the sentiments they convey.  The strike 
and disturbances in Palestine have at last ceased and the obstacles to 
your pilgrimage have been removed.  I would be so pleased to meet 
you face to face at this Holy Spot.

          (November 3, 1936)  
 
+F1 Dr. Rokuichiro Masujima was a good friend of the Faith but he could not 
+F1 commit himself to becoming a &amp;Baha'i.  
 
+P66 
     The Guardian wishes me to heartily congratulate you for the 
success of your efforts in connection with the publication of this new 
(Japanese) Braille edition of "&amp;Baha'u'llah and the New Era", which 
undoubtedly constitutes a most valuable addition to the literature of 
the Cause for the blind.  I wish to also ask you to transmit the 
Guardian's grateful appreciation and thanks to Mr. Torii for his 
painstaking labours for the preparation of this new Braille publication 
on the Cause.  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     Wishing you success from all my heart, your true and grateful 
brother, Shoghi  
          (November 19, 1936)  
 
     On behalf of the Guardian ... (I) wish to assure you again of his 
abiding appreciation of the splendid activities in which you are so 
laboriously and so devotedly engaged for the spread and establishment 
of the Cause in Japan.  Do not feel discouraged at the meagerness of 
the results you now obtain.  The Master's promises regarding the share 
you are destined to contribute towards the spread of the Faith in the 
Far East will sooner or later be completely realized.  No matter how 
dark the present may appear, you should feel nevertheless confident 
that the distant future is immeasurably bright.  Strive, therefore, with 
a joyful radiant and confident heart to hasten the fulfillment of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's glorious promises.  Your reward is unimaginably 
great, and the success that awaits your labours certain.  
     Regarding your visit to Fujita's mother+F1, the Guardian feels 
rejoiced and thankful for all the kindness and assistance you have so 
lovingly extended to her, and would certainly approve of your wish 
to continue helping her in every way you can...  
          (signed by H. Rabbani)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     With the assurance of my deepfelt and abiding appreciation of 
your wholehearted and touching response to my request+F1, and wishing 
you success and happiness from the depths of my heart.  
                    Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi  
          (January 24, 1937)  
 
+F1 The Guardian had asked Miss Alexander to visit Mr. Fujita's mother, who lay 
+F1 ill in Yanai, Yamaguchi Prefecture.  At that time it was an 18-hour train 
+F1 trip from Tokyo.  
 
+P67 
     Miss Alexander left Japan in 1937.  She made her pilgrimage to 
Haifa and rejoiced in being in the presence of the Guardian.  After 
that she traveled to various places and ended up in her ancestral home 
in Hawaii.  At the Guardian's urging she returned to Japan in 1950.  
Below are some of the letters from the Guardian sent to her home in 
Hawaii and then to Japan upon her return.  
 
     He (the Guardian) was ... glad to know you have put the soldier 
&amp;Baha'is in Korea and Japan in contact with the friends in those places, 
and hopes and prays this will lead to the rebirth of the Cause out there.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)

under all conditions, aid you to add fresh laurels to the crown you 
have won in the service of His Faith, and fulfill your heart's desire 
for its promotion.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (June 3, 1946)

devoted and he (the Guardian) hopes you will do all you can to assist 
them and stimulate their activities.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (July 23, 1946)  
 
     He (the Guardian) was very happy indeed to receive the good 
news of the devotion of the Japanese friends to the Faith, and he feels 
that the greatest service you can render the Cause is to do everything 
in your power to encourage and help them.  Your letters, the news 
you give them, and the books you may be able gradually to forward 
will teach them and keep them up to date in the development of the 
Cause and its activities.  
     He does not feel a so-called &amp;Baha'i School is a wise undertaking 
for Mr. I..; the great need at present is to teach, and he hopes in 
your letters you will impress this upon him, and the other &amp;Baha'is there 
and assure them of his loving prayers on their behalf.

to Japan and meet with your old co-workers there, and assist the 
new &amp;Baha'is in their work.  Your long and deep association with this 
country, which at last has begun to put forth flowers in the &amp;Baha'i 
world community, would be befittingly crowned by this service, and 
he hopes the way will open for you to go there as soon as possible.

     He (the Guardian) is so happy to have you at last in Japan, and 
feels your presence there will be of great help and inspiration to the 
Japanese friends.  
     They seem dear and devoted souls, and he rejoices to see that, 
after all these years, and the long period of patient toil you spent there 
in the past, the tree of the Faith has struck deep roots, and the fruits 
are beginning to appear at last.  
     He feels you, and dear Fujita too, should devote particular attention 
to deepening the friends in the Covenant, which is the ark of safety 
for every believer.

(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     May the Almighty sustain, guide and bless you always, give you 
all the strength you need to enrich the splendid record of your past 
services in Japan, and enable you continually to extend the range of 
your meritorious accomplishments.

     He (the Guardian) urges you never to feel discouraged but to go 
on showering your love on the friends (in Japan) and helping them to 
a deeper understanding of the Covenant.  
     The Guardian was pleased to hear Mr. Torii is arranging for the 
Hidden Words in Braille.  Please thank him and assure him of the 
Guardian's loving prayers.

          (November 15, 1951)  
 
     The Guardian was most happy to learn of the many teaching 
opportunities which have been coming to you in that land, where you 
have labored so tirelessly and so lovingly, and assures you of his

prayers for you and for those whom you are attracting to the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.

     The Guardian greatly values your continuous sacrificial services 
in behalf of the Faith, particularly in Japan.  He prays for the success 
of the efforts of the friends in Japan, that the Cause may spread rapidly 
in that country.  He will particularly pray for the success of your work 
in Kyoto.  He is hopeful that your contact with the Esperantists in 
Japan will bring many of them into the Faith.

     The Guardian is indeed deeply grateful for your ceaseless services 
in the Cause of God, and was very happy to learn from you of 
the progress of the work in Japan.  
     He urges you by all means to make your plans to attend the 
International Teaching Conference to be held in New Delhi in October.  
You should then return to Japan, as he feels that this is the time 
for you to resume your work in that country.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     May the Beloved bless, guide and sustain you always, reward 
you abundantly for your long record of historic services, and enable 
you to enrich it in the days to come.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (August 15, 1953)  
 
     The Guardian has been greatly pleased with the manner in which 
the Faith has been spreading in Japan.  He sincerely hopes that during 
the second year of the Crusade it will spread even more rapidly, and 
to more centers.  
     The future of the Faith in Japan is very great.  It now depends 
upon the &amp;Baha'is to teach, to develop the Faith in a city and then move 
on to a new area.  If this is continued diligently, it will bring the light 
of guidance to all parts of Japan in a very short time.

     He (the Guardian) was very happy to hear of the progress of the 
work in Japan; and he greatly appreciates the fact that you have returned 
once more to that country, so dear to your heart, and where 
the Master was so eager for you to serve.  
     He wishes to assure you that he will pray for Mr. Mori+F1, and 
that before he passes from this world, his spirit may be illumined, and 
he may come to accept &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     The Guardian was also very pleased to hear that the Momtazis 
have given their home as a &amp;Baha'i hall and Hazira, and hopes that this 
will open the way for the foundation of a firm Spiritual Assembly in 
the city.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (May 5, 1954)  
 
     He (the Guardian) was glad to hear Mr. Mori died a firm &amp;Baha'i 
and that his funeral was in itself a service to the Faith.  He will pray 
for his soul, and for his dear family.  
          (signed by "Ruhiyyih")  
          (May 27, 1954)

create ever greater unity and enthusiasm amongst the Japanese friends, 
and the other believers in Japan.

and receptive people.

+F1 died.  
 
+P71 
and in the same spirit of service, that you have always shown in your 
&amp;Baha'i life, and which has entitled you to this great honor.  
     It will no doubt be a source of encouragement to the believers 
that they now have two Hands of the Cause, one in the South and one 
in the North Pacific; and, in view of the remarkable spread of the Faith 
throughout that whole region, your services will be of much help in 
stimulating and reassuring the friends, and encouraging them to arise 
and constantly extend the outposts of the Faith.  
     He will remember you in the Holy Shrines, and pray that you 
may be strengthened, guided and blessed in this new form of service 
to the Cause you love so dearly.

aid you, now that you occupy so lofty a position in the ranks of the 
followers of His Faith, to enrich the record of your distinguished and 
truly historic services to its institutions.

                          1922-1931 
 
My well-beloved brethren and sisters in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:-- 
     Despondent and sorrowful, though I be in these darksome days, 
yet whenever I call to mind the hopes our departed Master so 
confidently reposed in the friends in that Far-Eastern land, hope revives 
within me and drives away the gloom of His bereavement.  As His 
attendant and secretary for well-nigh two years after the termination 
of the Great War, I recall so vividly the radiant joy that transfigured 
His Face wherever I opened before Him your supplications as well 
as those of Miss Agnes Alexander.  What promises He gave us all 
regarding the future of the Cause in that land at the close of almost 
every supplication I read to Him!  Let me state, straightway, the most 
emphatic, the most inspiring of them all.  These are His very words, 
that still keep ringing in my ears;--"Japan will turn ablaze!  Japan is 
endowed with a most remarkable capacity for the spread of the Cause 
of God!  Japan, with (another country whose name He stated but bade 
us conceal it for the present) will take the lead in the spiritual 
reawakening of the peoples and nations that the world shall soon 
witness!"  On another occasion,--how vividly I recall it!--as He 
reclined on His chair, with eyes closed with bodily fatigue, He waved 
His hand and uttered vigorously and cheerfully these words in the 
presence of His friends:--"Here we are seated calm, quiet and 
inactive, but the Hand of the Unseen is ever active and triumphant in 
lands, even as distant as Japan."  
     My dear and steadfast friends!  Now if ever is the time for you 
and for us to show, by our unity, service, steadfastness and courage, 
the spirit that the Master has throughout His lifetime so laboriously, 
so persistently kindled in our hearts.  Now is the time for us to prove 
ourselves worthy of His love for us, His trust in us and His hopes for 
us.  Japan, He said, will turn ablaze.  Let us not, in any way, whatsoever, 
retard the realization of His promise.  Nay, let us hasten, through 
our service, cooperation and efforts the advent of this glorious day.  
     The bereaved Ladies of the Holy Household, receive with 
comfort and refreshing gladness any news that may come to them from 
that wonderful and distant land.  They all know what the Master has 
 
+P74 
graciously spoken about the future of the Cause in that land.  They 
all expect from it a rapid transformation, a spiritual transformation 
even more sudden and startling than its material progress and advancement, 
for the Power of God can achieve wonders still greater 
than those the brilliant minds of the Japanese can achieve.  This they 
firmly believe, for more than once, the Master has spoken of the 
spiritual potentialities hidden in the nature of these capable people.  
They all await with eagerness the joyful-tidings that your letters to 
them shall bear in future.  
     We all wish so much to know more about you, about your little 
rising &amp;Baha'i community, your number, your meetings, your activities, 
your difficulties, your plans, your distribution all over Japan and the 
neighbouring islands.  We shall all pray for you most fervently and 
in a special manner at all the three Hallowed Shrines and beseech the 
Master, under whose wings we are all, to guide you, to sustain you in 
your work for Him.  
     I shall never fail to send you all the news I receive from different 
parts of the &amp;Baha'i world that you may know of the efforts and 
triumphs our brethren, the loved ones of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, are achieving 
and will achieve after Him.  
     Persia, the leading nation in the &amp;Baha'i world, today will, I am 
confident, through its centre, Tihran, communicate with you all, that 
the East and West, even as our Beloved One has so much wished it, 
may become even as one.  
     The letter our dear sister, Miss Agnes Alexander, had written to 
Mr. Fujita, gave us such a joy and was read at the sorrowful gathering 
of His friends, in the very room He used to receive His friends and 
meet them every night.  
          Ever awaiting your joyful news, 
          I am, your devoted brother in His love and service, 
                    Shoghi  
          (January 26, 1922)  
 
     To the believers in Japan care Agnes Alexander.  Refreshed and 
reassured I now stretch to you across the distant seas my hand of 
brotherly cooperation in the Cause of &amp;Baha.  
                    Shoghi  
          (cable dated December 15, 1922)  
 
+P75 
Dear friends, the chosen ones of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in that Far Eastern land!  
     Having brought to an end my long hours of retirement and 
meditation, one of my first thoughts upon my return to these hallowed 
surroundings has been to inquire after the well-being and spiritual 
happiness of my far-away fellow-workers who toil and labour in those 
remote regions of the earth for the blessed Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  How 
great was my joy when I learned that you were well safe and happy, 
content and determined, untiring in your labours and hopeful of the 
future!  
     That my sudden withdrawal from the field of active service 
would leave you undeterred in your activities, would never damp your 
tender hopes nor shake your resolution to stand firmly for the Cause, 
I never doubted as I knew well the indelible marks of loyalty and 
steadfastness which the words of our beloved Master have wrought 
in your lives.  I am equally certain that now when we join hands again 
in carrying the Cause of God a stage yet further, your assistance 
wholehearted as ever before will give it a fresh impetus that will lead 
to the establishment of throbbing centres of spiritual activity in those 
outlying regions of the world.  
     Japan, a land so richly endowed, so alert and progressive, so 
quick in its grasp of realities of life, is now the recipient of a Divine 
Bestowal, greater, richer and more enduring than any material gift she 
has ever enjoyed in modern times.  What blissful thought to remember 
that you are the chosen ones that shall establish the Kingdom of God 
in that land; that you are the pioneers of a Work that will endure and 
supersede all the other achievements, however meritorious and 
brilliant, of your fellow-countrymen for Japan.  
     I pray that your vision of the vast opportunities that are yours 
may never be dimmed; that your efforts to realize that vision may 
never slacken and that the gracious aid of &amp;Baha'u'llah may never be 
withheld from you all through your sacred mission in this world.  
     And now in conclusion, let us not forget those ringing words of 
the Beloved, uttered with such force and emphasis:--"The Fire of 
the Love of God shall assuredly set Japan afire!" and let us arise, now 
at this moment, with increased and renewed confidence in His Sayings 
that we may assure and hasten the advent of so glorious an era in the 
history of that ancient land.  
          With my best wishes to every one of you 
          I am your brother and fellow-worker, 
                    Shoghi  
          (December 17, 1922)

Dearest brethren and sisters in &amp;Baha'u'llah!  
     The most welcome letter of our dearly beloved &amp;Baha'i sister, Miss 
Agnes Alexander, imparting the glad news of the progress of her glorious 
services in Japan has rejoiced my heart, and has served to 
strengthen my hope and confidence in the future glories of that far 
eastern land.  
     The Ladies of the Holy Household are highly gratified and comforted 
to learn of your untiring labours in His Vineyard, of the success 
that has attended your efforts, of the perseverance and ardour with 
which you conduct your teaching work in those distant regions of the 
earth.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is with you always and your success is assured!  
     May the visit of our beloved sister, Miss Martha Root, to your 
shores stimulate widespread interest in the Cause throughout Japan, 
China and the Pacific Islands, and consolidate the foundation of the 
Edifice of the Cause in those far-eastern regions.  I shall ever pray at 
the Three Holy Thresholds that the seeds now scattered bear abundant 
fruit and the promise of our beloved Master be speedily fulfilled.  
     I shall remember in my prayers Mr. and Mrs. Sam Baldwin and 
their children, as well as Mrs. and Miss Cramer, and wish them from 
all my heart signal success in their noble endeavours to promote far 
and wide the Heavenly Teachings.  
     It is my earnest hope that the friends in Japan will from now on 
write me frequent and detailed letters, setting forth the account of their 
various spiritual activities and giving me the plans for their future 
services to the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Our devoted brother, Mr. Fujita, is well and happy in the Holy 
Land, and together with the Ladies of the Household and myself is 
engaged in the service of the various pilgrims that visit in these days this 
sacred Spot.  He is faithfully and actively carrying on the work which 
he has started so whole-heartedly during the Master's last years on earth.  
     I trust that the letters addressed to you by the newly-constituted 
Spiritual Assembly in Haifa have contributed their share in informing 
you more fully of the onward and irresistible march of the Movement 
throughout the world.  
          Awaiting your joyful letters, 
          I am your brother and fellow-worker,

To Miss Alexander 
     Shoghi Effendi has very kindly instructed me to acknowledge 
receipt of the letter dated April 9th by the following dearly loved 
friends in the great Cause of El &amp;Abha in Tokyo, K. Sawada, H. 
Tanaka, Ida Finch, Ei Noguchi, Y. S. Ling, K. S. Ling, Yoshio 
Nakamura, Fumi Sato, Yuri Takao, B. Enomoto.  
     The few expressions of devotion by each one of them on one 
sheet of paper speak out for themselves of the unity and love that exists 
between the &amp;Baha'i friends of Tokyo and express in a most vivid form 
the &amp;Baha'i spirit and teachings which indeed above all stand out for 
unity and love amongst mankind.  
     Shoghi Effendi is deeply impressed by the letters, and earnestly 
hopes to see the &amp;Baha'is of Japan from whom he will anxiously expect 
to hear, increase their efforts and spread out the &amp;Baha'i teachings all 
over Japan for the good of mankind.  
     I hope our dear sister Miss Martha Root has safely arrived and 
that by the grace of the Almighty her stay will be productive of great 
results.

To Mr. Susumu Aibara  
My dear brother in God!  
     Your welcome letter has rejoiced my heart.  I am sending you 
some &amp;Baha'i literature which I trust will guide and assist you in your 
work.  I shall be delighted to hear from you directly and regularly and 
please rest assured of my deep interest in your work and of my fervent 
prayers for the success of your labours.

To the &amp;Baha'is of Tokyo 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge receipt of your joint 
letter enclosed in Miss Alexander's note.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that 
through the combined efforts of the &amp;Baha'is of Tokyo, the Cause will 
establish a strong center in that city and then begin and radiate its 
spiritual light to neighboring localities.  Now that Miss Root is with 
you, you should endeavor to awaken new competent souls and then 
when she is gone strive to ground them firmly in the teachings.

Naganuma, Miss Elizabeth Dawe 
     He (the Guardian) was very happy to hear of your very nice and 
interesting gathering when Miss Martha Root was there.  He sincerely 
hopes that her short stay will bear wonderful fruits and be the cause 
of guidance to many souls.  Such persons who travel from one country 
to another, meeting the friends and exchanging thoughts with them, 
achieve a great part in strengthening the link between the new friends 
in different parts of the world.  They give a new spirit and impart 
courage and perseverance to those who feel disappointed and overwhelmed 
by the greatness of the task laid before them.

To Mr. Tokujiro Torii 
     I am directed by Shoghi Effendi to write and express his great 
pleasure over the receipt of your kind and happy letter of January 2.  
     He was very happy to hear from you, to learn that you are well 
and increasingly enthusiastic about the &amp;Baha'i Faith.  He prays from 
the bottom of his heart that the Almighty may help and strengthen 
you to render valuable services to the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah and also 
to assist the cause of the blind which is in itself a great &amp;Baha'i service.  
     He deeply regrets that you are handicapped by your early loss 
of eyesight, but a spiritual light illuminates and guides you and through 
it, he hopes you will become a channel to His Grace.  
     It is unfortunate that despite the eager and persistent endeavors 
of our devoted sister Miss Agnes Alexander, no permanent and thriving 
centre has yet been established in Japan.  But he trusts that soon 
a special endeavor will be made to establish an active group who will 
be able to translate the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah and make them known 
to the people of Japan.  
     With the assurance of Shoghi Effendi's affection and prayers for 
you, also to Miss Alexander, and of his hope that you will someday 
come to Haifa.

     Our Guardian has been overjoyed to hear of your gathering at 
the library of Dr. Masujima and to receive your very kind messages 
written on that occasion.  
     Both the Master and Shoghi Effendi have always cherished great 
hopes for the &amp;Baha'i Faith in Japan.  They have felt that only through 
the broad spiritual outlook which the Faith provides can the Japanese 
people introduce true spiritual enlightenment in their fast developing 
civilization.  Hence Shoghi Effendi's great pleasure to hear from you 
and learn of your increasing interest in and enthusiasm for the Cause.

               Letters and Cables to 
            Administrative Institutions 
 
          To the First National Convention 
      of the &amp;Baha'is of North East Asia--1957 
 
     To the Delegates and Visitors assembled at the Convention of the 
&amp;Baha'is of North-East Asia.  
     With feelings of exultation, joy, and pride I hail the convocation 
of this history-making Convention of the &amp;Baha'is of North-East 
Asia, paving the way for the emergence of a Regional Spiritual Assembly 
with an area of jurisdiction embracing Japan, Korea, Formosa, 
Macao, Hong Kong, Hainan Island and Sakhalin Island.  
     This auspicious event, which posterity will regard as the 
culmination of a process initiated, half a century ago, in the capital 
city of Japan, under the watchful care and through the direct inspiration 
of the Centre of the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, marks the opening of 
the second chapter in the history of the evolution of His Faith in the 
North Pacific area.  Such a consummation cannot fail to lend a 
tremendous impetus to its onward march in the entire Pacific Ocean, 
a march which will now, no doubt, be greatly accelerated by the 
simultaneous emergence of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the 
&amp;Baha'is of South-East Asia and of the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of New Zealand.  
     I particularly welcome the establishment of this highly important 
institution in the capital city of Japan, as it affords a splendid 
opportunity for the diffusion of the Lights of the Faith, and the erection 
of the structure of its Administrative Order, among a people 
representing the overwhelming majority of the yellow race, living in 
the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and in a country regarded as one of 
the strongholds of the Buddhist Faith.  
     I feel a warm tribute should be paid, on this historic occasion, 
to the members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, as well as to their 
elected national representatives, who have, for so long and so devotedly, 
promoted the interests of the Faith in that country, and, in recent 
years in its neighbouring islands.  
     I call upon the Regional Spiritual Assembly now being formed 
to signalize its birth through the initiation of a subsidiary Six-Year 
 
+P81 
Plan, designed to swell the number of the adherents of the Faith 
throughout the area of its jurisdiction; to multiply the groups, the isolated 
centers and the local spiritual assemblies; to incorporate all firmly 
grounded local spiritual assemblies; to obtain recognition from the civil 
authorities for the &amp;Baha'i Marriage Certificate, as well as the &amp;Baha'i 
Holy Days; to inaugurate a national &amp;Baha'i Fund; to consolidate the 
work initiated in the newly opened territories; to lend an impetus to 
the translation, the publication, and dissemination of &amp;Baha'i Literature 
in divers languages; to establish Summer Schools, and &amp;Baha'i 
burial grounds; to propagate the Faith throughout the smaller islands 
of Japan; and to acquire a plot to serve as the site of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of North-East Asia.  
     May the blessings of &amp;Baha'u'llah be showered, in an ever-increasing 
measure, on those newly emerged Communities now 
holding aloft, so steadfastly and so valiantly, the banner of His Faith, 
and may the outcome of their collective efforts illuminate its annals, 
and contribute to a notable degree to the consolidation of the institutions

     Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on his 
behalf and inform you that the Hand of the Cause Mr. &amp;Varqa, will 
shortly be forwarding to your assembly the equivalent of five hundred 
English Pounds, as the Guardian's contribution to your newly 
established National Fund.  
     He hopes that, in the formulation of your plans, particular 
attention will be given to the all-important teaching work, the 
foundation of all the activities of the Faith and the most urgent task 
facing the friends in this critical period the world is passing through.  
     You may be sure he will pray for your success.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (May 20, 1957)  
 
     He (the Guardian) has read with much interest the reports of the 
Convention recently held in Tokyo.  
 
+P83 
     The formation of this new Regional Assembly, whose area of 
operation is so vast and situated in such an important part of the globe, 
has been a source of great joy to the Guardian.  He was also very happy 
to see that your Assembly has represented on it members of the three 
great races of mankind, a living demonstration of the fundamental 
teaching of our Holy Faith, and one which cannot but attract the interest 
of the public.  The fact that so many believers attended the first 
historic convention, from practically all the territories your Assembly 
represents, was also most encouraging, and augurs well for your future 
work.  
     The work, so faithfully carried on, by both the American and 
Persian pioneers, has borne its first fruit.  The long and loyal service 
of dear Agnes Alexander, who so faithfully carried out the beloved 
Master's wishes and served the spiritual interests of Japan for decades, 
has been richly crowned.  Even the death of the devoted pioneer, Mr. 
Anthony Seto, has added a blessing to the work in that region, for he 
served in spite of failing health and remained at his post to be laid at 
rest in a distant land, his very dust testifying to the greatness of the 
love and the nature of the ideals &amp;Baha'u'llah inspires in His servants+F1.  
     It has been a great source of joy to the Guardian to see the marked 
increase of native &amp;Baha'is throughout that area, particularly in Japan, 
Korea and Formosa.  However devoted the pioneers may be to these 
distant countries of their adoption, their relation to them cannot but 
be a transient one, especially in view of the disturbed state of the world 
and gloomy clouds that hang over its political horizons.  They may 
suddenly be forced to go home; therefore, the native &amp;Baha'is, in particular, 
must seize this opportunity and arise too, themselves, in their 
own countries, pioneer to new cities and towns, new islands and as 
yet unopened territories, so that they may, with the help of their &amp;Baha'i 
brethren from overseas, lay a firm and enduring foundation, and 
commence the great task of building up the Administrative Order, 
which is itself the foundation of the future World Order.  
     Special attention must be given during this crucial year to consolidating 
the precious goals already won, to creating new Spiritual 
Assemblies, to increasing the groups and the isolated centers.  
     Your Assembly must be very careful not to overload the &amp;Baha'is 
with rules and regulations, circulars and directions.  The purpose of 
the administration at this time is to blow on the fire newly kindled in 
the hearts of these people who have accepted the Faith, to create in

them the desire and capacity to teach, to facilitate the pioneer and 
teaching work, and help deepen the knowledge and understanding of 
the friends.  The beloved Guardian issues this word of warning, as 
long experience has shown that it is a tendency on the part of all 
N.S.A.s to over-administer.  In their enthusiasm they forget that they 
only have a handful of inexperienced souls to guide, and attempt to 
deal with their work as if they had a large population to regulate!  This 
then stifles the spirit of the friends and the teaching work suffers.  
     He hopes that special attention will be given to the translation 
of more literature into the languages in use throughout that area and 
its publication.  Likewise, Summer Schools should be multiplied as 
they enable the friends to gain in knowledge, and, through taking part 
in the course, increase their ability as &amp;Baha'i teachers.  
     He was most happy to receive news of the spread of the Faith to 
some of the other islands in Japan, and hopes that this initial effort 
will be carefully followed up, and that the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
will be carried to all the Japanese islands--and those in their 
neighbourhood--including Sakhalin, which is one of the few 
remaining virgin territories to be opened under the Ten-Year Plan.  
     The extraordinary progress made in the Far East and the Pacific 
area has been a constant source of pride and joy to the Guardian, and 
he feels confident that the door has opened on a new era in the advancement 
of our beloved Faith in these promising regions, and, indeed, 
all over the world.  To the degree to which the friends consecrate 
themselves to the teaching work will directly depend the results they 
achieve during this year and coming years.  
     The beloved Guardian assures you all of his loving and continued 
prayers for the success of your work, for your strength, guidance and 
protection.

(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The formation of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is 
of North East Asia is to be acclaimed as an event of far-reaching 
historic significance, whose repercussions cannot be confined to the 
Pacific area, but are bound to affect the immediate fortunes of the 
entire &amp;Baha'i world.  The emergence of this epochal institution, however 
transitional its character, represents the culmination of a fifty-year 
old process that has had its inception in the days of the Centre 
of the Covenant, during the last decades of the Heroic Age of the 
 
+P85 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  The rise and expansion of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith in the northern regions of the vast Pacific Ocean 
fills a great gap, and constitutes a notable parallel to the rise of similar 
institutions in the Antipodes, establishing thereby a spiritual equilibrium 
destined to affect, to a marked degree, the destinies of the Faith 
throughout the islands of the Pacific Ocean, in the years immediately 
ahead.  It should be hailed, moreover, as a momentous development 
paving the way for the eventual introduction of the Faith into the far-flung 
Chinese mainland and, beyond it, to the extensive territories of 
Soviet Russia.  
     A milestone of such tremendous significance in the progress of 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, in so strategic and important an area of the 
globe, should be acclaimed by the members of your assembly, as well 
as by the rank and file of the believers throughout that area, as a 
demonstration of the creative energies released by its Author and the 
Centre of His Covenant, in territories and amidst peoples and races 
destined to play a role of immense significance in the future 
development of the human race.  
     This God-given opportunity, now presenting itself to the 
prosecutors of the &amp;Baha'i world Spiritual Crusade, at so critical a stage 
in the history of the peoples and nations established in those far-off 
islands and territories, should be seized with eagerness and enthusiasm, 
and exploited to the full in the years lying immediately ahead.  
     The Six-Year Plan, designed to lend a tremendous impetus to 
the awakening of the peoples and races in those regions, should be 
prosecuted with the utmost diligence, unrelaxing vigilance and whole-hearted 
consecration.  All must participate, young and old alike, both 
men and women, however limited their circumstances or circumscribed 
their resources.  
     An effort, unprecedented in its scope and intensity, must be 
exerted to attain, speedily and completely the specific objectives of 
this Plan.  The number of the avowed supporters of the Faith must 
rapidly increase.  The isolated centers, groups and local assemblies, 
constituting the bedrock of a rising Administrative Order, must steadily 
and continually multiply.  All firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies 
must be speedily incorporated, in order to reinforce the 
foundations of the institution of this divinely conceived Order.  The 
&amp;Baha'i marriage certificate, as well as the &amp;Baha'i Holy Days must, at 
the earliest possible opportunity, receive recognition from the civil 
authorities concerned.  The work now being initiated in the Northern 
and smaller islands of Japan, with such zeal and devotion should be 
 
+P86 
constantly reinforced and its scope continually widened.  The literature 
of the Faith must be translated into as many languages as possible, 
published and widely disseminated.  The holding of the summer-schools 
is yet another objective that should receive the earnest and 
immediate attention of the members of your assembly.  The purchase 
of &amp;Baha'i burial-grounds, should, moreover, be, in due course considered 
and effectively carried out.  The newly-opened territories, that 
have been so painstakingly brought within the pale of the Faith, must 
at whatever cost, be safeguarded, and the enterprises initiated within 
their confines carefully expanded and consolidated.  The acquisition 
of a plot, in the outskirts of Tokyo, to serve as the site of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of North East Asia, must, likewise, be seriously 
considered and brought to a successful conclusion.  
     The task challenging the spirit and resources of your assembly, 
as well as those whom you represent, is admittedly arduous, pressing 
and sacred.  The field in which you operate is exceptionally vast, and 
the barriers standing in your way are varied and formidable.  Nothing 
short of complete dedication to the objectives of the Six-Year Plan 
you are called upon to fulfill, and of the utmost self-sacrifice on your 
part, as well as on the part of those who are to participate in its 
prosecution, can ensure the success to which I confidently look forward, 
to which your sister, as well as parent, communities throughout 
the &amp;Baha'i world, are likewise, eagerly anticipating.  
     May those who are privileged, at this auspicious hour, to render 
so noble a service to the Cause of God, and fulfill so glorious a destiny, 
in the course of the evolution of so sacred and precious a Faith, arise 
to perform befittingly their task, and achieve such feats in the days to 
come as shall draw forth from the Source on high a still greater 
measure of divine blessings that will enable them to write a still more 
brilliant chapter in the annals of God's infant Faith, and to contribute 
an outstanding share to the world-wide establishment and ultimate 
recognition of its newly-born administrative institutions.

     He (the Guardian) was greatly pleased to learn of the contacts 
which have been made by the friends with the original natives of Japan, 
namely the Ainu people.  He hopes that some of them will be 
quickened in the Faith so that they may teach the call of God to the 
remainder of their people.  There is no doubt that great results will be 
achieved if this can be done.  
     Therefore the Guardian hopes your Assembly will take some very 
active measures to insure the teaching of the Faith amongst this Tribe.  
     The Guardian will pray for you and will pray for the success of 
your labors.

               To the National Spiritual Assembly of 
                   the United States, 1951-1956 
 
     He (the Guardian) feels there is no definite action that can be 
taken by the Tokyo Spiritual Assembly against ... any society which 
uses our &amp;Baha'i ideas and principles.  The best thing is for the Japanese 
believers, through strengthening their community, enlarging it, 
obtaining publicity in the press, and holding, whenever possible, 
dignified public meetings, to gradually assert themselves as the real 
body of the Faith, and make everything else appear to be mere plagiarism, 
a shadow of the Faith.  Your Assembly should give them (the 
Japanese believers) as much moral support and encouragement as 
possible.  
          (February 29, 1951)  
 
     The Guardian attaches great importance to the teaching conference+F1 
... and feels that as many friends as possible should attend.  He 
thinks it will be a great stimulant to the Faith, and certainly foundations 
can be laid for the rapid expansion of the Cause...  This will be 
a historic event, and one that should lay the foundation for great victories 
in the future.  
     The beloved Guardian has approved the attendance of one of the 
Hands of the Cause in Asia ... Mr. Zikru'llah &amp;Khadem...

+P88 
     Your loving letter was received (with the) copy of Miss Linfoot's 
report to the National Assembly concerning the Teaching Conference 
held in Japan.  
     The Guardian was greatly delighted with the Conference and its 
results; more particularly with the effect which it is going to have on 
the teaching work of the entire area in the future.  
     It was a very historic gathering, because it marked the first time 
a general conference regarding teaching matters had been held in 
Japan, and furthermore was participated in by representatives of the 
other countries in the area.  It released a new power of the Spirit in 
that part of the world which will certainly elevate the minds and hearts 
of the people and attract many to the Cause.  
     The Guardian appreciates the sacrificial efforts made by all those 
who undertook the development of the Conference, so that it might 
produce such beneficial results.  
     The Guardian is hopeful that the conditions in Japan may not 
force many of the pioneers to leave that territory.  As you know, he 
attaches the utmost importance to the teaching work in Japan; he anticipates 
that the Faith will spread rapidly in that country.  The help 
of the American &amp;Baha'is is very essential; and he hopes therefore it 
will not be necessary for any of them to leave.

          (November 20, 1955)  
 
     The beloved Guardian feels the time is ripe for the settlement of 
the Northern Island of Japan, and he wishes your Assembly to consider 
what might be done to accomplish this before the coming &amp;Ridvan 
without in any way interfering with the work now engaged in, in 
connection with the establishment of the new National Assembly next 
&amp;Ridvan.  
     There are three tasks which the new National Assembly should 
undertake, when it is formed, and that is the sending of pioneers into 
Sakhalin Island, and Hainan Island; also the extension of the teaching 
work in the Northern Island (Hokkaido) of Japan.  If no settlers 
are in the Northern Island, then they should undertake to send some 
in as quickly as possible.  
     Will you please actively consider the settlement now of the 
Northern Island; also pass on to the new N.S.A. the three tasks the 
Guardian feels they should undertake promptly.

     ...The emergence of a new Regional Spiritual Assembly in the 
North Pacific Area+F1, with its seat fixed in the capital city of a country 
which by reason of its innate capacity and the spiritual receptivity it 
has acquired, in consequence of the severe and prolonged ordeal its 
entire population has providentially experienced, is destined to have 
a preponderating share in awakening the peoples and races inhabiting 
the entire Pacific area, to the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and to act 
as the Vanguard of His hosts in their future spiritual conquest of the 
main body of the yellow race on the Chinese mainland--the emergence 
of such an assembly may be said to have, at long last established 
a spiritual axis, extending from the Antipodes to the northern islands 
of the Pacific Ocean--an axis whose northern and southern poles 
will act as powerful magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual 
potency, and towards which younger and less experienced communities 
will tend for some time to gravitate.  
     A responsibility, at once weighty and inescapable, must rest on 
the communities which occupy so privileged a position in so vast and 
turbulent an area of the globe.  However great the distance that separates 
them; however much they differ in race, language, custom, and 
religion; however active the political forces which tend to keep them 
apart and foster racial and political antagonisms, the close and continued 
association of these communities in their common, their peculiar 
and paramount task of raising up and of consolidating the embryonic 
World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah in those regions of the globe, is a matter 
of vital and urgent importance, which should receive on the part of 
the elected representatives of their communities, a most earnest and 
prayerful consideration...  
     May this community+F2 which, with its sister community in the 
North, has had the inestimable privilege of being called into being in 
the lifetime of, and through the operation of the dynamic forces released 
by the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant continue, with 
undimmed vision, with redoubled vigour, and unwavering fidelity and 
constancy, to discharge its manifold and ever increasing duties and 
responsibilities, and lend, as the days go by, an impetus such as it has 
not lent before, in the course of almost two score years of its existence,

the beloved Guardian states that they must not gather in one place but 
scatter to make new centers, e.g., Mr. Assassi and his wife, and Mr. 
Labib who travelled to Japan must not stay in Tokyo but should go to 
places where there are no &amp;Baha'is, or very few &amp;Baha'is to make new 
centers.  Furthermore (he) says that the National Spiritual Assembly 
of Iran must write to all pioneers that have left Iran for other parts of 
the world and instruct them not to gather in one place but to scatter 
in different places.  He says that the matter stated above is very 
important...  (translated from the original Persian)

To the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo 
     To know that a Spiritual Assembly of all Japanese members was 
formed in Tokyo greatly inspired him (the Guardian).  This is a historic 
and wonderful achievement.  At present it might seem to people 
of the world that these few devoted souls are insignificant when 
compared to the millions of people residing in Japan--but we who 
have recognized the Power of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and that His teaching is 
God's Message to men in this day, know that the seed of the Tree of 
Life has at last germinated in your land, and that it will grow to overshadow 
all those who dwell in the islands of Japan.  
     The love of the Japanese people, for truth and beauty is very 
great, and our Guardian feels sure that gradually many souls will 
become attracted to the Cause of God through your persevering and 
devoted labours.  
     Your loyalty and determination touches him deeply, and he assures 
you all that for each one of you he will pray for guidance and

Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I was thrilled by your message and I greatly value the sentiments 
it expressed.  I urge you to persevere and be confident, and labour 
unitedly for the spread of the Faith and the formation of new centres, 
however small, in the vicinity of your capital.  I will, from all my heart, 
supplicate for you Divine guidance and blessings, that your historic 
work may flourish, your numbers increase and your highest hopes be 
fulfilled in the service of His glorious Faith.

     The beloved Guardian has received your letter, so beautifully 
written in Japanese, and which he regrets very much he could not read 
in the original.  
     He very deeply appreciated the contribution the &amp;Baha'is of Japan 
have made for the Shrine of the &amp;Bab; and I am enclosing a receipt 
herein for the sum you mentioned in your letter, ten thousand yen.  
     The sentiments expressed by the &amp;Baha'is of Japan touched him 
very deeply; and he feels that the contribution they have made to the 
Shrine enriches its spiritual significance for all of us, coming, as it 
does, from believers in the &amp;Bab, our beloved Martyr-Prophet, who 
reside in a land so far away, and yet are filled with such great love and 
devotion for, not only the &amp;Bab Himself, but for the Faith He heralded.  
     The Guardian is most happy over the progress being made in 
Japan; and he wants you to know that his loving thoughts are with 
you, and you are mentioned often in his prayers in the Holy Shrines.

     Your gracious letter of March 20th, conveying &amp;Naw-Ruz greetings 
to the beloved Guardian has been received, and gave the Guardian 
the utmost of happiness.  It revealed anew the power of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
that in that far off land, the banner of His Grace has been raised so 
effectively, and the friends have been quickened by the new spirit of 
unity which is sweeping the world.  
     The Guardian will pray at the Holy Shrines that the powers of 
the Holy Spirit will inspire and sustain you in your labors for the 
spread of the true teachings of brotherhood, and the spiritual elevation 
of the people of Japan.  
     Today, the head corner-stone of service to the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah is teaching.  It is the source of divine blessings.  The 
beloved Guardian feels your consecration to this most important of 
all &amp;Baha'i activities will achieve new goals and win many victories 
for the Faith.  
     He sends his loving greetings to each one of you, who will ever 
be in his heart.

     It always brings joy to the heart of our beloved Guardian to 
receive news from you, as he is so happy over the remarkable growth 
of the Faith in Japan since the end of the war.  He has instructed me 
to answer on his behalf your letter of July 12.  
     Plans for future works in Japan will certainly form part of the 
general plan for Asia, which will be discussed at the New Delhi Conference 
in October 1953.  He would be very happy if some of the 
friends from Japan could attend this historic gathering.  
     He was delighted to hear that your Assembly is undertaking extension 
teaching work in other Japanese cities; as Tokyo is the mother 
Assembly, her responsibility is great.  He was particularly glad to hear 
teaching will be done in Hiroshima, where the people suffered so 
mercilessly during the war; they have a special right--the people of 
that city--to hear of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Message of peace and brotherhood.  
     The Assembly of Tokyo, until such time as other local assemblies 
are formed, can receive the applications for enrollment from people 
living elsewhere.  Anyone living outside the civic limits of Tokyo, 
however, cannot be a voting member of that community, but of course, 
may attend meetings and Feasts until a local nucleus is established.

a great service in Japan, the object of all teachings is to establish firmly 
the Faith of God in the hearts and lives of the people of the country.  
He hopes that special efforts will be made to teach the Japanese, and 
to provide them with &amp;Baha'i literature in their own language, and to 
conduct meetings in Japanese, and also to encourage them to 
understand the Administration and take an active, constructive part 
in its workings.  Without a proper understanding of the Administrative 
Order, extensive plans cannot be undertaken and harmony will 
not prevail within the community.  
     He (the Guardian) will remember you in all his prayers, and is 
most pleased with your progress and your devoted spirit.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
     
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     May the Almighty bless your high and persistent endeavours, 
guide every step you take in the path of service, and enable you 
to extend continually the range of your splendid activities, and win 
great and memorable victories for His Cause.  
                    Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi  
          (August 30, 1952)  
 
     The beloved Guardian has said that the future of Japan from 
every standpoint is very bright indeed.  The Faith will spread rapidly 
in Japan, once the public become acquainted with its universal principles, 
and its dynamic spirit.  
     What is necessary at this time is for the &amp;Baha'is to adhere firmly 
to the teachings of the Faith, and to become a clear channel through 
which the power of the Holy Spirit might disseminate itself throughout 
the country.  
     So far as the Ananai-kyo Movement is concerned, and their desire 
for affiliation:  
     The &amp;Baha'is may associate with Movements such as this, without 
becoming supporters and active workers therein; the object being 
to make friendly contacts which can be developed into firm &amp;Baha'is.  
     So far as &amp;non-Baha'is affiliating with the &amp;Baha'i Faith is concerned, 
either a person becomes a &amp;Baha'i and accepts &amp;Baha'u'llah 
as the divine Manifestation for this day or he does not.  The tenets of 
the &amp;Baha'i Faith are simple as outlined by the Guardian, but they do 
not permit any variations.  In other words, if any members of the 
Ananai-kyo Movement wish to become &amp;Baha'is; they will be most 
welcome; but they can only become &amp;Baha'is on the basis of accepting 
 
+P94 
&amp;Baha'u'llah as a divine Manifestation, and of course, with this goes 
the acceptance of the &amp;Bab as the Fore-runner, and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as 
the Center of the Covenant, and the present Administrative Order.  
     When a person has reached the sea of immortality, it is idle to 
keep seeking elsewhere; and when the members of the Ananai-kyo 
Movement reach &amp;Baha'u'llah in their search for a world teacher, they 
have reached the goal, and not another step along the path.  
     I presume you have received by this time full details concerning 
the Ten Year Crusade, and the Plan which the Guardian has enunciated 
for the American National Assembly to assist in the 
development of the Faith in Japan, so that ultimately there may be a 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is in Japan itself.  
     The American National Spiritual Assembly has appointed a special committee 
for the Asian countries, and I am quite sure you will find the 
very closest possible cooperation from them in the development of 
the work.  
     You will find, as the Extension Teaching work in Japan moves 
forward, there will have to be constant and continuous consultation 
with this important committee.  
     You can appreciate it will be entirely impossible for the International 
Council or the staff of the Guardian himself, to undertake the 
supervision of the teaching work in any one part of the world; furthermore 
it would be contrary to the general principle of &amp;Baha'i administration.  
Under &amp;Baha'i administration, Local Assemblies, and the 
development of teaching work are placed in the hands of National 
Assemblies.  The National Assemblies themselves report directly to 
Haifa--to the Universal House of Justice, when it is established; and 
until that time, to the Guardian himself.  
     At the instruction of the Guardian, I am communicating with the 
American National Spiritual Assembly, to ask them to set up a 
program, whereby there will be the closest possible collaboration 
between their Asia Teaching Committee and your own Assembly.  I 
hope this will be the means of all data reaching you very promptly.  
     The beloved Guardian asked me to convey to you his deep love.  
He appreciates and values very highly your devoted services to the 
Faith.  He will pray at the Holy Shrines, for your guidance and confirmation.  
It is his hope that heavenly blessings may be with you at 
all times, and every obstacle in the path of your efforts to continually 
spread the Message in Japan may be removed, so that you may ultimately 
gain complete victory.

+P95 
     The Guardian is hopeful that some day it may be possible for 
the &amp;Baha'is of Tokyo to establish their Hazira; and of course if this 
were done, some day it will become the National Hazira, because when 
the National Spiritual Assembly is formed in Japan, Tokyo will no 
doubt be the seat of the National Assembly.  
     Shoghi Effendi feels that the time has now come when the Faith 
will spread rapidly in Japan.  The Japanese people have great vision 
and spirituality, and the difficulties of the last war have prepared many 
of them for the Divine Guidance.  He therefore urges each and every 
one of you to treble your efforts, so that the Cause may grow and 
develop rapidly.  
     He sends his loving greetings to you, and assures you all of his 
prayers in your behalf.  
          (signed by Leroy Ioas)  
          (November 26, 1953)
 
     The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to each and 
every one of the friends in Japan.  He greatly values their devotion 
and sacrifice for the Faith, and the noble manner in which they are 
arising to spread the Teachings in that land.  
     He feels the future of Japan is very great.  The hearts and minds 
of the Japanese people are awakened; and if the teaching work is 
carried on very actively and audaciously, many souls will be attracted 
by the Divine Fragrances.  
     The beloved Guardian is so confident that the Faith will spread 
rapidly in Japan, and the believers will firmly establish the institutions 
of the Cause, that he has chosen to send to them for ultimate display 
in their National Haziratu'l-Quds in Tokyo one of the very precious 
relics from the Shrine of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He has entrusted with our dear 
brother, Hiroyasu Takano, a very precious brocade, which has rested 
immediately over the remains of &amp;Baha'u'llah in His glorious Shrine.  
It is very precious and very sacred.  
     The Guardian is sending this to the Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo 
as a gift.  The friends may wish to have it carefully and beautifully 
framed for display in the Hazira, when it is acquired.  Ultimately of 
course it is to be hung in the Hazira of the National Assembly, when 
that great goal has been achieved by the Japanese believers.  
     The beloved Guardian assures each and every one of you of his 
prayers in your behalf.  
          (signed by Leroy Ioas)  
          (March 2, 1954)  
 
+P96 
     The beloved Guardian was pleased to see the manner in which 
the Assembly has undertaken its responsibility of enthusing the believers 
to carry on teaching work throughout Japan in an aggressive 
manner.  
     The keynote of activity during the second year of the Ten-Year 
Crusade is the multiplication of Assemblies, groups and isolated 
centers.  The Guardian feels the time is ripe for the active spread of 
the Faith throughout Japan; and if pioneers and settlers will go to 
additional cities and very actively teach the Faith, they will find that 
the Cause will grow and develop in each of these new areas.  
     You should not overlook the fact that one of the goals of the Ten-Year 
Crusade is the establishment of a National Assembly in Japan.  
This can be brought about more quickly if the friends set aside all other 
considerations and actively teach the Faith.  
     The sacred gift which the Guardian sent to the Japanese &amp;Baha'is 
through Mr. Takano is of course for the Hazira as soon as it is procured.  
It is one of the very sacred relics, and the Guardian hopes it 
will be a source of inspiration to the friends to redouble their efforts 
in the teaching field.  
          (signed by Leroy Ioas)  
          (May 29, 1954)  
 
     The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to each and 
every one of you.  He is praying for the success of your teaching work.  
He feels the time is ripe for a rapid expansion of the Faith in Japan; 
and that if everyone will arise with renewed effort, they will be surprised 
at the spiritual victories which they will achieve.

          (June 7, 1954)  
 
     Please refer to our previous correspondence with regard to the 
purchase of a Haziratu'l-Quds in Tokyo.  The beloved Guardian feels 
this is a matter of great importance, and should be accomplished 
during the present year.  
     He has written to the American N.S.A. in detail concerning the 
matter, instructing them to proceed at once with the development of 
this project, so that it may be concluded during the present year, if at 
all possible.  
     The beloved Guardian is sending a contribution of &amp;500.  
     As you know, a Haziratu'l-Quds was given by Mr. Momtazi in 
Mukonoso, Hyogo-ken.  The Guardian would see no objection to this 
 
+P97 
Haziratu'l-Quds being sold, and the fund received thereby being used 
to defray the cost of the Haziratu'l-Quds in Tokyo.  It is far more important 
that a Hazira be established in Tokyo, which is the seat of the 
future National Assembly, than in Mukonoso, Hyogo-ken.  Of course 
this can only be done in case Mr. Momtazi is entirely agreeable.  
          (signed by Leroy Ioas)  
          (June 8, 1954)  
 
     Your loving letter ... has just come to hand, telling of the funds 
which you have available now, since the generous gift of Mr. N. 
Momtazi, for the Haziratu'l-Quds in Tokyo.  
     You have in mind that the Hazira need not be an elaborate place.  
It should be a building which you own, and which can be used now 
as the Haziratu'l-Quds for the Local Tokyo Assembly, to be utilized 
later as the National Haziratu'l-Quds for the National Spiritual Assembly 
when it is formed.  
     The important thing is that this piece of property should be acquired 
for as reasonable a price as possible.  
     The Guardian will await with expectation, advice from you as 
to the acquisition of this important piece of property+F1.  
     The Guardian sends each one his loving greetings.

     Your loving letter ... has come to hand, giving the latest information 
concerning the International Teaching Conference which was 
to be held at Nikko, September 23, 24, and 25.  
     From the word we have received, the Conference must have been 
a great success with so many being present, and representing so many 
different countries.  As I understand it, there were representatives of 
nine different nations.  
     The Guardian has attached the greatest importance to this Conference, 
as it is the first to be held in Japan, and is therefore a great 
historic event.  Let us hope the teaching work will develop rapidly in 
Japan, so that there may be a large number of Assemblies and groups 
established who may take part in the election of the National Assembly.  
          (signed by Leroy Ioas)  
          (September 26, 1955)  
 
+F1 The purchase of the Tokyo Hazira was accomplished that year.  It was not 
+F1 necessary to sell the Mukonoso property as Mr. Momtazi contributed a like 
+F1 amount toward the purchase of the Tokyo Hazira.  When the Guardian was 
+F1 informed of the purchase, he cabled "Delighted loving prayers" to the Tokyo 
+F1 Local Spiritual Assembly.  
 
+P98 
     It was a great pleasure to have some of the friends from Japan 
here, and particularly to get dear Fujita back again.  
     The Guardian is particularly happy over the news conveyed by 
Mr. Momtazi for the formation of seven new Assemblies.  This is a 
great step forward in the progress of the work, not only in Japan, but 
in the Pacific area; and augurs well for the formation of the Regional 
National Assembly with Japan as the hub, which is to be elected next 
&amp;Ridvan.  
     The Japanese believers are often in his thoughts and prayers, and 
he is proud of their achievements, and cherishes great hopes for their 
future.  He will pray that your Assembly may be instrumental in 
bringing in many new souls during the coming year.

     May the Almighty, whose Cause you serve so devotedly, aid you 
to extend continually the scope of your valued activities, and enable 
you to win great victories in the days to come.  
                    Your true brother, Shoghi  
          (April 24, 1956)  
 
     He (the Guardian) was very happy to receive the copies of the 
Japanese Geppo.  They are historic, marking the first &amp;Baha'i Newsletters 
to be published in that country.  He hopes its scope will gradually 
widen, and it become a most effective means of stimulating the 
friends in Japan in service to the Cause of God.  
     Great victories have been won by the friends in Japan.  He hopes 
during the short period between now, and when the new National 
Assembly is formed, the friends will treble their efforts, so many many 
souls may find eternal life, through the teaching services of the true 
servants of God.  
     As &amp;Baha'u'llah has stated, true victory is winning the hearts of 
men to the Cause of God.  The Guardian is praying for many more 
such glorious victories, so the Faith may be firmly established in that 
far off land, which has such a bright and promising future.  
     The Guardian will pray for the friends, for the success of their 
work.  He sends his loving greetings.

     The various materials which you sent to the Guardian he has read 
with great interest--the pamphlet on the recent Congress of Religions 
held in Tokyo, the English summaries of the important &amp;Baha'i News 
Geppo, and your report of the progress of the Faith in that promising 
country.  
     The Guardian is looking forward with keen anticipation to the 
forthcoming &amp;Ridvan period, as it marks the establishment of thirteen 
new National Assemblies; the most important of which are in the 
Pacific area; the one centered in Tokyo, the one in Djakarta, and the 
third in New Zealand.  
     The Guardian is well pleased with the teaching work in Japan.  
He hopes this branch of your service will be greatly reinforced and 
stimulated by the establishment of the new National Assembly.  
    He will pray for the friends, for Japan, and for the success of 
the labors of the Faithful.

     It is indeed a great privilege for the &amp;Baha'is of Japan, so remote 
from the Holy Land, to have two of their most devoted teachers come 
to Haifa on pilgrimage; and he (the Guardian) feels sure that they will 
carry back to the work in that important Center in the Pacific area a 
fresh impetus and a new inspiration.  
     It is also a source of great satisfaction to him that dear Fujita 
has returned to serve here.  It brings the Japanese believers even closer 
to the International Center to have a representative of their nation 
working for the Cause at its World Center.  
     He assures you all that he will pray for the success, not only of 
the work in Hyogo-ken, but throughout Japan, and urges you and your 
co-workers to persevere in the face of every obstacle.

To Mr. Saichiro Fujita 
     After so many years of silence our beloved Guardian was very 
happy to receive your postcard.  
     He is very glad to see you are not only safe after all these terrible 
years of war and privation, but that you are seeking to establish 
a center of the Faith where you live.  He assures you he will pray that 
your efforts may be successful, and that you may become the father 
of the first spiritual assembly there.  
     Your long services in Haifa are not forgotten, and the Guardian 
sends you his greetings.

     The excellent progress the Cause is making is a delight to his 
(the Guardian's) heart, and he feels very close to the Japanese believers.  
     Now that our dear Agnes Alexander is with you again out there 
(in Japan), he feels still greater progress will be made.  You and she, 
both old and tried believers, must devote particular attention to 
strengthening the faith of the new souls, and giving them a firm 
foundation in the Covenant.  You are often affectionately remembered 
here.

To Mrs. Kyoko Hongo 
     He (the Guardian) is very happy to hear that you and your husband 
have become declared &amp;Baha'is; and he will ardently pray in the 
Holy Shrines that each of you may become an active and devoted 
servant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and may be assisted in bringing many souls 
in that land to the light of this great Faith, and carry on the work nobly 
started by the dear Davenports.

To Mr. Tameo Hongo 
     It brings him (the Guardian) great joy to realize that we see before 
our eyes the promises of &amp;Baha'u'llah being fulfilled, and the 
peoples of East and West embracing as lovers, and united in the service 
of God and of man.  
     He feels that the Japanese people, so sensitive to every form of 
beauty both spiritual and material, will have a deep appreciation of 
the Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, not only because of their truth and justice, 
but because of the great beauty which permeates them, a beauty 
which will gradually, through the fulfillment of His prophecies and 
the practice of His Laws and Principles, permeate the life of mankind, 
and create a society such as has never been dreamed of before.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)

To Mr. Michitoshi Zenimoto 
     Your letter has been received by the beloved Guardian and he 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah wrote, many, many years ago:  "The vitality of men's 
belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short of His wholesome 
medicine can ever restore it.  The corrosion of ungodliness is 
eating into the vitals of human society; what else but the Elixir of His 
potent Revelation can cleanse and revive it?"  
     This is the ebb of the tide.  The &amp;Baha'is know that the tide will 
turn and come in, after mankind has suffered, with mighty waves of 
faith and devotion.  The people will enter the Cause of God in troops, 
and the whole condition will change.  The &amp;Baha'is see this new condition 
which will take place, as one on the mountain-top sees the first 
glimpse of the dawn, before others are aware of it; and it is toward 
that that the &amp;Baha'is must work.  
     The Guardian will pray that you may be instrumental in bringing 
many of your fellow-youth into the Faith.  He sends you his loving 
greetings.

To Miss Yoshiko Morita 
     The photograph of the Japanese &amp;Baha'is, who attended the conference 
recently held in Nikko, brought great joy to his (the 
Guardian's) heart.  
     Although the American and Persian friends are helping greatly 
the spread of the Faith in Japan, the main object of their presence in 
 
+P103 
that country is to attract Japanese people to the Cause of God.  Only 
when the Faith is firmly rooted in the hearts of the people of that 
country can we feel that true progress has been made; and therefore 
to see there are so many Japanese believers, active and devoted in 
different places in Japan, has been a great comfort and joy to our 
Guardian.

To Mrs. Masao Konishi 
     The time is too short to spend years preparing yourself to teach 
by the indirect approach.  The world is ready for the direct Message, 
and it would be much better to equip yourself to do direct &amp;Baha'i 
teaching.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (September 19, 1957)  
 
             The following excerpts are from letters to 
                  pioneers to Japan and Korea, 1948-1957 
 
To Mr. Robert Imagire 
     He (the Guardian) notices in your last letter that you sound discouraged.  
But he feels you should look on the bright side of the work 
in Japan, and realize that, after so many, many years of complete 
inertia, the old &amp;Baha'is have been found--at least some of them--
and contacts reestablished.  You are able to serve there, new people 
are hearing of the Faith, and the prospects for the future work there 
are promising.  It is a great pity that a pioneer effort, organized and 
financed, cannot be carried out there.  But the present Seven Year Plan 
takes all the American &amp;Baha'i resources, and at present Japan must 
depend on volunteer teachers like your dear self, who of course are 
not as free as a full time pioneer would be.  
     In regard to the various questions in your last letter; because of 
the difficult conditions under which you are serving there and the state 
of the country and immaturity of the believers you should not be too 
rigid.  You should try and meet on the proper Feast day, but if it is not 
possible meet as close to the date as you can.  Likewise, it would be 
desirable to observe the Ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah and the Master, etc., 
at the correct times, but it is not essential to do so.  With such a small 
group of &amp;Baha'is who have no proper literature except the Esslemont 
 
+P104 
book, and need to deepen in the Teachings, you should be very patient 
and not ask them to do things before they see the wisdom of it.  
     Membership for &amp;Baha'is should be based on their understanding 
the station of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the Guardian 
and the function of the Administrative Order.  To do this it is not 
necessary for people to first read the Will and Testament and the 
Dispensation.  The essentials can be explained to them, and the rest 
is a question of faith; if they believe, they can be accepted as &amp;Baha'is.  
It is premature now to say any "laws" of the Aqdas must be followed.  
But the &amp;Baha'is should be encouraged to keep the Fast, use an 
obligatory prayer, obtain the consent of parents for marriage, and live 
up to the Teachings in general.  
     He certainly feels one of your first duties is to deepen the understanding 
of the Faith in the minds of the believers there.  
     You should certainly try to make new contacts but until you have 
a nucleus of active believers there he feels a lot of publicity is premature.  
     As to translations, this is certainly very important, but he would 
not suggest that at present with the limited facilities at your disposal, 
that you translate whole books.  Make selections of subjects that will 
interest the Japanese; some prayers, some of the chapters from "Some 
Answered Questions" on things of general interest rather than the 
purely Christian topics; some of the excerpts from "Gleanings".  In 
other words try and get together a selection from our Teachings that 
covers a wide range of subjects and is representative of our beliefs, and 
translate these at first.  Whole books can be undertaken in the future.  
     He feels the teaching and translating work can go hand in hand 
as you teach with new material translated.  
     Your services are very deeply valued by our beloved Guardian, 
and he assures you he will pray for you and all the Japanese &amp;Baha'is 
in the Holy Shrines.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
 
(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
     The zeal, devotion and courage which you exhibit in your activities 
in the service of the Cause in Japan are truly meritorious and 
evoke my deepest admiration.  Your mission is indeed historic, and 
your pioneer achievements an example to the rising generation.  Persevere 
in your high endeavors, and rest assured that the Beloved will 
bless your exertions and will aid you to fulfil your heart's desire.

     Your outstanding pioneer services are indeed worthy of the 
highest praise, and I am deeply grateful to you for the work you have 
accomplished.  The firm establishment of a spiritual assembly in Japan 
and its consolidation, as well as the formation of small groups 
and isolated centers, will no doubt act as a magnet that will draw the 
inestimable blessings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Persevere in your historic task 
and rest assured and be happy.  
                    Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi  
          (October 16, 1948)  
 
To Mrs. Barbara Davenport 
     He (the Guardian) urges you to encourage the friends (in Japan) 
to observe our &amp;Baha'i laws and ordinances, deepen themselves in the 
administration, and realize they are followers of a Faith--not a mere 
movement.

To Mr. Robert Imagire 
     He (the Guardian) is so pleased to have dear Miss Alexander 
there.  Her devotion and loyalty, her love and knowledge of the 
teachings will be a comfort and inspiration to the believers there (in 
Japan).  
     The Guardian was also very happy to see eight Japanese names 
on the Tokyo Assembly.  Although the help and advice of American 
believers is of great importance, it is excellent that the majority are 
Japanese and are assuming responsibility for the affairs of the Cause 
in their native land.  
     He feels great strides forward have been made, and trusts still 
greater progress lies ahead.  He was delighted to hear the Japanese 
friends and particularly the women, are actively teaching and giving 
lectures.

(in the Guardian's handwriting)  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     The services you are rendering the Faith in Japan are indeed 
remarkable and unforgettable.  I am filled with admiration for the spirit 
that animates you and for your splendid accomplishments.  Persevere 
in your historic tasks, and rest assured that the Beloved is well pleased 
with you.  I will continue to supplicate in your behalf the Master's 
richest blessings, that He may fulfill your heart's desire in His service.  
                    Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi  
          (September 17, 1950)  
 
     The news of the progress being made by the Japanese &amp;Baha'is 
in teaching and in reaching people of importance, pleased him (the 
Guardian) greatly; and he urges you all to persevere, and never lose 
heart.  In his visits to the Shrines, he will supplicate that &amp;Baha'u'llah 
may confirm your efforts, and enlarge the scope of your activities.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (February 27, 1951)  
 
     He (the Guardian) feels by all means you should plan to remain 
in Japan and buy a home, if possible.  Your presence there has marked 
a turning point in the work in that country.  
     It will interest you to know that there are &amp;Baha'is now in 
Formosa and Indochina, and we hope an English believer will be able 
to go out to Hong Kong later.  Lights are going on in Asia.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (September 21, 1951)  
 
     He (the Guardian) was most happy to hear of the progress being 
made in Japan, particularly in the new centers being opened to the 
Faith, such as Yokohama and Kofu.  He was also very happy to know 
that Miss Alexander is now teaching in Kyoto.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (November 12, 1952)  
 
To Mr. and Mrs. Donald Witzel 
     He (the Guardian) was deeply touched by the two letters by the 
two new believers of Korea, and the spirit of loving devotion which 
they portray.  He wishes you to assure them of his prayers in their 
behalf.  He hopes they will be inspired to intensify their teaching efforts, 
so others may be quickened by the spirit of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and an 
Assembly be formed in Korea.  
 
+P107 
     He wishes you and the friends in Tokyo to keep in close touch 
with the friends in Korea.  In fact, he wishes the Tokyo Assembly to 
undertake, as one of their direct responsibilities, the assistance of the 
work in Korea, sending if possible one or two pioneers to Korea.  This 
will keep the Center in Korea, (and even enable it to develop into an 
Assembly), until such time as more American pioneers are sent to 
Korea.  
     The Guardian greatly values the services of the friends in Japan.  
He hopes they will now treble their efforts in the teaching field.  Now 
that the Ten Year Crusade has been so auspiciously launched, the 
divine confirmations are descending; and the friends should seize this 
opportunity to spread the Faith to all corners of the globe.  Especial 
opportunity devolves on the Japanese &amp;Baha'is and pioneers, as one 
of the goals of the Crusade is the establishment of a National Assembly 
for Japan.  
     The Guardian will pray for the success of the teaching efforts of 
the friends in Japan; also for the services and development of the Faith 
in Korea.

          (May 25, 1953)  
 
To Mr. Noureddin Momtazi 
     The Guardian is deeply appreciative of your devotion and sacrifices 
for the Faith.  The gift which you have made of $3,000 toward 
the purchase of the Hazira in Tokyo is a further sign of the dynamic 
spirit which animates you in all of your services.  
     The Guardian attaches the utmost importance to the Hazira of 
Tokyo, as this is to become the Headquarters of the National Assembly 
when it is elected.  
     The Guardian feels the time is now ripe for the Faith to spread 
very rapidly throughout Japan, and he wishes that all of the preliminary 
steps be taken for the development of the Faith as it goes forward.  
Thus he is anxious that the Hazira be purchased this year if 
possible.

To Mr. William Maxwell 
     The Guardian has received very glowing reports of the wonderful 
accomplishments of the Conference+F1 in Japan.  He feels that this 
 
+F1 The International Teaching Conference at Nikko.  
 
+P108 
conference marked a new point of development of the Faith in Japan, 
as well as the entire general area.  The spirit of confirmation is reaching 
all those who arise to serve the Faith; and he is sure divine blessings 
will come upon everyone who attended the Conference and took 
part in its deliberations, and who will now go forth to win new victories.

          (October 19, 1955)  
 
To Mrs. Carolyn Dary 
     He (the Guardian) urges you to make a special effort to visit the 
friends in other places where you stop, no matter how short the time, 
as the news of the progress of the Faith in general will encourage and 
hearten them.  Especially in places such as Japan, the friends need to 
be urged to persevere with their teaching efforts, so as to have more 
Spiritual Assemblies in the future to support their National Body, when 
the time comes for its formation.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (November 23, 1955)  
 
     The recent news from Japan is most heartening--eight Assemblies 
in all.  Even though our dear &amp;Baha'i sister, Miss Alexander may 
be exhausted from years of labour, the harvest is so rich that it 
compensates for any inconvenience or suffering.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (May 3, 1956)  
 
To Mr. John McHenry III 
     He (the Guardian) is very happy that you can arrange your affairs 
so as to return to Korea...  The phenomenal progress the Cause 
has made in that area (Korea) is practically exclusively due to the 
services of the young American &amp;Baha'is who are in the Armed Forces.  
Indeed, it is a great victory won by &amp;Baha'i youth.  
          (signed by R. Rabbani)  
          (March 18, 1957)  
 
To Mr. William Maxwell 
     The Guardian was happy to learn that you are still in Korea and 
that you are able to continue in the teaching work of that important 
country.  He knows that wherever you are you will carry forward the 
pressing requirements of the Faith with vigor and enthusiasm but he 
 
+P109 
feels that Korea and even Japan particularly need the help of yourself 
and other American pioneers at this time.  
          (signed by Leroy Ioas)  
          (August 18, 1957)  
 
To Mr. Eugene Schreiber 
     The Master was most hopeful of the spread of the Faith in Japan.  
Now that His Promises are being fulfilled, the friends must be 
very happy.  Likewise this happiness must translate itself into renewed 
devotion so that the Call of God may be raised in all parts of that 
important country.  
     The Guardian is praying for the success of the teaching work in 
Japan.

               Shoghi Effendi Writes to 
                Emperor Showa of Japan 
 
     Emperor Showa (Hirohito) of Japan had the longest reign (December 
25, 1926 to January 7, 1989) of any reigning sovereign in 
Japan.  He was respected as a scholar; being an eminent marine 
biologist, and he was beloved by his people.  
     Following the custom in Japan, the reign of a new emperor is 
given a specially selected name.  After that emperor dies he takes on 
the name of the reign.  Consequently, Emperor Hirohito, as he was 
known during his reign, is now known as Emperor Showa.  
     At the time of his coronation in the fall of 1928 seven specially 
bound &amp;Baha'i books were presented to His Majesty.  The books which 
were sent in the name of two American &amp;Baha'is were presented by 
Dr. Rokuichiro Masujima, who was a friend of Miss Alexander and 
who was close to the Faith.  He had access to the Imperial Household.  
     Shoghi Effendi was asked to write something to be sent with the 
books.  The message sent to accompany the books was "May the 
perusal of &amp;Baha'i literature enable Your Imperial Majesty to appreciate 
the sublimity and penetrative power of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation 
and inspire you on this auspicious occasion to arise for its worldwide 
recognition and triumph."  
     The books arrived after the coronation ceremonies so the presentation 
was delayed.  On May 22 of the following year Dr. 
Masujima received a letter from the Minister of the Imperial Household 
that the seven books had been presented to the Emperor that day.  
     During World War II the palace did not suffer destruction so 
undoubtedly the books and message are still there with the other 
coronation gifts.  
     In 1930 the great &amp;Baha'i teacher Miss Martha Root visited Japan.  
She sent two gifts to the Emperor; a small Persian rug and a sheet of 
Holy Writings written in Persian script in the form of a beautiful bird.  
Accompanying the gifts was a cable from Shoghi Effendi:  "Martha 
Root care American Embassy Tokyo.  Kindly transmit His Imperial 
Majesty, Tokyo, Japan on behalf of myself and &amp;Baha'is world over, 
expression of our deepest love as well as assurance of heartfelt prayers 
for his well-being and prosperity of his ancient realm."  
     Japan, after recovery from the devastation of World War II, 
shows the prosperity that the Guardian prayed for, and the Emperor, 
active and healthy until the end had a very long and fruitful reign.

               Message from the Universal House of Justice 
                to the North Pacific Oceanic Conference, 
                    Sapporo, Japan, September, 1971 
 
To the Friends of God 
Assembled in the Conference 
of the North Pacific Ocean.  
 
Dearly-loved Friends, 
     On the eve of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the opening of the 
Formative Age of our Faith we call to mind the high hopes often 
expressed by the beloved Master for the spread of the Cause in this 
region.  His mention in the Tablets of the Divine Plan of many of the 
territories represented in this Conference, and the faithful and devoted 
services of that maid-servant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the Hand of the Cause 
Agnes Alexander, who brought the Teachings to these shores in the 
early years of this century.  
     In these days we are witnessing an unprecedented acceleration 
of the teaching work in almost every part of the globe.  In the North 
Pacific Ocean area great strides have been made in the advancement 
of the Cause since that historic Asia Regional Teaching Conference 
in Nikko just sixteen years ago.  The next two years witnessed the 
formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska and of the 
Regional National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia.  To the 
Convention in Tokyo at &amp;Ridvan 1957 the Guardian addressed these 
prophetic words:  
     "This auspicious event, which posterity will regard as the culmination 
of a process initiated, half a century ago, in the capital city 
of Japan ... marks the opening of the second chapter in the history of 
the evolution of His Faith in the North Pacific area.  Such a consummation 
cannot fail to lend a tremendous impetus to its onward march 
in the entire Pacific Ocean..."  
     Since that time National Spiritual Assemblies have also been 
firmly established in Korea and Taiwan.  
     Hokkaido, the site of this Conference, first heard of the Teachings 
less than fifteen years ago, and the first aboriginal peoples of this 
land accepted &amp;Baha'u'llah just over a decade ago.  Now you are the 
witnesses to the beginnings of a rapid increase in the number of believers.  
 
+P112 
Peoples in other islands and lands of the North Pacific, including 
the Ryukyus, Guam, the Trust Territories, the western shores 
of Canada and Alaska and the Aleutians are also enrolling under the 
banner of the Most Great Name, and next &amp;Ridvan yet another pillar 
of the Universal House of Justice is to be raised in Micronesia.  We 
are heartened at the prospect that from indigenous peoples of this vast 
oceanic area, the Ainu, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Koreans, the 
Okinawans, the Micronesians, the American Indians, the Eskimos, and 
the Aleuts vast numbers will soon enter the Faith.  
     The final hours of the Nine Year Plan are fast fleeting.  Praised 
be to God that you have gathered to consult on ways and means of 
assuring complete victory so that from these outposts the Teachings 
may spread to those nearby lands where teeming millions have not as 
yet heard of the advent of this Most Great Dispensation.  
     The sweet perfume of victory is in the air, and we must hasten 
to achieve it while there is yet time.  Vital goals, particularly on the 
homefronts of Taiwan and Japan, remain to be won, and everywhere 
the roots of the faith of the believers must sink deeper and deeper into 
the firm earth of the Teachings lest tempests and trials as yet unforeseen 
shake or uproot the tender plants so lovingly raised in the islands 
of this great Ocean and the land surrounding it.  
     As you and the friends in the sister Conference in Reykjavik 
bring this series of eight Oceanic and Continental Conferences to a 
triumphant close, our prayers for the success of your deliberations 
ascend at the Holy Threshold.  May God grant you the resources, the 
strength, and the determination to attain your highest hopes and enable 
you to open a new and glorious chapter in the evolution of His Faith 
in the North Pacific area.  
                    With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                    The Universal House of Justice 
 
+P113 
                              Afterword 
 
     The first printing of this book was done in 1974.  As it contained 
new material, that is, Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and letters of the 
Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, many of which had never been published, 
and because its theme was Japan, it proved to be a successful addition 
to the &amp;Baha'i literature throughout the &amp;Baha'i world.  It was 
translated into Japanese and has been one of the standard books in that 
language.  
     The &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust of Japan regularly has requests for 
the English edition although it has been out of print since the late 
1970s.  
     When the compiler considered a second edition she decided to 
refer back to the original material for possible changes, to add new 
material, and also add more details such as the names of translators 
(when available), thereby hoping to increase the historical value.  Very 
little of the original has been eliminated.  
     All of the Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to Miss Alexander and to 
&amp;Baha'is in Japan have been included.  Only some of the Tablets written 
to Japanese, who, at the time, were living in the United States have 
been included.  It was difficult to choose which of Shoghi Effendi's 
letters to Miss Aexander should be included.  
     The Guardian had requested that she write to him often so their 
correspondence was extensive.  She actually received many more 
letters than are printed here.  
     Most of Shoghi Effendi's letters (which, of course, also means 
those written on his behalf) to the early &amp;Baha'is of Japan and to the 
institutions of the Faith in Japan are printed here.  
     It was felt that certain communications from the Universal 
House of Justice would add to this important subject, hence the expansion 
to later years.
