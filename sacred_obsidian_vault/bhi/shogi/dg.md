     (India/Hawaii, 1973)

     FILEDATE:  08-06-94 
 
 
+P1 
1    &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA (Stories About)  
 
     "He would also urge you to attach no importance to the 
stories told about &amp;Abdu'l-Baha or to those attributed to Him 
by the friends.  These should be regarded in the same light as 
the notes and impressions of visiting pilgrims.  They need not 
be suppressed, but they should not also be given prominent or 
official recognition."  
 
 
2    &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA'S MINISTRY (Re:  World 
     Objectives)  
 
     "As to the three aims which Shoghi Effendi has stated in 
his America and the Most Great Peace to have been the chief 
objectives of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, it should be pointed out 
that the first was:  The establishment of the Cause in America; 
the erection of the &amp;Baha'i Temple in &amp;Ishqabad, and the building 
on Mt. Carmel of a mausoleum marking the resting-place of the 
&amp;Bab, were the two remaining ones."  
 
 
3    ADMINISTRATION--Attitude Towards 
     (National Assembly's Statement Approved)  
 
     "He also wishes me to express his approval of your statement 
in the November issue of the &amp;Baha'i News to the effect of 
creating within the Assemblies and individual believers a more 
positive and active attitude towards the Administration.  The 
need for positive action seems, indeed, to be one of the most 
urgent needs of the Cause at present."  
 
 
4    ADMINISTRATION, &amp;BAHA'I--(Rules and 
     Regulations)  
 
     "The various rulings and regulations recorded in the `&amp;Baha'i 
Administration', and the supplementary statements already issued 
 
 
 
+P2 
by the National Assembly, he feels, are for the present 
sufficiently detailed to guide the friends in their present-day 
activities...  The American believers, as well as their National 
representatives, must henceforth direct their attention to the 
greater and vital issues which an already established Administration 
is called upon to face and handle, rather than allow their 
energies to be expended in the consideration of purely secondary 
administrative matters."  
 
 
5    ADMINISTRATION (Study and Apply)  
 
     "Without the study and application of the administration 
the teaching of the Cause becomes not only meaningless, but 
loses in effectiveness and scope."  
 
 
6    ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY (Related 
     to America)  
 
     "Now that they (the American believers) have erected the administrative 
machinery of the Cause they must put it to its real 
use--serving only as an instrument to facilitate the flow of the 
spirit of the Faith out into the world.  Just as the muscles enable 
the body to carry out the will of the individual, all Assemblies 
and committees must enable the believers to carry forth the 
Message of God to the waiting public, the love of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and the healing laws and principles of the Faith to all men."  
 
 
7    AFRICAN STUDENTS AND VISITORS 
 
     "He hopes that wherever it is possible the believers will 
make every effort to contact African students and visitors, and 
to show them kindness and hospitality.  This may not only 
lead to the conversion of some while in America, but will also 
make friends for the Faith in Africa."  
 
8    AGES AND EPOCHS (Define)  
 
     "The Faith is divided into three Ages:  the Heroic, the 
Formative, the Golden Age, as has been outlined in His 
 
 
 
+P3 
Writings.  The Heroic Age closed with the Ascension of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The Formative Age is divided into epochs.  The 
first epoch lasted 25 years.  We are now actually in the second 
epoch of the Formative Age.  How long the Formative Age 
will last is not known, and there will probably be a number of 
epochs in it.  
     "The Divine Plan of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is divided into epochs.  
The first Seven-Year Plan constituted the first stage of the first 
epoch; the second Seven-Year Plan constitutes the second stage; 
while the Ten-Year Crusade will constitute the third stage of the 
first epoch of the Divine Plan.  The first epoch of the Divine Plan 
will conclude with the conclusion of the Ten-Year Crusade."  
 
 
9    &amp;ALLAH-U-ABHA (&amp;Baha'i Greeting)  
 
     "The &amp;Baha'is are free to greet each other with &amp;Allah-u-Abha 
when they meet, if they want to, but they should avoid anything 
which to outsiders, in a western country, might seem like some 
strange Oriental password.  We must be very firm on principles 
and laws, but very normal and natural in our ways, so as to 
attract strangers."  
 
 
10   ANNUAL CONVENTION 
 
     "I am deeply convinced that if the Annual Convention of the 
friends in America, as well as the National Spiritual Assembly, 
desire to become potent instruments for the speedy realization 
of the Beloved's fondest hopes for the future of that country, 
they should endeavor, first and foremost, to exemplify, in an 
increasing degree, to all &amp;Baha'is and to the world at large the 
high ideals of fellowship and service which &amp;Baha'u'llah and the 
beloved Master repeatedly set before them."  
 
 
11   AQDAS (THE)--LAWS OF 
 
     "In view of the importance of such a statement, he feels it 
is his duty to explain that the Laws revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
the Aqdas are, whenever practical and not in direct conflict 
 
 
+P4 
with the Civil laws of the land, absolutely binding on every 
believer or &amp;Baha'i institution whether in the East or in the 
West.  Certain laws, such as fasting, obligatory prayers, the 
consent of the parents before marriage, avoidance of alcoholic 
drinks, monogamy, should be regarded by all believers as universally 
and vitally applicable at the present time.  Others have 
been formulated in anticipation of a state of society destined 
to emerge from the chaotic conditions that prevail today.  
     "When the Aqdas is published, this matter will be further 
explained and elucidated.  What has not been formulated in the 
Aqdas, in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance 
arising out of the application of the laws already formulated 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah, will have to be enacted by the Universal 
House of Justice.  This body can supplement but never invalidate 
or modify in the least degree what has already been formulated 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever 
to lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the 
provisions of so fundamental and sacred a Book..."  
 
 
12   ARCHIVES (The Importance Of)  
 
     "The importance of the institution of &amp;Baha'i Archives is not 
due only to the many teaching facilities it procures, but is 
especially to be found in the vast amount of historical data and 
information it offers both to the present-day administrators of 
the Cause, and to the &amp;Baha'i historians of the future.  The 
institution of &amp;Baha'i Archives is indeed a most valuable 
storehouse of information regarding all the aspects of the Faith, 
administrative as well as doctrinal.  Future generations of 
believers will be surely in a better position than we are to 
truly and adequately appreciate the many advantages and 
facilities which the institution of the Archives offers to 
individual believers and also to the community at large.  Now 
that the Cause is rapidly passing through so many different 
phases of its evolution, is the time for the friends to exert their 
utmost in order to preserve as much as they can of the sacred 
relics and various other precious objects that are associated 
with the lives of the Founders of the Faith, and particularly the 
 
 
+P5 
Tablets They have revealed.  Every believer should realize 
that he has a definite responsibility to shoulder in this matter, 
and to help, to whatever extent he can, in rendering successful 
and valuable work which National and local &amp;Baha'i Archives 
committees are so devotedly accomplishing for the Faith in 
America."  
 
 
13   ARCHIVES 
 
     "The general principle should be that any object used by 
Him in person should be preserved for posterity, whether in 
the local or National Archives.  It is the duty and responsibility 
of the &amp;Baha'i Assemblies to ascertain carefully whether 
such objects are genuine or not, and to exercise the utmost 
caution in the matter."  
 
 
14   ASSEMBLIES--UNITY OF (&amp;Baha'u'llah's 
     Promise)  
 
     "&amp;Baha'u'llah has given the promise that in every Assembly 
where unity and harmony prevail, there His glorious spirit will 
not only be present, but will animate, sustain and guide all the 
friends in all their deliberations.  
     "It is to unity that the Guardian has been continually 
calling the friends:  For where a united will exists, nothing can 
effectively oppose and hamper the forces of constructive development."  
 
 
15   ASSEMBLY MEETINGS 
 
     "The Spiritual Assembly must decide how often it should 
meet in order to properly handle the affairs of the Cause under 
its jurisdiction.  Twice a week or twice a month is not the 
point, the point is that it should be alert and carry on the work 
adequately."  
 
 
16   ASSEMBLY VACANCY 
 
     "...It is establishing a dangerous precedent to allow Assemblies 
to put a time limit on non-attendance of their members at 
 
 
+P6 
meetings of the S.A., beyond which that person is automatically 
dropped from the Assembly and a vacancy declared ... 
there should be no time limit fixed by Assemblies beyond which 
a person is dropped.  Every case of prolonged absence from the 
sessions of the Assembly should be considered separately by that 
Assembly, and if the person is seen to not want to attend 
meetings or to be held away from them indefinitely because of 
illness or travel, then a vacancy could legitimately be declared 
and a new member be elected."  
 
 
17   ASSOCIATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS 
     (Appointing of)  
 
     "The Guardian wishes your Assembly to abandon the 
practice of appointing associate members to some of the 
committees...  Such a practice, he feels, tends to create confusion 
and misunderstanding."  
 
 
18   ATTACKS FROM CHURCH 
     MISSIONARIES 
 
     "The Guardian has read very carefully the letters your 
Assembly has received from the Spiritual Assemblies of Urbana 
and Chicago, reporting the criticisms that have been advanced 
by Rev. John Elder, a missionary from Iran.  While he is 
certain that such attacks from church missionaries are destined 
to increase in number and force in the future, he feels that 
for the present they do not constitute a challenge so grave and 
widespread as to justify any strong action by your Assembly.  
Later on, when the very progress of the Cause on the one hand, 
and the corresponding decline in ecclesiastical organizations on 
the other, will inevitably incite Christian ecclesiastical leaders 
to vehemently oppose and undermine the Faith, the believers 
will then have a real chance to defend and vindicate the Cause.  
Under present conditions it would be inadvisable for the 
American community to give such issues too much prominence."  
 
 
+P7 
19   &amp;BAB, DECLARATION OF 
 
     "In regard to the question submitted to your Assembly by 
the &amp;Baha'i group at Maui, Hawaii, concerning the passage on 
page 88 of the book `&amp;Baha'i Administration,' 
     "...The Guardian wishes me to inform you that the festivals 
of the Declaration of the &amp;Bab and the birthday of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
referred to in that passage as having been celebrated on the 
twenty-second of November, 1925, by the &amp;Baha'is of the Orient, 
are based on the lunar calendar.  For this reason the date of 
the celebration is not fixed, but shifts every year.  Eventually 
as the Master has explicitly stated, a uniform system will have 
to be established by the International House of Justice."  
 
 
20   &amp;BAB'S PHOTOGRAPH 
 
     "May I also draw your attention to the fact that the &amp;Bab's 
photograph which appeared in Nicolas' book, Siyyid &amp;Ali 
Muhammad dit le &amp;Bab, many years ago, is not authentic, 
although it presents great similarity to the original drawings of 
the &amp;Bab's portrait."  
 
 
21   &amp;BAHA'I DISPENSATION (Duration of)  
 
     "Concerning your question relative to the duration of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  There is no contradiction between 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's statement in the &amp;Iqan about the renewal of the 
City of God once every thousand years, and that of the 
Guardian in the Dispensation to the effect that the &amp;Baha'i 
cycle will extend over a period of at least 500,000 years.  The 
apparent contradiction is due to the confusion of the terms 
cycle and dispensation.  For while the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
will last for at least one thousand years, His Cycle will 
extend still farther, to at least 500,000 years.  
     "The &amp;Baha'i cycle is, indeed, incomparable in its greatness.  
It includes not only the Prophets that will appear after &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
but all those who have preceded Him ever since Adam.  
These should, indeed, be viewed as constituting but preliminary 
 
 
+P8 
stages leading gradually to the appearance of this supreme 
Manifestation of God."  
 
 
22   &amp;BAHA'IS (Destiny of)  
 
     "I, for my part, am determined to reinforce the impulse that 
impels its members forward to meet their destiny.  The Founders 
of their Faith survey from the Kingdom on high the range 
of their achievements, acclaim their progress, and are ever 
ready to speed their eventual triumph."  
 
 
23   &amp;BAHA'IS--NEW (On Admittance of New 
     Applicants)  
 
     "He has noted with care what you had written him regarding 
the question of admittance of applicants into the Cause.  
This is certainly a matter which calls for the utmost tact, 
wisdom and consideration on the part of &amp;Baha'i Assemblies.  
While, as he himself has repeatedly stressed, a uniform procedure 
should be adopted and followed whereby every applicant 
should be required to express his whole-hearted and unconditional 
acceptance of the essential verities of the Cause, great 
care should also be taken not to insist on matters of a secondary 
importance which the newcomer cannot, for obvious reasons, 
fully grasp and apprehend at the beginning.  Once the applicant 
has been admitted in the Community with a clear understanding 
of the duties and responsibilities, and essential implications 
which such membership entails, there would be no difficulty for 
him in gradually adjusting his whole ideas according to the 
requirements set forth in the Teachings.  The process of becoming 
a &amp;Baha'i is necessarily slow and gradual.  The essential is 
not that the beginner should have a full and detailed knowledge 
of the Cause, a thing which is obviously impossible in the vast 
majority of cases, but that he should, by an act of his own will, 
be willing to uphold and follow the truth and guidance set 
forth in the Teachings, and thus open his heart and mind to the 
reality of the Manifestation."  
 
 
+P9 
24   &amp;BAHA'IS--NEW (On Presenting the Master's 
     Will to New Applicants)  
 
     "Concerning the best method of presenting the Master's 
Will to the newcomers, Shoghi Effendi is of the opinion that 
the N.S.A. should first make some suitable extracts from the 
Testament and to send these to all the local Assemblies for their 
use, so that there may be full unity in circulating the provisions 
of the Will among the new believers.  The problem of choosing 
such excerpts is left entirely to the discretion of the N.S.A.  
The main thing, as it appears to the Guardian, is that the full 
station of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha be clearly 
explained and that the origin, nature and working of the 
Administrative Order of the Faith be clearly stated.  The full 
implications of such a recognition are evidently beyond the 
comprehension of any new believer.  Such a knowledge can be 
acquired gradually and only when the essentials of the Faith 
have been clearly recognized and adequately understood."  
 
 
25   &amp;BAHA'IS--NEW (Qualifications of a New 
     Believer)  
 
     "When a person becomes a &amp;Baha'i, he gives up the past only 
in the sense that he is a part of this new and living Faith of God, 
and must seek to pattern himself, in act and thought, along the 
lines laid down by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The fact that he is by origin 
a Jew or a Christian, a black man or a white man, is not important 
any more, but, as you say, lends color and charm to the 
&amp;Baha'i community in that it demonstrates unity in diversity."  
 
 
26   &amp;BAHA'IS--NEW (The "Two Extremes" in 
     Bringing in New &amp;Baha'is)  
 
     "The believers must discriminate between the two extremes 
of bringing people into the Cause before they have fully grasped 
its fundamentals and making it too hard for them, expecting 
too much of them, before they accept them.  This requires 
truly keen judgment, as it is unfair to people to allow them to 
 
 
+P10 
embrace a movement the true meaning of which they have not 
fully grasped.  It is equally unfair to expect them to be perfect 
&amp;Baha'is before they can enter the Faith.  Many teaching problems 
arise out of these two extremes..."  
 
 
27   &amp;BAHA'IS (Two Kinds of)  
 
     "There are two kinds of &amp;Baha'is, one might say:  those 
whose religion is &amp;Baha'i and those who live for the Faith.  
Needless to say if we can belong to the latter category, if we 
can be in the vanguard of heroes, martyrs and saints, it is more 
praiseworthy in the sight of God."  
 
 
28   &amp;BAHA'I WAY OF LIFE (The Strength of the 
     Cause)  
 
     "It is good for the &amp;Baha'is to learn that being a &amp;Baha'i is 
essentially an inner thing, or way of life, and not dependent on 
fixed patterns.  Important as our organized Institutions are, 
they are not the Faith itself.  The strength of the Cause grows 
no matter how much disrupted its activities may temporarily be.  
This we see over and over again, in lands where the Faith 
has been temporarily banned; at times when the believers are 
persecuted and even killed; where they are serving all alone or 
scattered and isolated.  So it has been a stimulating experience 
for the American believers to be without their schools for a few 
years, rather than a depressing one."  
 
 
29   &amp;BAHA'U'LLAH (In accepting)  
 
     "In accepting &amp;Baha'u'llah you have accepted Christ in His 
appearance as the Father, as He Himself so clearly foretold.  The 
Catholic Church does not believe this; on the contrary, it still 
awaits the return of Christ.  If you decide, in order to be buried 
next to your dear husband, to return to the Church, you 
either would have to, in good faith, deny &amp;Baha'u'llah or you 
would be just using the church as a means to satisfy a desire of 
your own, which would certainly not be an upright and conscientious 
thing to do.  
 
 
+P11 
     "When you think that your husband's soul is now free of 
the limitations of this world, and that he no doubt is beginning 
to see religious truth in its true light and to appreciate the 
station of &amp;Baha'u'llah, you should ask yourself whether he would 
wish you to leave the truth for this day and re-enter the church 
just for the sake of your dust being near his dust.  Your spirit, 
when you pass away, will be near his spirit; of what importance, 
then, is the body?  He will pray for your guidance in 
this matter."  
 
 
30   BELIEVERS, NEW (Accept Cause Without 
     Qualifications)  
 
     "The believers, and particularly those who have not had sufficient 
experience in teaching, should be very careful in the way 
they present the teachings of the Cause.  Sincerity, devotion and 
Faith are not the sole conditions of successful teaching.  Tactfulness, 
extreme caution and wisdom are equally important.  We 
should not be in a hurry when we announce the message to the 
public and we should be careful to present the teachings in their 
entirety and not to alter them for the sake of others.  Allegiance 
to the Faith cannot be partial and half-hearted.  Either we 
should accept the Cause without any qualification whatsoever 
or cease calling ourselves &amp;Baha'is.  The new believers should be 
made to realize that it is not sufficient for them to accept some 
aspects of the teachings and reject those which cannot suit their 
mentality in order to become fully recognized and active followers 
of the Faith.  In this way all sorts of misunderstandings 
will vanish and the organic unity of the Cause will be preserved."  
 
 
31   BELIEVERS, REMOVAL OF 
 
     "Concerning the removal of believers I feel that such a 
vitally important matter should be given the most serious consideration 
and preferably be referred to the National Assembly for 
further consideration and final decision.  We should be slow to 
accept and reluctant to remove.  I fully approve and whole-heartedly 
and unreservedly uphold the principle to which you 
 
 
+P12 
refer that personalities should not be made centers around 
which the community may revolve but they should be subordinated 
under all conditions and however great their merits to 
the properly constituted Assemblies.  You and your co-workers 
can never over-estimate or over-emphasize this cardinal principle 
of &amp;Baha'i Administration."  
 
 
32   BIBLE (Authenticity of the)  
 
     "As to the question raised by the Racine Assembly in connection 
with &amp;Baha'u'llah's statement in the Gleanings concerning 
the sacrifice of &amp;Ishmael; although His statement does not agree 
with that made in the Bible, Genesis 12:9, the friends should 
unhesitatingly, and for reasons that are only too obvious, give 
precedence to the sayings of &amp;Baha'u'llah which, it would be 
pointed out, is fully corroborated by the &amp;Qur'an, which book 
is more authentic than the Bible, including both the New and 
Old Testaments.  The Bible is not wholly authentic, and in this 
respect not to be compared with the &amp;Qur'an, and should be 
wholly subordinated to the authentic Sayings of &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
 
33   CALENDAR (&amp;BAHA'I)  
 
     "It is advisable to use both the &amp;Baha'i dates, according to 
the &amp;Baha'i Calendar, and the usual Gregorian dates as well.  
The friends at present are free to do as they please."  
 
 
34   CALIPHATE AND &amp;IMAMATE 
 
     "Both Caliphate and &amp;Imamate mean successorship.  Either 
term could be used."  
 
 
35   CATASTROPHE (The Apocalyptic Upheaval)  
 
     "We have no indication of exactly what nature the apocalyptic 
upheaval will be; it might be another war ... but as students 
of our &amp;Baha'i Writings, it is clear that the longer the `Divine 
Physician' (i.e. &amp;Baha'u'llah) is withheld from healing the ills of 
 
 
+P13 
the world, the more severe will be the crisis, and the more 
terrible the sufferings of the patient."  
 
 
36   CIVIL COURTS (Disputes)  
 
     "The Guardian wishes to emphasize the importance of 
avoiding (reference to civil courts) of cases of dispute between 
believers, even in &amp;non-Baha'i issues.  It is the Assembly's function 
to endeavor to settle amicably such disputes, both in order to 
safeguard the fair name and prestige of the Cause, and to 
acquire the necessary experience for the extension of its functions 
in the future."  
 
 
37   CIVIL ELECTIONS (Voting in)  
 
     "...No &amp;Baha'i vote for an officer, no &amp;Baha'i participation in 
the affairs of the Republic, shall involve acceptance of a program 
or policy that contravenes any vital principle, spiritual or 
social, of the Faith.  
     "...No vote cast, or office undertaken, by a &amp;Baha'i should 
necessarily constitute acceptance, by the voter or office holder, 
of the entire program of any political party.  No &amp;Baha'i can be 
regarded as either a Republican or Democrat, as such.  He is 
above all else, the supporter of the principles enunciated by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, with which, I am firmly convinced, the program 
of no political party is completely harmonious."  
 
 
38   COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS (Assembly 
     Members)  
 
     "Regarding the non-appointment of Assembly members to 
membership on National Committees, the Guardian firmly believes 
that no such principle should be recognised.  Those who 
are best fitted for the specific work assigned to the Committees 
should be elected irrespective of their membership on either 
National or local Assemblies.  The greater the pressure on those 
who shoulder both Committee and Assembly responsibilities, 
the greater the reward and the richer the blessings vouchsafed to 
those who willingly and gratefully sustain this double burden."  
 
 
+P14 
39   COMMITTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
     "He feels that Committees must assume more responsibility 
and exercise freedom of choice and judgment in electing their 
officers, and function as a corporate body with a corporate 
spirit.  More especially so as now that the Cause is growing 
in numbers, and its responsibilities are being multiplied, 
National committees are acquiring added importance and must 
seek, ever increasingly, to follow the pattern of &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
assume responsibility for the election of their officers.  These committees 
must develop, become mature, and forge ahead courageously 
relying more on united effort and less on personal leadership, 
as is now the case with Local and National Assemblies."  
 
 
40   CONTRIBUTION 
 
     "As to the idea of `giving what one can afford', this does by 
no means put a limit or even exclude the possibility of self-sacrifice.  
There can be no limit to one's contributions to the 
national fund.  The more one can give the better it is, especially 
when such offerings necessitate the sacrifice of other wants and 
desires on the part of the donor.  The harder the sacrifice the 
more meritorious will it be of course in the eye of God.  For 
after all it is not so much the quantity of one's offerings that 
matters, but rather the measure of deprivation that such offerings 
entail."  
 
 
41   CONTRIBUTIONS (Lifting the Burden of 
     Misery from Mankind)  
 
     "...In the first place every believer is free to follow the dictates 
of his own conscience as regards the manner in which to 
spend his own money.  Secondly, we must always bear in mind 
that there are so few &amp;Baha'is in the world, relative to the world's 
population, and so many people in need, that even if all of us 
gave all we had, it would not alleviate more than an infinitesimal 
amount of suffering.  This does not mean we must not help 
 
 
+P15 
the needy, we should; but our contributions to the Faith are 
the surest way of lifting once and for all time the burden of 
hunger and misery from mankind, for it is only through the 
System of &amp;Baha'u'llah--Divine in origin--that the world can be 
gotten on its feet, and want, fear, hunger, war, etc., be eliminated.  
&amp;Non-Baha'is cannot contribute to our work or do it for 
us; so really our first obligation is to support our own teaching 
work, as this will lead to the healing of the nations."  
 
 
42   CONTRIBUTIONS ARE VOLUNTARY 
 
     "In connection with the Institution of the National Fund 
and the budgetary system set forth in the minutes of the 
National Spiritual Assembly, I feel urged to remind you of the 
necessity of ever bearing in mind the cardinal principle that all 
contributions to the Fund are to be purely and strictly voluntary 
in character.  It should be made clear and evident to every 
one that any form of compulsion, however slight and indirect, 
strikes at the very root principle underlying the formation of 
the Fund ever since its inception.  While appeals of a general 
character, carefully worded and moving and dignified in tone 
are welcome under all circumstances, it should be left entirely 
to the discretion of every conscientious believer to decide upon 
the nature, the amount, and purpose of his or her contribution 
for the propagation of the Cause."  
 
 
43   COVENANT (Meaning of &amp;Baha'i)  
 
     "As regards the meaning of the &amp;Baha'i Covenant:  The 
Guardian considers the existence of two forms of Covenant both 
of which are explicitly mentioned in the literature of the Cause.  
First is the Covenant that every Prophet makes with humanity 
or, more definitely, with His people that they will accept and 
follow the coming Manifestation who will be the reappearance 
of His reality.  The second form of Covenant is such as the 
one &amp;Baha'u'llah made with His people that they should accept 
the Master.  This is merely to establish and strengthen the 
 
 
+P16 
succession of the series of Lights that appear after every 
Manifestation.  Under the same category falls the Covenant 
the Master made with the &amp;Baha'is that they should accept His 
administration after Him."  
     "The Most Great Covenant is different from the Everlasting 
Covenant."  
 
 
44   COVENANT BREAKERS (Expulsion and 
     Reinstatement of)  
 
     "The Guardian, like the Master before him, has not considered 
it advisable to as yet permit any person or Assembly to 
put another person out of the Cause of God.  There is a sharp 
distinction between depriving a believer of his voting rights, 
which is a severe disciplinary measure and not a spiritual sanction, 
and pronouncing a former believer to be a truly spiritually 
diseased soul, a soul in the condition the Master referred to 
when, in His last cable to America before His ascension, He 
said:  `He who sitteth with a leper catcheth leprosy.'  The 
Guardian has, within the last few years, considered the 
National Assemblies strong enough to wield the instrument of 
sanction in the sense of depriving a &amp;Baha'i of his voting rights.  
But no one but himself can pronounce a person to be in that 
diseased condition we call `Covenant Breaking' and no one but 
he can reinstate a Covenant Breaker.  No National Assembly 
has been given this right and cannot therefore review the question 
or reinstate anyone..."  
 
 
45   COVENANT BREAKERS (Shun)  
 
     "...&amp;Baha'u'llah and the Master in many places and very emphatically 
have told us to shun entirely all Covenant breakers 
as they are afflicted with what we might try and define as a 
contagious spiritual disease; they have also told us, however, 
to pray for them.  These souls are not lost forever.  In the 
Aqdas, &amp;Baha'u'llah says that God will forgive &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya if 
he repents.  It follows, therefore, that God will forgive any soul 
 
 
+P17 
if he repents.  Most of them don't want to repent, unfortunately.  
If the leaders can be forgiven it goes without saying that their 
followers can also be forgiven...  
     "Also, it has nothing to do with unity in the Cause; if a 
man cuts a cancer out of his body to preserve his health and 
very life, no one would suggest that for the sake of unity it 
should be reintroduced into the otherwise healthy organism.  
On the contrary, what was once a part of him has so radically 
changed as to have become a poison."  
 
 
46   CRIMSON BOOK (The)  
 
     "Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge `which 
could largely eliminate fear' has not been disclosed or identified 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah, so we do not know what it is.  
     "However, what &amp;Baha'u'llah did not elaborate but what He 
meant by the `world' recorded in the Crimson Book was the 
power of the Covenant.  
     "The `Crimson Book' refers to the Book of His Covenant, 
and the reference above means the power for unity which the 
Covenant possesses and radiates.  On page 238 of `God Passes 
By' you will find the cross-reference to the `Crimson Book' and 
the `Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.'"  
 
 
47   CRITICISM 
 
     "When criticism and harsh words arise within a &amp;Baha'i 
community, there is no remedy except to put the past behind 
one, and persuade all concerned to turn over a new leaf, and 
for the sake of God and His Faith refrain from mentioning the 
subjects which have led to misunderstanding and inharmony.  
The more the friends argue back and forth and maintain, each 
side, that their point of view is the right one, the worse the 
whole situation becomes.  
     "When we see the condition the world is in today, we must 
surely forget these utterly insignificant internal disturbances, 
 
 
+P18 
and rush, unitedly, to the rescue of humanity.  You should urge 
your fellow &amp;Baha'is to support you in a strong effort to suppress 
every critical thought and every harsh word, in order to let the 
spirit of &amp;Baha'u'llah flow into the entire community, and unite 
it in His love and in His service."  
 
 
48   CRITICISM (On)  
 
     "...Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity.  But its root is 
lack of faith in the system of &amp;Baha'u'llah, i.e., the Administrative 
Order--and lack of obedience to Him--for He has forbidden 
it!  If the &amp;Baha'is would follow the &amp;Baha'i laws in voting, in 
electing, in serving and in abiding by Assembly decisions, all 
this waste of strength through criticizing others could be diverted 
into cooperation and achieving the Plan..."  
 
 
49   DANIEL, THE PROPHECY OF 
 
     "Regarding the Prophecy of Daniel:  The passage in Esselmont 
should be changed to state that this prophecy refers to the 
one-hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
in the Garden of &amp;Ridvan, &amp;Baghdad--reference to this can be 
found in `The Passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha' in quotation from two of 
His Tablets."  
 
 
50   DISPENSATION OF &amp;BAHA'U'LLAH 
 
     "With reference to ... the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he 
wishes me to explain that although &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's station is not 
that of a Manifestation of God, nevertheless supplications may 
be addressed to Him.  It is essential, however, that every 
believer should realize that while doing so he is directing his 
thoughts toward the Master as an intermediary between him 
and the Manifestation, and not as the Source of Divine Revelation 
and Spiritual Guidance.  Provided this distinction is clearly 
established, there can be no harm or objection in addressing 
prayers to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha."  
 
 
+P19 
51   DISPUTES, INDIVIDUAL--(Consultation 
     with Assembly)  
 
     "Regarding consultation:  Any person can refer a matter to 
the Assembly for consultation whether the other person wishes to 
or not.  In matters which affect the Cause the Assembly should, 
if it deems it necessary, intervene even if both sides don't want 
it to, because the whole purpose of the Assemblies is to protect 
the Faith, the Communities and the individual &amp;Baha'is as 
well."  
 
 
52   DRAMA--MANIFESTATIONS (Dramatic 
     Works)  
 
     "With reference to your question whether the Figures of the 
&amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah should be made to appear as characters in 
dramatic works written by the believers, Shoghi Effendi's opinion 
is that such an attempt to dramatize the Manifestations 
would be highly disrespectful, and hence should be avoided by 
the friends, even in the case of the Master.  Besides it would be 
practically impossible to carry out such a plan faithfully, and in 
a dignified and befitting manner."  
 
 
53   DRAMA OF THE FAITH 
 
     "The Faith can certainly be dramatized, but two things 
must be remembered:  No personal presentation of the &amp;Bab, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah or the Master, only their Words can be used, but 
no figure must represent Them; great dignity must be the 
keynote."  
 
 
54   ECONOMIC TEACHINGS 
 
     "With regard to your wish for reorganizing your business 
along &amp;Baha'i lines, Shoghi Effendi deeply appreciates the spirit 
that has permitted you to make such a suggestion.  But he 
feels nevertheless that the time has not yet come for any believer 
to bring about such a fundamental change in the economic 
structure of our society, however restricted may be the field for 
 
 
+P20 
such an experiment.  The economic teachings of the Cause, 
though well known in their main outline, have not as yet been 
sufficiently elaborated and systematized to allow anyone to 
make an exact and thorough application of them even on a 
restricted scale."  
 
 
55   ECONOMICS--&amp;BAHA'I 
 
     "As you say, the Writings are not so rich on this subject 
and many issues at present baffling the minds of the world are 
not even mentioned.  The primary consideration is the spirit 
that has to permeate our economic life, and this will gradually 
crystallize itself into definite institutions and principles that will 
help to bring about the ideal condition foretold by &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
     "No, &amp;Baha'u'llah did not bring a complete system of economics 
to the world.  Profit sharing is recommended as a solution 
to one form of economic problems.  There is nothing in the 
teachings against some kind of capitalism; its present form, 
though, would require adjustments to be made."  
     "There are practically no technical teachings on economics 
in the Cause, such as banking, the price system, and others.  The 
Cause is not an economic system, nor its Founders be considered 
as having been technical economists.  The contribution 
of the Faith to this subject is essentially indirect, as it consists 
of the application of spiritual principles to our present-day 
economic system.  &amp;Baha'u'llah has given us a few basic principles 
which should guide future &amp;Baha'i economists in establishing 
such institutions which will adjust the economic relationships of 
the world...  
     "Social inequality is the inevitable outcome of the natural 
inequality of man.  Human beings are different in ability and 
should, therefore, be different in their social and economic 
standing.  Extremes of wealth and poverty should, however, be 
abolished...  
     "The Master has definitely stated that wages should be unequal, 
simply because that men are unequal in their ability and 
hence should receive wages that would correspond to their 
varying capacities and resources."  
 
 
+P21 
56   ECONOMIC TEACHINGS 
 
     "As regards the activities of the economic committee of the 
National Assembly; Shoghi Effendi fully sympathizes with the 
desire of some of the members to see the Committee find ways 
and means to put into practice the economic teachings of the 
Cause, as explained in some of the recorded Writings and Sayings 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah and the Master.  But he believes that the 
time is not yet ripe for such activities.  First we have to study 
the economic teachings in the light of modern problems more 
thoroughly so that we may advocate what the Founders of the 
Faith say and not what we conjecture from Their Writings.  
There is great difference between sounding a great general 
principle and finding its application to actual prevailing conditions.  
Secondly, the Cause is not financially in a position to 
launch itself in such undertakings at present.  Such plans need 
great financial backing to be worked out in a permanent form.  
In time, Shoghi Effendi hopes all these things will come to pass.  
For the present we have to consolidate our basic institutions 
and spread the teachings and spirit of the Faith among the 
public."  
 
 
57   EDUCATION (On Inability of Modern 
     Education to Produce a Mature Mind)  
 
     "People today indeed do tend to be very superficial in their 
thinking, and it would seem as if the educational systems in use 
are sorely lacking in ability to produce a mature mind in a 
person who has reached supposedly adult life!  All the outside 
influences that surround the individual seem to have an intensely 
distracting effect, and it is a hard job to get the average 
person to do any deep thinking or even a little meditation on the 
problems facing him and the world at large.  
     "Over and over again &amp;Baha'u'llah cried out against the heedlessness 
of humanity, and warns of the fate such an attitude 
must lead to.  Did we not know what God plans to, and will 
do, with the world in the future, we should certainly be as 
hopeless as many of the best thinkers of our generation have 
become."  
 
 
+P22 
 
58   ELDERS (Four and Twenty)  
 
     "Regarding the four and twenty elders:  The Master, in a 
Tablet, stated that they were the &amp;Bab, the eighteen Letters of 
the Living, and five others who would be known in the future.  
So far we do not know who these five others are."  
 
 
59   ELECTION (Acceptance of)  
 
     "Concerning the question of refusal by certain believers to 
accept election to an administrative post:  The Guardian strongly 
feels that criticism, opposition, or confusion do not provide 
sufficient grounds for either refusal or resignation.  Only cases 
of physical or mental incapacity, which, by their very nature, 
are extremely rare, constitute valid reasons for such an act.  
The difficulties and tests involved in the acceptance of Administrative 
posts, far from inducing the believers to dissociate 
themselves from the work of the Cause, should spur them on 
to greater exertions and to a more active participation in the 
privileged task of resolving the problems that confront the 
&amp;Baha'i community.  
     "Only in cases where individual believers, without any valid 
reason, deliberately refuse the repeated exhortations, pleas, and 
warnings addressed to them by their Assemblies, should action 
be taken in removing them from the voting list.  This is a 
measure designed to sustain the institutions of the Faith at the 
present time, and to insure that the abilities and talents of its, 
as yet, limited number of supporters are properly consecrated 
to its service.  
     "The believers, for the sake of the Cause, now in the period 
of its infancy, should accept their duties in a spirit a self-sacrifice, 
and should be animated by the desire to uphold the 
verdict of the electorate, and to lend their share of assistance 
however difficult the circumstances, to the effective administration 
of the affairs of the Faith.  
     "The same sanction should apply to those who persistently 
refuse to dissociate themselves from political and ecclesiastical 
activities.  This is a general principle which is being maintained 
throughout the &amp;Baha'i world..."  
 
 
+P23 
60   ELECTIONS (&amp;BAHA'I)  
 
     "I feel that reference to personalities before the election 
would give rise to misunderstanding and differences.  What 
the friends should do is get thoroughly acquainted with one 
another, to exchange views, to mix freely and discuss among 
themselves the requirements and qualifications for such a membership 
without reference or application, however indirect, to 
particular individuals.  We should refrain from influencing the 
opinion of others, of canvassing for any particular individual, 
but should stress the necessity of getting fully acquainted with 
the qualifications of membership referred to in our Beloved's 
Tablets of learning more about one another through direct, 
personal experience rather than through the reports and opinions 
of our friends."  
 
 
61   ELECTIONS (&amp;BAHA'I) (To Administrative 
     Posts)  
 
     "There is no objection in principle to an Assembly being 
re-elected whether in toto or in part, provided the members 
are considered to be well qualified for that post.  It is 
individual merit that counts.  Novelty, or the mere act of 
renewal of elections, are purely secondary considerations.  
Changes in Assembly membership would be welcome so 
far as they do not prejudice the quality of such membership.  
Once Assembly elections are over, the results should be conscientiously 
and unquestionably accepted by the entire body of the 
believers, not necessarily because they represent the Voice of 
Truth, or the Will of &amp;Baha'u'llah, but for the supreme purpose 
of maintaining unity and harmony in the community."  
 
 
62   ELECTIONS (Assembly Voting)  
 
     "With these Assemblies, Local as well as National, harmoniously, 
vigorously and efficiently functioning throughout the 
&amp;Baha'i world, the only means for the establishment of the 
Supreme House of Justice will have been assured.  And when 
this Supreme Body will have been properly established, it will 
 
 
+P24 
have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay down the 
principle which shall direct, as long as it deems advisable, the 
affairs of the Cause.  
     "Pending the establishment, and to insure uniformity 
throughout the East and throughout the West, all Local Assemblies 
will have to be re-elected once a year, during the first day 
of Ridvan, and the result of polling, if possible, be declared on 
that day."  
 
 
63   ELECTIONS (The Character of &amp;Baha'i)  
 
     "Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated assurance that 
every Assembly elected in that rarified atmosphere of selflessness 
and detachment is in truth, appointed of God, that its 
verdict is truly inspired, that one and all should submit to its 
decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness ... the elector ... 
is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer and 
reflection have inspired him to uphold...  Hence it is incumbent 
upon the chosen delegates to consider without the least trace 
of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration, 
the names of only those who can best combine the 
necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, 
of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience...  
Nothing short of the all-encompassing, all-pervading 
power of His Guidance and Love can enable this newly 
enfolded order to gather strength and flourish amid the storm 
and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fullness of time vindicate 
its high claim to be universally recognized as the one Haven 
of abiding felicity and peace."  
 
 
64   ELECTION OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES 
     (Radical Changes Not Advised)  
 
     "Regarding your questions concerning the advisability of 
changing the basis of the National Assembly's election and confining 
it to the body of delegates or of limiting the term of 
office:  He feels that as any such changes are of a radical nature 
and should therefore apply to the National Spiritual Assemblies 
 
 
+P25 
of other countries, they are inadvisable and premature, both for 
this reason and because of their very nature.  
     "What is needed is to get the administration in its present 
form to run more efficiently and at the same time to build up a 
higher sense of the responsibility among the body of the believers.  
They should be encouraged to think more, not only about 
the qualifications of their elected bodies, but also about such 
things as you mention, the law of averages, the age and indisposition 
of some of the members, etc.  
     "When we look back and see what the administration has 
accomplished in twenty-odd years, indeed what it has 
done in the last seven years, we see what strides forward 
have been made.  Far greater tasks lie ahead, but the Guardian 
does not feel that the way to meet them is to change the present 
system but rather to perfect it by educating the believers and 
training them, holding more conferences, publishing more news 
for &amp;Baha'is, getting more people active."  
 
 
65   ELECTIONS, REGARDING (In the United 
     States)  
 
     "The Guardian has written the National Assembly in 
detail and given them the principle upon which he would like 
to see them act.  He has asked them to advise the friends accordingly 
and also to expound the principles so as to apply to the 
local conditions in America."  
     "To facilitate matters and avoid misunderstandings he prefers 
to refer you and the individual friends to them (The National 
Assembly).  He is sure that you will obtain full satisfaction by 
putting the question to them.  The purpose of the Guardian in 
this is not to avoid the issue but only to facilitate matters and 
eliminate misunderstandings.  In all such matters the friends 
should first approach the Local, then the National Assembly 
and only in case they can obtain no satisfaction should they 
approach the Guardian on these matters.  This way many 
difficulties will be avoided."  
 
 
+P26 
66   EMMANUEL, HIS HIGHNESS 
 
     "In connection with your question regarding the reference 
made by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to `His Highness Emmanuel' in Vol. III 
of His Tablets; this obviously refers to the &amp;Bab, as the text 
shows it clearly, and is in no way a reference to Swedenborg."  
 
 
67   ESPERANTO (The Subject of)  
 
     "Regarding the subject of Esperanto; it should be made clear 
to the believers that while the teaching of that language has been 
repeatedly encouraged by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, there is no reference 
either from Him or from &amp;Baha'u'llah that can make us believe that 
it will necessarily develop into the international auxiliary language 
of the future.  &amp;Baha'u'llah has specified in His Writings that 
such a language will either have to be chosen from one of the 
existing languages, or an entirely new one should be created to 
serve as a medium of exchange between the nations and peoples 
of the world.  Pending this final choice, the &amp;Baha'is are advised 
to study Esperanto only in consideration of the fact that 
the learning of this language can considerably facilitate intercommunication 
between individuals, groups and Assemblies 
throughout the &amp;Baha'i world in the present stage of the 
evolution of the Faith."  
 
 
68   EVOLUTION, MAN'S 
 
     "You have asked as to what point in man's evolution he 
becomes conscious of self.  This consciousness of self in man 
is a gradual process, and does not start at a definite point.  It 
grows in him in this world and continues to do so in the future 
spiritual world.  
     "Man can certainly recall past experiences in his evolution, 
and even when his soul leaves this world it will still remember 
the past."  
 
 
69   FAMILY TIES, SPIRITUAL TIES (Vs.)  
 
     "Deep as are family ties, we must always remember that the 
spiritual ties are far deeper; they are everlasting and survive 
 
 
+P27 
death, whereas physical ties, unless supported by spiritual bonds, 
are confined to this life.  You should do all in your power, 
through prayer and example, to open the eyes of your family 
to the &amp;Baha'i Faith, but do not grieve too much over their 
actions.  Turn to your &amp;Baha'i brothers and sisters who are living 
with you in the Light of the Kingdom.  
     "Indeed, the believers have not yet fully learned to draw on 
each other's strength and consolation in time of need.  The 
Cause of God is endowed with tremendous powers, and the 
reason the believers do not gain more from it is because they 
have not learned to draw fully on these mighty forces of love 
and strength and harmony generated by the Faith."  
 
 
70   FAST (Necessary Permission For)  
 
     "With reference to your son's request for advice regarding 
the observance of the &amp;Baha'i Fast; much as the Guardian realizes 
the difficulty which a believer of his position, attending a 
military school, will have to encounter if he wishes to strictly 
conform to the regulations of the Fast, he nevertheless would 
advise him to make every effort to obtain from the school authorities 
the necessary permission.  In case his request is refused 
the only alternative for him would be to obey his superior."  
 
 
71   FASTING (The Ordinance of)  
 
     "As regards fasting, it constitutes, together with the obligatory 
prayers, the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law of 
God.  They act as stimulants to the soul, strengthen, revive 
and purify it, and thus insure its steady development."  
     "The ordinance of fasting is, as is the case with these 
three prayers (obligatory) a spiritual and vital obligation 
enjoined by &amp;Baha'u'llah upon every believer who has attained 
the age of fifteen.  In the Aqdas He thus writes:  `We have 
commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity; 
this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your 
forefathers.  He has exempted from this those who are weak 
 
 
+P28 
from illness or age, as a bounty from His Presence, and He is 
the Forgiving, the Generous.'  
     "And in another passage He says:  `We have enjoined upon 
you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have designated 
for you &amp;Naw-Ruz as a Feast...  The traveller, the ailing, 
those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the 
Fast...  Abstain from food and drink, from sunrise to sundown, 
and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed 
in the Book.'  
     "Also in the `Questions and Answers' that form an appendix 
to the Aqdas, &amp;Baha'u'llah reveals the following:  `Verily, I say 
that God has appointed a Great station for fasting and prayer.  
But during good health its benefit is evident, and when one is 
ill, it is not permissible to fulfill them.'  Concerning the age of 
maturity, He reveals in the appendix of that same Book:  `The 
age of maturity is in the fifteenth year; women and men are alike 
in this respect.'  Regarding the vital character and importance of 
the Divine ordinances and laws, and the necessity of complete 
obedience to them by the believers, we thus read in the 
Gleanings, p. 175:  
 
          `Know verily that the essence of justice and the source 
     thereof are both embodied in the ordinance prescribed by Him 
     Who is the Manifestation of the Self of God amongst men, if 
     ye be of them that recognize this truth.  He doth verily incarnate 
     the highest, the infallible standard of justice unto all creation.  
     Were His law to be such as to strike terror in the 
     hearts of all that are in heaven and on earth, that law is naught 
     but manifest justice.  The fears and agitation which the revelation 
     of this law provoke in men's hearts should indeed be 
     likened to the cries of the suckling babe weaned from his 
     mother's milk, if ye be of them that perceive...'  
 
     "The fasting period, which lasts nineteen days starting as a 
rule from the second of March every year and ending on the 
twentieth of the same month, involves complete abstention from 
food and drink from sunrise till sunset.  It is essentially a 
period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation, 
during which the believer must strive to make the necessary 
 
 
+P29 
readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate 
the spiritual forces latent in his soul.  Its significance and 
purpose are, therefore, fundamentally spiritual in character.  
Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from selfish 
and carnal desires."  
 
 
72   FAST (THE)  
 
     "Regarding your question concerning the Fast:  Travellers 
are exempt from fasting, but if they want to fast while they are 
travelling, they are free to do so.  You are exempt the whole 
period of your travel, not just the hours you are in a train or 
car, etc.  If one eats unconsciously during the fasting hours, 
this is not breaking the Fast as it is an accident.  The age limit 
is 70 years, but if one desires to fast after the age limit is 
passed, and is strong enough to, one is free to do so.  If during 
the Fast period a person falls ill and is unable to fast, but recovers 
before the Fast period is over, he can start to fast again 
and continue until the end.  Of course the Fast, as you know, 
can only be kept during the month set aside for that purpose."  
 
 
73   FEAST DAY (Changing Observance of)  
 
     "This is really a matter of secondary importance, and should 
be decided by the Assembly.  Meetings which have been 
publicly advertised for a certain date cannot obviously be 
cancelled."  
 
 
74   FEAST (Nature of)  
 
     "Concerning the nature of the Nineteen-Day Feast, in the 
Aqdas, &amp;Baha'u'llah clearly revealed the spiritual and social 
character of this Institution.  Its administrative significance, 
however, has been stressed by the Guardian in direct response 
to the growing needs of the &amp;Baha'i Community in this formative 
period of the &amp;Baha'i era for better training in the principles and 
practice of &amp;Baha'i administration."  
 
 
+P30 
75   &amp;NAW-RUZ FEAST (Observance of Feast 
     Day Calendar)  
 
     "The &amp;Naw-Ruz Feast should be held on March 21 before 
sunset and has nothing to do with the 19-day Feast.  The 19-day 
Feast is administrative in function whereas the &amp;Naw-Ruz 
is our New Year, a Feast of hospitality and rejoicing."  
 
 
76   &amp;NAW-RUZ, TIME OF CELEBRATION OF 
 
     "Regarding &amp;Naw-Ruz:  If the vernal equinox falls on the 
21st of March before sunset, it is celebrated on that day.  If at 
any time after sunset, &amp;Naw-Ruz will then, as stated by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
fall on the 22nd.  As to which spot should be regarded as 
the standard, this is a matter which the Universal House of 
Justice will have to decided.  The American NSA need not 
therefore take any action in this matter at present."  
 
 
77   FEAST (Time for Holding)  
 
     "Regarding the time for the holding of the Nineteen-Day 
Feasts and elections; the Guardian would advise your Assembly 
to urge the friends to hold such gatherings on the prescribed 
day before sunset.  If impossible, then it is permissible to hold 
them on the preceding day.  In connection with the nine holy 
days, however, the friends should consider it obligatory to celebrate 
them on the prescribed day before sunset."  
 
 
78   FEASTS (Attendance at)  
 
     "Attendance at 19-Day Feasts is not obligatory but very 
important, and every believer should consider it a duty and a 
privilege to be present on such occasions."  
     "He wishes the &amp;Baha'is to press for recognition of their 
right to observe their own Holy Days, and to observe them 
whenever possible in strict accordance with our teachings."  
 
 
+P31 
79   FEASTS AND ANNIVERSARIES--&amp;Baha'i 
 
     "The &amp;Baha'i Day starts and ends at sunset, and consequently 
the date of the celebration of &amp;Baha'i Feasts should be adjusted 
to conform to the &amp;Baha'i Calendar Time..."  
 
 
80   FUND (How Every Believer Can Test the 
     Measure of His Faith)  
 
     "He wishes you particularly to impress the believers with 
the necessity of maintaining the flow of their contributions to 
the Temple, and also to stress the importance of the Institution 
of the National &amp;Baha'i Fund which, in these early days of the 
administrative development of the Faith, is the indispensable 
medium for the growth and expansion of the Movement.  Contributions 
to this fund constitute, in addition, a practical and 
effective way whereby every believer can test the measure and 
character of his Faith, and to prove in deeds the intensity of 
his devotion and attachment to the Cause."  
 
 
81   FUND (The Life-blood of these Nascent 
     Institutions)  
 
     "As the activities of the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
expand, and its world-wide prestige correspondingly increases, 
the Institution of the National Fund, the bedrock on which 
all other Institutions must necessarily rest and be established, 
acquires added importance, and should be increasingly supported 
by the entire body of believers, both in their individual 
capacities and through their collective efforts, whether organized 
as groups or as Local Assemblies.  The supply of funds, in 
support of the National Treasury, constitutes, at the present 
time, the life-blood of these nascent institutions you are laboring 
to erect.  Its importance cannot, surely, be overestimated.  
Untold blessings shall no doubt crown every effort directed to 
that end."  
 
 
+P32 
82   FUND (National Fund, Chief Obligation of)  
 
     "Regarding his special contributions to the Teaching Fund; 
he feels that this is a matter to be left entirely to the discretion 
of the N.S.A.  He feels that the continuous expenditure of a 
considerable sum to provide for traveling expenses of teachers 
who are in need, constitutes in these days the chief obligation 
of the National Fund.  An effort should be made to facilitate 
as much as possible, the extension of the teaching work by 
helping those who are financially unable to reach their destination, 
and once there to encourage them to settle and earn the 
means of their livelihood."  
 
 
83   FUND (We must be like the Fountain)  
 
     "We must be like the fountain or spring that is continually 
emptying itself of all that it has and is continually being 
refilled from an invisible source.  To be continually giving out 
for the good of our fellows undeterred by fear of poverty and 
reliant on the unfailing bounty of the Source of all wealth and 
all good--this is the secret of right living."  
 
 
84   FUND (The Sacred Obligation)  
 
     "And as the progress and extension of spiritual activities is 
dependent and conditioned upon material means, it is of 
absolute necessity that immediately after the establishment of 
Local as well as National Spiritual Assemblies, a &amp;Baha'i Fund 
be established, to be placed under the exclusive control of the 
Spiritual Assembly.  All donations and contributions should be 
offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose 
of promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout the locality 
or country.  It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious 
and faithful servant of &amp;Baha'u'llah who desires to see His Cause 
advance, to contribute freely and generously for the increase of 
that Fund..."  
 
 
85   FUNERAL (&amp;Baha'i Funeral Service)  
 
     "Regarding the &amp;Baha'i funeral service:  It is extremely 
simple, as it consists only of a congregational prayer to be read 
 
  
+P33 
 
before burial.  This prayer will be made available to the friends 
when the Aqdas is translated and published.  In the meantime 
your N.S.A. should take great care lest any uniform procedure 
or ritual in this matter be adopted or imposed upon 
the friends.  The danger in this, as in some other cases regarding 
&amp;Baha'i worship, is that a definite system of rigid rituals and 
practices be developed among the believers.  The utmost simplicity 
and flexibility should be observed, and a selection from the 
&amp;Baha'i Sacred Writing should serve the purpose at the present 
time, provided this selection is not rigidly and uniformly 
adopted on all such occasions."  
     "There is no objection whatsoever to &amp;non-Baha'is being 
present when the long prayer for the dead is read, as long as 
they respect our manner of reading it by rising and standing 
as the &amp;Baha'is do on this occasion.  Nor, indeed, is there any 
objection to &amp;non-Baha'is being present during the reading of 
any &amp;Baha'i prayer for the departed.  
     "An official &amp;Baha'i funeral service should only be given for 
a believer, but there is no objection to the reading of &amp;Baha'i 
prayers, or indeed, to a &amp;Baha'i conducting the funeral service 
of a &amp;non-Baha'i if this has been requested."  
 
 
86   GREATEST NAME (Translation of Symbol of)  
 
     "He also wishes me to inform you that the symbol of the 
Greatest Name represents an invocation which can be translated 
either as `O Glory of Glories' or `O Glory of the All-Glorious'.  
The word Glory used in this connection is a translation of the 
Arabic term `&amp;Baha', the name of &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
 
87   GROUP, &amp;BAHA'I 
 
     "...next to an isolated believer, any number of confirmed 
&amp;Baha'is less than nine persons should be considered as automatically 
constituting a &amp;Baha'i Group..."  
 
 
88   GUARDIAN (Infallibility of the)  
 
     "The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters 
which are related strictly to the Cause and interpretation of the 
 
 
+P34 
teachings; he is not an infallible authority on other subjects, 
such as economics, science, etc.  When he feels that a certain 
thing is essential for the protection of the Cause, even if it is 
something that affects a person personally, he must be obeyed, 
but when he gives advice, such as that he gave you in a previous 
letter about your future, it is not binding; you are free 
to follow it or not as you please."  
 
 
89   GUIDANCE, DIVINE (Of Guardian)  
 
     "He feels that if ... ponders more deeply about the fundamentals 
of Divine Revelation, she will also come to understand 
the Guardianship.  Once the mind and heart have grasped the 
fact that God guides men through a Mouthpiece, a human being, 
a Prophet, infallible and unerring, it is only a logical projection 
of this acceptance to also accept the station of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and the Guardians.  The Guardians are the evidence of the 
maturity of mankind in the sense that at long last men have 
progressed to the point of having one world, and of needing 
one world management for human affairs.  In the spiritual realm 
they have also reached the point where God could leave, in 
human hands (i.e. the Guardians) guided directly by the &amp;Bab 
and &amp;Baha'u'llah, as the Master states in His Will, the affairs of 
His Faith for this Dispensation.  This is what is meant by `this 
is the day which will not be followed by night.'  In this Dispensation, 
divine guidance flows on to us in this world after the 
Prophet's ascension, through first the Master, and then the 
Guardians.  If a person can accept &amp;Baha'u'llah's function, it 
should not present any difficulty to them to also accept what 
He has ordained in a Divinely guided individual in matters 
pertaining to the Faith."  
 
 
90   GUIDANCE (Individual)  
 
     "The questions you ask in your letter about individual 
guidance have two aspects, one might say.  It is good that 
people should turn to God and beseech His aid in solving their 
problems and guiding their acts, indeed every day of their lives, 
if they feel the desire to do so.  But they cannot possibly impose 
 
 
+P35 
what they feel to be their guidance on anyone else, let alone on 
Assemblies or Committees, as &amp;Baha'u'llah has expressly laid 
down the law of consultation and never indicated that anything 
else superseded it."  
     "As to meditation:  This also is a field in which the individual 
is free.  There are no set forms of meditation prescribed 
in the teachings, no plan as such, for inner development.  The 
friends are urged--nay enjoined--to pray, and they also should 
meditate, but the manner of doing the latter is left entirely to 
the individual."  
 
 
91   GUIDANCE (Question of)  
 
     "The question of Guidance is a very subtle one.  We cannot 
be positive that an impulse or a dream is guidance.  We can 
seek, through earnest prayer and longing, sincerely to do God's 
will, His guidance.  We can try, as you say, to emulate the 
Master and at all times live up to the teachings, but we cannot 
be sure that doing these things we are still making no mistakes 
and are perfectly guided.  These things help us not to make so 
many mistakes and to receive more directly the guidance God 
seeks to give us."  
 
 
92   HANDS OF THE CAUSE--INSTITUTIONS 
     (Station and Function--When Mentioned in 
     Writing)  
 
     "The rank and position of the Hands of the Cause are superior 
to the position of the National Assemblies.  In writing 
concerning the Hands, therefore, when there is reference to the 
Institutions of the Faith, after the Guardian should be mentioned 
the Hands, and then the National Bodies..."  
 
 
93   &amp;HAZIRATU'L-QUDS (Functions of)  
 
     "While the National Office in Wilmette, designated by the 
Guardian as &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, is primarily an administrative 
 
 
+P36 
center, its use should by no means be confined to purely 
administrative work, but should include such activities of a 
social and intellectual character, both local and national, as 
can best establish its character as the foremost teaching and 
administrative center of the Faith throughout the States."  
     "As a teaching center, where &amp;Baha'i lectures, conferences, 
meetings, whether local, regional or national, could be held, the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds can also prove of invaluable help, and the N.S.A. 
should indeed see to it that the necessary facilities are provided 
in the building for that purpose.  But thus combining these 
three features, namely teaching, administrative, and social the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds can best fulfill its mission, as the visible symbol 
of the steadily-growing National &amp;Baha'i Community in Northern 
America, and as the chief rallying center for all its activities 
and plans throughout that Continent."  
 
 
94   HEALING 
 
     "The Guardian knows nothing about your kind of healing...  
But he can lay down for your guidance certain broad principles:  
There is no such thing as &amp;Baha'i healers or a &amp;Baha'i type of 
healing.  In His Most Holy Book (the Aqdas) &amp;Baha'u'llah says to 
consult the best physicians, in other words, doctors who have 
studied a scientific system of medicine; He never gave us to 
believe, He Himself would heal us through `Healers' but rather 
through prayer and the assistance of medicine and approved 
treatments.  Now, as long as your healing is in no opposition to 
these principles, as long as you do not try and take the place 
of a regular doctor in trying to heal others, but only give 
them your kind of help through constructive suggestion--or 
whatever it may be--and do not associate this help with 
being a channel of the direct grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the Guardian 
sees no harm in your continuing your assistance to others.  
But you must conscientiously decide whether, in view of the 
above, you are really justified in continuing.  He will pray 
for your guidance and happiness."  
 
 
95   HEROISM IS NEEDED 
 
     "These, indeed, are the days when heroism is needed on the 
 
 
+P37 
part of the believers.  Self-sacrifice, courage, indomitable hope 
and confidence are characteristics they should show forth, 
because these very attributes cannot but fix the attention of 
the public and lead them to enquire what, in a world so hopelessly 
chaotic and bewildered, leads these people to be so 
assured, so confident, so full of devotion?  Increasingly, as time 
goes by, the characteristics of the &amp;Baha'is will be that which 
captures the attention of their fellow-citizens.  They must show 
their aloofness from the hatreds and recriminations which are 
tearing at the hearts of humanity, and demonstrate by deed and 
word their profound belief in the future peaceful unification of 
the entire human race."  
 
 
96   HIDDEN WORDS (Arabic)  
 
     "As to the passage No. 13 of the Arabic Hidden Words:  
That which &amp;Baha'u'llah declares we can find abiding within 
us is the power of the Divine Spirit, the reflection of the light 
of His Revelation.  This reflection of the Divine Spirit, however, 
can in no way be compared to the Revelation which God 
discloses to His Prophets and Messengers.  The similarity in 
the terminology should not confuse this distinction which is 
most fundamental."  
 
 
97   HOLY DAYS--&amp;BAHA'I 
 
     "He wishes the &amp;Baha'is to press for recognition of their 
right to observe their own Holy Days, and to observe them 
whenever possible in strict accordance with our teachings."  
     "He wishes also to stress the fact that, according to the 
&amp;Baha'i laws, work is forbidden on our nine Holy Days.  Believers 
who have independent businesses or shops should refrain from 
working on these days.  Those who are in government employ 
should, on religious grounds, make an effort to be excused from 
work; all believers, whoever their employers, should do likewise.  
If the government or other employers refuse to grant 
them these days off, they are not required to forfeit their employment, 
but they should make every effort to have the independent 
 
 
+P38 
status of the Faith recognized and their right to hold 
their own religious Holy Days acknowledged."  
 
98   HOLY DAYS OF OTHER RELIGIONS 
 
     "As regards the celebration of the Christian Holiday by 
the believers; it is surely preferable and even highly advisable 
that the friends should in their relation to each other discontinue 
observing such holidays as Christmas and New Years, 
and to have their festival gatherings of this nature instead during 
the Intercalary Days and &amp;Naw-Ruz...."  
 
 
99   HOLY SHRINE (Believers turn to the)  
 
     "He feels the drawing of the hearts together, as the believers 
turn towards the Holy Shrine, will produce a greater love and 
unity amongst the friends, and attract the blessings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
 
100  HOSTS OF HIS TESTAMENT (The)  
 
     "`The Hosts of His Testament' refers to those who are 
firm in the Will and Testament of &amp;Baha'u'llah and who defend 
and uphold it."  
 
 
101  CORD (Meaning of)  
 
     "The word `cord' so often mentioned in the Teachings means 
both the Faith itself and also the power of the Faith which 
sustains those who cling to it."  
 
 
102  ILLNESS 
 
     "Such hindrances (i.e., illness and other difficulties) no 
matter how severe and insuperable they may at first seem, can 
and should be effectively overcome through the combined and 
sustained power of prayer and of determined and continued 
effort."  
 
 
+P39 
103  ILLNESS (Cancer)  
 
     "Cancer is such a terrible scourge in the world today!  But 
when the believers are called upon to go through such bitter 
ordeals they have the Faith to sustain them, the love of their 
&amp;Baha'i friends to comfort them, and the glorious words of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah regarding immortality to give them confidence 
and courage.  Blessed are we, indeed, even in the midst of our 
greatest trials."  
 
 
104  INHERITANCE (Division of)  
 
     "To divide the inheritance as it is prescribed by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
we have to divide it into 2,520 shares.  But we can also divide 
it into 42 shares.  Then every one of the beneficiaries will take 
so many of these shares.  These numbers form like a highest 
denominator for the different fractions which represent the 
shares of the different individuals that will benefit in case of 
intestacy.  In case of the non-existence of one class of inheritors 
the Aqdas mentions how it should be divided.  As a general 
rule a part goes to the House of Justice, a part to the 
children."  
 
 
105  INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE (Whole 
     question of)  
 
     "Regarding the whole question of an International Language 
and its relation to the Faith:  We, as &amp;Baha'is, are very anxious 
to see a universal auxiliary tongue adopted as soon as possible; 
we are not the protagonists of any one language to fill this post.  
If the governments of the world agree on an existing language, 
or a constructed, new tongue, to be used internationally, we 
would heartily support it because we desire to see this step in 
the unification of the human race take place as soon as 
possible.  
     "Esperanto has been in wide use, more so than any similar 
language, all over the world, and the &amp;Baha'is have been encouraged 
by both the Master and the Guardian to learn it and to translate 
 
 
+P40 
&amp;Baha'i literature into it.  We cannot be sure it will be the 
chosen language of the future; but as it is the one which has 
spread most, both East and West, we should certainly continue 
to cooperate with its members learn to speak it, and translate 
&amp;Baha'i literature into it."  
 
 
106  &amp;ISLAM 
 
     "&amp;Islam attained a very high spiritual state, but Western 
scholars are prone to judging it by Christian standards.  One 
cannot call one World Faith superior to another, as they all 
come from God; they are progressive, each suited to certain 
needs of the time."  
 
 
107  JESUS (Virgin Birth of)  
 
     "With regard to your question concerning the Virgin Birth 
of Jesus; on this point, as on several others, the &amp;Baha'i teachings 
are in full agreement with the doctrines of the Catholic 
Church.  In the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan (Book of Certitude) page 56, and 
in a few other Tablets still unpublished, &amp;Baha'u'llah confirms, 
however indirectly, the Catholic conception of the Virgin Birth.  
Also &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in `Some Answered Questions', Chap. 12, 
page 73, explicitly states that Christ found existence through the 
spirit of God which statement necessarily implies, when 
reviewed in the light of the text, that Jesus was not the son of 
Joseph."  
     "We believe that Christ only was conceived immaculately.  
His brothers and sisters would have been born in the natural 
way and conceived naturally."  
 
 
108  LIFE AFTER DEATH 
 
     "Those who have never had any opportunity of hearing of 
the Faith but who lived good lives will no doubt be treated 
with the greatest love and mercy in the next world and reap 
their full reward."  
 
 
+P41 
109  LOVE (Turn to &amp;Baha'i Brothers and Sisters)  
 
     "Turn to your &amp;Baha'i brothers and sisters, who are living 
with you in the kingdom.  Indeed, the believers have not yet 
fully learned to draw on each other's love for strength and 
consolation in time of need.  The Cause of God is endowed 
with tremendous powers, and the reason the believers do not 
gain more from it is because they have not learned to duly 
draw these mighty forces of love and strength and harmony 
generated by the Faith."  
 
 
110  LOVE, CUSTODIANS OF (World Exceedingly 
     Dark)  
 
     "The friends must, at all times, bear in mind that they are, 
in a way, like soldiers under attack.  The world is at present 
in an exceedingly dark condition spiritually; hatred and prejudice 
of every sort are literally tearing it to pieces.  We, on the 
other hand, are the custodians of the opposite forces, the 
forces of love, of unity, of peace and integration, and we must 
continually be on our guard, whether as individuals or as an 
Assembly or Community, lest through us these destructive, 
negative forces enter into our midst.  In other words, we 
must beware lest the darkness of society become reflected in 
our acts and attitudes, perhaps all unconsciously.  Love for each 
other, the deep sense that we are a new organism, the dawn-breakers 
of a new World Order, must constantly animate our 
&amp;Baha'i lives, and we must pray to be protected from the contamination 
of society which is so diseased with prejudice."  
 
 
111  LOVE--UNITY (The Greatest Need)  
 
     "The greatest need it seems everywhere inside the Cause is 
to impress upon the friends the need for love among them.  
There is a tendency to mix up the functions of the Administration 
and try to apply it in individual relationships, which is 
abortive, because the Assembly is a nascent House of Justice 
and is supposed to administer, according to the Teachings, the 
affairs of the Community.  But individuals towards each other 
 
 
+P42 
are governed by love, unity, forgiveness and a sin-covering eye.  
Once the friends grasp this they will get along much better, but 
they keep playing Spiritual Assembly to each other and expect 
the Assembly to behave like an individual."  
 
 
112  MANIFESTATION--IN 1000 YEARS 
     (Organic Unity)  
 
     "As to the meaning of the quotation, `My fears are for Him 
Who will be sent down unto you after Me,' this refers to the 
Manifestation who is to come after a thousand or more years, 
who like all previous Messengers of God will be subjected to 
persecutions, but will eventually triumph over them.  For men 
of ill-will have been and will always continue to be in this 
world, unless mankind reaches a state of complete and absolute 
perfection--a condition which is not only improbable but 
actually impossible to attain.  The fundamental difference, 
however, between this Dispensation and all previous ones is 
this, that in this Revelation the possibility of permanent schism 
between the followers of the Prophet has been prevented through 
the direct and explicit instructions providing for the necessary 
instruments designed to maintain the organic unity of the body 
of the Faithful."  
 
 
113  MANIFESTATIONS (The Phrase--"His 
     Holiness")  
 
     "In Persian it is impolite not to use the word Hadrat before 
the name of the Prophet, so that strictly speaking, a proper 
translation should always have `His Holiness Moses' etc.; 
however, as this seems peculiar in English, and not in the best 
usage of our language, he feels it can be dispensed with.  
Pronouns referring to the Manifestation, or the Master, should, 
however, invariably be capitalized."  
 
 
114  MANIFESTATIONS (Return of the Qualities)  
 
     "The reflection of the qualities of holy souls can take place 
at any time; it is not confined to the period when the Manifestation 
is on earth."  
 
 
+P43 
115  MANIFESTATIONS (Significance of the 
     Remains of the Prophets)  
 
     "There is no special physical significance in the remains of 
the Prophets or relics of Their Persons.  But there is a profound 
spiritual significance in the sense that Their dust was the 
physical mirror of the greatness of God.  In other words we 
know God through His Prophets, Who have bodies; these 
bodies--Their very dust--are precious through association.  It 
is natural for people to be touched by a lock of hair or some 
token of one they loved; how much more should we treasure 
and feel moved by a relic of the Beloved of God?  
     "The &amp;Bab has told us to bury the dead in silk (if possible) 
in coffins of crystal.  Why?  Because the body, though now dust, 
was once exalted by the immortal soul of man!  The portrait 
of the &amp;Bab should be regarded as an inestimable privilege and 
blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a glimpse 
of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on."  
     "The atoms of the Prophets are just atoms, like all others, 
but the association of this great spiritual power with them leaves 
in the place they are laid to rest a spiritual atmosphere, if one 
can use this expression.  They are, no doubt, endowed with 
a tremendous spiritual influence and far-reaching power.  But 
the physical character of their atoms are not different from 
other people's, any more than their bodies and physical functions 
are different."  
 
 
116  MANIFESTATIONS (Station of)  
 
     "The Manifestations no doubt had some consciousness of 
their station, but what the nature of that consciousness was we 
do not know."  
 
 
117  MARRIAGE, &amp;BAHA'I 
 
     "In regard to your question concerning the nature and 
character of &amp;Baha'i marriage.  As you have rightly stated, 
such a Marriage is conditioned upon the full approval of all 
 
 
+P44 
four parents.  Also your statement to the effect that the 
principle of the oneness of mankind prevents any true &amp;Baha'i 
from regarding race itself as a bar to union is in complete 
accord with the Teachings of the Faith on this point.  For 
both &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha never disapproved of the 
idea of interracial marriage, nor discouraged it.  The &amp;Baha'i 
Teachings, indeed, by their very nature transcend all limitations 
imposed by race, and as such can and should never be identified 
with any particular school of racial philosophy."  
 
 
118  MARRIAGE, &amp;BAHA'I (Consent of Parents-- 
     duty of Assembly to ascertain validity)  
 
     "With reference to the matter of the consent of the parents 
to a &amp;Baha'i marriage:  As this is a vital binding obligation, it is 
the duty of the Assemblies to ascertain, before giving their 
sanction, that the consent obtained has been given freely by the 
parents themselves."  
 
 
119  MARRIAGE--(Consent of Parents--Non-&amp;Baha'i 
     Participants)  
 
     "Regarding the question whether it is necessary to obtain the 
consent of the parents of a &amp;non-Baha'i participant in a marriage 
with a &amp;Baha'i; as &amp;Baha'u'llah has stated that the consent of the 
parents of both parties is required in order to promote unity 
and avoid friction, and as the Aqdas does not specify any exceptions 
to this rule, the Guardian feels that under all circumstances 
the consent of the parents of both parties is required."  
 
 
120  MARRIAGE TO &amp;NON-BAHA'I 
 
     "The general principle in regard to the marriage of a &amp;Baha'i 
to a &amp;non-Baha'i is as follows:  
     "If a &amp;Baha'i marries a &amp;non-Baha'i who wishes to have the 
religious ceremony of his own sect carried out, it must be quite 
clear that, first, the &amp;Baha'i partner is understood to be a &amp;Baha'i 
by religion, and not to accept the religion of the other party to 
 
 
+P45 
the marriage through having his or her religious ceremony; and 
second, the ceremony must be of a nature which does not commit 
the &amp;Baha'i to any declaration of faith in a religion other 
than his own.  Under these circumstances the &amp;Baha'i can partake 
of the religious ceremony of his &amp;non-Baha'i partner.  
     "The &amp;Baha'i should insist on having the &amp;Baha'i ceremony 
carried out before or after the &amp;non-Baha'i one, on the same 
day."  
 
 
121  MARRIAGES, &amp;BAHA'I--(Reporting to the 
     NSA)  
 
     "In reporting &amp;Baha'i marriages it is much better to mention 
that the ceremony was performed by the Assembly, as this is 
the proper thing to do, and an individual only acts for the 
Assembly on this occasion.  As a funeral is not a legal 
ceremony more latitude can be allowed, especially as the family 
of the deceased may want some particular &amp;Baha'i friend to 
officiate."  
 
 
122  MARRIAGE, &amp;BAHA'I (re:  Consent of Natural 
     Parents)  
 
     "Our beloved Guardian made it clear that it was the responsibility 
of the &amp;Baha'i body performing the marriage ceremony 
to confirm without question the fact that the living natural 
parents of the two individuals who are being married have 
given their consent to the marriage.  It is preferable that this 
consent be given in writing, but if this is not possible, or inadvisable 
for some reason, verbal consent in the present of witnesses 
is sufficient."...  "Regarding your question of applying 
the sanction of suspension of voting rights to people who marry 
without the consent of parents, this should be done from now 
on.  The laws of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas are explicit and not open to 
any ambiguity at all.  As long as the parents are alive, the consent 
must be obtained; it is not conditioned on their relationship 
to their children.  If the whereabouts of the parents is not 
known legally, in other words, if they are legally dead, then it is 
 
 
+P46 
not necessary for the children to obtain their consent, obviously.  
It is not a question of the child not knowing the present whereabouts 
of the parents, it is a question of a legal thing--if the 
parents are alive, they must be asked."  
 
 
123  MARRIAGE OF &amp;BAHA'U'LLAH 
 
     "It would, however, be very helpful for the friends to know 
that the question which the above-mentioned missionary has 
raised in connection with the marriage of &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
the provisions in the Aqdas regarding the institution of marriage 
have been explained by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in a Tablet 
which the Guardian hopes to have translated and published 
in conjunction with the Aqdas.  Moreover, as regards 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's marriage, it should be noted that His three marriages 
were all contracted before He revealed His Book of Laws, 
and even before His declaration in &amp;Baghdad, at a time when 
&amp;Baha'i marriage laws had not yet been made known, and the 
Revelation not yet disclosed."  
 
 
124  MASONRY, FREE (Membership in)  
 
     "Disapprove membership (in) Freemasonry."  
     "Any &amp;Baha'i determined retain membership (in) Freemasonry 
loses voting rights."  
     "The directive regarding membership in Freemasonry should 
be carried out by your Assembly in all areas under your Assembly's 
jurisdiction."  
 
 
125  MEDICAL SCIENCE (Leaving bodies to)  
 
     "There is nothing in the Teachings against leaving our bodies 
to Medical Science.  The only thing we should stipulate is 
that we do not wish to be cremated, as it is against &amp;Baha'i 
Law."  
     "As many people make arrangements to leave their bodies 
to Medical Science for investigation, he suggests that you 
 
 
+P47 
inquire, either through some lawyer friend or through some hospital, 
how you could do this and then make the necessary provision 
in your will, stipulating that you wish your body to be 
of service to mankind in death, and that, being a &amp;Baha'i, you 
request that your remains not be cremated and not be taken 
more than an hour's journey from the place you die."  
     "The spirit has no more connection with the body after it 
departs, but as the body was once the temple of the spirit, we 
&amp;Baha'is are taught that it must be treated with respect."  
 
 
126  MEDITATION 
 
     "Through meditation doors of deeper knowledge and inspiration 
may be opened.  Naturally, if one meditates as a &amp;Baha'i 
he is connected with the Source;...  Meditation is very important, 
and the Guardian sees no reason why the friends should not be 
taught to meditate, but they should guard against superstitions 
or foolish ideas creeping into it."  
 
 
127  MEETINGS, &amp;BAHA'I 
 
     "Regarding your question as to the advisability of holding 
&amp;Baha'i meetings at a time coinciding with church meetings; the 
Guardian would advise the friends to avoid such a coincidence, 
as otherwise many church people may feel offended, and this 
may lead to unnecessary and even harmful misunderstandings 
and developments which may injure the Cause and affect its 
prestige in the eyes of the public.  The friends should, under 
all circumstances, be careful not to arouse unnecessarily any 
feelings of religious antagonism."  
 
 
128  MEMBERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES, LSA 
     (Residential Qualifications)  
 
     "...it is only too obvious that unless a member can 
attend regularly the meetings of his local Assembly, it would 
be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon 
him, and to fulfill his responsibilities, as a representative of the 
 
 
+P48 
community.  Membership in a Local Spiritual Assembly carries 
with it, indeed, an obligation and capacity to remain in close 
touch with local &amp;Baha'i activities, and ability to attend regularly 
the sessions of the Assembly."  
 
 
129  MEMORIAL OFFERINGS 
 
     "He feels sure this offering, expended in memory of your 
dear ones, will rejoice their spirits, and aid them to progress in 
the world beyond."  
 
 
130  MENTAL ILLNESS 
 
     "Regarding persons whose condition has not been defined 
by the civil authorities after medical diagnosis, the Assembly on 
the spot must investigate every case that arises and, after consultation 
with experts, deliver its verdict.  Such a verdict, however, 
should, in important cases, be preceded by consultation 
with the NSA.  No doubt, the power of prayer is very great, 
yet consultation with experts is enjoined by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Should 
these experts believe that an abnormal case exists, the withholding 
of voting rights is justified."  
 
 
131  MILITARY DUTY (Status of &amp;Baha'is in relation 
     to)  
 
     "No change whatsoever (in) status (of) &amp;Baha'is (in) relation 
(to) active military duty.  No compromise (of) spiritual principles 
(of) Faith possible however tense (the) situation, however 
aroused public opinion."  
 
 
132  MILITARY SERVICE 
 
     "As there is neither an International Police Force nor any 
immediate prospect of one coming into being, the &amp;Baha'is 
should continue to apply, under all circumstances, for exemption 
from any military duties that necessitate the taking of life.  
There is no justification for any change of attitude on our part 
at the present time."  
 
 
+P49 
133  MORMONS (Religious sects--Associate with 
     all--Show tolerance and friendliness)  
 
     "The &amp;Baha'is should deal with the members of all religious 
sects, however, with the greatest tolerance and friendliness, and 
try to point out to them the significance of the Revelation of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to the world in this Great Day.  The Guardian 
would advise you to teach the Mormons, like everyone else, the 
Faith, when you find them receptive.  They have many great 
principles and their teachings regarding charity, not drinking or 
smoking, etc., are quite similar to ours and should form a point 
of common interest."  
 
 
134  &amp;MUNIRIH &amp;KHANUM 
 
     "With regard to &amp;Munirih &amp;Khanum's account of her life, 
concerning which certain questions have been raised by one of 
the believers; what has been written by &amp;Munirih &amp;Khanum herself 
in that account, and also the references to the subject made 
by &amp;Nabil in his Narrative should be taken as the accurate standard 
and not what has been reported in Dr. Esslemont's book."  
 
 
135  MUSIC 
 
     "Music, as one of the arts, is a natural cultural development, 
and the Guardian does not feel that there should be any 
cultivation of `&amp;Baha'i Music' any more than we are trying to 
develop a &amp;Baha'i school of painting or writing.  The believers 
are free to paint, write or compose as their talents guide them.  
If music is written incorporating the Sacred Writings, the 
friends are free to make use of it, but it should never be considered 
a requirement at &amp;Baha'i meetings to have such music.  The 
farther away the friends keep from any set forms, the better, 
for they must realize that the Cause is absolutely universal, and 
what might seem a beautiful addition to their mode of celebrating 
a Feast, etc., would perhaps fall on the ears of people of 
another country as unpleasant sounds--and vice versa.  As long 
as they have music for its own sake it is all right, but they 
should not consider it `&amp;Baha'i Music'."  
 
 
+P50 
136  NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES (Authority of)  
 
     "I wish to reaffirm in clear and categorical language, the 
principle already enunciated upholding the supreme authority of 
the National Assembly in all matters that affect the interests of 
the Faith in that land.  There can be no conflict of authority, 
no duality under any form or circumstances in any sphere of 
&amp;Baha'i jurisdiction whether local, national or international.  
The National Assembly, however, although the sole interpreter 
of its Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, is directly and morally 
responsible if it allows any body or institution within its 
jurisdiction to abuse its privileges or to decline in the exercise 
of its rights and privileges.  It is the trusted guardian and the 
mainspring of the manifold activities and interests of every 
national community in the &amp;Baha'i world.  It constitutes the 
sole link that binds these communities to the International
House of Justice, the supreme administrative body in the Dispensation 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
 
137  N.S.A. INVOLVEMENT (Appeals Prohibited)  
 
     "Anything whatsoever affecting the interests of the Cause 
and in which the National Assembly as a body is involved 
should, if regarded as unsatisfactory by Local Assemblies and 
individual believers, be immediately referred to the National 
Assembly itself.  Neither the general body of the believers, nor 
any Local Assembly, nor even the delegates to the annual Convention, 
should be regarded as having any authority to entertain 
appeals against the decision of the National Assembly.  Should 
the matter be referred to the Guardian it will be his duty to 
consider it with the utmost care and to decide whether the 
issues involved justify him to consider it in person, or to leave 
it entirely to the discretion of the National Assembly.  
     "This administrative principle which the Guardian is now 
restating and emphasizing is so clear, so comprehensive and 
simple that no misunderstanding as to its application, he 
feels, can possibly arise.  There are no exceptions whatever to 
this rule, and the Guardian would deprecate any attempt to 
 
 
+P51 
elaborate or dwell any further upon this fundamental and clearly 
enunciated principle."  
 
 
138  N.S.A.'s JURISDICTION OVER 
     COMMITTEES (Authority of)  
 
     "The N.S.A.'s final jurisdiction over both the National 
Teaching Committee and the Regional Teaching Committees is 
certainly indisputable, and is of the same nature and character 
as the authority to which it is entitled over all other national 
committees."  
 
 
139  NEW ASSEMBLIES (Formation of)  
 
     "Regarding the formation of Local Assemblies, the Guardian 
does not advise any departure from the principle that every civil 
community should have its own independent Assembly."  
 
 
140  NEW ASSEMBLIES (Residence Qualifications)  
 
     "In connection with the formation of new Assemblies and the 
maintenance of their Assembly status, the Guardian wishes to 
reaffirm the general principle that only those who reside within 
the city limits of any given locality have the right to either vote 
or be elected as member of the Assembly, even though this 
may involve frequent dissolution of the Assembly owing to 
insufficient number of members.  It will, on the other hand, 
serve as a stimulus to those outside these limits to establish a 
group and eventually an Assembly of their own.  This principle 
should be closely adhered to, otherwise it will lead to confusion 
and overlapping."  
 
 
141  NINE (Number)  
 
     "The number nine, which in itself is the number of perfection, 
is considered by the &amp;Baha'is as sacred, because it is 
symbolic of the perfection of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation which 
constitutes the ninth in the line of existing religions, the latest 
 
 
+P52 
and fullest Revelation which mankind has ever known.  The 
eighth is the religion of the &amp;Bab and the remaining seven are:  
Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, 
&amp;Islam, and the religion of the Sabaeans.  These religions are not 
the only true religions that have appeared in the world but are 
the only ones still existing.  There have always been Divine 
Prophets and Messengers, to many of whom the &amp;Qur'an refers.  
But the only ones existing are those mentioned above."  
     "The Guardian feels that with intellectuals and students of 
religion the question of exactly which are the nine existing religions 
is controversial, and it would be better to avoid it.  He 
does not want the friends to be rigid in these matters, but use 
their judgment and tact, sometimes one statement is exactly 
the right thing for one type of mind and the wrong thing for 
another.  
     "Strictly speaking the 5-pointed star is the symbol of our 
Faith, as used by the &amp;Bab and explained by Him.  But the 
Guardian does not feel it is wise or necessary to complicate our 
explanations of the Temple by adding this."  
     "Nine is the highest digit, hence symbolizes comprehensiveness, 
culminations; also, the reason it is used in the Temple's 
form is because 9 has exact numerical value of `&amp;Baha' (in the 
numerology connected with the Arabic alphabet) and `&amp;Baha' is 
the name of the Revealer of our Faith, &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The 
9-pointed star is not a part of the teachings of our Faith, but 
only used as an emblem representing `9'.  In telling people of the 
9 religions of the world, that is `existing religions, we should not 
give this as the reason the Temple has nine sides.  This may have 
been an idea of the architect, and a very pleasing idea, which 
can be mentioned in passing, but the Temple has 9 sides because 
of the association of 9 with perfection, unity and `&amp;Baha'."  
 
 
142  ORIENTALS 
 
     "As regards those Persian or Oriental non-believers who 
become genuinely interested in the Cause in America, they can 
 
 
+P53 
be admitted to study classes, but every care should be taken by 
the Assemblies to fully test their sincerity and the genuineness 
of their desire to join the Community before they are given the 
necessary facilities that will enable them eventually to be regarded 
as voting members of the Faith."  
 
 
143  ORIENTALS (Association with)  
 
     "In this connection, the Guardian wishes to draw once more 
your attention to the all-importance of his instructions to the 
Western believers regarding association with Orientals.  The 
friends in the West must be wide awake, and be extremely 
cautious when dealing with Easterners, particularly with those 
who in the name of the Cause desire to satisfy their own desires 
and ambitions.  The first step which they should take in protecting 
themselves against such mischief-makers is to insist that 
they should obtain proper credentials from the Assembly of the 
locality in which they live.  This measure, he feels, is absolutely 
essential and there can be no exception whatever to it."  
 
 
144  PACIFISM (&amp;Baha'i View of)  
 
     "With reference to the absolute pacifists, or conscientious 
objectors to war; their attitude, judged from the &amp;Baha'i standpoint 
is quite anti-social and due to its exaltation of the individual 
conscience leads inevitably to disorder and chaos in society.  
Extreme pacifists are thus very close to the anarchists, in the 
sense that both of these groups lay an undue emphasis on the
rights and merits of the individual.  The &amp;Baha'i conception of 
social life is essentially based on the subordination of the individual 
will to that of society.  It neither suppresses the individual 
nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an anti-social 
creature, a menace to society.  As in everything, it follows the 
`golden mean'.  The only way that society can function is for the 
minority to follow the will of the majority.  
     "The other main objection to the conscientious objectors is 
that their method of establishing peace is too negative.  Non-cooperation 
is too passive a philosophy to become an effective 
 
 
+P54 
way for social reconstruction.  Their refusal to bear arms can 
never establish peace.  There should first be a spiritual revitalization 
which nothing, except the Cause of God, can effectively 
bring to every man's heart."  
 
 
145  PEACE 
 
     "...I might add that he does not believe any radiations of 
thought or healing, from any group, is going to bring peace.  
Prayer, no doubt, will help the world, but what it needs is to 
accept &amp;Baha'u'llah's system so as to build up the World Order 
on a new foundation, a divine foundation!"  
 
 
146  PHOTOGRAPHS 
 
     "It is quite important that the Greatest Name or a picture 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha be placed in a dignified position.  They should 
not be placed on the floor nor, on the other hand, should 
they be held above the heads of the people in the photograph.  
It would seem that the proper position would be for them to 
be held about chest height."  
 
 
147  PILGRIM'S NOTES 
 
     "Regarding the notes taken by pilgrims at Haifa.  The 
Guardian has stated that he is unwilling to sign the notes of any 
pilgrim, in order that the literature consulted by the believers 
shall not be unduly extended...  This means that the notes of 
pilgrims do not carry the authority resident in the Guardian's 
letters written over his own signature.  On the other hand, 
each pilgrim brings back information and suggestions of a most 
precious character, and it is the privilege of all the friends to 
share in the spiritual results of these visits."  
 
 
148  PIONEERING 
 
     "...Sometimes people strive all their lives to render outstanding 
service.  Here is the time and opportunity to render 
 
 
+P55 
historic services; in fact the most unique in history, aiding 
in the fulfillment of Daniel's Prophecies of the Last Day, 
and the 1335 days, when men are to be blessed by the Glory 
of the Lord, covering the entire globe--which is the real goal 
of the Ten Year Crusade.  
     "In other words, when we fulfill the Ten Year Crusade we 
will have brought into fulfillment Daniel's great prophecy of 
'Blessed is he who waits and comes to the 1335 days.'  What 
could be more wonderful than taking part in the fulfillment 
of religious prophecy of over 3,000 years!"
     "The pioneers themselves must realize that not only are 
they fulfilling the wishes of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and doing that which 
the Master Himself said He longed to do; namely, to go, if 
necessary on foot, and carry His Father's Message to all the 
regions of the earth; but they are enhancing the prestige of the 
Faith to a remarkable degree in the eyes of the public, and 
specially in the eyes of the officials.  There is no doubt that the 
rapid forward march of the Faith recently has attracted a far 
greater measure of attention on the part of the thoughtful 
people, and people of position in society and in educational 
fields, than has been the case for almost one hundred years.  
     "Therefore, each pioneer must feel his responsibility very 
heavily, and understand that his calling is far above the average 
service; and his duty to remain at his post a very pressing one 
indeed."  
 
 
149  POLITICAL FIGURES (Non-Political 
     Character of the &amp;Baha'i Faith)  
 
     "The Guardian wishes me to draw the attention of the 
friends through you that they should be very careful in their 
public utterance not to mention any political figures ... either 
side with them or denounce them.  This is the first thing to bear 
in mind.  Otherwise they will involve the friends in political 
matters, which is definitely dangerous for the Cause."  
 
 
+P56 
150  POLITICS (Loyalty to World Order of 
     &amp;Baha'u'llah)  
 
     "Loyalty (to the) World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, security of 
its basic institutions, both imperatively demand all its avowed 
supporters ... in these days when sinister uncontrollable forces 
are deepening (the) cleavage sundering peoples, nations, creeds 
(and) classes, (to) resolve, despite (the) pressure (of) fast crystallizing 
public opinion, (to) abstain individually and collectively, 
in word (and) action, informally as well as in all official 
utterances and publications, from assigning blame, taking sides, 
however indirectly, in recurring political crises now agitating 
(and) ultimately engulfing human society.  Grave apprehension 
lest cumulative effect (of) such compromises (should) disintegrate 
(the) fabric, clog (the) channel of grace that sustains (the) 
system of God's essentially supranational, supernatural order 
so laboriously evolved, so recently established."  
 
 
151  POLITICS (Non-Interference in)  
 
     "The attitude of the &amp;Baha'is must be two-fold, complete 
obedience to the government of the country they reside in, and 
no interference whatsoever in political matters or questions.  
What the Master's statement really means is obedience to a 
duly constituted government, whatever that government may 
be in form.  We are not the ones, as individual &amp;Baha'is, to judge 
our government as just or unjust--for each believer would be 
sure to hold a different viewpoint, and within our own &amp;Baha'i 
fold a hotbed of dissension would spring up and destroy our 
unity.  We must build up our own &amp;Baha'i system, and leave the 
faulty systems of the world to go their way.  We cannot change 
them through becoming involved in them; on the contrary, they 
will destroy us."  
 
 
152  POLITICS (Remain Aloof from Political 
     Affairs)  
 
     "We should--every one of us--remain aloof, in heart and 
in mind, in words and in deeds, from the political affairs and 
 
 
+P57
disputes of the Nations and of Governments.  We should keep 
ourselves away from such thoughts.  We should have no political 
connection with any of the parties and should join no 
faction of these different and warring sects.  
     "Absolute impartiality in the matter of political parties 
should be shown by words and by deeds, and the love of the 
whole humanity, whether a Government or a nation, which is 
the basic teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah, should also be shown by 
words and by deeds...  
     "According to the exhortations of the Supreme Pen and the 
confirmatory explanations of the Covenant of God &amp;Baha'is are 
in no way allowed to enter into political affairs under any 
pretense of excuse; since such an action brings about disastrous 
results and ends in hurting the Cause of God and its intimate 
friends."  
 
 
153  POLITICS (Shun Politics Like the Plague)  
 
     "The cardinal principle which we must follow ... is obedience 
to the government prevailing in any land in which we reside....  
     "We see therefore that we must do two things--Shun 
politics like the plague, and be obedient to the Government in 
power in the place where we reside...  We must obey in all 
cases except where a spiritual principle is involved, such as 
denying our Faith.  For these spiritual principles we must 
be willing to die.  What we &amp;Baha'is must face is the 
fact that society is disintegrating so rapidly that moral 
issues which were clear a half century ago are now hopelessly 
confused and what is more, thoroughly mixed up with 
battling political interests.  That is why the &amp;Baha'is must turn 
all their forces into the channel of building up the &amp;Baha'i Cause 
and its Administration.  They can neither change nor help the 
world in any other way at present.  If they become involved in 
the issues the Governments of the world are struggling over, 
they will be lost.  But if they build up the &amp;Baha'i pattern they 
can offer it as a remedy when all else has failed."  
 
 
+P58 
154  PRAYER (Five Steps of)  
 
     "Regarding the five steps of prayer outlined by the Guardian, 
and recorded by Mrs. Moffett in her booklet, the `Call to 
Prayer', these, he wishes me to explain, are merely personal suggestions 
and need not, therefore, be adopted strictly and universally 
by the believers."  
 
 
155  PRAYER BEADS 
 
     "In the matter of the use and distribution of prayer beads, 
in this and other matters of secondary importance he does not 
wish that any hard and fast rules be set up.  The believers 
should not be required to use prayer beads, nor should they be 
prevented from doing so, as the Teachings do not contain any 
specific instruction on the subject."  
 
 
156  PRAYER (&amp;Baha'u'llah's in Dispensation)  
 
     "The names of those cited in &amp;Baha'u'llah's Prayer in the 
Dispensation are quite correct as you gave them, (Abraham, 
Moses, Joseph, John the Baptist, Christ, Muhammad, &amp;Imam 
Husayn, the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah.)  
     "The Prophets `regarded as one and the same person' include 
the lesser Prophets as well, and not merely those who bring a 
`Book'.  The station is different, but They are Prophets and 
Their nature thus different from that of ours.  
     "In the prayer mentioned above &amp;Baha'u'llah identifies 
Himself with &amp;Imam Husayn.  This does not make him a 
Prophet, but his position was very unique, and we know 
&amp;Baha'u'llah claims to be the `return' of the &amp;Imam Husayn.  
He, in other words, identifies His Spirit with these Holy Souls 
gone before, that does not, of course, make Him in any way 
their re-incarnation.  Nor does it mean all of them were 
Prophets."  
 
 
157  PRAYERS 
 
     "You have asked whether our prayers go beyond &amp;Baha'u'llah; 
It all depends whether we pray to Him directly or through Him 
 
 
+P59 
to God.  We may do both, and also can pray directly to God, 
but our prayers would certainly be more effective and illuminating 
if they are addressed to Him through His Manifestation 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     "Under no circumstances, however, can we, while repeating 
the prayers, insert the name &amp;Baha'u'llah where the word `God' 
is used.  This would be tantamount to blasphemy."  
     "In quoting prayers any part may be used, but should 
be quoted as it is, however short."  
 
 
158  PRAYERS AND MEDITATIONS 
     (Book of)  
 
     "He is indeed pleased to know that the Book of Prayers and 
Meditations by &amp;Baha'u'llah has been out in time to enable the 
friends to read it during the Fast, and he has every hope that 
the perusal of such a precious volume will help to deepen more 
than any other publication, the spirit of devotion and faith in the 
friends, and thus charge them with all the spiritual power they 
require for the accomplishment of their tremendous duties 
towards the Cause..."  
 
 
159  PRAYERS (Daily)  
 
     "The daily prayers are to be said each one for himself, aloud 
or silent makes no difference.  There is no congregational prayer 
except that for the dead.  We read healing and other prayers 
in our meetings, but the daily prayer is a personal obligation, 
so someone else reading it is not quite the same thing as saying 
it for yourself.  
     "If you find you need to visualize someone when you pray, 
think of the Master.  Through Him you can address &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Gradually try to think of the qualities of the Manifestation, and 
in that way a mental form will fade out, for after all the body 
is not the thing, His Spirit is there and is the essential, everlasting 
element."  
 
 
+P60 
160  PRAYERS (Daily Obligatory)  
 
     "The daily obligatory prayers are three in number.  The 
shortest one consists of a single verse which has to be recited 
once in every twenty-four hours and at midday.  The medium 
(prayer) which begins with the words:  `The Lord is witness 
that there is none other God but He,' has to be recited three 
times a day, in the morning, at noon and in the evening.  The 
long prayer which is the most elaborate of the three has to be 
recited once in every twenty-four hours, and at any time one 
feels inclined to do so.  
     "The believer is entirely free to choose any one of those 
three prayers but is under the obligation of reciting one of 
them, and in accordance with any specific directions with which 
they may be accompanied.  
     "These daily obligatory prayers, together with a few other 
specific ones, such as the Healing Prayer, the Tablet of Ahmad, 
have been invested by &amp;Baha'u'llah with a special potency and 
significance, and should therefore be accepted as such and be 
recited by the believers with unquestioned faith and confidence, 
that through them they may enter into a much closer communion 
with God, and identify themselves more fully with His 
Laws and precepts."  
 
 
161  PRAYERS (Healing)  
 
     "The healing prayers revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah can be 
effective even though used by non-believers.  But their effectiveness 
is of course greater in the case of those who fully accept 
the Revelation."  
 
 
162  PRAYERS (To be Read as Revealed)  
 
     "Regarding your question as to the changing of pronouns 
in &amp;Baha'i prayers:  The Guardian does not approve of such 
changes, either in the specific prayers or in any others.  They 
should be read as printed without changing a single word."  
 
 
+P61 
163  PREJUDICES (Racial)  
 
     "Regarding the solution of the racial problem; the believers 
should of course realize that the principle of the oneness of 
mankind which is the cornerstone of the message of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
is wholly incompatible with all forms of racial prejudice.  Loyalty 
to this foundation principle of the Faith is the paramount 
duty of every believer and should be therefore wholehearted 
and unqualified.  For a &amp;Baha'i, racial prejudice, in all its forms, 
is simply a negation of Faith, an attitude wholly incompatible 
with the very spirit and actual teachings of the Cause.  
     "But while the friends should faithfully and courageously 
uphold this &amp;Baha'i principle of the essential unity of all human 
races, yet in the methods they adopt for its application and 
further realization on the social plane they should act with tact, 
wisdom and moderation.  These two attitudes are by no means 
exclusive.  &amp;Baha'is do not believe that the spread of the Cause 
and its principles and teachings can be effected by means of 
radical and violent methods.  While they are loyal to all those 
teachings, yet they believe in the necessity of resorting to peaceful 
and friendly means for the realization of their aims.  
     "As regards the meaning of the passage on page 188 of the 
Gleanings it is an emphasis by &amp;Baha'u'llah on the importance 
of maintaining differences of station and classes in society and 
does not refer to the question of race."  
 
 
164  PROPHETS (Many will appear)  
 
     "After &amp;Baha'u'llah many Prophets will, no doubt, appear 
but they will be under His Shadow.  Although they may abrogate 
the laws of this Dispensation in accordance with the needs 
and requirements of the age in which they appear, they nevertheless 
draw their spiritual force from this mighty Revelation.  
The Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah constitutes, indeed, the stage of maturity 
in the development of mankind.  His appearance has released 
such spiritual forces which will continue to animate, for many 
long years to come, the world in its development.  Whatever progress 
may be achieved, in later ages, after the unification of the 
 
 
+P62 
whole human race is achieved, will be but improvement in the 
machinery of the world.  For the machinery itself has been 
already created by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The task of continually improving 
and perfecting this machinery is one which later Prophets 
will be called upon to achieve.  They will thus move and work 
within the orbit of the &amp;Baha'i Cycle."  
 
 
165  PSYCHIATRY 
 
     "There is nothing in our teachings about Freud and his 
method.  Psychiatry treatment in general is no doubt an important 
contribution to medicine, but we must believe it is still a 
growing rather than a perfected science.  As &amp;Baha'u'llah has 
urged us to avail ourselves of the help of good physicians &amp;Baha'is 
are certainly not only free to turn to psychiatry for assistance 
but should, when available, do so.  This does not mean psychiatrists 
are always wise or always right; it means we are free to 
avail ourselves of the best medicine has to offer us."  
 
 
166  PSYCHIC PHENOMENA 
 
     "With reference to psychic phenomena referred to in your 
letter; these, in most cases, are an indication of a deep psychological 
disturbance.  The friends should avoid as much as possible 
giving undue consideration to such matters."  
 
 
167  PURE SOULS 
 
     "Those who have never had any opportunity of hearing 
of the Faith but who lived good lives will no doubt be treated 
with the greatest love and mercy in the next world, and reap 
their full rewards."  
 
 
168  PYRAMID PROPHECIES 
 
     "We have nothing in our &amp;Baha'i Writings about the so-called 
Prophecies of the Pyramids; so he (the Guardian) does not 
think you need attach any importance to them."  
 
 
+P63 
169  PROMINENT FIGURES (Letters to 
     Government Heads)  
 
     "The Guardian feels that any communications addressed 
to international figures of this nature, particularly in connection 
with political proposals of any one group, should not be written 
unless approved by him.  He feels matters of this type so important 
that he does not wish such communications sent without 
his prior consideration and approval.  It may lead to quite 
difficult and embarrassing situations, especially when the letters 
are made public..."  
 
 
170  &amp;QUR'AN (`Sales' Translation 
     Recommended)  
 
     "As to the question raised by the Spiritual Assembly of Los 
Angeles concerning the best English translation of the &amp;Qur'an, 
the Guardian would recommend `Sales' translation which is the 
most accurate rendering available, and is the most widespread."  
 
 
171  &amp;QUR'AN--STUDY OF (Concerning School 
     Program)  
 
     "With regard to the school's program (Louhelen) for the 
next summer; the Guardian would certainly advise, and even 
urge the friends to make a thorough study of the &amp;Qur'an, as the 
knowledge of this sacred Scripture is absolutely indispensable 
for every believer who wishes to adequately understand and 
intelligently read, the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Although there 
are very few persons among Western &amp;Baha'is who are capable 
of handling such a course in a scholarly way, the mere lack of 
such competent teachers should encourage and stimulate the 
believers to get better acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures of 
&amp;Islam.  In this way, there will gradually appear some distinguished 
&amp;Baha'is who will be so well versed in the teachings of 
&amp;Islam as to be able to guide the believers in their study of that 
religion."  
 
 
+P64 
172  QUR'AN, SURIHS OF THE 
 
     "It is certainly most difficult to thoroughly grasp all the 
&amp;Surihs of the &amp;Qur'an, as it requires a detailed knowledge of the 
social, religious and historical background of Arabia at the time 
of the appearance of the Prophet.  The believers can not possibly 
hope, therefore, to understand the &amp;Surihs after the first or 
even second or third reading.  They have to study them again 
and again, ponder over their meaning, with the help of certain 
commentaries and explanatory notes as found, for instance, in 
the admirable translation made by SALE, endeavor to acquire 
as clear and correct understanding of their meaning and import 
as possible.  This is naturally a slow process, but future generations 
of believers will certainly come to grasp it.  For the present, 
the Guardian agrees, that it would be easier and more helpful 
to study the Book according to subjects, and note verse by verse 
and also in the light of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
interpretation which throw such floods of light on the whole of 
the &amp;Qur'an."  
 
 
173  RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS, 
     &amp;NON-BAHA'I 
 
     "Concerning membership in &amp;non-Baha'i religious associations, 
the Guardian wishes to re-emphasize the general principle 
already laid down in his communications to your Assembly and 
also to the individual believers that no &amp;Baha'i who wishes to be 
a whole hearted and sincere upholder of the distinguishing 
principles of the Cause can accept full membership in any &amp;non-Baha'i 
ecclesiastical organization.  For such an act would necessarily 
imply only a partial acceptance of the Teachings and Laws 
of the Faith, and an incomplete recognition of its independent 
status, and would thus be tantamount to an act of disloyalty to 
the verities it enshrines.  For it is only too obvious that in most 
of its fundamental assumptions the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah is 
completely at variance with outworn creeds, ceremonies, and 
institutions.  To be a &amp;Baha'i and at the same time accept membership 
in another religious body is simply an act of contradiction 
that no sincere and logically-minded person can possibly 
 
 
+P65 
accept.  To follow &amp;Baha'u'llah does not mean accepting some 
of His teachings and rejecting the rest.  Allegiance to His 
Cause must be uncompromising and whole-hearted.  During 
the days of the Master the Cause was still in a stage that made 
such an open and sharp disassociation between it and other 
religious organizations, and particularly the Muslim Faith 
not only inadvisable but practically impossible to establish.  
But since His passing, events throughout the &amp;Baha'i World 
and particularly in Egypt where the Muslim religious courts 
have formally testified to the independent character of the 
Faith, have developed to a point that have made such an assertion 
of the independence of the Cause not only highly desirable 
but absolutely essential."  
 
 
174  RESURRECTION (Explains the Passage on 
     page 231 of the Gleanings)  
 
     "`From it (the earth) have We created you', etc., this is a 
verse from the &amp;Qur'an and the quotation mark has been wrongly 
omitted from the text and should be added after `time'.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah in quoting this passage seeks to refute the argument 
of the Muslims, who attach a purely literal interpretation to this 
verse of the &amp;Qur'an, and therefore consider it as implying bodily 
resurrection.  To these Muslims, He says, that you who literally 
believe that the human body will return to dust and will be 
raised from it again, and therefore attach so much importance 
to this mortal world, how then can you wax so proud, and boast 
over things which are but perishable and consequently void 
of any true and lasting value."  
 
 
175  RINGSTONES AND BURIAL STONES 
 
     "In regard to the use of ringstones and burial stones, the 
Guardian leaves this matter at present entirely to the discretion 
of the believers, and has no objection if your Assembly provides 
facilities for their purchase by the friends.  When the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas 
is published the necessary instructions will be given regarding 
this matter."  
 
 
+P66 
176  SUMMER SCHOOLS, &amp;BAHA'I 
     (Importance of)  
 
     "He fervently hopes that through the earnest and sustained 
efforts of your committee these annual gatherings will acquire 
increasing importance in the eyes of the public, and will constitute 
an effective medium for the dissemination of the Teachings.  
He feels that in your next summer meetings continued 
emphasis should be laid upon the teaching of the Administration, 
especially in its relation to the outside world, so as 
to impress the &amp;non-Baha'i attendants at the school with the 
nature, character, and world-significance of the World Order of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
 
177  SUMMER SCHOOLS, &amp;BAHA'I 
     (Purpose of)  
 
     "The basic purpose of all &amp;Baha'i Summer Schools, whether 
in East or West, is to give the believers the opportunity to 
acquaint themselves, not only by mere study but through whole-hearted 
and active collaboration in various &amp;Baha'i activities 
with the essentials of the administration and in this way enable 
them to become efficient and able promoters of the Cause.  
The teaching of the Administration is therefore, an indispensable 
feature of every &amp;Baha'i Summer School and its special significance 
can be better understood if we realize the great need of 
every believer today for a more adequate understanding of the 
social principles and laws of the Faith."  
     "How wonderful it would be if all the friends could arrange 
to spend at least a few days in one of these summer schools and 
take an active part in their development.  These centers could 
attract many souls if properly arranged and made interesting; 
those &amp;non-Baha'is who visit them will then have some time to 
get into the spirit of the place and make a study of the Cause...  
We constantly receive letters from people who became &amp;Baha'i 
by visiting one of these centers and obtaining the Message 
there."  
 
 
+P67 
178  SERVICE TO HUMANITY 
 
     "He feels that, although your desire to partake actively of 
the dangers and miseries afflicting so many millions of people 
today, is natural, and a noble impulse, there can be no comparison 
between the value of &amp;Baha'i work and any other form 
of service to humanity.  
     "If the &amp;Baha'is could evaluate their work properly they 
would see that whereas other forms of relief work are superficial 
in character, alleviating the sufferings and ills of men for 
a short time at best, the work they are doing is to lay the 
foundation of a new Spiritual Order in the world founded on 
the Word of God, operating according to the Laws He has laid 
down for this age.  No one else can do this work except those 
who have fully realized the meaning of the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
where as almost any courageous, sincere person can engage 
in relief work, etc.  
     "The believers are building a refuge for mankind.  This is 
their supreme, sacred task and they should devote every moment 
they can to this task."  
 
 
179  SEVEN LIGHTS OF UNITY 
 
     "The seven lights of Unity will not necessarily come in the 
order given.  A product of the second may well be universal 
culture."  
 
 
180  SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE FAITH (A 
     Single Divine and World-Embracing System)  
 
     "Concerning the idea of the &amp;Baha'i World Order and the 
proper emphasis which should be laid on the social aspect of 
the Faith; the Guardian feels the necessity for all teachers to 
stress the fact that the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah can, under 
no circumstances, be divorced from the spiritual principles and 
 
 
+P68 
teachings of the Cause; that the social laws and institutions of 
the Faith are inseparably bound up and closely interwoven with 
the moral and spiritual principles enunciated by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
Who, Himself, indeed, has time and again emphasized the 
underlying oneness and the identity of purpose of all His 
spiritual, doctrinal, and social teachings.  The Friends, while 
emphasizing both of these aspects, should, in particular, point 
out that they constitute parts of one and the same plan, and 
elements of a single, divine and world-embracing system."  
 
 
181  SPIRITUALITY (The Troubles of This 
     World Pass)  
 
     "As we suffer these misfortunes we must remember that the 
Prophets of God Themselves were not immune from these 
things which men suffer.  They knew sorrow, illness and pain too.  
They rose above these things through Their spirits, and that is 
what we must try and do too, when afflicted.  The troubles of 
this world pass, and what we have left is what we have made of 
our souls; so it is to this we must look--to becoming more 
spiritual, drawing nearer to God, no matter what our human 
minds and bodies go through."  
 
 
182  SUMMER SCHOOLS (The &amp;Baha'i)  
 
     "Definite courses should be given along the different phases 
of the &amp;Baha'i Faith and in a manner that will stimulate the 
students to proceed in their studies privately once they return 
home, for the period of a few days is not sufficient to learn 
everything.  They have to be taught the habit of studying the 
Cause constantly, for the more we read the Words the more will 
the truth they contain be revealed to us."  
 
 
183  SUMMER SCHOOLS (&amp;Baha'i Atmosphere in)  
 
     "He (the Guardian) thinks the less time spent on such topics 
as `Current Events in the light of the &amp;Baha'i Faith', and `The 
 
 
+P69 
&amp;Baha'i Faith and Modern Science' the better.  There is no harm 
in having an evening lecture by a qualified speaker once on each 
of these subjects, but he certainly does not feel that much time 
should be spent on them, for the very simple reason that there 
is so little that can be said on the subject."  
     "The &amp;Baha'is must realize that they belong to a world-wide 
Order, and not an American civilization.  They must try and 
introduce the &amp;Baha'i atmosphere of life and thought into their 
Summer Schools, rather than making the Summer School an 
episode and a pleasant vacation period, during which they learn 
a little more about the Faith."  
 
 
184  SUPREME TRIBUNAL 
 
     "The Supreme Tribunal is an aspect of a world Superstate; 
the exact nature of its relationship to that state we cannot at 
present foresee.  Supreme Tribunal is the correct translation; 
it will be a contributing factor in establishing the Lesser Peace.  
There is no statement in the teachings indicating that the Lesser 
Peace will definitely be established by 1957 or 1963."  
 
 
185  TABLETS OF &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA 
 
     "The work of collecting and publishing the Tablets is one of 
the most important tasks that this generation has to undertake 
for upon it depends our true understanding of the Cause 
and its principles.  Only Tablets with the Master's signature and 
in the original tongue should be recognised.  Any translation 
or copies of them fail having real authority.  This shows the 
importance of collecting the original Tablets that bear the 
Master's signature."  
 
 
186  TEACHERS (Unqualified Loyalty)  
 
     "In connection with the problems facing the friends in their 
teaching work; these, the Guardian is well aware, are by no 
means easy to overcome, specially in view of the limited number 
and resources of the believers.  But in the field of &amp;Baha'i 
 
 
+P70 
service, as the history of the Cause abundantly demonstrates, 
there is no obstacle that can be said to be unsurmountable.  
Every difficulty will, in due time, be solved.  But continued and 
collective effort is also needed.  The &amp;Baha'i teacher should not 
get discouraged at the consciousness of the limitations within 
or without him.  He should rather persevere, and be confident, 
that no matter how numerous and perplexing the difficulties that 
confront him may appear, he is continually assisted and guided 
through Divine Confirmations.  He should consider himself 
as a mere instrument in the Hands of God, and should, therefore, 
cease looking at his own merits.  
     "The first and most important qualification of a &amp;Baha'i 
Teacher is, indeed, unqualified loyalty and attachment to the 
Cause.  Knowledge is, of course essential; but compared to 
devotion it is secondary in importance."  
 
 
187  TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS 
     (Can Serve as Both)  
 
     "Regarding the statement made by the Guardian ... concerning 
the fact that believers can serve both as teachers and administrators.  
Shoghi Effendi would approve your Assembly 
making this fact known to all the friends.  For although it is 
essential for the believers to maintain always a clear distinction 
between teaching and administrative duties and functions, yet 
they should be careful not to be led to think that these two types 
of &amp;Baha'i activity are mutually exclusive in their nature and as 
such cannot be exercised by one and the same person.  As a 
matter of fact, the friends should be encouraged to serve in both 
the teaching and the administrative fields of &amp;Baha'i service.  But 
as there are always some who are more specially gifted along 
one of these two lines of activity it would seem more desirable 
that they should concentrate their efforts in acquiring the full 
training for that type of work for which they are best suited by 
nature.  Such a specialization has the advantage of saving time 
and of leading to greater efficiency, particularly at this early 
stage of our development.  The great danger, however, lies in 
that by so doing the friends may tend to develop a sort of class 
 
 
+P71 
consciousness which is fundamentally contrary to both the spirit 
and actual teachings of the Faith.  
     "It is precisely in order to overcome such a danger that the 
Guardian thinks it advisable that the friends should be encouraged 
to serve from time to time in both the teaching and the 
administrative spheres of &amp;Baha'i work, but only whenever they 
feel fit to do so."  
 
 
188  TEACHERS, &amp;BAHA'I (A Principle)  
 
     "Regarding the principle that the Cause must not be allowed 
to center around any &amp;Baha'i personality, the Guardian wishes to 
make it clear that it was never intended that well qualified individual 
teachers should not receive from local Assemblies 
every encouragement and facilities to address the public.  What 
the Guardian meant was that the personality and popularity of 
such a speaker should never be allowed to eclipse the authority 
or detract from the influence of the body of the elected representatives 
in every local community.  Such an individual should 
not only seek the approval, advice and assistance of the body 
that represents the Cause in his locality, but should strive to 
attribute any credit he may obtain, to the collective wisdom and 
capacity of the Assembly under whose jurisdiction he performs 
his services.  Assemblies and not individuals constitute the bedrock 
on which the Administration is built.  Everything else 
must be subordinated to, and be made to serve and advance the 
best interests of these elected custodians and promoters of the 
laws of &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
 
189  TEACHING 
 
     "The Cause of God is developing rapidly in the virgin areas 
of the Crusade; but on the home front we seem to be not so 
successful.  No doubt this is due to the fact that the friends at 
home are not as diligently taking advantage of every teaching 
opportunity as the pioneers do in foreign lands.  Success will 
crown the efforts of the friends on the home front when they 
meditate on the teaching, pray fervently for divine confirmations 
for their work, study the teachings so they may carry the 
 
 
+P72 
spirit to the seeker, and then act,--and above all persevere in 
action.  When these steps are followed, and the teaching work 
carried on sacrificially and with devoted enthusiasm, the Faith 
will spread rapidly."  
 
 
190  TEACHING (Love for &amp;Baha'u'llah)  
 
     "...Without the spirit of real love for &amp;Baha'u'llah, for His 
Faith and its Institutions, and the believers for each other, the 
Cause can never really bring in large numbers of people.  For 
it is not preaching any rules the world wants, but love and 
action..."  
 
 
191  TEACHING 
 
     "Shoghi Effendi would urge every &amp;Baha'i who feels the urge 
to exercise his right of teaching unofficially the Cause, to keep 
in close touch with the Local Spiritual Assembly of the locality 
in which he is working.  The Local Spiritual Assembly, while 
reserving for itself the right to control such activities on the 
part of individual &amp;Baha'is, should do its utmost to encourage 
such teachers and to put at their disposal whatever facilities 
they would need in such circumstances.  Should any differences 
arise, the National Spiritual Assembly would naturally have 
to intervene and adjust matters."  
 
 
192  TEACHING (Advent of Divine Justice)  
 
     "In the matter of teaching, as repeatedly and emphatically 
stated, particularly in his `Advent of Divine Justice', the Guardian 
does not wish the believers to make the slightest discrimination, 
even though this may result in provoking opposition or 
criticism from any individual, class or institution.  The Call of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, being universal, should be addressed with equal 
force to all the peoples, classes and nations of the world, irrespective 
of any religious, racial, political or class distinction or 
difference..."  
 
 
+P73 
193  TEACHING, CONCENTRATE ON (Source 
     of Joy and Consolation)  
 
     "We all have our petty material obstacles in this life.  We 
cannot totally get rid of them.  The best thing to do, after all 
our efforts have failed to deliver us, is to concentrate on that 
which can alone bring real happiness and peace to our heart.  
And you should be thankful to God for having enabled you to 
recognize and accept His Faith.  For this is, assuredly, the only 
source of joy and consolation you can have in your moments of 
suffering.  Is there anything more worthwhile to work for than 
the Teachings of the Message?"  
 
 
194  TEACHING (The Concourse on High)  
 
     "The invisible battalions of the Concourse on High, are 
mustered, in serried ranks, ready to rush their reinforcements 
to the aid of the vanguard of &amp;Baha'u'llah's crusaders in the 
hour of their greatest need, and in anticipation of that Most 
Great, that Wondrous Jubilee in the joyfulness of which both 
heaven and earth will partake."  
 
 
195  TEACHING (Direct)  
 
     "He approves of your desire to teach the principles of the 
Faith through radio.  But he urges you to do all you can to 
always, however small the reference you are able to make to it 
may be, clearly identify or associate what you are giving out 
with &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The time is too short now for us &amp;Baha'is to 
be able to first educate humanity and then tell it that the 
source is this new World Faith.  For their own spiritual protection 
people must hear of the name &amp;Baha'i--then, if they turn 
blindly away they cannot excuse themselves by saying they 
never even knew it existed!  For dark days seem still ahead of 
the world, and outside this Divine Refuge the people will not, 
we firmly believe, find inner conviction, peace and security.  
So they have a right to at least hear of the Cause as such."  
 
 
+P74 
196  TEACHING--Divine World Order--The 
     Sole Panacea 
 
     "In connection with your teaching work:  What the Guardian 
wishes you to particularly emphasize in all your talks is the 
supreme necessity for all individuals and nations in this day to 
adopt in its entirety the social program given by &amp;Baha'u'llah for 
the reconstruction of the religious, economic and political life 
of mankind.  He wishes you to explain and analyze the elements 
that help in raising this Divine World Order in the light of the 
present-day events and conditions in the world.  Special stress, 
he feels, should be laid on the impending necessity of establishing 
a super-national, and sovereign world state, as the one 
described by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  With the world becoming increasingly 
subject to tumults and convulsions never experienced before, 
the realization of such a necessity is entering into the consciousness 
of not only the wise and learned, but of the common people 
as well.  The believers should, therefore, seize this opportunity 
to make a supreme effort to present, in convincing and eloquent 
language, those social and humanitarian teachings of the Faith 
which we believe to constitute the sole panacea for the innumerable 
ills afflicting our present-day world."  
 
 
197  TEACHING (Duty of Every Believer)  
 
     "Indeed to bring this message to mankind in its darkest 
hour of need is the paramount duty of every believer.  All the 
agony, the suffering, privation and spiritual blindness afflicting 
people today everywhere in the world, to a greater or lesser 
degree, is because they are unaware of, or indifferent to, the 
Remedy God has sent them.  Only those who are aware of it 
can carry its healing knowledge to others, so that each &amp;Baha'i 
has an inescapable and sacred duty to perform."  
 
 
198  TEACHING (Give the Message)  
 
     "The believers ought to give the message even to those who 
do not seem ready for it, because they can never judge the real 
extent to which the Word of God can influence the hearts and 
 
 
+P75 
minds of the people, even those who appear to lack any power 
of receptivity to the teachings."  
 
 
199  TEACHING (Greater Unity Among the 
     Friends)  
 
     "Regarding your question about the need for greater unity 
among the friends, there is no doubt that this is so, and the 
Guardian feels that one of the chief instruments for promoting 
it is to teach the &amp;Baha'is themselves, in classes and through precepts, 
that love of God, and consequently of men, is the essential 
foundation of every religion, our own included.  A greater 
degree of love will produce a greater unity, because it enables 
people to bear with each other, to be patient and forgiving."  
 
 
200  TEACHING (Love and Unity)  
 
     "The most important thing for the believers is, of course, to 
be united and to really love each other for the sake of God, 
(Otherwise it is not possible to love everyone).  However, if 
communities wait until love and complete harmony are established 
before teaching, the teaching work will come to a standstill.  
Both sides must be cultivated; whilst actively teaching 
the friends must themselves be taught and deepened in the spirit 
of the Faith, which brings love and unity."  
 
 
201  TEACHING--&amp;BAHA'I FAITH (What the 
     Cause Now Requires)  
 
     "What the Cause now requires is not so much a group of 
highly cultured and intellectual people who can adequately present 
its Teachings, but a number of devoted, sincere and loyal 
supporters, who, in utter disregard of their own weaknesses and 
limitations, and with hearts afire with the love of God, forsake 
their all for the sake of spreading and establishing His 
Faith.  In other words, what is mostly needed nowadays is a 
&amp;Baha'i pioneer and not so much a &amp;Baha'i philosopher or scholar.  
 
 
+P76 
For the Cause is not a system of philosophy; it is essentially a 
way of life, a religious faith that seeks to unite all people on a 
common basis of mutual understanding and love, and in a 
common devotion to God.  
     "&amp;Baha'i scholars and writers will, no doubt, gradually appear, 
and will as promised by &amp;Baha'u'llah lend a unique support to 
the Faith.  But in the meantime, we should not tarry, or
slacken in our efforts."  
 
 
202  TEACHING (Study Early History and Principles 
     of the Faith)  
 
     "I wish to urge the necessity of concentrating at your next 
summer session, on the systematic study of the early history and 
principles of the Faith, on public speaking, and on a thorough 
discussion, both formally and informally, of various aspects of 
the Cause.  These I regard as essential preliminaries to a future 
intensive campaign of teaching in which the rising generation 
must engage, if the spread of the Cause is to be assured in that 
land."  
 
 
203  TEACHING (The Utmost Effort)  
 
     "I cannot refrain from adding a few words to renew and 
reaffirm my fervent plea to you, and through you to every 
individual member of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, to exert 
the utmost effort in order to further the Cause of Teaching 
throughout the American Continent.  Every possible assistance, 
whether moral, financial, or administrative, should be continuously, 
generously, and systematically extended to this most 
urgent, this sacred and meritorious Cause.  My heart yearns to 
learn of any speedy and effective action which the valiant members 
of that community may determine, whether collectively or 
severally, to undertake.  The invisible hosts of the &amp;Abha Kingdom 
are arrayed and ready to rush forth and ensure the triumph 
of every stout-hearted and persevering herald of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
 
+P77 
204  TEACHING (In South)  
 
     "Regarding the whole manner of teaching the Faith in the 
South; the Guardian feels that, although the greatest consideration 
should be shown the feelings of white people in the South 
whom we are teaching, under no circumstances should we discriminate 
in their favour, consider them more valuable to the 
Cause than their Negro fellow-southerners, or single them out 
to be taught the Message first.  To pursue such a policy, however 
necessary and even desirable it may superficially seem, 
would be to compromise the true spirit of our Faith, which 
permits us to make no such distinctions in offering its tenets to 
the world.  The Negro and white races should be offered, simultaneously, 
on a basis of equality, the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Rich or poor, known or unknown, should be permitted to hear 
of this Holy Faith in this, humanity's greatest hour of need.  
     "This does not mean that we should go against the laws of 
the State, pursue a radical course which will stir up trouble, 
and cause misunderstanding...  Even in places where the two 
races can meet together in the South, he feels it would be, in 
certain cases, preferable to teach them separately until they are 
fully confirmed and then bring them together..."  
 
 
205  TEACHING METHODS 
 
     "The same thing is true of teaching methods; no system, for 
teachers to practice, exists.  But obviously the more people 
know about the teachings and the Cause, the better they will 
be to present the subject.  If some people find that prayer 
and placing all their trust in God, releases in them a flood of 
inspiration, they should be left free to pursue this method if 
it is productive of results.  
     "The inspiration received through meditation is of a nature 
that one cannot measure or determine.  God can inspire into 
our minds things that we had no previous knowledge of, if He 
desires to do so.  
     "We cannot clearly distinguish between personal desire and 
 
 
+P78 
guidance, but if the way opens, when we have sought guidance, 
then we may presume God is helping us."  
 
 
206  TEMPLE, CHANTING IN THE 
 
     "As regard the chanting of Tablets in the Temple, 
Shoghi Effendi wishes in this connection to urge the friends 
to avoid all forms of rigidity and uniformity in matters of 
worship.  There is no objection to the recital or chanting of 
prayers in the Oriental language, but there is also no obligation 
whatsoever of adopting such a form of prayer at any devotional 
service in the auditorium of the Temple.  It should neither be 
required nor prohibited.  The important thing that should 
always be borne in mind is that with the exception of certain 
specific obligatory prayers, &amp;Baha'u'llah has given us no strict 
or special rulings in matters of worship, whether in the Temple 
or elsewhere.  Prayer is essentially a communion between man 
and God, and as such transcends all ritualistic forms and 
formulae."  
 
 
207  TESTS AND PROBLEMS 
 
     "Ultimately all the battle of life is within the individual.  No 
amount of organization can solve the inner problems or 
produce or prevent, as the case may be, victory or failure at a 
crucial moment.  In such times as these particularly, individuals 
are torn by great forces at large in the world and, we see 
some weak ones strong, and strong ones fail--we can only try, 
through loving advice, as your Committee has done, to bring 
about the act on the part of the believer which will be for the 
highest good of the Cause.  Because obviously something bad 
for the Cause cannot be the highest good of the individual 
&amp;Baha'i."  
 
 
208  THEOCRACY 
 
     "What the Guardian was referring to was the Theocratic 
systems, such as the Catholic Church and the Caliphate, which 
are not divinely given as systems, but man-made and yet, having 
 
 
+P79 
partly derived from the teachings of Christ and Muhammad 
are, in a sense, theocracies.  The &amp;Baha'i theocracy, on the 
contrary, is both divinely ordained as a system and, of course, 
based on the teachings of the Prophet Himself...  Theophany is 
used in the sense of Dispensation..."  
 
 
209  TOMBSTONE, &amp;BAHA'I SYMBOL ON 
 
     "In regard to your question regarding the use of the 
Greatest Name on tombstones of &amp;Baha'is, the Guardian 
considers this too sacred to be placed in such a position in 
general use, and the friends should not use it on their tombstones.  
They can use quotations from the Teachings, if they 
wish to, but not the Greatest Name.  Naturally, if anyone has 
already used it, it does not matter."  
 
     NINE-POINTED STAR FOR HEADSTONE 
 
     "Approve star for graves."  Cable of October 22, 1954.  
 
 
210  TRANSLITERATION OF &amp;BAHA'I TERMS 
 
     "...the faithful spelling of which by all the Western friends 
will avoid confusion in future, and insure in this matter a 
uniformity which is greatly needed at present in all &amp;Baha'i 
literature...  I feel confident that all the friends will from now on 
follow this system and adhere scrupulously and at all times to 
this code in all their writings.  
     "The preparation of &amp;Baha'i articles, committee reports, etc., 
should therefore employ the system of transliteration which 
the Guardian has supplied."  
 
 
211  UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE, 
     MEMBERSHIP 
 
     "As regards your question concerning the membership of 
the Universal House of Justice, there is a Tablet from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
in which He definitely states that the membership of the 
 
 
+P80 
Universal House is confined to men and that the wisdom of it 
will be fully revealed in the future.  In the local, as well as the 
National Houses of Justice, however, women have the full right 
of membership.  It is therefore, only to the International 
House that they cannot be elected.  The &amp;Baha'is should accept 
this statement of the Master in a spirit of deep faith, confident 
that there is a divine guidance and wisdom behind it, which 
will be gradually unfolded to the eyes of the world."  
     "Regarding your question, the Master said the wisdom of 
having no women on the International House of Justice, would 
become manifest in the future.  We have no other indication 
than this.  
     "At present there are women on the International Council, 
and this will continue as long as it exists, but when the International 
House of Justice is elected, there will only be men on 
it, as this is the law of the Aqdas."  
 
 
212  VACCINATION 
 
     "Regarding your question about vaccination:  
     "These are technical matters which have not been specifically 
mentioned in the Teachings, and consequently, the 
Guardian cannot make any statement about them.  No doubt 
medical science will progress tremendously as time goes by and 
the treatment of disease becomes more perfect."  
 
 
213  VISIONS 
 
     "There is a fundamental difference between Divine Revelation 
as vouchsafed by God to His Prophets, and the spiritual 
experiences and visions which individuals may have.  The latter 
should, under no circumstances, be construed as constituting an 
infallible source of guidance, even for the person experiencing 
them."  
 
 
+P81 
214  VOTING--(Civil)  
 
     "The friends may vote, if they can do it, without identifying 
themselves with one party or another.  To enter the arena of 
party politics is surely detrimental to the best interests of the 
Faith and will harm the Cause.  It remains for the individuals 
to so use their right to vote as to keep aloof from party politics, 
and always bear in mind that they are voting on the merits of 
the individual, rather than because he belongs to one party or 
another.  The matter must be made perfectly clear to the 
individuals, who will be left free to exercise their discretion and 
judgment.  But if a certain person does enter into party 
politics and labors for the ascendency of one party over another, 
and continues to do it against the expressed appeals and 
warnings of the Assembly, then the Assembly has the right to 
refuse him the right to vote in &amp;Baha'i elections."  
 
 
215  VOTING RIGHT, The 
 
     "I feel I must reaffirm the vital importance and necessity of 
the right of voting--a sacred responsibility of which no adult 
recognized believer should be deprived, unless he is associated 
with a community that has not as yet been in a position to 
establish a Local Assembly.  This distinguishing right which 
the believer possesses, however, does not carry with it nor does 
it imply an obligation to cast his vote, if he feels that the 
circumstances under which he lives do not justify or allow 
him to exercise that right intelligently and with understanding.  
This is a matter which should be left to the individual to decide 
himself according to his own conscience and discretion."  
 
 
216  VOTING RIGHTS (Status of Individuals 
     Deprived of)  
 
     "Concerning your question as to the status of those individuals 
whom the Local Assembly or the N.S.A. have considered 
it necessary to deprive of the voting right and to suspend from 
local meetings and gatherings; such action which Local and 
National Assemblies have been empowered to take against such 
 
 
+P82 
recalcitrant members, however justified and no matter how 
severe, should under no circumstances be considered as implying 
the complete expulsion of the individuals affected from the 
Cause.  The suspension of voting and other administrative 
rights of an individual, always conditional and therefore temporary, 
can never have such far reaching implications, since it 
constitutes merely an administrative sanction; whereas his 
expulsion or ex-communication from the Faith, which can be 
effected by the Guardian alone in his capacity as the supreme 
spiritual head of the community, has far-reaching spiritual 
implications affecting the very soul of that believer.  The 
former, as already stated, is an administrative sanction, whereas 
the latter is essentially spiritual, involving not only the 
particular relationship of a believer to his local or National 
Assembly, but his very spiritual existence in the Cause.  It 
follows, therefore, that a believer can continue calling himself a 
&amp;Baha'i even though he may cease to be a voting member of 
the community.  But in case he is excluded from the body of 
the Cause by an act of the Guardian he ceases to be a believer 
and cannot possibly identify himself even nominally with the 
Faith."  
 
 
217  WORK, &amp;BAHA'I 
 
     "If the believers could properly evaluate the work they are 
doing they would be astonished at its importance, but they are 
in the position of not being able to see the forest for the trees; 
they are too close to it to realize its true import."  
 
 
218  WORK, DAILY--(&amp;Baha'u'llah's Command 
     Concerning Daily Work)  
 
     "With reference to &amp;Baha'u'llah's command concerning the 
engagement of the believers in some sort of profession; the 
teachings are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the 
statement in the Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite 
clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have no 
place in the new World Order.  As a corollary of this principle, 
 
 
+P83 
&amp;Baha'u'llah further states that mendicity should not only be 
discouraged but entirely wiped out from the face of society.  It 
is the duty of those who are in charge of the organization of 
society to give every individual the opportunity of acquiring 
the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also the 
means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for 
the sake of earning the means of his livelihood.  Every individual, 
no matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is 
under the obligation of engaging in some work or profession, 
for work, especially when performed in the spirit of service, is 
according to &amp;Baha'u'llah, a form of worship.  It has not only 
a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in itself, because it draws 
us nearer to God, and enables to better grasp His purpose 
for us in this world.  It is obvious, therefore, that the inheritance 
of wealth cannot make anyone immune from daily work.  
As to the question of retirement from work for individuals who 
have reached a certain age, this is a matter on which the International 
House of Justice will have to legislate as there are no 
provisions in the Aqdas concerning it."  
 
 
219  WORLD FEDERATION--(On &amp;Baha'i 
     Participation in International Conferences)  
 
     "He feels that the statement which your assembly made in 
your letter to him ... regarding &amp;Baha'is cooperating with peace 
and world unity conferences, covers the subject adequately.  
There is no reason to draw a line of demarcation as to whether 
the type of world federation being promoted by a certain 
society involves governments or peoples.  The point is that 
if it is not allied to any particular political faction, and is not 
either Eastern or Western in its projects, the &amp;Baha'is may 
appear as speakers on its platform and give it moral support."  
 
 
220  YEAR NINE, The 
 
     "The `Year Nine' is an abbreviation of 1269 A.H.  The 
beginning of the Year Nine occurred about two months after 
His (&amp;Baha'u'llah's) imprisonment in that dungeon.  We do not 
know the exact time He received this first intimation...  We 
 
 
+P84 
therefore regard the entire Year Nine as a Holy Year, and the 
emphasis should be placed ... on the entire year, which started 
in October, 1852.  This means our Centenary Year of Celebration 
will be from October, 1952 to October, 1953."  
 
 
221  YOUTH 
 
     "He quite agrees that the dangers facing the modern youth 
are becoming increasingly grave, and call for immediate solution.  
But, as experience clearly shows, the remedy to this truly 
sad and perplexing situation is not to be found in traditional and 
ecclesiastical religion.  The dogmatism of the Church has been 
discarded once for all.  What can control youth and save 
it from the pitfalls of the crass materialism of the age is the 
power of a genuine, constructive and living Faith such as the one 
revealed to the world by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Religion as in the past, 
is still the world's sole hope, but not that form of religion 
which our ecclesiastical leaders strive vainly to preach.  Divorced 
from true religion, morals lose their effectiveness and cease to 
guide and control man's individual and social life.  But when 
true religion is combined with true ethics, then moral progress 
becomes a possibility and not a mere ideal.  
     "The need of our modern youth is for such a type of ethics 
founded on pure religious faith.  Not until these two are rightly 
combined and brought into full action can there be any hope 
for the future of the race."
     "The world that lies ahead of us after this war is going to 
be in a terrible condition, and if the believers are going to 
accomplish their duty and present the Divine Solution to mankind, 
they must prepare themselves for the great tasks that lie 
ahead.  This particularly applies to &amp;Baha'i youth.  Young men 
and women in the Faith must be deep and thoughtful scholars 
of its teachings, so that they can teach in a way that will convince 
people that all the problems facing them have a remedy.  
They must grasp the Administration, so that they can wisely 
and efficiently administer the ever-growing affairs of the Cause; 
and they must exemplify the &amp;Baha'i way of living.  All this is 
 
 
+P85 
not easy--but the Guardian is always greatly encouraged to 
see the spirit animating such young believers as yourself.  He 
has high hopes of what your generation will accomplish."  
 
 
222  YOUTH (Regarding the Age of Fifteen)  
 
     "Regarding the age of fifteen fixed by &amp;Baha'u'llah:  This 
relates only to purely spiritual functions and obligations and is 
not related to the degree of administrative capacity and fitness 
which is a totally different thing, and is, for the present, fixed 
at twenty-one."  
     "&amp;Baha'i youth under twenty-one may serve on Committees.  
     "The question of young &amp;Baha'is being permitted to serve on 
committees other than the Youth Committee has been raised in 
a number of letters recently, and in considering the matter he 
felt that &amp;Baha'i young people under twenty-one should not be 
denied the privilege of committee work.  Though they cannot 
be voting members of &amp;Baha'i communities (or exercise the 
electoral vote at all until they reach that age), and though they 
cannot, likewise, be elected to Assemblies, there is no reason 
why they should not serve the Cause on various committees as 
all committees, national or local, are subordinate to Assemblies 
and their members not elected but appointed, and appointed by 
Assemblies.  We have many devoted and talented young believers 
who can be of great assistance to the Cause even though not 
yet legally of age."  
     "This Cause, although it embraces with equal esteem people 
of all ages, has a special message and mission for the youth 
of your generation.  It is their charter for their future, their 
hope, their guarantee of better days to come.  Therefore the 
Guardian is especially happy that the young &amp;Baha'is are active 
in the pioneer work."  
     "The importance of young &amp;Baha'is to become thoroughly 
steeped in every branch of the teachings can not be over-emphasized, 
as they have great teaching tasks ahead of them to 
accomplish."  
 
 
+P86 
223  &amp;BAHA'I YOUTH IN SCHOOL 
 
     "The problem with which you are faced is one which concerns 
and seriously puzzles many of our present-day youth.  
How to attain spirituality is indeed a question to which every 
young man and woman must sooner or later try to find a 
satisfactory answer.  It is precisely because no such satisfactory 
answer has been given or found, that the modern youth finds 
itself bewildered, and is being consequently carried away by 
the materialistic forces that are so powerfully undermining the 
foundations of man's moral and spiritual life.  
     "Indeed the chief reason for the evils now rampant in 
society is the lack of spirituality.  The materialistic civilization 
of our age has so much absorbed the energy and interest of 
mankind that people in general do no longer feel the necessity 
of raising themselves above the forces and conditions of their 
daily material existence.  There is not sufficient demand for 
things that we call spiritual to differentiate them from the 
needs and requirements of our physical existence.  
     "The universal crisis affecting mankind is, therefore, essentially 
spiritual in its causes.  The spirit of the age, taken on the 
whole, is irreligious.  Man's outlook on life is too crude and 
materialistic to enable him to elevate himself into the higher 
realms of the spirit.  
     "It is this condition, so sadly morbid, into which society 
has fallen, that religion seeks to improve and transform.  For 
the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites 
Man with God.  This state of spiritual communion can be 
brought about and maintained by means of meditation and 
prayer.  And this is the reason why &amp;Baha'u'llah has so much 
stressed the importance of worship.  It is not sufficient for a 
believer merely to accept and observe the teachings.  He should, 
in addition, cultivate the sense of spirituality which he can 
acquire chiefly by means of prayer.  The &amp;Baha'i Faith, like all 
other Divine Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character.  
Its chief goal is the development of the individual and 
society, through the acquisition of spiritual virtues and powers.  
 
 
+P87 
It is the soul of man which has first to be fed.  And this spiritual 
nourishment prayer can best provide.  
     "Laws and institutions, as viewed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, can become 
really effective only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected 
and transformed.  Otherwise religion will degenerate into 
a mere organization, and becomes a dead thing.  The believers, 
particularly the young ones, should therefore fully realize the 
necessity of praying.  For prayer is absolutely indispensable to 
their inner spiritual development, and this, as already stated, is 
the very foundation and purpose of the religion of God."  
 
 
224  YOUTH, JUNIOR (Do Great Deeds)  
 
     "He urges you to make up your minds to do great, great 
deeds for the Faith; the condition of the world is steadily 
growing worse, and your generation must provide the saints, 
heroes, martyrs and administrators of future years.  With 
dedication and will power you can rise to great heights!"  
     "He appreciates very much the devoted and determined 
spirit with which you are facing the future and all the &amp;Baha'i 
responsibility it will bring you increasingly.  The part of youth 
is very great; you have the opportunity to really determine to 
exemplify in word and deed the Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
to show your generation that the New World Order He has 
brought is a tangible reality in the lives of His followers."
