EXCERPTS FROM 
TABLETS OF THE DIVINE PLAN 
 
To the Assemblies and Meetings of the believers of God and the maidservants 
of the Merciful in the United States and Canada.  
 
Upon them be &amp;Baha'u'llah &amp;El' &amp;Abha 
 
                                  He is God!  
 
O ye blessed souls:  
     I desire for you eternal success and prosperity and beg perfect 
confirmation for each one in the divine world.  My hope for you is that each 
one may shine forth like unto the morning star from the horizon of the world 
and in this garden of God become a blessed tree, producing everlasting 
fruits and results.  
     Therefore I direct you to that which is conducive to your heavenly 
confirmation and illumination in the Kingdom of God!  
     It is this:  Alaska is a vast country; although one of the maidservants of 
the Merciful has hastened to those parts, serving as a librarian in the 
Public Library, and according to her ability is not failing in teaching the 
Cause, yet the call of the Kingdom of God is not yet raised through that 
spacious territory.  
     His Holiness Christ says:  Travel ye to the East and to the West of the 
world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.  Hence the mercy of 
God must encompass all humanity.  Therefore do ye not think it permissible 
to leave that region deprived of the breezes of the Morn of Guidance.  
Consequently, strive as far as ye are able to send to those parts fluent 
speakers, who are detached from aught else save God, attracted with the 
fragrances of God, and sanctified and purified from all desires and 
temptations.  Their sustenance and food must consist of the teachings of 
 
iv 
 
God.  First they must themselves live in accordance with those principles, 
then guide the people.  Perchance, God willing, the lights of the most 
great guidance may illumine that country and the breezes of the rose 
garden of the love of God may perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of 
Alaska.  Should ye become confirmed in thus rendering such a service, 
rest ye assured that ye shall crown your heads with the diadem of 
everlasting sovereignty and at the threshold of oneness you will become 
the favored and accepted servants.

                               SUPPLICATION 
 
     O Thou Incomparable God!  O Thou Lord of the Kingdom!  These souls 
are Thy heavenly army.  Assist them and with the cohorts of the Supreme 
Concourse, make them victorious; so that each one of them may become 
like unto a regiment and conquer these countries through the love of God 
and the illumination of divine teachings.  
     O God!  Be Thou their supporter and their helper, and in the wilderness, 
the mountain, the valley, the forests, the prairies and the seas, be 
Thou their confidant--so that they may cry out through the power of the 
Kingdom and the breath of the Holy Spirit!  
     Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the Omnipotent and Thou 
art the Wise, the Hearing, and the Seeing.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Friend, 
     The Guardian has received your most welcome and inspiring message 
of the 19th February, and is inexpressibly delighted to know that you have 
spontaneously offered your services for pioneer teaching in Alaska.+E1  He 
can well imagine the feelings of immeasurable satisfaction and unbounded 
gratitude with which both the N.S.A. and the National Teaching 
Committee must have welcomed your determination to teach and establish 
the Faith in that far-off and hitherto unexplored territory, and he 
wishes me to express also his own appreciation and gratitude for this 
remarkable step which you have, notwithstanding the well-nigh insuperable 
obstacles in your way, been inspired to take to carry the Message to 
that distant land.  The spirit of heroic self-sacrifice, and of unflinching 
resolve that has prompted you to undertake so noble and sacred a mission, 
and make such a warm and immediate response to his recent teaching call 
addressed to the American believers cannot but fill all hearts with admiration 
and praise, and evoke the memory of those acts of unrivalled 
heroism, of selfless and unstinted devotion that have characterized the 
lives of the immortal heroes of the Apostolic age of our beloved Faith.  
     Though labouring in an age and under circumstances wholly different 
from those in which those early pioneers of the Cause have been 
privileged to labour, yet it is that selfsame spirit of entire 
self-forgetfulness, of whole-hearted and unwavering loyalty, and of absolute 
consecration that is now, in this Formative period, inspiring you, and all 
our dear American &amp;Baha'i pioneers, to forsake their all and undergo such 
privations and suffering in order to speed up and ensure the triumph of the 
Cause of God.

     Rest assured that the Guardian will incessantly and most fervently 
supplicate on your behalf, that the invisible hosts of the Kingdom may 
continually reinforce and guide your efforts, and enable you to attain this 
assuredly high and noble goal you have set yourself to attain in service to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and His Cause.  
     In the hope that this letter will find you well, happy and well on the way 
of the realization of your plans, and with most cordial greetings, 
                                      Yours ever in His Service, 
                                      H. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and prized co-worker:  
     I am thrilled by the news you give me.  How proud I feel of the spirit 
that so powerfully animates you.  My prayers will, I assure you, accompany 
you on your great and historic adventure.  Persevere no matter how great 
the obstacles in your way.  Future generations will glorify your deed and 
emulate your example.  The Concourse on high acclaims your resolve 
and will richly bless your endeavours.  Be happy and confident.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                     Shoghi

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian has received your most welcome message of December 
31st, and feels truly delighted to know of your recent confirmation in the 
Faith, and of the pioneer work you are now undertaking in Alaska,+E2 in 
collaboration with our beloved sister Miss Honor Kempton.  
     He is indeed grateful to you for having offered to teach and establish 
the Cause in that far off land, and feels confident that through the 
promised confirmations of &amp;Baha'u'llah and your own persistent efforts 
you will eventually succeed in completely attaining your goal.  
     The various measures you have already taken with the view of giving 
widespread publicity to the Teachings have been noted with deep interest 
and appreciation by the Guardian who indeed trusts that they will result in 
attracting to the Cause people of capacity and understanding.  
     He would urge you and also dear Miss Kempton to persevere, and 
through your joint exertions endeavour to pave the way for the formation 
of a local assembly in Alaska.  Rest assured his prayers will be specially 
offered on behalf of you both, that you may receive ever-increasing 
 
+P5 
strength, capacity and guidance to carry out your high teaching mission to 
complete success.  
     With the renewed expression of his abiding gratitude for your devoted 
services, and with loving greetings, 
                                    Yours very sincerely, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     Your letter cheered and heartened me in the conduct of my arduous 
duties and responsibilities.  I rejoice to learn of your high endeavours in 
that distant field, and I will specially pray with increasing fervour for 
your protection and success.  How great your privilege, how laborious 
your task, how noble your mission!  Do not feel disheartened.  Persevere 
and be confident always.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                    Shoghi 
 
                                 *     *     * 
                                                       (3) February 13th, 1940 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian has received your most welcome communication of the 
31st December, and his heart was greatly cheered and refreshed by the 
perusal of its contents, and at the evidences of the slow yet steady 
progress of your teaching work in Alaska.  
     The very illuminating report you had given him covering the general 
social and religious conditions prevailing in that land clearly reveals the 
nature and extent of the obstacles which you have to face and surmount in 
the prosecution of your teaching task.  But surely for such valiant and 
steadfast pioneers like you there is no difficulty, however seemingly 
insurmountable, which cannot be effectively overcome, as &amp;Baha'u'llah is 
assuredly guiding and reinforcing your labours through the unseen hosts 
of His Kingdom.  
     The Guardian was particularly encouraged to know of the contact you 
have established with the editor of the "Alaskan," and of his very 
generous offer to publish in his paper various materials on the Teachings.  
His hope is that this will prove a most effective medium for the spread of 
the Cause, and will bring in a large number of earnest inquirers.  
     Also the Guardian cherishes very bright hopes regarding the bookshop 
which you have opened in Anchorage, which he trusts will serve to attract 
widespread attention to the Faith.  
 
+P6  
     Renewing to you his abiding and heartfelt gratitude for your invaluable 
teaching services, and assuring you again of his continued prayers for the 
confirmation of your efforts, and also for your own welfare and protection 
in these dark and gloomy days, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 
                                    H. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     Your most welcome report brought immense joy to my heart.  With 
feelings of increasing pride, admiration and gratitude I follow your 
activities and pray continually for your success.  Do not relax in your 
efforts.  The Concourse on high is watching over you and the Blessed 
Beauty will reinforce and guide you.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,
                                    Shoghi 
 
                                 *     *     * 
                                                       (4) December 12th, 1942 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letter of Aug. 5th has been received, and the Guardian was very 
pleased to hear from you.  He has instructed me to write and answer you 
on his behalf, and also thank you for the photographs you enclosed.  
     He feels that this is a very important opportunity which you have now 
obtained of teaching the Faith to the Eskimo people,+E3 and he hopes your 
efforts will be crowned with success.  
     He would not advise you to teach them Esperanto, as we have no way 
of knowing whether it will ultimately be chosen as the auxiliary language 
of the world.  He thinks the most direct and quickest way of communicating 
with them in a common tongue should be chosen; in other words 
either you should learn their language or they yours, whichever will yield 
the quickest results.  
     As they are a relatively uncivilized people, unused to the modern 
cosmopolitan forms of life, and consequently not au courant with the 
thoughts which to us have become mere commonplace, he would advise 
you to approach them through love, friendliness, and association, until 
you are in a position to enter into their confidence, and gradually teach 
them, in a simple way, the great truths of our Faith.  
     To confirm them in the Faith should be your main objective, always 
 
+P7 
bearing in mind that faith and belief are different from learning and a full 
grasp of the implications of such a vast Cause as ours.  
     You may be sure his loving prayers will be offered for the success of 
your historic mission, and he will be interested to hear how you are 
progressing.  
                                    With &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Assuring you of my abiding gratitude and appreciation for the 
magnificent services you are rendering, and for the laudable spirit you 
are demonstrating in your historic activities and achievements in these 
days of stress and peril, and assuring you also of my special and constant 
prayers for the success of every effort you exert, and every step you take 
in the path of service, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                    Shoghi 
 
                                 *     *     * 
                                                           (5) July 24th, 1943 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     The Guardian was very happy to receive your letter of May 29th; and he 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     It is with great joy that he welcomes you into the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and he hopes that you will be the means of attracting many other souls to 
this glorious life-giving Message.  
     &amp;Abdul-Baha was most anxious that the Eskimo people should be 
taught the Message of this New Day, and it is a source of happiness to all 
&amp;Baha'is that you, a member of that race, have arisen to spread these 
teachings.+E4  God has surely guided your steps and blessed your search for 
divine Truth.  
     If people only realized it, the inner life of the spirit is that which 
counts, but they are so blinded by desires and so misled that they have brought 
upon themselves all the suffering we see at present in the world.  The 
&amp;Baha'is seek to lead people back to a knowledge of their true selves and 
the purpose for which they were created, and thus to their greatest 
happiness and highest good.  
     You may be sure the Guardian will pray that you may render the Cause 
 
+P8 
many valuable services and become a gifted and confirmed &amp;Baha'i 
teacher.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
P.S. It will interest you to know that there are now &amp;Baha'is active in 
Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Eskimo village of Tuluksak, Alaska.  
 
          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your most welcome letter has rejoiced my heart.  I extend to you a most 
hearty welcome into the ranks of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and will 
greatly value your support and cooperation.  Your conversion to His 
Cause is indeed a historic event, and will greatly rejoice the hearts of the 
believers.  I will pray for your success and spiritual advancement from the 
depths of my heart.  Rest assured and be confident.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                    Shoghi 
 
                                 *     *     * 
                                                          (6) October 14, 1943 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of July 9th has reached the Guardian safely, and he has 
instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     He feels that the most important thing at the present time is, of course, 
the establishment of the first &amp;Baha'i Spiritual Assembly of Alaska.  
     He hopes that, after the assembly is well established and has a 
sufficient number to maintain its status, you will again be able to do 
pioneer teaching work among the Eskimos.  
     Your talk on the Faith in the church of Tuluksak may, indeed, have 
reached some of them, and left a seed of Truth in their minds.  
     As the Centenary Celebration of the Faith draws near the Guardian 
finds himself busier than ever before and barely able to keep pace with his 
work.  However, his thoughts are often with the friends, and he is very 
proud of their achievements.  
     He assures you of his deep appreciation of your devoted and 
self-sacrificing services, and that his loving prayers will continue to be 
offered on your behalf.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
+P9 
          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I admire and feel proud of your historic achievements.  I am deeply 
grateful to you and will continue to pray from the depths of my heart for 
your protection, happiness, and the speedy and full realization of every 
hope you cherish in such an important sphere of &amp;Baha'i activity.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of Aug. 6th brought great joy to the Guardian's heart.  It has 
taken it some time to reach him but he has instructed me to answer it at 
once.  
     He was particularly pleased to hear of the weekly radio broadcasts you 
are giving, and feels that this cannot but have a marked effect on the 
progress of the Cause in Alaska, both visibly and spiritually.  
     Although there are many souls ripe to receive the message, there are 
many others who, though they are not able to recognize its import at 
present, will take the seed into their hearts, and there it will ultimately 
germinate.  Radio reaches so many people and thus is of the utmost 
importance.  
     It was very kind of you to think of sending gifts to the Guardian made 
by Eskimos, and he will value them as tokens of your love and the 
handiwork of a people whom he is most anxious should receive the Divine 
Message.  
     He hopes that your Assembly will endeavour to reach the Eskimos with 
the Message; he fully realizes how difficult a task this is, but it is also one 
of great importance.  If but one of these souls should become truly 
enkindled, he or she could then teach others in their own language and a 
manner suited to their minds.  
     Assuring you all of the loving appreciation of your devoted services, 
and his ardent prayers for the success of your labours.  
                                    Yours, with warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and prized co-workers:  
     It is always a joy to hear from you.  I truly admire the spirit that 
 
+P14 
animates you, as well as your remarkable achievements in the service of 
our beloved Faith.  You truly deserve the praise of the Concourse on 
high.  Persevere in your noble and historic task, and rest assured that the 
Beloved is well pleased with you.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                    Shoghi

To the &amp;Baha'is who attended 
     the Alaska Convention.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of December 3rd has reached the beloved Guardian; and he 
was very pleased to receive the assurance of your determination to 
persevere in the work of the Cause, and achieve all the goals set before the 
American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
     He was also very happy indeed to know that all Alaskan &amp;Baha'is had 
been present.  He considers this a great achievement.  When we consider 
that not so many years ago, there was not a single &amp;Baha'i in Alaska, we 
can truly say:  "What hath God wrought!"--and with thankful hearts 
rededicate ourselves to the work of His Faith.  
                                    With &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Assuring you of my deepest appreciation of the sentiments you have 
expressed, and of my loving, my ardent and continued prayers for the 
extension and consolidation of your highly meritorious activities, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

&amp;Baha'is of the Anchorage Recording District.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Our beloved Guardian has received your letter of January 17th, enclosing 
the loving contribution for the Shrine of the &amp;Bab from the &amp;Baha'is of 
the Anchorage District; and has instructed me to answer on his behalf, 
and to send you the attached receipt.  
 
+P15 
     He very deeply appreciates your gift toward the completion of this 
most holy enterprise, which is serving to draw the devoted believers in all 
lands closer to the Center of their Faith.  
     Naturally he is most happy to hear of the growth of the Faith in your 
land, and it cannot be otherwise when there is such firm resolve and 
determination to serve, and such harmony among the devoted believers.  
     He assures you all of his loving prayers for you at the Holy Shrines.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved bless you and your fellow-workers in Anchorage, 
sustain and protect you, reward you for your contribution and services to 
the Faith, and aid you to enrich the splendid record of your achievements.

The &amp;Baha'i Community of Anchorage.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of January 7th, expressing appreciation of the action 
of the beloved Guardian in arranging for &amp;Ruhiyyih &amp;Khanum, accompanied 
by the Vice-President of the International Council, Amelia Collins, 
to be present at the All-America Teaching Conference and the 
dedication of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Chicago, has been received by 
him.  He has asked me to acknowledge receipt of your letter on his behalf.  
     The Guardian feels that the four forthcoming Conferences are the most 
important gatherings ever held in the Faith to date.  
     The Conferences will bring together representatives of the entire 
&amp;Baha'i World, representing twelve national communities, made up of 
numerous racial and religious backgrounds.  
     The purpose of the Conferences will be the world-wide propagation of 
the Faith.  They will lay the foundations of the service of the &amp;Baha'is of the 
world for the great ten year Crusade ahead--which, God willing, will be 
consummated in the fulfillment of the prophecies of Daniel, and the 
achievement of the initial goals set by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of the 
Divine Plan, whereby the world will be flooded with the Glory of the 
Lord.  
 
+P16 
     The Guardian attaches great importance to the Conference to be held in 
Wilmette, and he sincerely hopes as many of the believers as possible will 
attend.  
     The Guardian will pray at the Shrines for the friends in Anchorage.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

To the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Just a little note to assure you our beloved Guardian received your 
&amp;Naw-Ruz greeting, which he appreciated very much.  
     Great things lie ahead of the &amp;Baha'is in Alaska, and he will pray that 
they may attain their goals speedily and worthily.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani

To the Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of 
     the Anchorage Recording District 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of January 23rd has been received by the Beloved 
Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it in his behalf.  
     The Guardian feels the Dedication of the Temple, and the Intercontinental 
Teaching Conference to be held immediately thereafter, will mark 
a most important historic milepost in the development of the Faith in 
America, and the world.  It will close the epoch of Temple Building, and 
open the 10 year period of World Crusade, during which time, the Faith 
will be established over the face of the earth.  
     The Guardian is happy &amp;Ruhiyyih &amp;Khanum and Vice-President Collins 
of the International &amp;Baha'i Council can attend to represent him.  He hopes 
as many of the Friends as possible will be present.  
                                    With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    I am, 
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas, Asst. Secretary

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has asked me to write the Friends of Alaska on 
his behalf, and explain to them that he is following very closely their 
activities in Alaska.  
     He attaches the very greatest importance to the services which are 
being rendered by the &amp;Baha'is in that land.  
     The future of Alaska is so important that he has set as one of the goals 
of the Ten Year Crusade, the establishment of a National Spiritual 
Assembly in Alaska, notwithstanding its present or future political 
relationship with the United States.  
     This great gift which has come to Alaska likewise calls for great 
sacrifice and service.  The Guardian feels the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska fully 
realize the heavy responsibilities devolving upon them and will arise with 
a superhuman effort to spread the Faith throughout the length and breadth 
of the country.  He will welcome advice of the opening up of new cities 
and centers throughout Alaska, which will lay the foundation stones on 
which the future National Assembly can be built.  The only way this can 
be done is for the Friends to "scatter" as the Master foretold, and settle in 
new cities, areas, etc.  
     A copy of this letter is being sent to the American National Spiritual 
Assembly, so that they might assist the friends of Alaska to fulfill their 
spiritual mission and help their country attain its spiritual destiny.  
     Please send a copy of this appeal of the Guardian to each Believer in 
Alaska.  
     The Beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to each and every one 
of the &amp;Baha'is in Alaska.  He assures you of his prayers at the Holy Shrine 
in your behalf, that every obstacle may be removed from your paths, as 
you prosecute this sacred mission.  
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
                                    Assistant Secretary

                                                           (14) August 5, 1953 
Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has asked me to write you on his behalf, 
concerning settlement in Kotzebue, in the Arctic Circle.  
 
+P18 
     He has learned that one of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage, or Alaska, has 
gone or is going soon to Kotzebue, and he wishes full information in 
connection therewith.  He would like to know who the pioneer is, when he 
settled, or if not settled, when he will do so.  
     The Guardian attaches the greatest importance to this project, and he 
asks that your Assembly assist the pioneer in every way possible.  
     The Guardian asks that you give his love to the pioneer either in or 
enroute to Kotzebue, and assure him, the Guardian will pray for him; that 
the Divine Confirmations may be with him, that every obstacle may be 
removed from his path, and that he will achieve new victories for our 
Glorious Faith.  
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
                                    Assistant Secretary

                                                        (15) November 23, 1953 
Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of September 3rd has been received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     The &amp;Baha'is of Alaska have always proved themselves full of initiative 
and devotion; and he feels sure that they will successfully accomplish 
their goal of having an independent National Assembly before the end of 
the ten years.  
     He feels that if Mrs. Wells can go to Kotzebue next Spring, it would be 
excellent.  The ideal of course is for the friends to obtain work before they 
go to new places, if at all possible, and in this way not deplete their 
resources or be a burden on the Fund.  
     The Guardian was also very happy to hear that the Caldwells are still in 
the Aleutian chain, as he attaches the greatest importance to this very 
difficult post.  He urges your Assembly to give them all the encouragement 
you can, and to impress upon them the importance of remaining 
there.  
     You may be sure he will pray for the progress of your work in the holy 
Shrines; and no doubt the National Assembly will give you every assistance 
it can.  As you know, it has heavy demands made upon it at present, 
in order to get the pioneers out to their posts; and the consolidation work 
will undoubtedly be taken up later on.  
                                    With warmest &amp;Baha'i greetings to you all, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
+P19 
          [From the Guardian:]  
May the Almighty bless, guide and sustain you, aid you to promote 
continually the vital interests of His Faith, and win great victories in its 
service.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                    Shoghi

                                                          (16) March 18, 1954 
Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is following very closely the activities in 
connection with the Ten-Year Crusade throughout the entire &amp;Baha'i world.  
He has been encouraged by the reports reaching him from all centers.  
     The Guardian is happy over the development of the Faith in Alaska.  
Inasmuch as one of the very important goals of the Ten Year Crusade is 
the establishment of a National Spiritual Assembly for Alaska, the 
Guardian is hopeful that the friends will very seriously undertake the 
establishment of the Faith in the important cities, and the development of 
as many assemblies as possible.  This can be accomplished best, of 
course, by "scattering" from the larger communities, and in settling in 
new areas.  
     The beloved Guardian was greatly encouraged to learn through a letter 
from Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell addressed to me, that at the Alaska State 
Convention on December 6th, a fund was started for the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds.  
The Guardian attaches great importance to the development of the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds even before there are prospects for the establishment of 
the National Assembly.  The Guardian is arranging for a gift to this fund 
of $500 as his personal contribution.  It will be sent you by the Treasurer 
of the American N.S.A.  He hopes this will stimulate the friends to 
contribute to this important fund, as time goes on.  
     The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to all the friends in 
Alaska.  
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

                                                           (17) April 23, 1954 
Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of April 6th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and 
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
 
+P20 
     In regard to the matters you raised in it, he feels that the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds should be inside the city limits.  Ten miles from the town 
is too far out to be practical.+E5 
     The first thing is to acquire, if possible, either a building site or a 
building; but pending the possibility of doing this, which no doubt will 
involve considerable expenditure, he advises you to go on augmenting the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds Fund.  
     He would like you to please forward him a list of all the places where 
there are &amp;Baha'is throughout Alaskan territory, specifying whether it is an 
Assembly, a Group or an isolated Centre.  
     Although he attaches great importance to the opening of new Centres 
throughout any territory, including, of course, Alaska, he wishes you to 
give special attention to sending a pioneer to Point Barrow, beyond the 
Arctic Circle.  He feels that there is a great significance in having believers 
serving so far north; and he hopes that one of the friends will be able to 
secure some employment there and proceed to act as a pioneer in this 
highly meritorious field.  
     All the news that you gave him was good news, and he appreciated it 
deeply.  
     You may be sure that his loving prayers will surround you and all the 
friends, as they labour to carry the Faith throughout Alaskan territory, 
and to hasten the day when it will have its own independent National 
Spiritual Assembly.  
                                    With &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved bless your efforts, guide your steps, and enable you to 
win great victories in the service of His Faith.

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is 
     of the Anchorage Recording District 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of January 19th, written on behalf of the Spiritual Assembly 
of the Anchorage Recording District, has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to send you this note in reply.  
 
+P21 
     He was indeed happy to hear that the Anchorage Recording District 
Assembly is now incorporated, thus broadening still further the foundations 
of the Administrative Order of the Faith.  
     He would appreciate receiving a copy of your Certificate of Incorporation, 
to be added to the many now on display in the Mansion of &amp;Bahji.  
     The devoted services of the dear friends there are deeply appreciated, 
and he sends his loving greetings to you all.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    R. Rabbani

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of June 25, 1954, with enclosure, has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was indeed happy to learn that, through the dispersal of the friends 
in Anchorage to three other cities, the goal set by the Alaska Teaching 
Committee for the last year was achieved.  This is indeed most encouraging 
news.  
     The rapid expansion of the Faith in Alaska has delighted the heart of 
the Guardian.  The way the believers have scattered in order to create new 
Centers, shows their great devotion and courage.  
     He is now looking forward to the time when the friends there will have 
their own &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds.  
     Please convey the loving greetings of the Guardian to all the Alaska 
&amp;Baha'is; and assure them of his deep appreciation of their sacrificial 
services, and their determination to broaden the basis of their Faith in that 
country.  All these efforts will hasten the day when Alaska will have its 
own National Spiritual Assembly.  
     His prayers are ever with the friends as they pursue their noble task.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of the 
     Anchorage Recording District 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of April 6th with enclosures has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     The contribution you enclosed from the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage Recording 
District is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed herewith.  
     The Guardian greatly appreciated receiving the incorporation papers 
from the Anchorage District Assembly.  He feels the incorporation of this 
Assembly an historical event.  He likewise appreciates the map which you 
sent showing the area involved in the recording district, as well as the 
location of the &amp;Baha'i property.  So far as the use of the land is concerned, 
this is something which will have to be determined as time goes on, and 
particularly when Alaska establishes their National Assembly.  
     The Guardian sincerely hopes all the friends in Alaska will redouble 
their teaching efforts, so that the Faith may become firmly established.  
The work of the Alaska &amp;Baha'is has so encouraged the Guardian that he 
has announced the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly for 
Alaska in 1957.  It is evident that intensive teaching work must be done 
between now and that date, so that there will be a sufficient number of 
Assemblies and a wide enough basis of the Faith throughout Alaska to 
build up a proper foundation for this crowning institution.  
     The challenge has now come to the Alaska &amp;Baha'is.  We all hope and 
pray they will be assisted in their strenuous efforts.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf.  He sends you 
his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

Northern Peoples Teaching Committee 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of May 2nd with enclosures has been received by the 
 
+P23 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He appreciates receiving the pamphlet and the photograph which you 
sent him.  
     He considers it would be a great service to the Faith if you can arrange 
to have some of the literature translated into other of the more widely used 
dialects, and especially Aleut.  He also approves of your following the 
idea of the book published in English entitled:  "A &amp;Baha'i Child's Song 
Book," where you feel that is desirable.  
     The Guardian greatly values the services of your Committee in their 
devoted efforts to bring the Faith to the native people of Alaska, and 
assures you of his prayers for the abundant success of your labours.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letters of July 15 and 23, with enclosures, have been received by 
the beloved Guardian; and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He regrets the delay in receiving your letter of the 15th, as it prevented 
his sending a cabled message on the occasion of the dedication of the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds of Alaska.  
     He rejoices over this important step forward on the way to the formation 
of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska.  He 
considers the progress of the Faith in Alaska remarkable.  
     The Guardian urges the friends to exert even greater efforts, especially 
in the teaching and enrollment of the Eskimos.  
     He remembers all the dear friends in Alaska in his loving prayers.  
                                    With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved guide, aid and protect you in your high and historic 
 
+P24

Teaching Committee for Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of August 17th, with the 
sheet enclosed showing the names of those who attended the first All 
Alaskan Summer Teaching Conference.  
     The progress of the work in Alaska is very gratifying to him.  
     He would like your Committee to assure those who attended this 
Teaching Conference of his prayers for the success of their labours.  
     It is the Guardian's deep hope that, in countries where the friends may 
teach freely, a mighty, sustained teaching effort may be exerted.  If the 
Faith progresses rapidly in such countries, this will in a measure compensate 
for the setback it has suffered in Persia, because of the recent terrible 
persecutions.  
     He attaches great importance to Alaska; and he hopes the friends there 
will rise to great heights, in the days to come, in their teaching activities.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved bless your efforts, guide your steps, and aid you to 
promote, at all times, the vital interests of His Faith.  
                                    Your true brother,

     Alaska State Convention.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter, signed by all those who 
were present at the Convention on December 4th; and this is just a note on 
his behalf to urge you all to redouble your teaching efforts, so that Alaska

     of the Anchorage Recording District.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of January 9th has been received by the Beloved 
Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  The 
contribution which you have sent to the International Fund is greatly 
appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed herein.  
 
+P26 
     The Hosts of the Supreme Concourse are in marshall array, poised 
between Earth and Heaven ready to rush to the assistance of those who 
arise to Teach the Faith.  If one seeks the confirmation of the Holy Spirit, 
they can find it in rich abundance in the Teaching Field.  The world is 
seeking as never before, and if the Friends will arise with new determination, 
fully consecrated to the noble task ahead of them victory after 
victory will be won for the Glorious Faith of God.  
     The Guardian will pray for the quickening of the teaching work in 
Alaska.  A great upward surge is essential in that great country, as it is 
soon to have its own National Assembly.  May the Friends arise with 
resolve, dedication and consecration.  Then surely great results will be 
achieved.  The Guardian sends you his loving Greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

The &amp;Baha'i Community of Ketchikan, Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of April 24th has been received, and the beloved Guardian 
was delighted over the formation of your Assembly.  
     He compliments Mrs. Roberts on her youthful spirit, which has enabled 
her at her age to recognize this glorious Faith, and arise to serve it.+E6  
She must truly be an inspiration to other Alaskan &amp;Baha'is; and he was 
truly happy to know that your Community is distinguished by having the 
first Indian Alaskan+E7 as one of its members.  You seem to have made a 
"scoop"!  
     You may be sure he will pray for your progress and the unfoldment of 
the work there, in the holy Shrines.  He sends you all his loving greetings.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

     Your loving letter of April 23rd was received by the Beloved Guardian, 
 
+P27 
and he has directed me to respond to it on his behalf.  The contribution 
which you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated.  
Receipt is enclosed herein.  
     The spirit of the time is the teaching of the Faith in new areas, 
particularly on the home front.  The Guardian sincerely hopes you will be 
most active in this field, so that many seeking the light of divine guidance 
in your area, may be led to the Fountain of Immortality.  
     The Keynote of success in the teaching field is study of the Word, 
Prayer, Meditation; and then action.  Above all, perseverance in action.  
When these steps are followed in the realm of self-sacrifice, success will 
be achieved.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf.  He sends his 
loving greetings.

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Ketchikan 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of May 15th, and has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     The news you conveyed of the enrollment of Miss Campbell+E8 was most 
welcome.  The Guardian is very proud to have these Indian &amp;Baha'is in the 
Faith, and hopes that they will make every effort to carry the Message of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to their people, remembering always the promises of the 
beloved Master of how great the Indians would become when the illumination 
of this Revelation reached them.  
     The Guardian is happy to see that the Assembly there is functioning so 
well and achieving so much in the teaching field.  He will pray for you all.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your loving letter of June 8th, on behalf of the Spiritual Assembly of 
 
+P28 
the &amp;Baha'is of Ketchikan, Alaska, came duly to hand; and the beloved 
Guardian directed me to respond to it on his behalf.  The contribution to 
the International Fund is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed 
herewith.  
     The Guardian is very appreciative of the excellent work being done by 
the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska in preparing for their National Assembly.  The 
pioneering services are highly meritorious, and will be richly blessed by 
the ever watchful Master.  The friends should redouble their efforts during 
the short remaining period, so there may be many more &amp;Baha'is in that 
important area, when the National Assembly is formed.  
     The Guardian assures you, each and every one, of his prayers in your 
behalf.  He sends his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Anchorage 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of June 27th has been received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     You must feel proud of the achievements in Anchorage, and in Alaska 
generally.  He himself is very happy over, and proud of, the work 
accomplished there, particularly in recent years.  
     You should not worry about attacks on the Faith, as these in the end 
cannot but result in the further growth of the Faith.  You should face the 
coming formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska with joy 
and confidence, as it will rest on a firm and promising foundation.  
     He will remember all the members of the Spiritual Assembly in his 
prayers, that their labours in the Cause of God may be richly blessed.  He 
also assures you of his prayers.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

     The contribution which you have made to the International Fund is

Teaching Committee for Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of August 8th, enclosing a list of the &amp;Baha'is who attended 
the Fairbanks Conference conducted by the Alaska Teaching Committee, 
as well as a program of the Conference, has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was especially pleased to see that a number of different localities 
were represented at this gathering.  
     He hopes the spirit generated there will strengthen the believers in the 
different areas and encourage them to carry forward the work with even 
greater energy than before.  There is much to be done before the rapidly 
approaching historic election of their own National Spiritual Assembly.  
The Guardian feels the members of the Teaching Committee and all the 
friends are very conscious of this fact, and urges them to leave no stone 
unturned to gain new believers, and also to do all in their power to assist in 
the further consolidation of the Faith throughout that important land.  
     He appreciates the devoted efforts of each one of the friends, and 
assures them all of his prayers.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly 
appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     The beloved Guardian is hopeful the friends will arise, each and every

Everywhere the goals of the Ten Year Crusade are being won, with

+P31

many seeking souls to the Faith.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Will you please deliver to the Convenor of the Alaska &amp;Baha'i Convention 
the enclosed envelope containing the Guardian's Message to the 
friends and which is to be read to them at Convention.  
     To gain time this is being sent thru Rome and mailed by a Pilgrim.

                                    R. Rabbani 
P.S.--The Guardian requests that you acknowledge receipt of this communication

To:  Delegates and Visitors assembled at the 
     Convention of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
     I welcome, with joy, pride and thankfulness, the convocation, on the 
northern fringes of the Western Hemisphere, and in a region that must 
needs play a prominent part in the shaping of the destinies of mankind, of 
the first Alaskan &amp;Baha'i Convention.  So auspicious an event constitutes 
an important milestone in the progressive unfoldment of the &amp;Baha'i 
World Spiritual Crusade, and represents the fruition of the valiant efforts 
exerted, in the course of several decades, by the American &amp;Baha'i 
Community, which has striven so steadfastly to ensure the emergence of 
independent &amp;Baha'i Communities in that hemisphere.  
 
+P32 
     So great a triumph, crowning so much patient and painstaking labour, 
won at the hour when the &amp;Baha'i World Spiritual Crusade is entering the 
second year of the third phase in its irresistible unfoldment, must be 
celebrated through the initiation of a subsidiary Six-Year Plan on the part 
of the newly-formed Alaskan National Spiritual Assembly, for the purpose 
of speedily increasing the number of the followers of the Faith; of 
multiplying its Centres; of adding to its existing Local Spiritual Assemblies; 
of inaugurating a National &amp;Baha'i Fund; of establishing a Summer 
School; of initiating local &amp;Baha'i endowments; of incorporating the 
newly-emerged National Spiritual Assembly as well as all firmly 
grounded local spiritual assemblies; of obtaining recognition for the 
&amp;Baha'i Marriage Certificate, as well as the Holy Days on which work is 
forbidden; of stimulating the conversion of both the Eskimos and American 
Indians, and of purchasing a plot of land to serve as the site for the 
future &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of Alaska.  
     I appeal to the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly 
to persevere in their highly laudable endeavours on behalf of a Community 
so small yet so valiant and promising, and to ensure by every means in 
their power the steady development and consolidation of the institutions 
of an Order to whose rise and establishment they have so conspicuously 
contributed.  
     May the process now set in motion gather momentum in the years lying 
ahead, through a liberal effusion of the grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and may 
those whose privilege it is to stimulate its development, be guided in every 
step they take, and fulfill every desire they cherish for its ultimate 
consummation.

To the National Spiritual Assembly 
     of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of May 5th has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  
     The contribution made by your new Assembly to the International 
Fund is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     It is fitting that one of your first actions should be the dispatch of 
this remittance, as it links your new spiritual body directly with the work 
being done at the World Center of the Faith.  
 
+P33 
     The Guardian is well pleased with the diligent services of all the Alaska 
friends, reaching the present goal of a National Assembly.  May the 
friends now arise with renewed vigor, and with the new spirit released, 
win many more souls to the Faith.  More &amp;Baha'is, more Centres, more 
Assemblies is the dominating spirit of service for the friends during the 
remainder of the Ten Year Crusade.  
     The Guardian will pray for you, and for the success of your labours for 
the Cause of God.  
     He sends his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

The National Spiritual Assembly 
     of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on his behalf and 
inform you that the Hand of the Cause, Mr. Varga, will shortly be 
forwarding to your assembly the equivalent of five hundred English 
Pounds, as the Guardian's contribution to your newly established National 
Fund.  
     He hopes that, in the formulation of your plans, particular attention 
will be given to the all-important teaching work, the foundation of all the 
activities of the Faith and the most urgent task facing the friends in this 
critical period the world is passing through.  
     You may be sure he will pray for your success.  
                                    With &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani

The National Spiritual Assembly 
     of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has instructed me to write your Assembly in 
connection with the important goal of your six year plan, of purchasing or 
acquiring the site for the future &amp;Baha'i Temple in Alaska.  
 
+P34 
     No publicity of any type should be given this matter at this time, but the 
Committee should proceed with its work quietly and wisely.  They should 
simply try to purchase a piece of land, without indicating its purpose.  No 
contact should be had with the Government.  
     If your Assembly is not incorporated, or your local Assembly, then the 
land can be registered in the name of individuals appointed by the 
National Assembly.  
     Before actual purchase is made, the Guardian would appreciate advice 
as to the location, size of land, cost, etc.  This you can send to him through 
me.  
                                    With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    I am, 
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

The Local Spiritual Assembly                                
of the &amp;Baha'is of Ketchikan 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of May 15th was received by the Beloved Guardian 
and he has directed me to acknowledge it in his behalf.  
     The contribution made by the friends in Ketchikan to the International 
Fund is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     The establishment of the new National Spiritual Assembly in Alaska 
must be a source of great gratification to those of you who have labored so 
long and diligently in the establishment of the Faith in that very important 
country.  This great blessing likewise carries with it many serious 
responsibilities.  The greatest responsibility today is the diffusion of the 
Divine Fragrances and the establishment of the Faith far and wide.  The 
Guardian hopes therefore that the Members of your Assembly will arise with 
renewed vigor and not only spread the Faith more firmly in Ketchikan, 
but will spread your energies to surrounding areas so that new lights of 
Divine Guidance may be established in the various centers.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf.  He sends you 
his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
 
+P35 
                                                            (42) June 30, 1957 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer the letters received, 
with enclosure, from the Assembly's Recording Secretary and from the 
Secretary, and dated as follows:  May 4, 7, 29 and June 11.  
     He is very happy to see the eagerness with which this new historic 
Body has embarked upon its tasks, and he wishes you to know that he is 
particularly pleased with the Alaska Community.  He admires the lively 
spirit animating it and which indeed has animated it for years--the spirit 
of optimism and joyous service, and its determination and courage.  He 
has recently heard many fine things about the friends there and the work 
they are doing from Mrs. Florence Mayberry, all of which have encouraged 
him to cherish the very highest hopes for the future of the work in 
that vast territory.  
     He hopes your Assembly will devote special, constant attention to 
encouraging the friends in their teaching work, and facilitate their tasks.  
As the new National Assemblies are being formed, he feels it incumbent 
upon him to issue a word of warning to avoid rules and regulations and 
tying the believers' work up in red tape.  Over-administration can be even 
worse for the Faith at this time than under-administration.  The believers 
are, for the most part, young in the Cause, and if they make mistakes it is 
not half as important as if their spirit is crushed by being told all the 
time--do this and don't do that!  The new National Body should be like a 
loving parent, watching over and helping its children, and not like a stern 
judge, waiting for an opportunity to display his judicial powers.  The 
reason he points this out to you is that constantly, for the past twenty years 
and more, he has been pointing this out to the old and tried National 
Assemblies, and he does not want the younger bodies to make the same 
mistakes.  Individual cases should be dealt with as they arise, according to 
the Teachings, of which the believers have quite sufficient available to 
handle all of their problems at this time, and no more additional rules and 
regulations need be introduced.  
     The friends should be helped to overcome their problems, deepen in 
the Faith, and increase their unity and their love for each other.  In this 
way you will find that your work goes ahead speedily, and that the 
National Body is like the beating of a healthy heart in the midst of the 
Community, pumping spiritual love, energy and encouragement out to all 
the members.  
 
+P36 
     As regards the question you asked about a Summer School, there is no 
reason why a property should either be rented or bought for this purpose.  
You can arrange to hold a Summer School in any suitable place where the 
friends can find accommodation, and a hall can be rented for its sessions.  
This is what they have done in England for many years to great advantage.  
It is a simple and economical way of holding the School.  The primary 
purpose of the School is to deepen the knowledge of the friends in the 
Teachings, to enable them to consort, as &amp;Baha'is, with each other, and to 
confirm any contacts who may have attended.  The School may be held
during the winter season or any other time of the year.  
     As regards local endowments, these can be a piece of land, or a 
building offered or purchased in any place in Alaska.  However, as the 
friends have six years in which to accomplish their Plan, and the most 
important work of all is the teaching work, he would not advise that they 
begin by spending their money on these projects, unless somebody has a 
piece of land or a building which they wish to give.  The site for the 
Temple is much more important.  It should be near the capital of Alaska 
within easy distance, or preferably in it, so that the friends can gather 
there, when the Temple is built for their services.  If the twenty-acre 
National Endowment is suitably close to the city, it can be used as the 
Temple site, and another piece of land, smaller in area, and anywhere in 
Alaska, be acquired as the National Endowment.  
     He is delighted to see that you are approaching your tasks with so much 
enthusiasm, and awaits news of wonderful victories from that promising 
northern territory.  
     He feels your Assembly should bear in mind, and call to the attention 
of the friends, the importance of the Iron Curtain territories not yet open.  
Whoever feels the urge to dedicate themselves to arising and going to one 
of the satellites or republics of the Soviet Union, should be encouraged to 
do so.  
     He hopes to receive much good news during the coming months of the 
progress of the work there, and assures you all of his prayers for your 
success.  
                                    With loving greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of 
Alaska signalizes the erection of yet another pillar designed to support, 
and reinforce the foundation of the future Universal House of Justice, 
 
+P37 
and marks a milestone of far reaching significance in the history of the 
evolution of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the North American continent.  I 
rejoice at this remarkable evidence of the vitality of the Faith which 
animates the members of the small yet highly promising community of His 
followers in that far off northern region of the globe, a region destined to 
play an important role in shaping the spiritual destinies of the great 
Republic of the west of which it forms a part, and to contribute, in no 
small measure, to the establishment of the institutions of His World Order 
throughout the American continent.  
     The task now facing this highly promising, spiritually dynamic community, 
at the hour of its emergence as an independent member of the 
embryonic World &amp;Baha'i Commonwealth, is truly formidable; the responsibilities 
which it valiantly shoulders, at this crucial hour in its 
evolution are sacred, heavy, manifold and inescapable.  The tests and 
trials which it must, sooner or later, experience in the course of its 
unfoldment and consolidation will severely challenge its spirit and resources.  
The path which it must tread ere the full evidence of its latent 
capacities are manifested will be long, tortuous and stony.  The indomitable 
faith which now so powerfully animates its members, however, will, 
beyond the shadow of a doubt, enable them to overcome whatever 
obstacles may confront them in the future, and ensure the ultimate 
attainment of their high destiny.  
     The Six Year Plan, to which this community is now committed, and 
which should be regarded as the chief and immediate instrument designed 
to ensure the triumphant conclusion of the initial stage in the 
unfoldment of its destiny, must be energetically prosecuted however 
great the sacrifices involved, and must receive the concentrated, the 
continuous and prayerful consideration of its national elected representatives. 
All must participate in furthering its interests and in ensuring its 
ultimate and complete success.  
     Every effort must be exerted to increase steadily the number of avowed 
adherents of the Faith in that Territory, to multiply its centres, to 
consolidate its local Assemblies, to incorporate the firmly grounded 
amongst them.  
     The establishment of &amp;Baha'i endowments and of a summer-school, and 
the incorporation of the National Spiritual Assembly itself, must be 
simultaneously and efficiently carried out.  Steps must likewise be taken to 
obtain recognition of the &amp;Baha'i Marriage Certificate and of the &amp;Baha'i 
Holy Days from the civil authorities concerned.  Nor must the vital 
 
+P38 
obligation of converting as speedily as possible, both the Eskimos and the 
American Indians, who, as time passes, must assume a notable share in 
the diffusion of the Faith and the establishment of its rising Order in these 
regions, be, under any circumstances neglected; and last but not least, 
the selection and purchase of a site for the Mother Temple of Alaska, in 
the city of Anchorage or its suburbs, must be carefully considered and 
suitable action taken at the earliest opportunity.  
     The endeavours which the highminded, youthful hearted, deeply consecrated 
members of this community will exert must be such as to excite 
the unqualified admiration of their fellow believers in &amp;Baha'i communities 
in both Hemispheres.  The sacrifices which must be made will, 
no doubt, if they rise to this occasion, merit the applause of the Concourse 
on high and draw forth a still fuller measure of the promised 
blessings of the Author of the Divine Plan Himself.  
     That the members of this community may neither falter nor fail, that 
they may set an example worthy of emulation of their fellow-workers in 
all continents of the globe, that they may achieve such feats, in the course 
of the attainment of their high objectives, as shall eclipse the past 
achievements of their spiritual brethren in the North American continent 
and throughout Latin America, is the object of my constant prayer for 
them in the Holy Shrines as well as my heart's most cherished desire.

The Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Ketchikan 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of June 7th was duly received by the beloved 
Guardian and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  The 
contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly 
appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     The Spirit of confirmation is descending in torrents on all those who 
arise to teach in a devoted and consecrated manner.  Never before have so 
many victories been won in the teaching field as are being won all over the 
&amp;Baha'i world at this time.  
     Alaska has developed very remarkably in the past years.  With the 
establishment of the new National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska in 
&amp;Ridvan of this year, the Guardian is hopeful that the friends will arise with 
 
+P39 
renewed effort and spread the Faith far and wide.  A new spirit has been 
released due to the establishment of the National Assembly and the 
friends should seize their opportunity while they still have the chance and 
win many souls to the Faith.  
     The Guardian will pray for you and for the success of your work.  He 
sends his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is 
     of the Anchorage Recording District 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of May 29th has been received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He is very happy to learn that your Assembly now has an endowment of 
its own.  This will give the Faith a greater prestige and standing there.  The 
spiritual vitality shown by the friends in Alaska pleases him greatly.  
     Please express his appreciation of their gift to the Faith to the donors 
of this tract of land.+E10 
     He assures you of his prayers for you all, and for the rapid progress of 
the work in that region, and throughout Alaska.

     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of June 15th, in which 
you quoted the cablegram sent by your Assembly to &amp;Iran; and has

instructed me to acknowledge it on his behalf, and to tell you he greatly

First Annual Convention of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of June 11th together with enclosures has been received by 
the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  He appreciates having the Minutes of this Convention.  
     The Guardian has high hopes for the rapid progress of the Faith in 
Alaska, and feels confident that, as the believers arise to shoulder their 
new responsibilities, adequate strength and guidance will be given them 
to accomplish the tasks set before them.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of July 6th was received by the beloved Guardian and 
he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  
     The contribution made by your National Assembly to the International 
Fund is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     The Guardian feels that it is proper for your Assembly to make a 
contribution to the International Fund because it links more closely the 
activities of the National Assembly with the World Center of the Faith 
and through you all the &amp;Baha'is in Alaska.  
     Alaska has won many great victories for the Faith in the past, but the 
Guardian feels sure now that the National Assembly has been established, 
the victories to be won in the future will be far more glorious and
far more effective for the spread of the Faith.  
 
+P41 
     He will pray for you and for the success of your work.  He sends each 
and every one his loving greetings.

National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you that he was very 
happy to note from your recent letter the practical way the National 
Assembly has gone about settling their goals for this year, and will pray 
for their success.  
     He deeply appreciates the gift Mrs. Huffman and her husband have 
made of the Temple site for Alaska.  This fulfills one of Alaska's important 
goals--only a few months after the birth of the new National 
Spiritual Assembly.

The Local Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Ketchikan 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of July 15th was duly received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  The 
contribution you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated.  
Receipt is enclosed herewith.  
     The Divine Confirmations are descending in torrents on those who 
arise to teach.  At this critical time in the history of the Faith, teaching is 
the one &amp;Baha'i service that is Confirmed.  
     The Guardian hopes that you will therefore arise with renewed effort to 
take your part in this great crusade now sweeping the world.  America has 
been called upon by the Master to play the preponderating role in this 
great World Crusade which is moving forward with increasing momentum.  
Thus more &amp;Baha'is must be confirmed in the United States, that 
America may achieve its Spiritual Destiny.  
     The Guardian will pray for you and for the success of your teaching 
work.  He sends you his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

all times the vital interests of His glorious Faith.

&amp;Baha'i Community of Ketchikan, Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of August 15th was received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  The 
contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly 
appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     Spiritual success can be won today, only by teaching the Faith of God.  
The people are seeking, dying from spiritual thirst.  The &amp;Baha'is must 
disseminate the Water of Life freely, so seeking souls may find eternal 
life.  
     If the friends arise with consecration, devotion, and zeal--so the Holy 
Spirit may descend through them, to those who are wandering the deserts 
of material chaos--they will be surprised at the victories which will be 
won.  
     The Guardian hopes you will take a most active part in this quickening 
of mankind.  May the blessings of the Holy Spirit, and its confirming 
power be with you at all times.  
     The Guardian will pray for you, and for the success of your work.  He 
sends his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is very anxious to secure information as to the 
Indian tribes (native), which have been contacted by any of the believers 
in your area; or of course if there are any believers from these Tribes, that 
would be even more interesting.  
     Can you prepare a list showing the number of Tribes that have been 
contacted, and of these Tribes, the number who have become believers.  
This would be very interesting information.  
     Can you secure it at an early date and send it on to me for the beloved 
Guardian.  
                                    With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    I am, 
                                    Faithfully yours,

Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Fairbanks 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of July 28th with enclosures has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He greatly appreciates your prompt action in sending the cable to &amp;Iran.  
     The believers in Fairbanks are all remembered by him, and he prays for 
the success of the teaching efforts of each one.  
     He also wishes to assure Kathryn and Marzieh Alio of his prayers for 
the recovery of Mrs. Volz.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of October 4th and subsequent cablegram of October 
 
+P44 
12th have been duly received and its contents presented to the beloved 
Guardian.  
     He was pleased to learn the manner in which your Assembly and the 
&amp;Baha'is are undertaking this all-important task of teaching the Indians, 
the Eskimos and to the extent possible, the Aleuts.  
     The Master has promised that very great results would be achieved 
when these people are given the inspiration and guidance of the Holy 
Spirit, and therefore he hopes the friends will be able to bring it to them in 
increasing force and in increasing numbers.  
     The Guardian will pray for you and for the success of your work.  
                                    Faithfully yours,

National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of October 1st was duly received by the beloved 
Guardian and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  
     The contribution which has been sent by your Assembly to the International 
Fund is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     The Guardian is happy that the friends in Alaska are arising with such 
vigor and enthusiasm to serve the Cause of God.  They have won outstanding 
and historic victories for the Faith, but the thing that pleases him most 
is that each victory that is won has been used as a stepping stone to further 
service in the Cause of God.  Thus the Cause is expanding very rapidly 
both in the teaching and administrative fields.  He hopes that your Assembly 
will be guided and confirmed in the noble undertakings in which you 
are engaged.  But he likewise hopes that you will be able to stimulate all 
the friends to intensive effort so that many seeking souls may find eternal 
life at this particular time and that the Institutions of the Faith may be 
firmly established in that promising Country.  He will pray for you and for 
the success of your work.  
     He sends you his loving greetings.  
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

Letters to Individuals, 1946-1957.  These letters were addressed 
to many individuals who continued to write directly 
to the Holy Land after the formation of the institutions.  The 
tone of the letters reflects personal interests rather than 
institutional development.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter dated July 17th has been received, and the beloved Guardian 
has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     He was very pleased to hear the Alaskan believers are so active, and 
that you have witnessed with your own eyes such a wonderful development 
of the Faith there these last few years, since you went there as a 
pioneer.  
     He was also delighted to hear Mr. Oliver is anxious to translate some of 
the Writings into Eskimo; please assure him this would be rendering both 
the Eskimos and the Cause a great service.  If anything is printed in that 
language the Guardian would like to receive copies for the libraries here.  
     He hopes through the "Arctic Trails Shopping Service" you will be 
able to demonstrate the fairness, uprightness, and nobility of the adherents 
of the &amp;Baha'i Faith to the people it deals with, as this will more than 
anything else attract their attention to the Faith.  
     As to your own plans:  if you are absolutely certain that your departure 
from Alaska will not in any way affect the stability of the Cause there, he 
approves of your suggestion that you go to Europe and assist the work 
there.  If, on your way, you could visit and do some teaching in England it 
would help the British &amp;Baha'is very much, as they are embarking on a 
very heavy teaching schedule.  He will pray that your family there may 
become attracted to the Faith.  
     Assuring you of his deep appreciation of your wonderful services and 
his loving prayers.  
                                    Yours in the Faith, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
P.S.--If Mr. Oliver would begin by translating even a small pamphlet 
into Eskimo at once this would be a much appreciated service.  Please 
send him some printed copies as soon as available.  Please assure this 
dear friend that his service is highly meritorious.  
 
+P48 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Assuring you of my deepfelt and abiding gratitude for the splendid and 
historic services you have rendered our beloved Faith and of my constant 
prayers for the extension of your valued activities, and the realization of 
every hope you cherish for the advancement of its institutions, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of January 9th has been received and our beloved Guardian 
has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     He very much appreciated your desire to once again answer the call for 
pioneers and go to Europe, and in principle he approves of your doing so.  
However, Miss Kempton+E12 has already left Alaska, and you say Miss 
Dole+E13 is contemplating doing so, and he is very concerned lest the work 
in Alaska suffer and the number of resident believers in Anchorage fall to 
below Assembly status.  Alaska is one of the prizes of the first Seven Year 
Plan, and must be guarded at all costs.  If you find in the future, after 
consultation with the National Teaching Committee, that you can be 
safely spared from the work there, he approves of your going to Europe.  
     He cannot suggest to you what form of employment would be best for 
you, but he will pray that you may be guided in this matter, and that your 
&amp;Baha'i services be richly blessed.  
                                    With loving greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I deeply appreciate the spirit that so powerfully animates you in the 
service of our beloved Faith.  You are a great asset to the Cause you serve 
so devotedly.  I will pray for the extension and consolidation of your 
service from the depths of my heart.  Persevere in your historic task, rest 
assured, and be happy.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter, dated May 7th, has been received by our beloved Guardian, 
and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
 
+P49 
     He was very pleased to see with what determination and dedication you 
are serving the Cause in Alaska.  Now that two pioneers have gone forth 
from there, your labour is all the more important, and he certainly hopes 
that, through the medium of the Arctic Trails Shopping Service, the 
public meetings being held weekly, and the devoted labours of all the dear 
friends there, the Faith will rapidly reach and enlighten many new souls.  
     There is such a confusion in the world today, so much uncertainty, so 
much materialism, that it is very hard to hold the attention of even the 
more spiritually minded people.  But we must persevere and do our best 
knowing this is our duty and that conditions will eventually change 
completely and follow &amp;Baha'u'llah's Pattern.  
     Please give his love to the Anchorage friends.  You may be sure he will 
pray for you all, and for the success of your work, in the Holy Shrines.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love,

steady extension of your valued activities, for the consolidation of the 
historic work already achieved, and the realization of every hope you 
cherish for the promotion of our beloved Faith, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian dated October 31st has been 
received, and, in spite of the fact that he is terribly busy, he has instructed 
me to answer you on his behalf because he would not like in any way to 
ever hurt the feelings of one of the friends.  However, he suggests in the 
future you refer such questions to the N.S.A. and ask them to put you in 
touch with a &amp;Baha'i teacher who can correspond with you.  He himself 
cannot do this kind of work, because he is so overworked with the more 
urgent administrative affairs of the Faith.  
     To answer you briefly what the original state of the universe was no one 
as yet knows.  But we believe God is a spiritual Being and did create it; 
how we do not know.  We will have experience of God's spirit through His 
Prophets in the next world, but God is too great for us to know without 
this Intermediary.  The Prophets know God, but how is more than our 
human minds can grasp.  We believe we attain in the next world to seeing 
 
+P50 
the Prophets.  There is certainly a future life.  Heaven and hell are 
conditions within our own beings.  
     He urges you to study carefully the &amp;Baha'i books, and he will pray for 
your advancement and the success of your &amp;Baha'i activities.  
                                    With loving greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved bless your efforts, guide and sustain you in your 
meritorious activities, in such a distant field, and enable you to win great 
and memorable victories in the teaching field.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your most interesting gift has been received, through the kindness of 
Leroy Ioas, and it is deeply appreciated.  I thank you for the thought as 
well as the gift.  
     These are busy days in Haifa with the many pilgrims who are coming 
and going.  The news of the rapid growth of the Faith in various lands is 
very inspiring, and the pilgrims leave the Holy Land for their posts with a 
new determination to play nobly their parts.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    &amp;Ruhiyyih 
P.S. I should also say the beloved Guardian appreciated very much the 
Eskimo things.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of August 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     As the Guardian is very busy indeed these days, the answer will be 
brief.  Your plan to return to Alaska makes him very happy indeed.  He 
attaches the greatest importance to Alaska, and it will become increasingly 
important in the future.  Therefore, he urges you by all means to 
return to that land, and there lend your valuable assistance in the service 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P51 
     The Guardian assures you your dedication and service to the Faith are 
very deeply appreciated.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved reward you bountifully for your splendid labours, guide 
and sustain you always, and enable you to win great and memorable 
victories in the days to come.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of February 14th has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  
     The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the &amp;Bab is very 
greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed herewith.  
     The work on the dome of the Shrine is going forward quite satisfactorily.  
The brim of the dome has been finished.  As additional units of the 
building are completed, it adds to the stateliness of the entire structure, 
and permits one to realize how beautiful it is going to be.  
     The Guardian very deeply appreciates the wonderful work you are 
doing in connection with the spread of the Faith.  
     The Eskimo booklet which you submitted for his approval he feels 
should be submitted to the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of 
the United States for their review.  The reason for this is that they are 
closely in touch with the teaching work, and therefore well qualified to 
decide just what should and what should not be included in such a 
pamphlet.  
     He hopes you and Frances Wells will work very closely with the
National Spiritual Assembly in connection with this important service.  
     The Guardian is extremely anxious that the Eskimos be brought into 
the Faith.  He values very highly indeed the very wonderful services 
rendered by Mrs. Wells.  He feels that she has sacrificed very deeply in 
order to carry the light of guidance to the seeking peoples of the world, 
particularly in Alaska, and now with the Eskimos.  You may be sure the 
Guardian will pray for her spiritual success and her spiritual happiness.  
     The Guardian will likewise be very happy to pray for Mrs. Hadley 
 
+P52 
Ferguson of Fairbanks, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Greene, Mr. and Mrs. L.E. 
Pirkey, Mrs. Perry Bane, and Dr. Saul Mackoff.  
     The Guardian has communicated with the National Spiritual Assembly 
with regard to the efforts being made by yourself and Mrs. Wells as well 
as others in connection with the introduction of the Faith amongst the 
Eskimos, asking them to render every possible assistance to this most 
important work.  It is impossible to let you know how important the 
Guardian feels the introduction of the Faith amongst the Eskimos is at this 
particular time.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

Spiritual Assembly.

All Pioneers:  
Dearly Beloved Friends, 
     The beloved Guardian sends you his loving greetings, and he assures 
you of his prayers in your behalf.  
     You will be most happy to know that at this time there is only one 
country, Chagos Archipelago, which has not been assigned to a settler, 
outside of the countries which are under Iron Curtain influence.  More 
pioneers are arriving at their posts daily, so that at the present time, 71 of 
the new countries of the Crusade have been opened to the Faith.  
     You are now the representative of the Faith in your area, and the 
beloved Guardian feels assured that you will arise to the great opportunity 
that has come to you, to become the one to quicken the souls in your 
virgin territory and become the spiritual conqueror of that new land.  The 
Guardian realizes you will have many problems and difficulties, but he 
urges you to persevere under all circumstances; not to become disheartened 
in any way, but relying solely upon &amp;Baha'u'llah and His quickening 
Spirit, arise at once to carry forward the teaching work.  
     The Guardian makes the following suggestions with regard to teaching 
in virgin areas, at this critical time:  
     1.  No publicity should be secured.  
     2.  No articles should be placed in newspapers or magazines.  
     3.  Do not contact Authorities or Political Leaders.  
 
+P53 
     4.  Do not discuss Government policies in any way.  
     5.  No effort should be made toward a public proclamation of the Faith.  
     6.  Proceed with great caution.  
     7.  Be very wise in the manner in which the Teachings of the Faith are 
         presented.  
     8.  Make friends, and when these friends gain confidence in you and 
         you in them, gradually confirm them in the Faith.  
     9.  What is needed is a complete reliance upon &amp;Baha'u'llah; pure 
         consecration to the Faith, and then energetic but wise presentation 
         of the Divine teachings.  Such selfless sacrificial devotion will 
         attract the divine confirmations, and gradually you will confirm 
         souls who will join you as strong supporters of the Faith in your 
         area.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of October 9th was duly received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  
     He very deeply appreciates the contribution which you have made in 
behalf of the Eskimos of Alaska.  Receipt therefor is enclosed herewith.  
It is fitting that the Eskimos of Alaska be associated with the work of the 
Shrine of the &amp;Bab, and your having made this gift in their behalf is very 
appropriate, especially as you are endeavoring to work with the Eskimos 
in that country.  
     The Guardian feels that you should write to the American National 
Spiritual Assembly in detail concerning the problem of Groups, Assemblies, 
etc. outside of Fairbanks.  Certainly some basis should be set up for 
the establishment of such Groups and Assemblies, and he feels sure that 
within the principles that have already been enunciated, the American 
National Spiritual Assembly can properly handle the matter.  
     At his direction I am sending a copy of this letter to the National 
Assembly, so that they will be informed of the matter when you write to 
them.  
 
+P54 
     The Guardian greatly values your sacrificial and devoted services to the 
Faith.  He is praying in your behalf.  He likewise will pray for the friends 
in Alaska, and also for those who are being attracted to the Faith, 
particularly Mr. English, who is half Eskimo.  
     The Guardian was deeply appreciative of the spirit which animated you 
in preparing the tape recording of the &amp;Ridvan Feast held in the home of an 
Eskimo family in Fairbanks.  
     With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, I am 
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
                                    Assistant Secretary 
 
                                 *     *     * 
 
                                                        (65) December 18, 1953 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving communication of December 5th has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  
     The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the &amp;Bab is 
greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed herewith.  
     The beloved Guardian is very happy because of the response of the 
friends throughout the world to the Ten Year Crusade.  All of the virgin 
areas, with the exception of the Iron Curtain countries, are settled or 
assigned to pioneers.  There are now over seventy of the virgin areas 
settled by pioneers, which bring the number of countries within the pale 
of the Faith to over two hundred.  
     The Guardian is now deeply concerned with the development of the 
Faith in the homelands.  If the Faith is not developed and spread in the 
homelands, it will ultimately affect the success of the work in foreign 
lands.  The Guardian therefore hopes that the believers who have not been 
able to go to foreign areas will, in accordance with the Master's instructions, 
scatter to the goal cities in the homelands, and thus aid in the 
establishment of Spiritual Assemblies.  
     What is needed to achieve success in the teaching field is a complete 
dedication on the part of the individual, consecration to the glorious task 
of spreading the Faith, and the living of the &amp;Baha'i life, because that 
creates the magnet for the Holy Spirit, and it is the Holy Spirit which 
quickens the new soul.  Thus, the individual should be as a reed, through 
which the Holy Spirit may flow, to give new life to the seeking soul.  
     One should search out those who are receptive to the Faith, and then 
concentrate on those persons in their teaching.  
 
+P55 
     The &amp;Baha'is in Alaska have a special responsibility, and that is to 
spread the Faith rapidly in that vast country.  The success of the teaching 
work done by the &amp;Baha'is of Alaska will determine how soon a National 
Spiritual Assembly will be established in your country.  
     The beloved Guardian is praying for the success of your efforts.  He 
sends his loving greetings to you.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
                                    Assistant Secretary 
 
                                 *     *     * 
 
                                                          (66) January 9, 1954 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian greatly appreciated the spirit of your loving 
letter of December 28th, addressed to me, and has asked me to assure you 
of his prayers in your behalf, for the success of the noble mission you 
have undertaken.  He will pray that the divine confirmations may be with 
you always, so that many souls may find eternal life, in that far off land, 
through your devoted and sacrificial efforts.  
     He was pleased with the establishment of the fund for the &amp;Hazira for 
Alaska.  It is his hope, the Friends will arise with renewed effort in the 
Teaching Field, so many new centers and Assembies may be estabished, 
thus enabling Alaska to achieve its supreme goal of the NSA early 
in the Ten-Year Plan.  Then the time will be ripe for the building of the 
&amp;Hazira, for which the Friends are now contributing funds.  
     With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, I am, 
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
 
                                 *     *     * 
 
                                                        (67) February 20, 1954 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of February 8th has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  Your 
contribution to the international interests of the Faith is greatly appreciated 
by him.  Receipt is enclosed herewith.  
     The Guardian is very happy with the development of the teaching work 
in the virgin areas of the Ten-Year Crusade.  Over 84 of the countries have 
 
+P56 
now been settled, bringing the number of countries within the pale of the 
Faith to over 216.  
     The Guardian is hopeful that the friends at home will arise with the 
same spirit of sacrifice and determination as the pioneers abroad, and 
teach and spread the Faith.  
     More &amp;Baha'is, more Groups, more Assemblies, are the immediate 
goals before the friends at home.  He feels sure the friends will arise as 
never before, and filled with the Holy Spirit, quicken the seeking souls, 
leading many to the bourn of immortality.  
     Dedication to the heavenly task, complete consecration to the noble 
mission, and living the life, are the requirements for success in the 
teaching field.  
     The beloved Guardian greatly values the active services of you two 
devoted workers in the Faith.  As you know, the Guardian feels that the 
future of Alaska is very important indeed, particularly the city of Anchorage.  
One of the goals of the Ten Year Crusade is the establishment of a 
National Assembly in Alaska.  This great bounty carries with it great 
responsibilities; and therefore the Guardian is hopeful that each and every 
&amp;Baha'i in Alaska will redouble their efforts in order to spread the Faith far 
and wide, and to bring many new souls into the Faith.  
     The Guardian feels sure that you two will render distinguished and 
outstanding services in connection with the development of the Cause in 
Alaska during the present Crusade.  He assures you of his prayers in your 
behalf, and sends you his loving greetings.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
 
                                 *     *     * 
 
                                                           (68) April 12, 1954 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of March 16th has been received through the courtesy 
of Mrs. Tuttle.  
     We have prayed at the Shrines for the solution of your problems; that 
all obstacles may be removed from your path, and that your true field of 
&amp;Baha'i service may become clear and evident.  
     As a general principle, the Guardian has established the order of 
importance in &amp;Baha'i service as follows:  First, Pioneering in one of the 
virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade.  Second, Pioneering in one of the 
consolidation areas of the Ten Year Crusade.  Third, Settlement and 
Teaching in one of the goal cities of the home front campaign.  This of 
 
+P57 
course would include developing the Faith in Communities where there is 
already a Group or isolated &amp;Baha'is.  
     The Guardian feels that it is advisable for every individual, after his 
own prayers and meditations and seeking of guidance, to consult with the 
appropriate committee appointed by the National Assembly.  They are in 
touch with the ramifications of the Campaign, and are qualified to give 
sound advice.  
     So far as your personal affairs are concerned, the Guardian assures you 
of his prayers in your behalf, that they may be clarified for you.  Of course 
the question of love and marriage is something that can only be determined 
by the individual.  
     So far as the publication of the pamphlet in Eskimo is concerned, it 
probably would be advisable for you to write the National Assembly on 
this important matter, asking them what the present status is, and if you 
can assist in any way.  
     With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings, I am, 
                                    Faithfully yours, 
                                    Leroy Ioas 
                                    Secretary-General

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of April 21st has been received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He appreciated your loving thought in sending him &amp;Ridvan Greetings 
from a new Alaskan Center.+E14 
     He attaches the greatest importance to the spread of the Faith in that 
territory, because, as you know, it is destined to have a National Spiritual 
Assembly of its own ere the termination of the Ten Year Plan; and the 
sooner the believers can open up new centers and establish new Spiritual 
Assemblies, the sooner will the happy day come when Alaska will be 
independent, and have its own national &amp;Baha'i Body.  
     He assures you he will certainly pray that your sacrifices and your 
services may be richly rewarded.  
     He urges you to concentrate on attracting the natives as much as 
possible, by that he means the Eskimos.  These people have a right to hear 
of the glorious message of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and he hopes you will be instrumental 
in attracting many of them to the Faith.  
                                    With warmest &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani

Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of March 19th has been received by the beloved Guardian, 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He is delighted to see that you are in one of the goal cities in Alaska, 
and that you have been joined by Miss Meyer.  He feels sure that this 
nucleus will soon attract to itself sufficient new &amp;Baha'is to create a 
Spiritual Assembly.+E15 
     He urges you to persevere, and assures you of his prayers for your 
success.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of June 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and 
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He will pray that your personal affairs may work out happily.  He fully 
approves of your going to Selewik, where you can be of greater service to 
the Faith than in Fairbanks, where there are now a number of &amp;Baha'is, 
until such time as you can arrange to carry the Teachings into the far 
north.  
     He assures you his loving prayers will always surround you in your 
devoted efforts to serve the Faith so dear to your heart.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of December 15th has been received by the beloved Guardian; 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He is happy to know that you are engaged in the service of the Faith, 
and will pray that you may be strenghthened to perform befittingly your 
part, and may be instrumental in guiding others to this great Cause.  
     He urges you to teach all you can, both in Anchorage, and, if possible, 
in surrounding towns.  As you know, Alaska is to establish its own 
National Spiritual Assembly during the World Crusade; and the first step 
is the formation of a sufficient number of Local Spiritual Assemblies.  
     In his visits to the Holy Shrines, he will remember all the members of 
your family.  He hopes your two dear children will become pure and noble 
examples of the &amp;Baha'i life, and worthy instruments for the service of the 
Cause.  
     He will also remember in his supplications all the dear friends in that 
land.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of February 10th, and 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     In view of the fact that he hopes that in the not-too-distant future 
Alaska will have its own Spiritual Assembly, he advises you to remain in 
Alaska, and try to find employment in some place other than Anchorage, where 
you can assist in establishing another Local Spiritual Assembly.  There 
must be a sufficient number of local Assemblies in Alaska in order to 
form a broad basis for the National Body to be erected upon.  He feels that 
this would be the greatest service you could render at this time.  
     Assuring you of his appreciation of your devotion to the Faith, and of 
his prayers for your success, 
                                    With loving greetings,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of July 15th, and has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He deeply appreciates your devotion and service to the Faith.  
     You must not become discouraged, but strive diligently to consolidate 
the Faith in that important area.  He feels the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds itself will 
prove to be an instrument to attract new souls to the Cause.  
     He assures you of his prayers for the success of your labours, and will 
also pray for all the &amp;Baha'is in Anchorage.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your loving letter of October 31st has been received by the Beloved 
Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  The 
contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly 
appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.  
     Alaska is a most important country, especially mentioned by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of the Divine Plan.  The Friends there must 
arise with renewed effort to spread the Glad Tidings and win souls to the 
Cause of God.  There should be many assemblies, groups and Isolated 
centers, for the formation of the National Assembly, and its vigorous 
functioning.  
 
+P61 
     The Guardian was happy to learn that Alaska is awake to the Faith, as 
never before.  It therefore remains to see what the Friends will do; for it is 
now in their hands to raise the heights of their spiritual endeavors.  
     The Guardian assures you, and all the Friends in Alaska of his prayers 
in their behalf; for the success of their work; and the confirmation of many 
souls in the Kingdom of God.  
     He sends you his loving Greetings, 
                                    Faithfully yours,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of January 3rd, and has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was very happy to hear of the declaration of Miss Johnson,+E16 and 
particularly of the translation into Aleut of the excerpt from &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Writings.  Likewise, he was very happy to know that you are building a 
&amp;Baha'i Center,+E17 which he will consider as an auxiliary to the other goals 
the friends are winning all over the world.  
     Perhaps one should not approach the people in that country+E18 on the 
basis of religion, but rather through the social teachings of the Faith and 
its Laws, and make them understand the need for World Order, rather 
than giving them the religious aspect first, when they are so fanatically 
attached to their church.  
     He will certainly pray that you may find receptive souls, and the slow 
work of conversion be begun.  No doubt once they embrace the Faith, they 
will be very staunch.  
     Assuring you all of his loving prayers and his appreciation of your 
persevering services, 
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of April 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and 
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He feels that now that you have found the thing you were searching for 
inwardly, and have this added joy in your life of our glorious Faith, you 
should be kinder to your husband and more considerate than ever, and do 
everything in your power to make him feel that this has not taken you 
away from him, but only made your love for him and your desire to be a 
good wife to him, greater.  Whether he will ultimately be able to become a 
&amp;Baha'i or not, is something that only time can tell; but there is no doubt 
where your duty lies, and that is to make him appreciate the fact that your 
new affiliation has not interfered in any way with his home life or his 
marriage, but on the contrary, has strengthened both.  
     It is very difficult when one has found what one knows is the truth, to 
sit by and see a dear and close relative completely blind to it.  The 
temptation is to try and "stir them up and make them see the light", but this 
is often disastrous.  Silence, love and forbearance will win greater victories 
in such cases.  However, your husband has no right to ask you to give up 
being a &amp;Baha'i.  That is going too far.  Nobody should trespass on the 
sacred bond every human being has a right to have with their Creator.  
     The Guardian assures you he will pray that you may be guided to do the 
right thing at this difficult time, and that your husband's attitude may 
change.  
                                    With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                    R. Rabbani 
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
May the Beloved bless, guide and sustain you, aid you to overcome your 
difficulties, and enable you to promote effectively the vital interests of His 
Faith.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                    Shoghi

Statements on Various Subjects.  These statements are extracted

are not found elsewhere in this compilation.  They are from 
letters written by the Guardian's secretary at his specific 
direction.  The arrangement is according to subject matter.  
 
 

 
+P68 
 
+P69 
(81) ALASKA--Important 
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian was received, dated September 
10th, and he is very happy to welcome you into the service of this glorious 
Faith, and especially to see that you are going to serve in Alaska, a 
country to which he attaches great importance.  
 
(82) ALASKA--Incorporation of L.S.A. and growth 
     He was also delighted to hear of the incorporation of Anchorage.  The 
Faith is certainly going ahead by leaps and bounds in the "barren North"!  
 
(83) ALASKA--Spirit of confidence 
     He was delighted with all the good news you conveyed of the progress 
of the Cause in Alaska, the radio broadcasts, the new believers, and the 
spirit of confidence and devotion which animates you all in serving our 
precious Faith.  
 
(84) ALASKA--Unity of believers 
     He was very happy to hear of the unity of the Alaskan &amp;Baha'is; they are 
a Community particularly dear to his heart, and he hopes that in the years 
to come the Cause will make remarkable progress in that land.  
 
(85) ANTI-CHRIST 
     We do not believe in Anti-Christ in the sense the Christians do.  Anyone 
who violently and determinedly sought to oppose the Manifestation could 
be called an "anti-Christ," such as the &amp;Vazir in the &amp;Bab's day, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Aqasi.  
 
(86) CHRIST--RESURRECTION 
     We do not believe that there was a bodily resurrection after the 
 
+P70 
crucifixion of Christ, but that there was a time after His ascension when 
His disciples perceived spiritually His true greatness and realized He was 
eternal in being.  This is what has been reported symbolically in the New 
Testament and been misunderstood.  His eating with His disciples after 
resurrection is the same thing.  
 
(87) CHRIST--Virgin Birth 
     What science calls a virgin birth we do not associate with that of Jesus 
Christ, which we believe to have been a miracle and a sign of His 
Prophethood.  In this matter we are in entire agreement with the most 
orthodox church views.  
 
(88) FEAR--Overcoming fear 
     He will certainly pray that you may entirely over-come your fear-complex.  
When you concentrate your thoughts on realizing that you now 
belong to &amp;Baha'u'llah, are His servant whom He loves and will always 
help, if you ask Him to, and that the great spiritual strength of the Cause 
of God is behind you for you to draw upon, you will soon see your fears 
melting away.  
 
(89) FOOD-Storage 
     With regard to the storing of food--this is something which the 
Spiritual Assembly will have to determine, based on local conditions; and 
based on discussions with Local Authorities.  The Guardian feels it is not 
a subject which can be generally legislated upon.  
 
(90) GOD--Nature of our Knowledge 
     We find God only through the Intermediary of His Prophet.  We see the 
Perfection of God in His Prophets.  Time and space are physical things; 
God, the Creator, is not a "place" as we conceive of place in physical 
terms.  God is the Infinite Essence, the Creator.  We cannot picture Him or 
His state, but if we did, we would be His equals, not His creatures.  God is 
never flesh, but mirrored in the attributes of His Prophets we see His 
Divine characteristics and perfections.  
 
(91) IMMORTALITY--Cause of Happiness 
     He will pray for the progress and happiness of the soul of your dear 
daughter in the invisible, spiritual worlds.  He feels your attitude in this 
physical separation from her is exemplary, and is causing her great 
happiness now.  
 
+P71 
(92) INVESTMENTS 
     He leaves such matters as investments, etc., to the discretion of 
individuals who are free to consult experts and make their own decisions, 
and he feels this applies also to the shares in the prospective oil land which 
you asked his advice about.  
 
(93)  MANIFESTATIONS--Future Manifestations 
     The bud, the flower, the fruit are only symbols to convey to us the sense 
of the progress being made by man in receiving ever fuller Revelations 
from God.  In spite of the vast spiritual significance of what &amp;Baha'u'llah 
has brought to the world we humans have infinite progress to make in the 
future.  Future Prophets will bring us new laws suitable to our state of 
development and continue to educate us on this planet, but they will be 
under the shadow of &amp;Baha'u'llah for five thousand centuries.  
 
(94) PHOTOGRAPHS--of the Master 
     There is no objection to your copying pictures of the Master for your 
friends, but do not do it on a wholesale scale.  He has always preferred that 
the friends should have the Master's photo rather than his own.  
 
(95) PRAYER 
     We cannot know God directly, but only through His Prophets.  We can 
pray to Him, realizing that through His Prophets we know Him, or we can 
address our prayer in thought to &amp;Baha'u'llah, not as God, but as the Door 
to our knowing God.  
 
(96) PRE-EXISTENCE--of Prophets 
     The Prophets, unlike us, are pre-existent.  The soul of Christ existed in 
the spiritual world before His birth in this world.  We cannot imagine what 
that world is like, so words are inadequate to picture His state of being.  
 
(97) JOSEPH SMITH--Statements in Book of Mormon 
     As there is nothing specific about Joseph Smith in the teachings, the 
Guardian has no statement to make on his position or about the accuracy 
of any statement in the Book of Mormon regarding American history or 
its peoples.  This is a matter for historians to pass upon.  
 
(98) SOUL--Origin 
     The soul or spirit of the individual comes into being with the conception 
of his physical body.  
 
+P72 
(99) STUDY 
     Shoghi Effendi advises you to study "Some Answered Questions" and 
the "Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah" which help you to grasp these questions.  
 
(100) TEACHINGS--Acceleration 
     The Guardian was very happy to learn that the teaching work in Alaska 
is being accelerated.  May the momentum being gained, not be lost, but 
on the other hand intensified, so the forthcoming National Assembly may 
have a wide and strong base.  
     The world is seeking for a solution for its increasing problems, and if 
the friends arise with the dynamic spirit of the Faith, assured of final 
victory, many seeking souls will enter the Faith, and find eternal life.  
 
(101) TEACHING--Importance 
     The more one observes the conditions of the world and the terrible 
problems confronting humanity, the more deeply one realizes that the 
only remedy is that which &amp;Baha'u'llah has brought, and yet, alas, the 
masses of the people seem to not yet be aware that the way out of our 
problems can only be a divine way, given by something far greater than 
human understanding!  However, many souls are seriously thinking and 
seeking, and the &amp;Baha'is must try to bring the knowledge of the teachings 
to all, so that those prepared to accept may not be denied the Message.  
 
(102) TEACHING--Participation of Children 
     He is happy that the children are being attracted.  They are the pillars 
of the future, and should be trained and encouraged in every way, to learn 
the details of the teachings, and how to teach others.  For the true source of 
existence is the diffusing of Glad Tidings.  
 
(103) TEACHING--Remaining at Post 
     He would certainly advise you to remain in Alaska and continue to 
teach and give the small but devoted Community there your active 
support.  
 
(104) TEACHING--Teaching Relatives 
     He would not advise you to in any way force the teachings on your 
husband, but rather through prayer, love and example attract his heart to 
what he will be forced to see has not only made you a happier person 
 
+P73 
but a better wife and mother than ever before.  It is often most difficult to 
teach those nearest to us, but the Guardian will earnestly pray that your 
husband and children will join you in serving this wonderful Cause.

                                     NOTES 
 
      1.  (Letter No. 1) Honor Kempton was the first Pioneer to Alaska under 
the first Seven Year Plan.  
 
      2.  (Letter No. 2) Janet Whitenack (Stout) was the first person to enroll 
in the Faith in Alaska during the first Seven Year Plan.  
 
      3.  (Letter No. 4) Janet Whitenack (Stout) had secured a school teaching 
position in the village of Tuluksak on the Kuskokwim River.  
 
      4.  (Letter No. 5) Melba Call (King) was the first Eskimo to become a 
&amp;Baha'i.  While she was born and raised in Alaska, she was residing in New

      5.  (Letter No. 17) Based on these directions from the Guardian, the 
first &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds was purchased inside the City limits at 810-8th 
Avenue.  At that time (1955) the population of Anchorage was less than 
25,000 concentrated around what is now downtown Anchorage.  Following 
the earthquake in 1964, it was necessary to abandon the original 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds.  The property was sold for $20,000 and a diligent 
year-long effort was made to find a suitable replacement.  Nothing appropriate 
could be found inside the city limits within the price range.  
Guidance was requested from the Universal House of Justice.  In a letter 
dated May 11, 1965, they stated the following, "...we feel that it is 
more important that you should acquire a national &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds for 
Alaska without delay.  Preferably is should be within the civic limits of 
Anchorage but if you cannot find a suitable building which can be 
purchased for the $20,000 which you have available, you should look for 
a location in the immediate suburbs of Anchorage...."  
 
      6.  (Letter No. 27) Mrs. Sarah Mary ("Granny") Roberts was 87 years 
old when she became a &amp;Baha'i.  
 
      7.  (Letter No. 27) Joyce Anderson Combs was the first Tlingit Indian

&amp;Baha'i while living in Alaska was Agnes Parent (Harrison).  
 
      8.  (Letter No. 29) Joyce Campbell (Baldwin).  
 
      9.  (Letter No. 35) Martha Brown (Reed).

Huffman.  
 
     11.  (Letter No. 50) This ringstone was given by the Greatest Holy Leaf 
to Mrs. Marie Lowell of Santa Barbara, California who gave it to Frances 
Wells.  Mrs. Wells gave it to the Alaska National Archives.  
 
     12.  (Letter No. 57) Miss Honor Kempton served in Luxembourg after 
leaving Alaska.  
 
     13.  (Letter No. 57) Miss Dagmar Dole came to Alaska shortly after the 
first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed.  She pioneered to Europe and 
is buried in Switzerland.  The Guardian said she was a "distinguished 
consecrated pioneer."  
 
     14.  (Letter No. 69) Seward was opened by the pioneering of the Edgar 
Russell family.  
 
     15.  (Letter No. 70) This letter so encouraged the friends when it was 
re-read a year and a half later that it changed attitudes from one of 
discouragement to confidence and enthusiasm which resulted in the 
formation of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Ketchikan the following 
&amp;Ridvan.  
 
     16.  (Letter No. 76) Janet Johnson (Smith) later became the Secretary 
of the Alaska National Spiritual Assembly.
