     "AROHANUI"  
     The word "Arohanui" is a Maori word and, as with many Polynesian 
words, there is no direct translation into English.  The literal 
meaning is "big love", or "much love" or "great love".  And, like 
most words in most languages, it has several meanings.  In naming 
this book, "Arohanui:  Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand", 
"Arohanui" is used in its more expressive meaning, "enfolding 
love", or "that love which binds a community together", 
or "that love which creates bonds of mutual trust and loyalty", or 
"that love which builds and carries forward culture or civilization".

My dear &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     Your beautiful letter of April 3rd written to the Beloved 
Guardian of the Cause of God, our dear Shoghi Effendi, was 
received.[+E1]  He was much impressed and charmed with the 
spirit of your letter, which indicated deep devotion to and 
absolute dependence on the Holy Spirit of the Beloved Master, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     He instructed me with a heart overflowing with love to 
answer your letter, conveying to you his high estimation for 
the beauty of the faith of the New Zealand friends, and deep 
appreciation towards the splendid services of our dear Mr and 
Mrs Dunn,[+E2] who are so wonderfully blessed and assisted by 
the power of the Holy Ghost.  He loves you all and prays for 
your happiness and spiritual growth.  
     It is true that your group is now still small, but he assures 
you that your group will before long grow larger and 
larger day by day.  It has been always the case with the growth 
of every religion.  Some pure soul or souls go to some land 
and sow the seeds of the heavenly teachings in the hearts of 
few who are most pure and so most receptive.  The seeds will 
germinate and grow in them.  The fruits of these seeds appear 
in the regeneration of the lives of these primary adherents.  
These primary adherents share the bounties they have received 
with other souls, who through them obtain new life 
and light and in turn illumine other people.  
     The primary adherents are the stars of great magnitude 
in every land in the firmament of the Kingdom of God.  They 
are the chosen people.  They are like candles which, through 
their sacrificial efforts, are weeping their lives away in order 
to give light to the world and establish the purpose of their 
Lord and Saviour, which purpose is the salvation of mankind.  
His Holiness, Jesus Christ! see how small the group of 
His disciples was!  No matter how few the number of the disciples 
was, yet they through His power illumined the world.  
Our Era is similar to that, but through the development of 
 
+P4 
humanity it is greater, and through the evils of the material 
civilization and negligence of mankind our sacrifices must be 
greater.  Divine light must make itself manifest in our daily 
life deeds.  
     In the early days of the appearance of our Saviour, virtue 
was to save ourselves.  When we are once established in 
our faith, then virtue is to save others.  The three mottoes of 
education hold true in our case too.  First grow, then become 
and then contribute.  We have developed; we have established 
ourselves, and now it is time to contribute to others.  
We have inexhaustible capital.  The candles of our spiritual 
lives constantly weep away their lives in shedding light to the 
world, but they never become exhausted.  For there is connection 
between our lives and that of &amp;Baha'u'llah and our 
beloved &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     It cannot be described how much we long to see our 
dear New Zealand brethren and sisters.  We hope the day will 
come when they can come to us and we to them.  Meanwhile, 
we are praying at the Holy Threshold of our beloved Master 
for your success and happiness.  We hope you will pray for us 
too.  The effect of the prayers of the pure hearts is tremendously 
great.  
     Our dear Shoghi Effendi wants you not to look at your 
own capacity, but at the power of the Holy Ghost of God.  He 
sends you all his loving greeting and tender affection.  
     With warm wishes and &amp;Baha'i love, I remain, 
                     Your humble brother in His love, 
                                 Azizullah S. Bahadur

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to receive this morning 
your letter of 28th April, but we were very sorry to hear 
you have been ill and hope your health will soon be completely 
 
+P5 
restored.[+E3]  It was nice that you saw Shoghi's sister and 
Soheil's brother in London.  
     I forget whether I gave you the address of Mr and Mrs 
King, c/o Messrs Hayman and King, 202 Old Christchurch 
Rd. Bournemouth.  They are very kind-hearted &amp;Baha'is and 
will be delighted to see any of you if you call.  Both of them 
work in the business and you are most likely to see them if 
you call there.  They live above the shop.  
     I gave you Sister Challis's address at West Moors 
(Ferndown Lodge).  You can get there by 'bus from Bournemouth 
Sq. or Lansdowne, which will drop you right at 
Sister Challis's door (She keeps a nursing home) or you can 
go by train from West Bournemouth to West Moors station 
which is within 5 minutes' walk of Ferndown Lodge.  I hope 
you will be able to see her.  
     As I write, the Greatest Holy Leaf is on a visit to the 
Shrine of the Master.  It is over a year, I think, since she has 
been able to visit the shrine and until now she has not seen the 
new Gardens, in the laying out of which Shoghi Effendi has 
taken such a deep interest.  The Gardens are looking lovely 
now and it is easy to imagine how delighted she will be.  One 
day during the feast of &amp;Ridvan she and the Holy Mother were 
able to visit &amp;Bahji and the Garden of &amp;Ridvan.  
     I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am 
steadily regaining my strength.  
     Shoghi Effendi is still tired.  I hope he will soon be able 
to take a rest.  
     All the friends here join in loving greetings and best 
wishes to yourself, your son and daughter, Miss Stevenson 
and Effie Baker.[+E4]  With warmest greetings.  
                        Your brother in the service of the 
                        Beloved, 
                                 J. E. Esslemont 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear precious sister in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:  
     I was so glad to hear from you directly and learn of 
 
+P6 
your improved health and meeting with the English &amp;Baha'is.  I 
need not assure you of my ardent prayers for your happiness, 
good health and continued success in the service of the 
Cause.  I hope and pray you will be enabled by the guiding 
spirit of the Master not only to stimulate the interest of your 
friends and relations in this Cause but to make of some of 
them earnest and whole-hearted believers and supporters of 
the Faith.

                                (3)  May 9th, 1925 
                         &amp;Allah-u-abha 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Greatest Holy Leaf and Shoghi Effendi have asked 
me to answer on their behalf your kind letters of Apr. 2nd 
from Port Said and April 14th from London.  
     We were sorry to hear that Mrs Blundell got a chill on 
the steamer and was laid up for a few days after her arrival in 
London.  We hope that by this time she is all right again.  We 
had a note from her from Bournemouth.  
     You will be glad to hear that the Greatest Holy Leaf and 
the Holy Mother were able to motor to &amp;Bahji and &amp;Ridvan one 
day during the Feast of &amp;Ridvan, and that yesterday the 
Greatest Holy Leaf motored to the Shrine of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and saw the new Gardens in which Shoghi Effendi has been 
taking so much interest.  
     Yesterday a Dutchman arrived here from Port Said, the 
first Dutch &amp;Baha'i, so far as we know.  He has been a sincere 
and earnest truth-seeker for years.  About 9 months ago he left 
his home at the Hague and walked on foot through Belgium, 
France and Italy.  Then he felt some inward urge to go to 
Egypt, and travelled thither by a Dutch Cargo Steamer.  
When the steamer arrived at Port Said Mahmood Effendi, 
one of the Port Said &amp;Baha'is came on board and was introduced 
to Mesdag (the Dutchman).  They struck up a 
friendship at once and after 2 days Mesdag went to live in 
 
+P7 
Mahmood's house.  There he met Martha Root, Mr 
Schopflocher and various other &amp;Baha'is, read my book and 
became thoroughly interested and seems now already a firm 
believer.  He has already, since his arrival yesterday morning, 
translated our 8-page folder into Dutch and we hope he will 
be able to do much to make the Cause known in Holland and 
win adherents there.  
     I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am 
feeling almost as vigorous as before the attack.  Azizullah 
Bahadur is now in Stuttgart.  There is as yet no improvement 
in his hand, but he is having skilled treatment now and we 
hope it will be successful.  He seems to be having a very 
happy time with the German friends.  
     Shoghi Effendi is much in need of rest, but fairly well.  
He and all the members of the Holy Family join in loving 
greetings and heartfelt prayers for your welfare.  We hope you 
will have a fine time in England and return to New Zealand 
refreshed and reinvigorated physically and spiritually to take 
up your work for the Kingdom there with new enthusiasm 
and devotion.  We pray that you may always be guided and 
strengthened by the Divine Confirmations.  
     With love also to Effie Baker and all the other friends, 
                         Your brother in the service of the 
                         Beloved, 
                                  J. E. Esslemont 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My precious &amp;Baha'i sister:-- 
     I wish to assure you personally of my appreciation of 
your devotion to the Cause, and your earnest efforts to promote 
it as well as my fervent prayers for your spiritual advancement, 
success and happiness.  I will always remember 
you most tenderly in my hours of visit at the three holy Shrines 
and beseech for you and the New Zealand friends the 
blessings of our loving and almighty Master.  
                         You true brother, 
                                   Shoghi

                           &amp;Allah-u-abha 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother, 
     Shoghi Effendi has asked me to reply to your kind letter 
of 11th April.  He is delighted to hear that you propose starting 
a &amp;Baha'i Magazine for Australia and New Zealand and 
suggests as a suitable title "The Herald of the South".  Every 
19 days a letter will be sent from Haifa to Mr and Mrs Hyde 
Dunn giving the news of the Cause.  Owing to the restricted 
facilities for multiplying copies which are at present available 
here, I fear it will not be possible to send another copy to you, 
but doubtless you can arrange with Mr and Mrs Hyde Dunn to 
have their copy passed on to you for the magazine.  We are 
glad to hear that notwithstanding the absence of the Blundells 
and Margaret Stevenson, the friends in New Zealand are remaining 
united and active.  We hope that when the pilgrims 
return the faith and enthusiasm of the believers will be greatly 
deepened and strengthened and that many new believers may 
be attracted.  I had a long letter from Effie Baker yesterday.  
She is very devoted and whole-hearted and will be a valuable 
worker for the Cause, I think, and a great help to Father and 
Mother Dunn.  When she wrote, Margaret Stevenson had 
gone to Scotland and Mrs and Miss Blundell were in Bournemouth.  
Effie Baker hopes to make a return visit to Haifa on 
her way back to Australia.  
     Shoghi Effendi assures you of his prayers on behalf of 
your mother, yourself and all the Australasian friends and his 
hopes that the proposed Magazine may greatly help the 
spread of the Glad Tidings in Australia and New Zealand.  
     With warmest greetings and best wishes, 
                      Yours sincerely in the Master's 
                      service, 
                                 J. E. Esslemont 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear fellow-worker:  
     Your charming letter truly gladdened my heart.  I will 
follow the development of your magazine with keen interest 
 
+P9 
and assure you of my desire to help and promote its interests 
to the fullest possible extent.  I am enclosing the photographs of 
the shrine and gardens recently laid out in the close 
neighbourhood of the Shrines of the &amp;Bab and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  I 
assure you of my love, appreciation and fervent prayers.  
                         Yours, 
                                    Shoghi

                                 (5)  May 28th, 1925 
                       &amp;Allah-u-abha.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Shoghi Effendi asks me to thank you on his behalf for 
your letter of 14th May.  He received the letter of Mrs. Amy 
Thornton all right.  I remember answering it for him some 
weeks ago, so you can set your mind at rest on that score.  
     The recovery of your &amp;Baha'i ring and stones was very 
remarkable.  It reminds me of a somewhat similar occurrence 
in Bournemouth.  One of our &amp;Baha'i friends had her &amp;Baha'i 
ring stolen, and nothing was heard or seen of it for some 
months.  Mr King, another of our group, has an antique shop 
in Bournemouth and one day his partner (a &amp;non-Baha'i) 
bought a ring from a man who said it was his wife's, but as 
they had become very badly off she wanted to sell it.  When 
Mr King saw the ring he recognized it as a &amp;Baha'i ring and 
knowing that this friend had lost her ring, he sent it to me.  It 
turned out to be her ring and she was delighted to recover it.  
The curious thing is that out of the dozens of jewellers and 
antique shops in Bournemouth to which the ring might have 
been taken for sale, it should be taken to the one where there 
was a &amp;Baha'i who recognized it.  
     I hope that before you leave Scotland you may be able 
to go to Aberdeen and see my home people.  They would be 
delighted to see you.  My father's address is Fairford, Cults, 
(about 3 miles from Aberdeen, by car or train).  He is 86 years 
of age and rather frail.  My sister looks after him.  My two 
 
+P10 
married brothers are Peter Esslemont, 21, Louisville Avenue 
(Business:  John E. Esslemont, 16 King Street) and W.D.E., 
12 Wellbrae Terr., Mannofield.  Both of their houses are near 
the Mannofield Car Line.  
     We were very glad to hear of your meetings with the 
friends at London and West Moors.  
     Many thanks for your letter to myself and the excellent 
snap-shots enclosed.  I am glad you have fallen in love with 
Sister Challis and hope you will see her again before you 
leave.  I had a delightful letter yesterday from Miss Kilford of 
West Moors, whom I regard as a &amp;Baha'i grand-daughter, as 
she was brought into the Cause by Sister Challis who calls me 
her &amp;Baha'i father!  
     We hope Shoghi Effendi will get away soon for a much 
needed rest.  The Greatest Holy Leaf was rather seriously ill 
last week, but is a good deal better again, although very feeble 
and frail.  
     I have been advised by the Drs to leave Haifa for the 
summer months, as my breathing has lately been troublesome 
and they think the moist heat during the summer here 
would be bad for me.  On the same day on which this decision 
was arrived at, I received a cordial invitation to go to a place 
in the Black Forest for my summer vacation.  The Drs considered 
this place would be ideal for me and that the sooner I got 
away the better, so I leave in 3 days time.  My address will be 
c/o Frau Victoria von Sigsfeld, Husli, Finsterlingen, bei St 
Blaisien, Baden, Germany.  I hope to return to Haifa in the 
latter part of Sept. to resume my work here.  
     Shoghi Effendi, the members of the Holy Household 
and the friends here join in loving greetings and best wishes.  
                          Your brother in the service of the 
                          Beloved, 
                                    J. E. Esslemont 
 
     Mrs Schopflocher arrived here last night after a very successful 
tour in Russia, Persia and Iraq.  
 
+P11 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear co-worker:  
     I was very glad indeed to learn about your experiences 
and visit to the friends and your firm determination to labour 
unceasingly in the Divine Vineyard.  I will continue to pray 
for you that all your relatives and friends may recognise and 
be illumined with the resplendent Light of this Divine Revelation.  
Never feel disheartened and trust me ever your affectionate, 
grateful and true brother in the service of the Cause.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Shoghi Effendi received your kind letter and wishes me 
to acknowledge its receipt.  He hopes that on your return to 
New Zealand you will obtain divine assistance in your services 
to the Cause.  That land has been newly opened to the 
&amp;Baha'i Movement.  The work of the friends therefore, interesting 
and useful as it may be, is hard and most exacting to 
one's patience and energy.  It needs great perseverance to 
obtain a hearing among the people and draw their attention to 
this Blessed Cause.  But once that that has been obtained and 
the way smoothed then progress becomes increasingly great 
and the fruits of your labours appreciated.  
     Shoghi Effendi is very glad that you have enjoyed your 
trip to England.  The Friends there though they are few in 
number, are full of love and affection, one cannot but feel at 
home among them.  
     Shoghi Effendi thanks Miss Nora Lee for the kind contribution 
she has made to the Cause.  It will be spent for the 
progress of this movement so dear to the heart of us all.  
Enclosed there will be a receipt for that amount.  
     Shoghi Effendi and the other members of the family 
send you their best &amp;Baha'i love and greeting and wish you 
success in your services to the Cause.  
                        Your brother in His Name,

+P12 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dearest fellow-worker:  
     My prayers accompany you wherever you go.  I wish 
you to be happy, confident and active.  Rest assured of my 
great admiration of your zeal and steadfast labours, of my 
confidence in the success of your splendid pioneer services 
and of my eagerness to hear from you about the progress of 
your work.  
                       Your true brother,

     To the publisher of the &amp;Baha'i Magazine, "The Herald 
of the South".  
     My dear friend and fellow-worker:  
     I have just heard the welcome news of the publication 
of the first issue of the &amp;Baha'i Journal, recently established by 
the friends of Australia and New Zealand.  I rejoice in this 
new and notable &amp;Baha'i enterprise, particularly as it is undertaken 
by my dearly-beloved and self-sacrificing brothers and 
sisters in a land which holds so great a promise for the future.  
     I have followed the progress of the activities of the 
&amp;Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand with keen interest and 
ever-increasing confidence, and with a deep sense of pride 
and gratitude.  I most heartily welcome this newly-added link 
in the chain of the many services, so lovingly and spontaneously 
rendered by the pioneers of the Cause in these lands.  I 
assure you of my steadfast prayers for the speedy expansion 
and consolidation of this youngest of all &amp;Baha'i Magazines, 
and of my earnest endeavours to enable it attain a standard 
worthy of the bearer of such a noble Message.  
     It should be the object and purpose of its author and 
publisher to open its pages to the consideration and review of 
matters that are strictly &amp;Baha'i in character, as well as to the 
treatment of topics of a humanitarian, ethical and religious 
nature; that its readers, while witnessing to the liberal and 
broad-minded attitude of the &amp;Baha'i Cause, may receive from 
 
+P13 
it their full share of inspiration which only a clear and direct 
statement of the Divine Message can impart.  
     Go forth, on thy noble errand, O thou Herald of the 
South!  Join thy voice, however feeble, to those of thy sister-journals 
who, in various parts of the world, are raising with 
one accord the call of this new Day of God.  Persevere in thy 
labours, endeavour to reach every circle and every home, 
that the light thou bearest may in the fulness of time illuminate 
with its healing rays the uttermost corners of that distant 
and troubled continent.  
                       Your well-wisher,

     Your letter to Shoghi Effendi and the enclosed one to 
Ruhi with the postal order for &amp;10 have been received and 
read with keen interest and pleasure.  
     We are all very happy to know that you have had such a 
pleasant journey back home and that you had the opportunity 
of delivering the message on so many occasions.  We hope 
and pray that the seed you have sown has fallen on fertile soil 
and that in time it will grow and bear abundant fruit.  
     We hope that now through your sustained zeal and effort 
new life will be infused into your small &amp;Baha'i group, and 
that it will in the near future grow sufficiently in number to 
enable you to form an assembly the first to be established in 
that land.  We shall pray at the Holy Threshold for your guidance 
and the success of your work.  
     The Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy Mother remember 
you well, and they and the other members of the 
family send their loving greetings to you.  
     You will be interested to know that the new pilgrim 
house is being completed, and it will be all ready in a month 
time for the new pilgrims that will come.  
 
+P14 
     We still have our dear sister Effie Baker with us, and 
we all love her so; she is so sweet and helpful.  
     We have just now two American lady friends with us, 
Auntie Victoria Bedekian and Mrs R. Kehler--very fine 
&amp;Baha'is they are and we are expecting some more soon.  
     I always remember the happy day I spent with you and 
Effy in London and shall look forward to the pleasure of 
meeting you again some day--perhaps here in Haifa or in 
New Zealand, who knows?  
     I am back at home now for the present, and I am trying 
to help Shoghi Effendi a little in his enormous task.  
     He is keeping in good health I am glad to say in spite of 
his many activities and heavy and manifold responsibilities.  
     To you he sends his brotherly love and the assurance of 
his prayers for your welfare and happiness.  
     With all good wishes and loving greetings, 
                      Your sister in His Service,

My dear and precious &amp;Baha'i sister:  
     I cannot but add a few words personally expressing my 
deep appreciation of your persistent, self-sacrificing services 
to the Cause.  I have devoted your gift towards the Fund for 
the Western Pilgrim House and I wish to assure you that 
when I visit the Holy Shrines I tenderly supplicate for you Divine 
Guidance and strength in your labours for our beloved 
Cause.

Dear Spiritual Sister:-- 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated January 24, 1926.  
     He hopes that after this long vacation you have had you 
are ready to begin spreading the Cause in New Zealand with 
 
+P15 
even greater energy than before.  The people there seem to be 
broad in their outlook, receptive to any idea which helps the 
human family from decreasing its burden.  
     Shoghi Effendi was most chagrined to hear of the sudden 
death of your son+F1 and wishes me to extend to you his 
deepest love and sympathy.  
     There is no special news here except that we have removed 
to the new pilgrim house.  Miss Baker is well and very 
busy entertaining the friends and arranging the new home.  
     Shoghi Effendi as well as the other members of the 
family are well and send you their love and greetings.  They 
earnestly pray for your success and hope to hear, before long, 
the news of your many victories in the field of services to the 
Cause.  
     Please convey my loving greetings to your son and 
daughter.  
                     Yours most sincerely, 
                                Ruhi Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear fellow-worker:  
     I wish to express in person my deep sympathy in the 
heavy loss you have sustained.  May the Beloved Comforter 
strengthen you and sustain you in your bereavement.  The 
memory of your visit to the Holy Land is still fresh and vivid in 
my mind and I pray and supplicate at the holy Shrines that 
your labours in the Cause may yield an abundant harvest.  
                     Your sympathising brother, 
                                        Shoghi

                                    (10)  August 12th, 1926 
My very dear Spiritual Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi has been in receipt of your interesting 
letter dated June 7, 1926.  It is a great pity that your health has 
more or less handicapped you in your service to the Cause.  
We, however, hope that this weakness will soon vanish and 
your health and strength be fully restored.  
     The case of the teacher who has been in Palestine is one 
really to be lamented.  All such persons instead of procuring 
their information from the very source, when they are so near 
to it, they go to the Missionaries who are undoubtedly biased.  
They are immediately told that the Cause is nothing more 
than a sect of Islam; a Movement that may do immense good 
to the &amp;Muhammadan world, but far from ranking with Christianity 
or satisfying its needs.  Then they refer this ignorant 
and innocent person to books such as Brown's.  It is their fault 
for having gone to the wrong source for proper information, 
but once they have gone it is not their mistake to have been 
misled.  We have heard of many such instances and there is 
absolutely no remedy except to leave them until they find the 
truth for themselves.  We can only pray for their guidance.  
     Shoghi Effendi always prays for you as well as the 
other Auckland friends, so that through your combined efforts 
the Cause may prosper there, and obtain a strong position 
in the life of the people.  I am not the least familiar with 
the social conditions there, but I am sure there is a ready field 
for active service.  
                           Yours in His Name, 
                                  Ruhi Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear fellow-worker:  
      I rejoice to learn that your dear sons are realizing 
gradually the significance of this unique and mighty Cause, 
and my constant and fervent prayer is that you may witness 
erelong the fruition of their slow yet sure spiritual evolution.  
Persevere in your labours for I entertain and cherish the 
 
+P20 
brightest hopes for the future awakening of promising New-Zealand.  
I shall ever remember the memorable visit of the 
first New-Zealand believers to the Holy Land.  Please assure 
them of my undying affection.  
                          Your true brother, 
                                     Shoghi

                                    (11)  August 12th, 1926 
My dear Spiritual Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated June 7, 1926.  It was most interesting to go 
over your circular letter and read the many points of interest.  I 
was especially struck by the literature you have sent to Lord 
and Lady Allenby.  If they have at all seen them I am sure they 
were much impressed, for they knew the Master so well.  
They were surely very astonished to see a group of &amp;Baha'is 
formed in such a distant land.  
     I am very ashamed of myself not to have yet answered 
your letter of some months ago.  It was mainly because Shoghi 
Effendi wrote you and acknowledged the receipt of your 
contribution for the pilgrim house that I have been so neglectful.  
I took Miss Baker's advice on the matter and together 
we went down-town and bought a set of straw chairs.  
We thought that would be most appreciated by the friends 
while sitting in the veranda of the new Pilgrim House.  
     I remember a prayer, which you wrote, has been asked 
by a certain friend to be read daily.  I believe sometimes the 
friends through their zeal and ardour do things that are not 
asked in the Cause.  We have only one prayer that we have to 
say daily.  No one in the world has the power, given to him by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to add another to that daily prayer.  If we should 
admit this the life of the friends will soon be spent in mere 
prayer, which is not the aim of the Cause.  The healing prayer 
and such ones are only for occasional use when the need 
arises.  
 
+P21 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to extend to you his hearty 
greetings and assure you of his prayers.  
                         Yours in His Name, 
                                 Ruhi Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear fellow-worker:  
      Your letters are always a source of inspiring joy and 
stimulating encouragement to me.  You are destined to 
achieve great things for our beloved Cause and my constant 
prayer is that your vision may be clear, your purpose unshaken, 
your zeal undiminished, your hopes undimmed.  Let 
not obstacles and disappointments, which are inevitable, 
dishearten you and whenever you are faced with trials recall 
our Beloved's innumerable sufferings.  You certainly occupy 
a warm and abiding place in my heart.  
                         Your true brother, 
                                    Shoghi

Dear Spiritual Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated June 14th 1926, and also thank, through 
you, the Auckland friends for their kind contribution.  
     He wishes me to assure you and them of his earnest 
prayers.  He hopes that through your constant endeavours the 
Cause will progress rapidly in that city and make the spirit of 
the movement permeate throughout the land.  Though your 
number is still comparatively small yet through divine guidance 
and the Master's ever wakeful spirit you will soon add 
many to your group and make of it a power for goodness 
which will attract all attention.  
     With best wishes and kindest greetings I remain, 
                         Yours ever sincerely, 
                                    Ruhi Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear fellow-worker:  
     I am touched by this expression of the loyalty and devotion 
 
+P22 
of the Auckland &amp;Baha'is whose welfare, and spiritual 
advancement are the object of my earnest and constant 
prayer.  I shall devote it to further the interests of the Cause in 
ways that are dearest and nearest to my heart.  I shall supplicate 
the Almighty that strength and wisdom may be given you 
to face and overcome the obstacles and trials that you will inevitably 
encounter in future.  The end is glorious if we only 
persevere.  
                             Your true brother,

Dear Spiritual Brother:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated July 18, 1926.  He was very glad to learn 
of the encouraging prospects you have for your "Herald of 
the South".  He hopes that it will daily progress and add to its 
importance in drawing the attention of the people there.  A 
good periodical fully representative of the spirit and teachings 
of the Cause is the greatest help the Movement can have 
in establishing itself in a country.  So though difficulties may 
be found at the outset, we should bear them patiently and 
await that the future should give us our reward.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to extend to you his loving 
greetings and assure you, as well as your mother and Mr 
Brewer, of his constant prayers.  He hopes that through your 
combined efforts the Herald of the South will soon realise its 
aim and purpose.  
                             Yours in His Service,

strength to strength and contribute its destined share to the

Dear Spiritual Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated 11-9-26.  He was most gratified to learn 
that the Cause is becoming more and more known and appreciated 
by the people in New Zealand.  This is as important as 
the actual increase of the number of the friends, for it means 
that the principles are gradually permeating the thoughts of 
the people and making them more ready and receptive to the 
full identification of their beliefs with the precepts of the 
Cause.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers 
for you as well as for the other friends in New Zealand.  He 
hopes that they will increase both in number as well as in 
spiritual understanding and insight.  The reports that we occasionally 
receive from there are most encouraging and hopeful.  
It seems that the people there due to their breadth of mind 
and lack of traditional draw-backs show better prospect than 
many other places.  
     With deepest loving greetings, 
                          Yours in His Name, 
                                 Ruhi Afnan

My dear co-worker:  
     Your letter rejoiced my heart.  I request you to persevere 
and renew your splendid efforts for the consolidation of 
the work already achieved.  I have great hopes in the `Herald 
of the South' and trust that the Editor will be guided and 
 
+P24 
strengthened in his noble undertaking.  I shall be obliged if 
you send me copies of any newspapers that may publish anything 
on the Cause as I am preparing a collection of them in 
the Holy Land.  Please assure the friends in New-Zealand of 
my continued prayers at the holy Shrines for the success of 
their pioneer work.

Dear Spiritual Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated September 13th 1926.  He was most 
gratified to read the nice and encouraging news it contained.[+E5]  
He hopes that the "Herald of the South" will daily increase 
in importance and now that it is coming out in printed form, 
obtain a great number of readers.  You should try from the 
very start to maintain a high standard for its articles.  They 
should be broad in view, clear in style and scholarly in their 
development of the different subjects.  In short the `public' 
should be taught to consider it as a paper fully worthwhile to 
read and meditate upon.  Shoghi Effendi will remember in his 
prayers all those who are working in this noble field of service.  
     Shoghi Effendi desires that you should extend his loving 
greetings to all the friends in Auckland.  He hopes that 
through their endeavours and the Master's invisible guiding 
hand they will succeed to raise the standard of the Cause in 
that land to such heights that it will arouse the interest of all 
the seeking souls and in due time win their support.  
     The members of the Master's family are well and send 
you their loving greetings.  
                           Yours in His Service,

May its voice grow in strength and power, and may its pages 
increasingly reflect the dynamic spirit of the Faith and mirror 
forth the ever-expanding activities of the friends in Australasia 
as well as in distant lands.  Persevere in your efforts, 
let not obstacles damp your zeal and determination and 
rest assured that the Power of God which is reinforcing your 
efforts will in the end triumph and enable you to fulfil your 
cherished desire.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Our beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you for 
him.  He is very pleased with your letter of Dec. 8th which 
reached him on Jan. 10th and he is very glad to hear of your 
activities in New Zealand.  He will pray earnestly that your 
sincere efforts to make &amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation widely 
known will bring forth much fruit and have a great result.  In 
the newer countries minds are more open, and the people 
more ready and willing to receive this Great Message.  
     With regard to the Queen of Rumania's 3 articles--he 
will see that you receive them correctly.  He considers the last 
one in which she acknowledges &amp;Muhammad as a true Prophet 
of God to have great importance for the East and especially in 
Persia.  This evening, I personally have had a most interesting 
conversation with Dr. &amp;Habib of &amp;Kermanshah[+E6] who is now on 
a visit to Shoghi Effendi with his wife and little girl.  He was 
telling us of the continued fanaticism of the Moslems of 
Persia--and how during two periods of the year especially, 
the fanatical Mullahs preach against the &amp;Baha'is from their 
pulpits--saying to the ignorant "No matter what evil things 
you have done during your life, or what sins you have committed, 
 
+P26 
if you kill a &amp;Baha'i who is an enemy of Islam, or even 
if you take his property or severely injure him, all your own 
sins will be wiped out and forgiven for the sake of this good 
deed of destroying an enemy of the Faith!!"--in this way 
they incite the people to deeds of violence and persecution.  
He said that the &amp;Baha'i teachings are spreading rapidly 
amongst the more educated classes--but it is difficult to 
teach the very poor and ignorant fanatical people--tho' when 
they do become Believers, they are very strong and faithful.  
The 2 periods of particular danger for the &amp;Baha'is in Persia 
are the fast month and the period of Moharram[+E7]--which lasts 
for 8 weeks.  
     Shoghi Effendi is very interested to hear of the 
engagement of your son to a &amp;Baha'i young lady--and he 
prays that in future they may do a great work for the 
"Cause".  He hopes so much that you will recover your full 
health and strength, and he will pray especially for that.  It is 
good to know that Esperanto is increasingly studied in New 
Zealand.  
     He will certainly pray for Miss Palter+F1 and her Mother 
as you ask him to do--and also for your dear son and your 
two daughters.  Please accept all best wishes from myself and 
Believe me 
                            Yours in His Service,

My dear and able co-worker:  
     I have read the issues of the "Herald" with deep joy 
and thankfulness.  I will continue to pray at the holy shrines 
that the invincible power of &amp;Baha'u'llah may add to your 
present opportunities, extend the sphere of the Journal, and

     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you for the M.O.

sufferers in Persia.  
     He is himself sending this money to the Nat. Assembly

     I take pleasure in thanking you on behalf of my dear 
Guardian for your letter of April 5th.  
     As a far away outpost of the &amp;Baha'i Faith in New Zealand, 
he is always delighted to hear from Auckland and especially 
yourself and your promising Assembly there.  You own

when through the efforts of the Auckland Assembly, centres 
will be established in every town in New Zealand.  A firm 
faith and a golden heart is yours, there still remains to turn 
other hearts into gold.  
     Miss Butler is well and often thinks of you.  Assuring

     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear and precious co-worker:  
     You should exercise your judgement and tact in delivering 
the message.  You should make an effort to understand 
the character and mind of the seeker before you speak to him 
on the Cause.  I will pray that you may be inspired and guided 
to follow the path of moderation and may become an

Dear Spiritual Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter of Feb. 14th.  He always feels great pleasure to 
obtain some news from the friends of that distant land and he 
hopes and prays that through God's blessings and your constant 
endeavours the Cause will develop in New Zealand and 
bring into its fold many sincere and devoted souls.  
 
+P29 
     The news that we daily obtain from the different parts 
of the world bring in wonderful news of the progress of the 
Movement.  The world is gradually appreciating the significance 
of this Movement which has been for so long misunderstood 
and denounced.  
                            Yours ever sincerely, 
                                        Ruhi Afnan

My dear Spiritual Sister:  
     I wish to assure you in person of my prayers for you as 
well as the dear and unforgettable friends in Auckland who 
assuredly occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart.  I 
eagerly await the news of the progress of their work, and 
trust and pray that the Almighty may guide their steps, and 
help them to surmount every obstacle.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated April 6th 1930 written from London.  He 
was very happy to learn that wherever you have been you 
have received wonderful reception from the friends.  Surely, 
it is only through such acts of hospitality that the true spirit of 
the Cause is manifested.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers 
and extend to you his hope that wherever you go you will feel 
the divine help and guidance.  He hopes that in America you 
will experience the true spirit of love that animates the friends 
there and that you will give them Shoghi Effendi's greetings.  
                            Yours ever sincerely, 
                                 Ruhi Afnan

My dear and precious co-worker:  
     I was much pleased to hear from you and to learn of 
your experiences.  I trust that the same welcome and loving-kindness 
 
+P30 
will be extended to you by the American friends.  You 
are often in my thoughts, and I will continue to pray for your 
spiritual as well as material welfare and advancement.  Convey, 
when you write to your Mother, my loving and affectionate 
greetings.  
                              Your true brother,

My dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     I thank you on behalf of the Guardian for your letter of 
April 16th.  
     He was very glad to know that you are now on your way 
to England by way of America and he hopes that you will find 
the occasion and the means of visiting the friends and making 
permanent connections with them.  Bertram will of course be 
delighted to meet you and we hope he is successful in his 
work there.  
      I suppose you have all the London addresses as the 
friends there would be delighted to meet you.  Of course if 
you do decide to visit Haifa on your way back, Shoghi Effendi 
wishes me to assure you of a most hearty welcome.  
     With his loving greetings to you all and to the young 
couple in England and with much love from all here.  
                              Sincerely yours, 
                                Soheil Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
My dear co-worker:  
     I was so pleased to hear from you and of your plans.  I 
do hope you will be able to visit the Holy Land where you 
would be most welcome in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's home.  I will pray 
for the success of your efforts from the depths of my heart 
when I visit the holy shrines.  May the Beloved enable you to 
render distinguished services to His Cause and remove every 
obstacle from your path.  
                             Your true brother, 
                                   Shoghi

                                    (22)  December 17th, 1931 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated Dec. 2nd 1931.  He is very sorry that you 
cannot on your way to New Zealand, break your journey and 
come over for a short visit to Haifa.  But these are such 
difficult days that we should not be astonished and discouraged 
if our plans fail.  He hopes however that on your way you 
will meet the friends, especially those in Port Said, for we 
have no centers in Haifa and Colombo.  
     He was also very sorry to hear that Bertram has to give 
up his studies and return home.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that 
this period he spent in America would be itself an education 
that would help him in his work in serving the Cause.  His activities 
with the young people there should have made him 
very experienced and have deepened his understanding of the 
Faith.  
     I believe Mrs Dunn is planning to come this spring for a 
visit to Haifa.  Perhaps you will meet her before she starts, 
Shoghi Effendi is eagerly waiting to see this noble soul who 
introduced the Cause into Australia and has been so self-sacrificing 
in her services.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that on returning home you will 
start again to serve the Cause and attract new souls.  The 
world is in great distress and its only salvation is in the spirit 
and teachings of the Blessed Beauty.  Let us not, we who are 
the trustees of that divine message, fail in accomplishing our 
task and fulfilling our purpose.  
     Assuring you of Shoghi Effendi's best wishes I remain 
                            Yours ever sincerely, 
                                 Ruhi Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am wiring the friends in Port-Said to meet you on your 
arrival and I very much regret your inability to come to Haifa 
and visit the holy shrines.  I will continue to pray for you, for 
 
+P32 
your son-in-law and for your dear and promising son for 
whose future work in the Cause I cherish the brightest hopes.  
I will also remember in my prayers the friends in far-away 
Australia and New Zealand and will supplicate for them all 
the Master's richest blessings and unfailing guidance.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you[+E8] for your kind 
letter of March 16th 1933, as well as the enclosed article 
which has been translated by Mr. Paul into the Maori language.  
     The Guardian has already written Mr. Paul and expressed 
to him his deep appreciation for the service he has 
rendered to the Faith, but especially to his own people who 
through the means of such literature will be acquainted with 
the teachings and will receive the light of guidance brought to 
the world by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     I believe the Guardian has already intimated his approval 
of this pamphlet and the desire that the friends in Australia 
publish and circulate it among the Maoris.  
     As regards the passages in the sacred writings indicating 
the wrath of God; Shoghi Effendi says that the Divinity 
has many attributes:  He is loving and merciful but also just.  
Just as reward and punishment, according to &amp;Baha'u'llah, are 
the pillars upon which society rests, so mercy and justice may 
be considered as their counterpart in the world to come.  
Should we disobey God and work against His commands He 
will view our acts in the light of justice and punish us for it.  
That punishment may not be in the form of fire, as some believe, 
but in the form of spiritual deprivation and degradation.  
This is why we read so often in the prayers statements 
such as "God do not deal with us with justice, but rather 
through thy infinite mercy."  The wrath of God is in the administration 
of His justice, both in this world and in the world 
 
+P33 
to come.  A God that is only loving or only just is not a perfect 
God.  The divinity has to possess both of these aspects as 
every father ought to express both in his attitude towards his 
children.  If we ponder a while, we will see that our welfare 
can be insured only when both of these divine attributes are 
equally emphasised and practiced.  
     In closing may I express the Guardian's loving greetings 
and best wishes for the progress of your work in serving 
the Cause.  
                           Yours ever sincerely, 
                                 Ruhi Afnan 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
     May the Almighty bless your efforts, deepen your 
understanding of the essentials and distinguishing features of 
His Faith, guide your steps, and aid and assist you to extend 
the range of your activities and services.  
                             Your true brother, 
                                   Shoghi

                                    (24)  September 1st, 1933 
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friend, 
     Shoghi Effendi has directed me to address you these 
few lines, acknowledging the receipt of your welcome letter 
of July 20th, 33, which he has read with deepest interest.  He 
was gratified to learn that you have newly embraced the 
Cause and that you are earnestly endeavouring to spread it 
through every possible means.  It is on young and active 
&amp;Baha'is, like you, that the Guardian centers all his hopes for 
the future progress and expansion of the Cause and it is on 
their shoulders that he lays all the responsibility for the upkeep 
of the spirit of selfless service among their fellow-believers.  
Without that spirit, no work can be successfully 
achieved.  With it triumph, though hardly-won, is but inevitable.  
You should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame 
within you the torch of faith, for through it you will surely 
find guidance, strength and eventual success.  
 
+P34 
     The Guardian is fully conscious of the difficulties that 
impede the progress of the Faith in your community.  Chief 
among these, you mention the lack of courage and of initiative 
on the part of the believers, and a feeling of inferiority 
complex which prevents them from addressing the public.  It 
is precisely these weaknesses that he wishes the friends to 
overcome, for these do not only paralyze their efforts but 
actually serve to quench the flame of faith in their hearts.  Not 
until all the friends come to realize that every one of them is 
able, in his own measure, to deliver the Message, can they 
ever hope to reach the goal that has been set before them by a 
loving and wise Master.  It is no use waiting for some able and 
eloquent teacher to take all the responsibility for the spread of 
the Cause.  For such a thing is not only contrary to the spirit of 
the Teachings but to the explicit text of the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, both of whom place the obligation 
of teaching not on any particular class, as in former 
ecclesiastical organizations, but on every faithful and loyal 
follower of the Cause.  The teaching of the Word is thus made 
universal and compulsory.  How long then shall we wait to 
carry out this command, the full wisdom of which only future 
generations will be able to appreciate?  We have no special 
teachers in the Cause.  Everyone is a potential teacher.  He has 
only to use what God has given him and thus prove that he is 
faithful to his trust.  
     Visiting teachers, who are, at least in a general way, 
supposed to be more competent and able than the rest, are undoubtedly 
of a great help.  But these can never replace the 
mass of individual believers and fulfil what must be inevitably 
accomplished through the collective effort and wisdom of 
the community at large.  What visiting teachers are supposed 
to do is to give the final touch to the work that has been done, 
to consolidate rather than supplement individual efforts and 
thereby direct them in a constructive and suitable channel.  
Their task is to encourage and inspire individual believers, 
and to broaden and deepen their vision of the task that is to be 
 
+P35 
done.  And this, not by virtue of any inherent spiritual right, 
but in the spirit of simple and whole-hearted cooperation.  
     It is in this light that Shoghi Effendi views the whole 
problem of teaching not only in New Zealand but in all the 
&amp;Baha'i world.  He would, therefore, encourage you to take a 
leading part in the carrying out of his wishes on this point, to 
take yourself an active interest in teaching, not only private 
but also public, and in this way stimulate the friends to follow 
your example.  It is then, and only then, that there can be a 
need for a qualified and competent visiting teacher in order to 
bring to full fruition individual teaching efforts.  
     Assuring you of our Guardian's fervent prayers on your 
behalf, so that you may be increasingly blessed in your efforts 
for the spread of the Message.  
                            Yours in His Service, 
                                 H. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
     May the Beloved guide your steps, cheer your heart, 
deepen your understanding of the distinguishing features of 
His Faith and enable you to render the sacred Threshold 
unique and inestimable services, 
                             Your true brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother, 
     The Guardian has duly received and deeply enjoyed 
reading your letters dated November 30th, December 27th, 
1933 and February 4th, 1934.  He is sorry that unforeseen circumstances 
have caused such a long delay in acknowledging 
their receipt.  He hopes, however, that the matters you have 
submitted for his consideration have not suffered as a result.  
     Since your last letter to him, he has heard of the 
gratifying news of the formation of your N.S.A.+F1  This historic 
step in the development of the Administration in Australia 
and New Zealand is, he feels, bound to react favourably on 
the further expansion and consolidation of the Faith in these 
far-off lands.  He is fervently supplicating &amp;Baha'u'llah that 
the newly-elected members of the N.S.A.,+F1 upon whom has 
been placed such a tremendous responsibility, be assisted in 
the discharge of their sacred obligations and duties to the 
Faith.  
                            Yours in His Service, 
                                 H. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     The splendid reports you have sent me have been incorporated 
in the manuscript and sent to the &amp;Baha'i World 
Committee in America.  The formation of the national assembly 
of Australia and New Zealand will no doubt furnish you 
with new and refreshing material for your next report in 
1936.  I will pray for your success and deeply value the manifold 
and constant services you are rendering the Cause of 
God.  
                       Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian was profoundly grieved to learn of the 
passing away of your dear mother, and has directed me to 
convey to you and to the bereaved members of your family, 
his heartfelt condolences and sympathy for this severe loss 
which you have sustained.  
     Mrs Blundell's departure is, indeed, a loss not only to 
her family, but also to the community of her fellow-believers 
in New Zealand.  For in her they have come to lose one of 
their oldest and most distinguished co-workers.  
     The Guardian well remembers her pilgrimage to the 
Holy Land, and has always cherished the hope that she would 
once more be enabled to visit the shrines.  But alas, her departed 
soul has taken its flight from this world, leaving her 
friends and relatives in a state of profoundest grief.  Their 
only consolation now is the realization that through her 
painstaking and sustained labours for the Cause in Auckland 
Mrs Blundell has left an abiding monument to her memory, 
and one which will continue for many years to come to inspire 
and strengthen them all in their collective endeavours for the 
establishment of the Faith in New Zealand.  
     Shoghi Effendi is fervently praying for the soul of our 
departed sister, and is entreating &amp;Baha'u'llah to give her her 
full share of divine blessings in the other world.  
     May I also assure you of his ardent supplications for 
you, and for all the friends in Auckland.  
                            Yours in His Service, 
                                 H. Rabbani

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Shoghi Effendi has just been in receipt of your kind 
letter of the fourteenth of December last, and has read its 
 
+P41 
contents with deep interest and gratification.  It made him so 
happy, indeed, to learn that you are pursuing your activities 
for the Faith with such steadfastness and self-sacrifice, and 
also that through your beautiful and loving spirit those members 
of your family who have not yet embraced the Faith are 
being gradually attracted to it.  He is ardently entreating 
&amp;Baha'u'llah that through your inspiration and guidance their 
interest in the Teachings may wax stronger and lead them to 
eventually espouse His Cause.  
     With reference to the suggestion made by Mr Alexander+F1 
for taking a record of the Guardian's voice, he wishes 
me to inform you that although he fully appreciates the spirit 
in which this and similar suggestions are made to him he is, 
nevertheless, extremely reluctant that the believers should 
give any prominence to his writings, specially in the meetings 
which, he is firmly convinced, should be chiefly devoted 
to the reading and study of the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah and the 
Master.  
     In closing will you kindly convey his greetings and 
appreciation to all the friends in Auckland, and particularly to 
the members of your family who, he hopes, will be assisted 
and sustained in their labours for the spread of the Message.  
                            Yours in His Service, 
                                  H. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am deeply grateful for the services you are so devotedly 
rendering and the efforts you are so diligently exerting 
for the promotion of our beloved Faith.  I will continue to

heart.  
                             Your true brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian has just received your kind message of 
the second of January last, and wishes me to thank you for it.  
     It comforted him greatly to learn that, despite the severe 
loss which you have sustained through the passing away 
of your mother, you are still engaged as actively as before in 
the work which you have set your heart to accomplish for the 
Cause in Auckland.  The agonies of her earthly separation 
from you, difficult though they may be to bear, will assuredly 
be transmuted through the blessings of &amp;Baha'u'llah into a 
peaceful and abiding joy.  In serving a Cause for which your 
mother sacrificed so much you will no doubt come to find the 
very purpose of your life, and the true secret of happiness in 
this, as well as in the next world.  
     The Guardian is fervently praying for you and for your 
brother, that you both may be strengthened and guided in 
your services to the Cause, and in this way continue and 
enrich still further the noble heritage which your mother has 
left for the Faith in New-Zealand.  
     With loving &amp;Baha'i greetings to you and to all the 
friends in Auckland.  
                            Yours in His Service,

Dear co-worker:  
     I wish to assure you in person of my heartfelt sympathy 
in the loss you have sustained, and of my loving and ardent 
prayers for the departed soul.  The work with which her name 
will for ever be associated will confer upon her imperishable 
glory, and her example will serve to stimulate the rising generation 
to follow in her footsteps, and carry on the work she 
has so nobly initiated.  
                             Your true brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Many thanks indeed from the Guardian for your welcome 
message of April 17th just received.  He would certainly 
be delighted to meet you in Haifa next year, and hopes 
that your visit to the Holy Shrines will give you a fresh vigour 
and a renewed determination to carry on your work for the 
Cause.  He specially cherishes the hope that your trip to 
England will be of great benefit to you, and also to our 
English believers.  They will be only too happy to welcome 
you in their midst, and will thoroughly appreciate any assistance 
which you may give them during your sojourn in 
England.  
     The Guardian has learned with deep gratification of the 
news of the teaching work carried on by the Auckland believers.  
He wishes you to kindly assure them all of his best wishes 
and fervent prayers for the success of their labours.  May 
&amp;Baha'u'llah bless, guide and strengthen them in every step 
they are taking for the spread of His Faith and the consolidation 
of its institutions in this far-off land.  
     Assuring you too of his special prayers on your behalf 
at the Holy Shrines, and with warmest greetings, 
                            Yours in His Service,

desire to visit the Holy Shrines may be fulfilled 
very soon, and that through this pilgrimage you may attain a 
renewed zeal and vigour, as well as a new vision of the task 
you are called upon to accomplish for the Faith in New-Zealand.  
     In closing let me assure you and your fellow-workers in 
Auckland of his profound appreciation of your determination 
to press forward the work in the teaching field.  He is ardently

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of the fifth 
November, and exceedingly regrets that, owing to certain 
family difficulties, you have found it necessary to cancel your 
trip to the Holy Land.  He is specially grieved to learn of the 
many cares and sorrows with which your daughter has been 
so sadly afflicted of late, and wishes me to hasten to convey to 
you his most loving sympathy, as well as the assurance of his 
prayers for the removal of the family troubles with which you 
are beset.  He fervently hopes that these afflictive trials confronting 
you and your beloved daughter will all serve to 
quicken your spiritual energies, and that the outcome of it all 
will be to open before you new horizons of service, and fresh 
fields for teaching the Message.  May &amp;Baha'u'llah give you 
patience to courageously withstand these tests, and full guidance 
 
+P45 
to use them as a means to more active, concentrated and 
selfless service to His Cause.  Do assure, therefore, your 
daughter not to feel disheartened, but to confidently endeavour 
to overcome her domestic sorrows and cares.  
     In closing may I express the Guardian's hope that, as 
soon as your family problems are solved, you may be able to 
undertake your long-cherished pilgrimage to the Holy 
Shrines.  He is ardently praying for the materialization of your 
hopes and plans in this connection.  
     It is a pleasure to learn of the successful visit of Mr 
Schopflocher+F1 to Auckland, and of the warm welcome he has 
been accorded by you and the friends.  This is a true evidence 
of the strong ties of fellowship so closely uniting the friends 
throughout the world, and of the deep affection which the believers 
in New-Zealand cherish for their fellow-believers in 
every region and clime.  
     With renewed and warmest greetings to you and to the 
friends in Auckland, 
                      Yours in the Guardian's Service, 
                                 H. Rabbani

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     Many thanks for your letter of September 16th addressed 
to our beloved Guardian.  He is most pleased indeed 
to hear of Miss Holloway's interest in the Cause and appreciates 
keenly your efforts for bringing about her full confirmation

directly and giving her the addresses of some individuals and 
centers in South Africa.  He hopes that through contact with 
the friends her interest in the Teachings will be considerably 
increased and she will be stimulated to help in spreading their 
knowledge throughout South Africa.  
     The Guardian wishes you to keep in closest touch with 
her through correspondence, and to send her suitable literature 
on the Cause, and to endeavour to make her join actively 
the Faith.  
     Again with many thanks for introducing this lady who 
indeed seems to be a most promising worker, and with loving 
greetings to all the friends in Auckland.  
                         Yours ever in His Service,

to you such a warm hospitality all through your stay.[+E9]

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
      Your very cordial message of the 17th November addressed 
to our beloved Guardian has duly reached him, and 
he has noted with keen appreciation indeed the desire you had 
expressed of visiting the Holy Shrines on your way back to 
New-Zealand.  
     As you must have surely read in the newspapers, however, 
the general situation in Palestine is at present so gravely 
disturbed as to make it quite impossible for you to undertake 
this trip in the next few months, and in view of this the 
Guardian would advise that you postpone your visit until the 
November of next year, by which time, it is hoped, the situation 
throughout the country will have sufficiently improved 
to permit you to undertake this long-cherished pilgrimage.  
The Guardian, needless to say, would be also most delighted 
to meet you, and to hear from you directly of the news of the 
Cause in New-Zealand, and to discuss certain matters which 
the N.S.A.+F1 has asked you to present to him for his instructions.  
     Regarding your question whether there is any special 
ceremony which the believers should perform when they 
wish to "name" a baby; the Teachings do not provide for any 
ceremony whatever on such occasions.  We have no "baptismal 
service" in the Cause, such as the Christians have.  
There would be no objection, however, for the friends to 
 
______________________ 
+F1 The National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia and New 
+F1 Zealand 
 
+P48 
come together on such happy occasions, provided they do not 
hold an official public ceremony, and provided also they 
strictly avoid uniformity and rigidity in all such practices.  No 
rule whatsoever that would tend to be rigid and uniform 
should be allowed in such secondary matters, particularly as 
there are no specific instructions in the Teachings regarding 
them.  
     With the warmest good wishes of the Guardian to you 
and to the friends, and assuring you again of his hearty welcome 
to visit the Holy Shrines during next autumn, and with 
greetings, 
                            Yours in His Service, 
                                 H. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I shall indeed grieve if the situation in Palestine should 
prevent our meeting and prevent your pilgrimage to the Holy 
Shrines.  I pray that this may not be the case.  I am so eager to 
meet you, and express in person my deep and abiding sense of 
appreciation of the splendid and historic services you have 
rendered.  I will continue to pray for you from the depths of 
my heart.  
                       Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge 
the receipt of your letter dated February 25th, informing him 
of the date of your departure from England, and your inability 
to defer your visit to Haifa till next November.  He regrets indeed 
that you should find it impossible to extend your stay in 
Europe and come to Palestine in autumn, as the situation here 
is now so tense and dangerous that there seems very little 
hope of any real amelioration in security conditions to take 
 
+P49 
place by next May.  General conditions throughout the country 
are, at present, even worse than a month ago, and the tension 
is daily increasing.  
      In case, however, security is reestablished by the time 
you reach Port-Said, you would be welcome to visit the 
Shrines, but the Guardian would be still away.  
     Wishing you again a successful and happy return 
home, and with the renewed assurance of the Guardian's 
prayers for your welfare, protection and guidance, 
                            Yours most sincerely, 
                                 H. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I deeply regret that the situation in Palestine has not 
yet improved as I realize how eager you are to visit the Holy 
Shrines.  If however when you reach Port-Said it will at all be 
possible for you to visit the Shrine, you will be most welcome, 
I assure you.  May the Almighty fulfil the dearest hope of your 
heart, 
                             Your true brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter 
to him of May 10th, which just came.  
     He was, as already expressed in the cable he sent you, 
greatly impressed by the statement in the Quarterly on the 
true &amp;Baha'i attitude at the present time.  It displayed a correctness 
of viewpoint, a courage, and a loyalty to &amp;Baha'u'llah 
which has led him to disseminate it far and wide:  in the 
American News Letter, in the two Haifa News Letters, 
English and Persian, etc.  It was indeed a timely and most 
noble contribution to the Faith.  
     The friends in both Australia and New Zealand seem to 
 
+P50 
have developed a most outstanding soundness in their relation 
to the teachings.  This leads Shoghi Effendi to believe 
that they will make great contributions to the unfoldment of 
the world-wide aspects of the Faith.  
     His prayers are always with you, and he most deeply 
appreciates the splendid services you are rendering the 
Cause, and will pray that the way will open for you to do even 
greater work and in an ever widening field.  
      Please assure all the dear friends of Auckland of his 
loving remembrance and his prayers for their work.  
                             With &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                R. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I cannot refrain from adding a few words in person to 
assure you of my lively appreciation of your constancy and of 
the distinctive services you are so ably and devotedly rendering 
our beloved Faith.  That you may be able to extend 
their range is my fervent and constant prayer.  Persevere, and 
be confident and happy.  
                       Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 12th 
has been received, and he has instructed me to answer it on 
his behalf.  The previous letter you mention cannot have 
reached him, as he always replies to letters from the friends.  
     Your book[+E10] touches on a very important subject, and 
he regrets that he cannot read it himself.  His work is so 
pressing and multiplying so fast that he invariably refuses to 
go over the manuscripts the friends send him as he simply 
cannot attend to such things as well as all his other work.  You 
should send it to the Reviewing Com. in the U.S.A. and ask 
 
+P51 
their advice.  Perhaps an outside publisher would be interested 
in it?  The &amp;Baha'i funds have such heavy demands 
made on them at present that even essential literature must 
often wait to be published, unfortunately.  
     He fully appreciates the fact that the believers locally, 
in different parts of the world, often feel that their political 
party is in many ways striving to accomplish ideals akin to 
our &amp;Baha'i aims--but the fact remains that the only way for 
the &amp;Baha'is to preserve their international character, their 
unity and integrity, is for them individually to sacrifice these 
desired political affiliations for the universal good and protection 
of the Faith.  There is no political party in existence 
with whose platform we wholly agree, and we must abstain 
from membership in such parties.  Likewise people who join 
the Faith must have the courage and conviction to leave their 
political affiliations behind.  
     There is no reason why this should cause enmity as they 
are not joining another party, but a universal Faith striving for 
the advancement of the entire human race.  He thinks there is 
very little possibility of any politician joining the Faith.  The 
sacrifice of such individuals' personal ambitions is too great a 
one for them to make.  The condition of the world today is 
such that it is obvious no political solution to its problems is 
going to be found.  We &amp;Baha'is must therefore concentrate on 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's World Order--the true solution.  
     He assures you he will pray your teaching labours may 
be very successful.  He will also pray for your dear mother's 
welfare.  
                           With warmest greetings, 
                                 R. Rabbani

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of October 28 has been received, and our 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     First, let me say how very deeply he appreciates the 
services you have been rendering our glorious Faith in Australia, 
and particularly Perth, during the past two years.  Your 
trip has been of real assistance to the teaching work, and it 
pleased him greatly.  
     Regarding Mr. ...:  it was with the approval of the 
Guardian that his name was removed from the voting list.  It is 
very bad for the Cause to have a member of the Community, 
actively, in the public eye, teaching the Faith, and at the same 
time showing dishonest characteristics.  We cannot possibly 
say that because a person also has many virtues, faults as 
grave as lying and dishonourable conduct regarding money, 
can be overlooked!  This means that we tolerate as representatives 
of our Faith people who flagrantly disobey its laws and 
fundamental teachings.  This does not mean there is no hope 
for Mr. ...; let him change his conduct, if he really loves 
the Cause, and then a way will be opened for him to again be 
active.  But the change must be real and obvious; mere protestations 
will serve no purpose.  
     He urges you to continue your services in the teaching 
field in New Zealand, and also to write to the friends in Australia 
who are disturbed about Mr. ..., and strengthen 
their faith and determination.  
                           With warmest greetings, 
                                  R. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
     May the Almighty, Whose Cause you serve with such 
zeal and devotion, reward you for your labours, and graciously 
assist you to win great victories for His Faith and its 
institutions, 
                             Your true brother,

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of November 1st was received, and, although 
our beloved Guardian is so busy at present on the 
Shrine work here that his mail is piling up alarmingly, he 
does want to send you a word of appreciation for your fine, 
constructive spirit and the services you are rendering the 
Faith.  
     Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity.  But its root is 
lack of faith in the system of &amp;Baha'u'llah (i.e. the administrative 
order) and lack of obedience to Him--for He has forbidden 
it.  If the &amp;Baha'is would follow the &amp;Baha'i laws in voting, 
in electing, in serving, and in abiding by assembly decisions, 
all this waste of strength thru criticizing others could 
be diverted into cooperation and achieving the Plan.  Keep on 
trying to point this out to them!  
                             With &amp;Baha'i love, 
                                 R. Rabbani

New Delhi Conference, as it will be a very historic occasion, 
and the more &amp;Baha'is from Australia and New Zealand that

of your letter dated Feb. 18th 1926.  He well appreciates the 
whole-hearted contributions the friends, the world over, have

My dear &amp;Baha'i sister, 
     I thank you on behalf of Shoghi Effendi for your letter 
of Mar. 8th and for the second copy of the draft that you had 
sent enclosed.  
     He has already received and cashed the first draft and 
has sent you the receipt for it.  
     He appreciates very much indeed the help of the New 
Zealand friends and I am sure they would all be very glad to 
 
+P58 
know that the surroundings of the holy Shrines on Mt Carmel 
have already been safeguarded.  This is such a relief to Shoghi 
Effendi and all the friends who feared lest the approaches 
should fall into the hands of speculators and interested men.  
     With heartfelt greetings to the friends in New Zealand.  
I am 
                            Yours ever in His Service,

Dear fellow-worker:  
     I wish to reassure you in person of my continued 
prayers for you as well as for those friends who in the distant 
city of Auckland are labouring for the advancement of the 
Cause in New Zealand.  Please convey to them my brotherly 
greetings and very best wishes.  I can never forget them and 
they are ever near to me.

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian has duly received your beautiful message 
of 2nd of December, and he wishes me to thank you for 
it, as well as for the enclosed copy of the Auckland Assembly's 
circular letter which he has delivered to the spiritual assembly 
of Haifa for their perusal.  
     He also wishes me to ask you to kindly inform Mrs 
Blundell of the receipt of the twenty five copies of the Maori 
pamphlet which she had lately mailed to him.  These, together 
with those she had sent previously, have all been placed in his 
own library, and a few copies have also been placed in the 
Mansion of &amp;Baha'u'llah at &amp;Bahji for the information of the 
general public.  
     In closing the Guardian wishes me to renew to you the 
expressions of his abiding and genuine appreciation of your 
labours for the Cause in Auckland, and particularly in connection 
 
+P59 
with your duties as secretary of the local assembly.  
He is praying from the very depths of his heart for your progress

Beloved &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your 
letter of the 30th March informing him of the date of Miss 
Kitty Carpenter's arrival in Port-Said.  You can be sure that 
the friends will be most delighted to meet her, and to render 
her journey to Haifa as safe and comfortable as possible.  
     The Guardian himself is eagerly looking forward to the 
pleasure of meeting her, and cherishes the hope that through 
this pilgrimage she may receive a renewed stimulus to better 
work for the promotion of the Faith upon her return 
home....

Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister, 
     ...The Guardian would also advise that the local assemblies 
take a similar step, and obtain official recognition 
from the authorities.  In case the Auckland assembly has been 
registered in the government, will you be so kind as to send 
him photostatic reproductions of any registration papers or 
documents that the Auckland friends may have obtained from 
the authorities, as he wishes to have them published in the 
next "&amp;Baha'i World"....

     The Guardian wishes me to express his loving thanks 
for your letter of the third instant, enclosing the half-yearly 
reports of the Perth and Auckland Spiritual Assemblies, all of 
which he has been delighted to read.  
     He wishes you to write the Auckland Assembly assuring 
them of his approval of the request they have made on behalf 
of Miss Kitty Carpenter for permission to visit Haifa.  He 
has every hope that through this pilgrimage she will be 
greatly refreshed and strengthened spiritually, and will upon 
her return home impart to the friends in New-Zealand some 
measure of the inspiration she will gain through close contact 
with the Holy Shrines....

Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     ...As Mrs Axford requested Mrs Thomas to write 
about her &amp;Baha'i life there is every reason to respect her

Auckland Assembly should be consulted, as her, (Mrs Axford's),

all concerned....

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letter on behalf of the Assembly, (as well as your

the pressure of work piled up during the long and serious illness

Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     ...I would like to add that the Guardian does not consider 
that it is advisable for New Zealand to be separated in 
the near future from Australia, and come under the jurisdiction 
 
+P67 
of an independent National Assembly.  He considers that 
the present arrangement is the best one until such time as 
there are more assemblies flourishing in New Zealand, and he 
would consider the basis for a National Assembly strong 
enough there to support such an institution....

Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the 
&amp;Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     ...He was very happy to see that Mrs Dunn was able 
to attend the New Zealand &amp;Baha'i Summer School.  For a 
woman of her age, this was surely a remarkable achievement, 
and must have been a great inspiration to the New Zealand 
friends, coming as she did so freshly from the last Intercontinental 
Teaching Conference held in New Delhi....  
     He attaches great importance to teaching the aboriginal 
Australians, and also in converting more Maoris to the Faith, 
and hopes that the &amp;Baha'is will devote some attention to contacting 
both of these minority groups....  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     ...The multiplication of &amp;Baha'i isolated centres, 
groups and local assemblies, in both Australia and New 
Zealand--a process that has been steadily and rapidly developing 
since the inauguration of the Ten-Year Plan, is 
likewise of paramount importance in the years immediately 
ahead.  The development of these institutions, particularly in 
New Zealand, will no doubt hasten the emergence of an independent 
National Spiritual Assembly in that territory, and 
will lend a tremendous impetus to the onward march of the 
Faith in those regions....  
     The purchase of a building in Auckland destined to 
serve as the National &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds of the &amp;Baha'is of New 
Zealand, is yet another objective on which attention should 
 
+P68 
be immediately focused--in anticipation of the erection of 
yet another pillar of the future House of Justice in that remote 
part of the world....

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     ...The news of the purchase of the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds 
in Auckland was most welcome.  The acquisition of this 
building is really one of the pre-requisites for the formation of 
the National Assembly of New Zealand; he hopes that the 
impetus this has given to the work of the Faith there, combined 
with the devotion of the &amp;Baha'is will speed the formation 
of local Assemblies, which alone constitute the necessary 
firm foundation for the National Body, a Body which 
will be one of the direct pillars supporting the International 
House of Justice.  He urges, therefore, your Assembly to give 
all the teaching help it can to New Zealand; and to encourage 
the believers there to do their utmost to achieve their 
goals....  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     ...The purchase of the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds in Auckland, 
as the future headquarters of the New Zealand National 
Spiritual Assembly, is another accomplishment that merits 
the highest praise....  
     ...The establishment of &amp;Baha'i endowments in the 
Dominion of New Zealand is yet another responsibility devolving 
upon their elected national representatives, a responsibility 
which should be discharged prior to the emergence 
of an independent national assembly in that distant and 
promising island.  
      Whilst these immediate goals are being steadily and resolutely 
 
+P69 
pursued, attention should, likewise, be particularly 
directed to the vital need for the constant multiplication of 
isolated centres, groups and local assemblies, as well as to 
the necessity of increasing, to an unprecedented degree, the 
number of the avowed adherents of the Faith who can directly 
and effectively contribute to the broadening of its foundations 
and the expansion of its nascent institutions.  Particularly in 
the Dominion of New Zealand, where a pillar of the future 
Universal House of Justice will soon be erected, must a fresh 
impetus be lent to this vital process which can alone reinforce 
the foundations on which this projected institution must ultimately 
rest....

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:

the &amp;Baha'i teachings.  At a future date such matters will no 
doubt be taken up by the International House of Justice....  
     He is delighted to hear that the New Zealand friends are 
so eagerly carrying on their work in preparation for their National

Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of August 3rd with enclosure has been received 
by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     He was happy to see this report of the activities of the 
&amp;Baha'is in New Zealand, and will be pleased to receive a 
copy of your News Letter regularly.  
     The Guardian wishes your Committee and the believers 
there to know that he has high hopes for their future 
achievements in that far-off land, where they are now on the 
threshold of that historic event, the election of their own National 
Spiritual Assembly.  He deeply values their devotion, 
and the eager and fervent character of their services.  
                        With warm &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                 R. Rabbani 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
     Assuring you of my loving prayers for your success and 
spiritual advancement, 
                             Your true brother,

                                    (64)  April 4th, 1957 
Message from the Guardian at the inception of the New 
Zealand National Spiritual Assembly.  
     I share with the assembled delegates, gathered to elect, 
on this historic occasion, the second National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of the Antipodes, the feelings of profound 
satisfaction and gratitude to &amp;Baha'u'llah evoked by 
 
+P71 
this epoch-making event in the evolution of His Faith in that 
far off region of the globe.  I am deeply conscious of the decisive 
share which the Australian &amp;Baha'i Community, labouring 
during more than three decades, for the spread of the 
light of this glorious revelation among the highly progressive 
people of that distant continent, has had in the laying of the 
foundations of the Administrative Order and the erection of 
yet another pillar of the future Universal House of Justice in 
this remote Dominion.  
     The emergence of this independent &amp;Baha'i Community, 
no matter how limited its numerical strength and modest its 
resources, must be regarded as a highly significant development 
in the rise and establishment of the &amp;Baha'i Faith in the 
Pacific Area, and should synchronise with the formulation, 
on the part of the National Spiritual Assembly now being 
elected in that Island, of a subsidiary Six-Year-Plan, designed 
to reinforce substantially the numerical strength of the 
Community; to multiply its Centres, as well as its Local 
Spiritual Assemblies; to incorporate the solidly grounded 
amongst them; to inaugurate a National Fund; to obtain 
recognition for both the &amp;Baha'i marriage certificate and the 
&amp;Baha'i Holy Days; to lend an unprecedented impetus to the 
conversion of the Maoris, and to ensure their active participation 
in the conduct of &amp;Baha'i Administrative Institutions; to 
extend the scope of the work already initiated in the South 
Island; to incorporate the newly formed National Spiritual 
Assembly, and to select and acquire a site for the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of that Dominion.  
     I call upon the members of the Australian National 
Spiritual Assembly, as well as the members of the Australian 
&amp;Baha'i Community, to continue to lend their valued support 
to this newly pledged sister Community, and to enable it, 
through the extension of material assistance as well as the 
dispatch of visiting teachers and pioneers, to contribute, in 
an ever increasing measure, to the furtherance of the 
magnificent and colossal campaign now being so vigorously 
 
+P72 
conducted in the North, in the South, and in the heart of the 
Pacific Ocean.  
     May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to 
energise this small yet resolute forward marching, dedicated 
community, and may the outcome of the collective efforts of 
its members contribute decisively to the triumphant consummation 
of the World Crusade on which the entire body of the 
followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah have so confidently embarked.

Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of New Zealand.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Friends:  
     Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you 
on his behalf and inform you that the Hand of the Cause, Mr 
&amp;Varqa, will shortly be forwarding to your assembly the 
equivalent of five hundred English pounds, as the Guardian's 
contribution to your newly established National Fund.  
     He hopes that in the formulation of your plans, particular 
attention will be given to the all-important teaching 
work, the foundation of all the activities of the Faith and the 
most urgent task facing the friends in this critical period the 
world is passing through.  
     You may be sure he will pray for your success, 
                          With &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                 R. Rabbani 
 
                        _______________ 
 
                                    (66)  June 27th, 1957 
Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of New Zealand.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Sister:  
     I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to write you 
on his behalf and assure you he was most happy to receive 
your letter dated May 4.  
 
+P73 
     He rejoices with the New Zealand &amp;Baha'is in the formation 
of their historic National Assembly.  They are now 
firmly launched on the course of their own destiny, and undoubtedly 
the Faith will go forward very much faster.  They 
have an advantage not shared by many of their fellow National 
Assemblies, of exclusively administering the affairs of 
the Faith in a small area, which means that they can function 
much more efficiently.  When one remembers the many years 
that the New Zealand and Australian believers toiled to carry 
on the work in those two countries, with the sea in between, 
and inadequate funds to provide transportation, which necessitated 
so much of the National Assembly's work being carried 
on by correspondence, one can appreciate the advantages 
you now enjoy.  
     The formation of a new National Body in any case is an 
organic thing, and a new and lively flow of life will go out 
into all the members of the Community from this Assembly.  
     As regards the question you asked him about the site for 
the Temple, this need not be a large piece of land at this 
time--three or four acres would be sufficient for the site if 
you find suitable land is expensive.  If the worst comes to the 
worst, when the time comes to build the Temple, the site can 
be changed.  In Uganda some years ago, they purchased a 
Temple site, and later, a large piece of land for their endowment.  
With the Guardian's permission, they exchanged the 
two as the Endowment's position was better for the Temple.  
So you see, it need not be too rigid.  The point is to get a Temple 
site as soon as possible.  He feels it should be in the outskirts 
of Auckland, within easy motoring distance, so that the 
friends can attend services there.  Naturally the closer to the 
city, the better.  
     As you formulate your plans and carry them out for the 
work entrusted to you during the next six years, he wishes 
you to particularly bear in mind the need of teaching the 
Maoris.  These original discoverers of New Zealand are of a 
very fine race, and they are a people long admired for their 
 
+P74 
noble qualities; and special effort should be made, not only to 
contact the Maoris in the cities and draw them into the Faith, 
but to go to their towns and live amongst them and establish 
Assemblies in which at least the majority of the believers will 
be Maoris, if not all.  This would be indeed a worthy 
achievement.  
     The beloved Guardian assures you all of his prayers for 
the success of the historic work you are now undertaking, and 
he feels sure you will achieve your goals.  
                       With warmest &amp;Baha'i greetings, 
                                 &amp;Ruhiyyih 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The emergence of the New Zealand National Spiritual 
Assembly, as a result of the convocation of the first &amp;Baha'i 
historic Convention held in that far-away and promising 
Dominion, will be hailed by posterity as an event of the 
greatest significance, marking the erection of another pillar 
designed to support, in the South Pacific area, the future 
Universal House of Justice.  My heart overflows with happiness 
and is filled with gratitude as I contemplate the splendid 
progress achieved, in recent years, in that far-off island, and 
note the loyalty and devotion with which the members of this 
valiant community, now standing on the threshold of unprecedented 
achievements, have discharged their manifold 
and sacred responsibilities.  
     The six brief years that now lie ahead must witness a 
swift expansion in the scope of &amp;Baha'i activities throughout 
the length and breadth of that Dominion, as well as a steady 
consolidation of the foundations of the institutions that have 
been so painstakingly laid.  The Six-Year Plan upon which the 
New Zealand believers have now so auspiciously embarked 
must be diligently prosecuted and brought to a triumphant 
conclusion.  All must participate, whether young or old, veterans 
as well as newly enrolled believers, all must contribute 
their share to the ultimate success of this mighty collective 
 
+P75 
enterprise, however limited their means, however modest 
their abilities, however restricted the range of their previous 
experiences.  
     The increase in the number of the avowed adherents of 
the Faith; the multiplication of isolated centres, groups, and 
local assemblies; the incorporation of the newly formed National 
Spiritual Assembly as well as all firmly grounded local 
assemblies; the recognition of the &amp;Baha'i marriage 
certificate by the civil authorities, and of the &amp;Baha'i Holy 
Days by the Superintendent of schools in that island; the 
rapid conversion of the Maoris and their close association 
with the white believers in the administration of the affairs of 
the community; the consolidation of the work energetically 
initiated in the South Island; the selection and purchase of the 
site for the Mother Temple of New Zealand--these stand out 
as the foremost objectives of the Plan now demanding of its 
high minded determined prosecutors, the utmost consecration, 
unrelaxing vigilance and the noblest self-sacrifice.  
     The tasks, challenging the spirit and resources of this 
community, whose numerical strength is as yet so limited, 
whose material resources are so circumscribed, whose past 
experiences have, in many respects, been confined to a narrow 
range, are truly formidable.  The alloted time, during 
which so stupendous an undertaking is to be consummated, is 
short.  The obstacles confronting its members are varied and 
manifold.  Yet the sustaining grace promised to all those who 
will arise, with single-mindedness, courage, dedication and 
high resolve to aid in the attainment of these noble objectives, 
is of such potency that no earthly power can resist the ultimate 
fulfilment of so glorious a task, or even delay its eventual 
fruition.  
     I appeal most earnestly to all those who, in both the 
teaching and administrative fields, are committed to carry 
out so magnificent an enterprise, as well as to those who, in 
an unofficial capacity, are called upon to further, by every 
means in their power, the interests of this epoch-making 
 
+P76 
Plan, to dedicate themselves, at this hour to the arduous, yet 
infinitely precious task they have shouldered, and to devote, 
in the days and years that lie ahead, every ounce of their 
energy to the systematic prosecution of a Plan, on which the 
immediate destinies of the entire New Zealand &amp;Baha'i community 
directly depend; and which can alone provide the 
stepping-stone to the still more brilliant achievements destined 
to ennoble the annals of the Faith in that remote island 
of the globe.

Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia.  
Dear &amp;Baha'i Brother:  
     ...As regards the "Herald of the South" magazine, 
in view of the important work lying ahead of your Assembly, 
and the fact that this magazine is a drain on the limited resources 
of the Community, he thinks it would be quite all 
right to suspend publication until a future date when the 
financial situation permits such expenditures to be made with 
relative ease.  He leaves, however, the final decision to your 
Assembly.  
     The Committee responsible for the publication of this 
magazine has certainly laboured valiantly throughout the 
years, and the publication will be missed by its readers.  
However, it is some years since the American &amp;Baha'i Magazine 
was abandoned for similar reasons, and the Guardian 
feels that you can do so in Australia, and the funds be used to 
better advantage, at this time.  However, now that you have 
found a printer in Sydney and appointed a new committee, he 
thinks you should continue it and give the new Plan a try....  
     The successful culmination of the long standing 
partnership of the Australian and New Zealand believers thru 
the emergence of the New Zealand N. S. A. is a source of 
great satisfaction to the Guardian, and no doubt to all the 
 
+P77 
members of both communities.  He feels sure this will mark 
a turning point in the work in the Antipodes and the 
neighbouring islands and give a new lease of life to the 
teaching work throughout that area.  Both your Assembly and 
that of New Zealand have now emerged into your permanent 
form as pillars of the future International House of Justice.  
The bones of the skeleton of the World Order are growing 
strong, but only the teaching work can clothe them with 
flesh....  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     ...Particularly commendable, and indeed exemplary, 
has been the share of the Australian believers in enabling 
the New-Zealand &amp;Baha'i Community to make such 
rapid strides, in recent years, strides that have prepared it 
for the assumption of its sacred and vital function as an independent 
community, and which culminated in the formation 
of a body qualified to take its place, and assume the weighty 
responsibilities incumbent on it, as a distinct and separate 
member of the world-wide family of &amp;Baha'i national and regional 
Spiritual Assemblies....

     ALCOHOL                           (74)  
 
     You had asked in connection with the subject of prohibition.  
Of course in every country one must take into consideration 
the exact conditions as to whether by force of 
legislation people can be stopped from drinking, but as a 
principle the &amp;Baha'i teachings are quite against drinking intoxicating 
liquors and from the &amp;Baha'i point of view every 
thing that helps to stop drinking is welcome.

     EVOLUTION                         (75)  
 
     We cannot prove man was always man for this is a fundamental 
doctrine, but it is based on the assertion that nothing 
can exceed its own potentialities, that everything, a stone, a 
tree, an animal and a human being existed in plan, potentially, 
from the very "beginning" of creation.  We don't believe 
man has always had the form of man, but rather that 
from the outset he was going to evolve into the human form 
and species and not be a haphazard branch of the ape family.  
     You see our whole approach to each matter is based on 
the belief that God sends us divinely inspired Educators; what 
they tell us is fundamentally true, what science tells us today 
is true; tomorrow may be entirely changed to better explain a 
new set of facts.  
     When &amp;Abdu'l-Baha says man breaks the laws of nature, 
He means we shape nature to meet our own needs, as no 
animal does.  Animals adapt themselves to better fit in with 
and benefit from their environment.  But men both surmount 
and change environment.  Likewise when He says nature is 
devoid of memory He means memory as we have it, not the 
strange memory of inherited habits which animals so strikingly 
possess.  
     These various statements must be taken in conjunction 
 
+P86 
with all the &amp;Baha'i teachings; we cannot get a correct picture 
by concentrating on just one phrase.

     Persevere 
     I shall pray from all my heart for the steady development 
and the growing influence of the "Herald of the South".  
May its voice grow in strength and power, and may its pages 
increasingly reflect the dynamic spirit of the Faith and mirror 
forth the ever-expanding activities of the friends in Australasia 
as well as in distant lands.  Persevere in your efforts, 
let not obstacles damp your zeal and determination and 
rest assured that the Power of God which is reinforcing your 
efforts will in the end triumph and enable you to fulfil your 
cherished desire.

     Effective teaching medium.  
     ...Regarding the "Herald of the South" magazine, 
Shoghi Effendi very much appreciates the fact that in spite of 
the many difficulties that your Assembly had to overcome 
this review is being regularly published, and that its standard 
is gradually improving.  He would call upon all the English-speaking 
friends to contribute, as often as they can, such articles 
for publication in that magazine as would serve to make 
it a more direct and effective teaching medium for the spread 
of the Cause throughout Australia and New-Zealand.  He is 
advising the American N. S. A. to specially ask the cooperation 
of the American believers for that purpose, and hopes 
that the response they will make to this call will be such as to 
further encourage you in your splendid efforts for the publication 
of this national organ of the Faith....

     ...The Guardian, while fully aware of the difficulties, 
both financial and otherwise which your N. S. A.+F1 is facing 
in connection with the publication of the "Herald of the 
South", feels nevertheless the urge to advise you to continue 
with this magazine and not to feel in the least discouraged if 
your efforts for meeting the expenses incurred for its printing 
and circulation, and for raising its literary standard, do not 
bring the expected results.  He very deeply values the self-sacrificing 
and sustained efforts exerted by your Assembly in 
this connection.  May &amp;Baha'u'llah richly reward you for all 
your meritorious endeavours....

     Psychic practices.  
     ...In connection with the article published in the 
October number of the "Herald of the South" entitled 
"Above the Mists"; the Guardian wishes the believers to 
disregard such subjects as psychic practices and phenomena, 
for these besides not being authenticated by the Writings of 
the Founders of the Faith, pertain mostly to the domain of 
conjectures.  The magazines of the "Herald of the South" 
should be devoted to the study and presentation of those subjects 
that reflect the spirit of the Teachings, and which as such 
are worthy of consideration by the believers.  As the national 
organ of the Australian and New-Zealand friends its main 
function is to assist in disseminating the knowledge of the 
Cause, and thus develop into an effective teaching medium.  
This is the goal which the editors should have constantly in

+P88 
mind, and which they should endeavour to attain through the 
best possible means they can devise at present....

     PHILOSOPHERS                      (80)  
 
     We must not take many of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's statements 
as dogmatic finalities, for there are other points which when 
added to them round out the picture.  For instance, when He 
calls Aristotle and Plato Philosophers of the East, He is obviously 
placing them in that category because He believes they 
belong more correctly to Eastern culture than to Central 
European and the New World cultures of the West.  When He 
calls the philosophers of the West materialistic this does not 
for a moment mean He includes all Western philosophers for, 
as you truly point out, many of them have been very spiritual 
in their concepts....  
     Historians cannot be sure Socrates did not visit the 
Holy Land.  But believing as we do that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had an 
intuitive knowledge quite different from our own, we accept 
His authority on this matter....  
     The Guardian hopes this will better enable you to 
understand our wonderful Faith--for a living religion it is, 
and not merely a philosophy!

lesson to the young boys and girls provided they are 
not prepared directly for the army.  In some towns here we 
have in some of the schools Scout troops who are also students 
of the Colleges and it has proved to be a great educational 
scheme for helping the development of the children but 
they are never taught to carry arms or even the use of firearms.  
And furthermore they are often taught the evils of war 
rather than encourage them to become in future active 
 
+P89 
soldiers with imperialistic designs.  This of course is my own 
personal view.  
          (Extract, letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 
          December 30th, 1925)  
 
 
     SOUL, MIND AND SPIRIT             (82)  
 
     When studying at present, in English, the available 
&amp;Baha'i writings on the subject of body, soul and spirit, one is 
handicapped by a certain lack of clarity because not all were 
translated by the same person, and also there are, as you 
know, still many &amp;Baha'i writings untranslated.  But there is no 
doubt that spirit and soul seem to have been interchanged in 
meaning sometimes; soul and mind have, likewise, been interchanged 
in meaning, no doubt due to difficulties arising from 
different translations.  What the &amp;Baha'is do believe though is 
that we have three aspects of our humanness, so to speak, a 
body, a mind and an immortal identity--soul or spirit.  We 
believe the mind forms a link between the soul and the body, 
and the two interact on each other.

Notes
 
     1.  (Letter No. 1)  Margaret Stevenson, the first New Zealand &amp;Baha'i
was born on November 30th, 1865.  Her first intimation of the &amp;Baha'i Faith
was through reading "The Christian Commonwealth" and she admitted
later that "she did not think any more about it".  She received this journal
from her sister who was in London studying music and had heard
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha address the congregation of St. John's, Westminster at the
invitation of Canon Wilberforce.  She was so impressed that when another
discourse given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at City Temple, London was printed in
"The Christian Commonwealth" dated March 27th, 1911, she sent a copy
of the journal to Margaret in New Zealand.  In 1912, Miss Dorothea Spinney 
arrived in Auckland from London and stayed with Margaret at her 
home, "Clunie", 3, Cowie Street, Parnell where she talked about the 
&amp;Baha'i Cause and her own meeting with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  To quote Margaret's 
own words:  "As a child, I used to wish I had lived when Christ was 
on earth.  As Miss Spinney spoke, I remembered my childhood wish, and 
the thought came to me that I too might have denied Him as so many others 
had done.  It was this secret thought that made me seriously think of what I 
heard from Miss Spinney, and through God's grace and mercy I was 
enabled to grasp and believe in &amp;Baha'u'llah and His Message".+F1  Margaret 
spoke to others of her belief and obtained literature from America, becoming 
a subscriber to "Star of the West".  Eventually a study group was 
formed in Auckland and for ten years, Margaret's home was a venue for 
these classes.  It was here that the first &amp;Baha'i Feast in New Zealand took 
place in January, 1923.
     In 1925, Margaret was one of a small group who journeyed from 
New Zealand to the Holy Land on pilgrimage, and after an inspiring nineteen 
days in Haifa, travelled on to England where she met with the English 
&amp;Baha'i community.  The pilgrims arrived back in Auckland in December, 
1925, bringing with them some dust from the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah which 
was placed in New Zealand soil at the Stevenson's home in a ceremony 
held on February 14th, 1926.
     In such a geographically remote country, the early New Zealand 
believers had scant knowledge of &amp;Baha'i administration and erroneously 
called themselves an Assembly as early as 1924.  This was corrected with

+P94 
the receipt of a booklet on the subject and the first properly constituted 
&amp;Baha'i Assembly in New Zealand was formed on April 21st, 1926, with 
Margaret Stevenson as its Secretary.  A steadfast worker, Margaret was a 
member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia 
and New Zealand which was elected in 1934, and served the &amp;Baha'i Cause 
with faithfulness and efficiency until her passing to the &amp;Abha Kingdom on 
February 11th, 1941.
 
     2.  (Letter No. 1)  Born in London in 1855, Hyde Dunn was engaged in 
business in Britain and continental Europe before emigrating to the United 
States.  In 1905, whilst at a tinsmith's shop in Seattle, he observed the 
shopkeeper in excited conversation with a man who had just returned from 
the Prison of &amp;Akka and the presence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; he overheard the 
quotation "Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country, but let him 
glory in this, that he loves his kind".  Hyde Dunn later recalled that "The 
words reached me with dynamic force, its truth and power crystallised in 
my heart--a new consciousness awakened...  That one glorious utterance 
magnetised my whole being, appealed as a new note, sent forth from 
God to His wandering creatures--a Message from the Supreme to the sons 
of men".+F1  Recognising the Truth, Hyde Dunn interrupted the conversation, 
and accepted immediately the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The year 
was 1905.
     In 1912, he was present at a meeting with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in San 
Francisco and declared it was the Master's "penetrating glance, his life 
giving words, he felt gave him the power that enabled him later to become 
the spiritual conqueror of a continent".  Accompanied by his English born 
wife, Clara, he answered the call of the "Tablets of the Divine Plan" and 
on April 18th, 1920 reached Australia whence they travelled to New Zealand 
in 1922-3, not knowing there was already a believer there (Margaret 
Stevenson).  With their arrival in Auckland, the Cause grew in that country 
and when Hyde Dunn left to return to Australia, Clara remained for a time 
to organise a study group in New Zealand.
     Known affectionately among &amp;Baha'is as "Mother" and "Father" 
Dunn, they carried the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah from New South Wales to 
Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, across the desert to Perth and to 
tropical Queensland and became the spiritual parents of Australia.  After 
"Mother" Dunn returned from a lone pilgrimage to the Holy Land, 
"Father" was elected a member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of

+P95 
the &amp;Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand in 1934.  After his passing on 
February 17th, 1941, "Mother" Dunn's dedication to the &amp;Baha'i Faith 
continued unabated and in 1952 she was elevated to the station of Hand of 
the Cause of God by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the &amp;Baha'i Faith:  
"Father" Dunn was subsequently elevated to the same station posthumously.
     Despite her advanced years, "Mother" Dunn returned to New Zealand 
in 1957 as representative of the Guardian at the formation of the first 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of New Zealand.  In March, 
1958, at the request of the Guardian, she placed plaster from the Castle of 
&amp;Mah-Ku in the foundations of the Australasian &amp;Baha'i House of Worship in 
Sydney during the Australian Inter-Continental Conference.  Until her passing 
to the &amp;Abha Kingdom in 1960 at the age of 91 years, "Mother" Dunn 
retained her memory of many &amp;Baha'i prayers and was reciting these at the 
time of her death.
 
     3.  (Letter No. 2)  The Blundell family:  Mrs Sarah Blundell was born at 
Burwell, Cambridgeshire, England in 1850, a year sacred in &amp;Baha'i history 
as that of the &amp;Bab's martyrdom, and was destined to become one of the 
pioneers of the &amp;Baha'i Cause in New Zealand.  She received her early religious 
training from her "Non-Conformist" father, a man whose strong 
convictions led him to withdraw his seven year old daughter from religious 
instruction classes at her boarding school.  The feeling of isolation which 
followed caused her to think for herself and she had the rare distinction of 
being one of the first women to enter the Cambridge University Examinations 
in an age prejudiced against the education of women.
     In 1886, with her husband and seven children, she arrived in New 
Zealand where she endured hardship and difficulties in a strange country.  
She persisted in her unfettered search for truth and rejected several dogmas 
until, with an open mind and a prepared heart, she read in "The Christian 
Commonwealth" of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's visit to London in 1911 and sent overseas 
for additional literature.  When Mr and Mrs Dunn arrived in Auckland 
in 1922-3, Mrs Blundell invited them to her home, "Lymbury", Ridings 
Road, Remuera to meet a group of twenty people whom she thought might 
be interested.  This was the first &amp;Baha'i meeting held in New Zealand and 
shortly afterwards Mrs Blundell accepted the &amp;Baha'i Faith.
     On hearing from Martha Root that Shoghi Effendi and the Ladies of 
the Household were eager to welcome the New Zealand friends, Sarah 
Blundell arranged to make the journey to the Holy Land in 1925 visit the 
Holy Family, and the Shrines of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
and to meet in person many other &amp;Baha'is--this was "a crowning gift to 
 
+P96 
one whose spiritual path had been travelled alone."+F1  She returned to New 
Zealand after first going home to England to see her relatives and, at the 
Guardian's suggestion, make personal contact with the English &amp;Baha'i 
community.  She continued to work unsparingly in New Zealand to serve 
the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah until her passing at the age of eighty-four years on 
December 20th, 1934.
     One of her daughters, Ethel Blundell who accepted the &amp;Baha'i Faith 
in 1925, was a delegate to the first &amp;Baha'i Convention and was elected as a 
member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia 
and New Zealand in May, 1934.
     Mrs Blundell's son, Hugh, was also destined to serve the &amp;Baha'i 
Cause.  Although not at that time a &amp;Baha'i, Hugh accompanied his mother 
and sister on their pilgrimage to Haifa in 1925 and accepted the Faith the 
following year.  A tireless worker for the Cause, he was New Zealand's first 
Auxiliary Board Member and passed to the &amp;Abha Kingdom on October 
16th, 1976 in his ninety-second year.
 
     4.  (Letter No. 2)  Effie Baker became disenchanted with the Church 
and, having an open and enquiring attitude, was one of a committee formed 
in Melbourne responsible for arranging speakers to address the "New 
Thought" organisation.  This led her to attend a public meeting at which 
Hyde Dunn spoke on the &amp;Baha'i Faith and, recognising the truth of the 
Message, Effie Baker accepted the Faith the same evening and so became 
the first woman believer in Australia.  She accompanied Martha Root on the 
latter's lecture tour of New Zealand and, learning of the New Zealand 
&amp;Baha'is projected journey to the Holy Land in 1925, Effie sold her home 
and joined the pilgrims.
     After the bounty of visiting the Shrines and meeting with the 
Guardian and the Greatest Holy Leaf, Effie acceded to Shoghi Effendi's 
request and accompanied the New Zealand friends to London so as to contact 
the British &amp;Baha'i community.  She planned to return to Australia and 
assist the Dunns, and had accepted an invitation from the Ladies of the 
Holy Family to stop over in Haifa on her homeward journey, but on arriving 
there in June, she found Shoghi Effendi was away from the Holy Land 
and so decided to wait until he returned.  Her offer to serve was accepted 
and she remained at the World Centre of the &amp;Baha'i Faith in Israel for the 
next eleven years where she assumed the duties of hostess, welcoming the 
friends to the Pilgrim House, using her artistry and talent to photograph 
events in Haifa for the Guardian.  In 1930, when the need arose to secure

+P97 
photographs of places in Persia associated with the early history of the 
&amp;Baha'i Faith, Effie undertook arduous journeys by road through Syria and 
Iraq, undeterred by danger from hostile bandits.  This intrepid worker now 
embarked on an exacting and fruitful period of direct service to the Guardian, 
often using cars supplied by the Persian believers, at times travelling 
on horseback, mule or donkey to all but a few sites where it was too 
dangerous for a westerner to venture.  The unique photographic record she 
obtained was immortalised by being selected by the Guardian for inclusion 
in Nabil's "The Dawnbreakers".
     In 1936, Effie returned to her homeland, Australia, where she 
looked after the National Archives over a long period.  Her last years were 
spent in a small flat in the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds in Sydney at the invitation of 
the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand who had been 
requested by the Guardian to take care of her until her passing on January 
2nd, 1968.
 
     5.  (Letter No. 15)  Mrs Amy Dewing and her son Bertram were 
among New Zealand's earliest &amp;Baha'is; Mrs Dewing came from an orthodox 
Church of England background and viewed with disapproval her 
son's questioning attitude which led him to describe himself as a Rationalist.  
They heard of and accepted the Truth of the &amp;Baha'i Cause after 
meeting with "Mother" and "Father" Dunn in Devonport, Auckland and, 
in 1926, both of them served as members of the first Local Spiritual Assembly 
in Auckland.  Amy Dewing, as one of a small and persevering 
group of New Zealand believers, was active in spreading the Message as 
was her son through whose efforts a &amp;Baha'i magazine was published in 
Australia and New Zealand to promote the teachings.  Prior to her passing 
in 1957, Amy Dewing witnessed the emergence of the New Zealand community 
as an independent entity.
     Having travelled extensively overseas, Bertram Dewing eventually 
settled in Auckland.  A tireless worker for the Faith, he was a member of the 
first Local Spiritual Assembly in Devonport in 1951 and in 1958 was 
elected to the second National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of New 
Zealand.  He pioneered to Hokianga in the same year and a decade later assisted 
in spreading the Faith to New Plymouth where he worked for the 
Cause with unabated zeal until he passed to the &amp;Abha Kingdom in 1972 at 
the age of seventy.
 
     6.  (Letter No. 16)  Dr &amp;Habib, whose older brother attained martyrdom, 
was born in 1888 at &amp;Kermanshah, Persia and was given the name 
Mu'ayyad (meaning `confirmed') by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  At the age of twenty-one, 
when en route to Beirut to begin his medical studies at the American 
 
+P98 
University, he spent a month in the Holy Land with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha who took 
a personal interest in his progress.  Thereafter he returned each summer to 
serve the Cause, extending hospitality to visitors and pilgrims, recording 
daily events, acquiring spiritual knowledge from outstanding &amp;Baha'i 
scholars and being entrusted with the receipt and dispatch of Tablets.  
Referring to &amp;Habib's student days, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha extolled the young man's 
influence, detachment and sanctity, saying "the fragrance of Beirut" perfumed 
His nostrils.
     After graduating from the University of Beirut in 1914, Dr &amp;Habib 
operated a dispensary at &amp;Abu-Sinan, a Druse village northeast of &amp;Akka 
where the Master had temporarily settled the &amp;Baha'is:  this period of close 
contact with the Holy Family and daily lessons from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha he was 
later to describe as the "most precious segment of his life".  In a Tablet to 
Dr &amp;Habib's father, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha described this dedicated young &amp;Baha'i as 
"A lamp enkindled with the love of God".
     In 1915, responding to the Master's specific instructions, Dr &amp;Habib 
returned to his birthplace to practice his profession and teach the Faith to 
which he was so deeply devoted, and was for forty years a member of the 
Local Spiritual Assembly of &amp;Kermanshah, also serving for a period on the 
National Spiritual Assembly.  His published works include two volumes of 
reminiscences based on the principles of the Covenant and the history of 
the Cause, whilst his much loved poem entitled "Hold Thou my Hand, O 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha" is widely sung at gatherings of the &amp;Baha'is in &amp;Iran.  Dr 
&amp;Habib Mu'ayyad passed to the &amp;Abha Kingdom on October 29th, 1971.
 
     7.  (Letter No. 16)  The Moslem calendar dates from &amp;Muhammad's 
emigration or Hijrah from Mecca to Medina in 622 A.D.  The Moslem year 
begins with the month of &amp;Muharram of which the first ten days are observed 
by &amp;Shi'ah Moslems as part of their mourning period for the &amp;Imams.  The 
tenth day is called &amp;Ashura and commemorates the martyrdom of &amp;Husayn, 
the grand-son of &amp;Muhammad, who was cut down by thirty-three strokes of 
swords and lances and decapitated:  his clothes were torn from him and his 
naked body trampled by horses hooves.
 
     8.  (Letter No. 23)  Mrs Emily Axford was born in Huddersfield, 
England on October 19th, 1870 and was an infant teacher before her marriage.  
In 1907, the family emigrated to New Zealand where her husband 
practiced medicine in Te Aroha until his passing in 1912, after which Mrs 
Axford moved to Auckland so as to educate her three children.  Having rejected 
conventional Christianity, she was attracted by the New England 
Transcendental Movement until she became aware of the &amp;Baha'i Faith 
through her friendship with Sarah Blundell and was enrolled as a member 
 
+P99 
in 1923.  Three years later, Mrs Axford was elected Chairman of the first 
Local Spiritual Assembly in Auckland and for many years conducted 
classes in public speaking to help the friends overcome their shyness and 
reticence so that they might teach the Faith effectively.  Emily was one of 
three New Zealand delegates who attended the National Convention held 
in Sydney during 1934 and the following year was elected to the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand.  She continued 
to work staunchly for the Faith, being appointed in 1946 to the Regional 
Teaching Committee responsible for formulating teaching plans 
throughout New Zealand.  The following year, she assumed the delicate 
task of conducting negotiations with the immigration authorities so that 
&amp;Baha'is from Persia might be permitted to enter New Zealand as University 
students, and was actively engaged in this work up to the time of her passing 
on December 26th, 1949.
 
     9.  (Letter No. 33)  Born in 1900, Miss Kitty Carpenter became a 
&amp;Baha'i in 1936 since when many members of the Carpenter-Hancock family 
of which she is a member have followed her and joined the Faith.  An 
adventurous and enquiring soul, she undertook her first pilgrimage to 
Haifa in 1938, arriving there shortly after the marriage of Shoghi Effendi 
and, after living for two years in Australia, she returned to New Zealand 
where she embarked on a life of service to the Cause.  Towards the end of 
the Second World War, she willingly made available her premises (a 
counter lunch-shop) in Anzac Avenue as a venue for the Auckland &amp;Baha'i 
community and, in the 1950's, responded to the call by travel teaching in 
Mangakino and Whangarei.  She served on the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of New Zealand during 1958 and, two years later, moved 
from Christchurch to Hamilton to aid in establishing an assembly there.  
1964 saw her travel teaching in Invercargill and the following year she was 
appointed to the National Teaching Committee.  Responding to the need for 
the believers to establish another assembly, Kitty finally made her home in 
Tauranga where she is an active and much loved exponent of the Cause.
 
     10.  (Letter No. 37)  This refers to a book on &amp;Islam written by Bertram 
Dewing which was never published.
