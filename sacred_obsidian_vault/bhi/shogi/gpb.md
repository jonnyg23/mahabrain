     On the 23rd of May of this auspicious year the &amp;Baha'i world will 
celebrate the centennial anniversary of the founding of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  It will commemorate at once the hundreth anniversary 
of the inception of the &amp;Babi Dispensation, of the inauguration of the 
&amp;Baha'i Era, of the commencement of the &amp;Baha'i Cycle, and of the 
birth of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The weight of the potentialities with which 
this Faith, possessing no peer or equal in the world's spiritual history, 
and marking the culmination of a universal prophetic cycle, has been 
endowed, staggers our imagination.  The brightness of the millennial 
glory which it must shed in the fullness of time dazzles our eyes.  The 
magnitude of the shadow which its Author will continue to cast on 
successive Prophets destined to be raised up after Him eludes our 
calculation.  
     Already in the space of less than a century the operation of the 
mysterious processes generated by its creative spirit has provoked a 
tumult in human society such as no mind can fathom.  Itself undergoing 
a period of incubation during its primitive age, it has, through 
the emergence of its slowly-crystallizing system, induced a fermentation 
in the general life of mankind designed to shake the very foundations 
of a disordered society, to purify its life-blood, to reorientate 
and reconstruct its institutions, and shape its final destiny.  
     To what else can the observant eye or the unprejudiced mind, 
acquainted with the signs and portents heralding the birth, and 
accompanying the rise, of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah ascribe this dire, 
this planetary upheaval, with its attendant destruction, misery and 
fear, if not to the emergence of His embryonic World Order, which, 
as He Himself has unequivocally proclaimed, has "deranged the 
equilibrium of the world and revolutionized mankind's ordered life"?  
To what agency, if not to the irresistible diffusion of that world-shaking, 
world-energizing, world-redeeming spirit, which the &amp;Bab has 
affirmed is "vibrating in the innermost realities of all created things" 
can the origins of this portentous crisis, incomprehensible to man, 
and admittedly unprecedented in the annals of the human race, be 
attributed?  In the convulsions of contemporary society, in the 
frenzied, world-wide ebullitions of men's thoughts, in the fierce 
antagonisms inflaming races, creeds and classes, in the shipwreck of 
nations, in the downfall of kings, in the dismemberment of empires, 
in the extinction of dynasties, in the collapse of ecclesiastical hierarchies, 
 
xii 
in the deterioration of time-honored institutions, in the dissolution 
of ties, secular as well as religious, that had for so long held 
together the members of the human race--all manifesting themselves 
with ever-increasing gravity since the outbreak of the first World War 
that immediately preceded the opening years of the Formative Age 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah--in these we can readily recognize the 
evidences of the travail of an age that has sustained the impact of 
His Revelation, that has ignored His summons, and is now laboring 
to be delivered of its burden, as a direct consequence of the impulse 
communicated to it by the generative, the purifying, the transmuting 
influence of His Spirit.  
     It is my purpose, on the occasion of an anniversary of such profound 
significance, to attempt in the succeeding pages a survey of 
the outstanding events of the century that has seen this Spirit burst 
forth upon the world, as well as the initial stages of its subsequent 
incarnation in a System that must evolve into an Order designed to 
embrace the whole of mankind, and capable of fulfilling the high 
destiny that awaits man on this planet.  I shall endeavor to review, 
in their proper perspective and despite the comparatively brief space 
of time which separates us from them, the events which the revolution 
of a hundred years, unique alike in glory and tribulation, has unrolled 
before our eyes.  I shall seek to represent and correlate, in however 
cursory a manner, those momentous happenings which have insensibly, 
relentlessly, and under the very eyes of successive generations, perverse, 
indifferent or hostile, transformed a heterodox and seemingly 
negligible offshoot of the &amp;Shaykhi school of the &amp;Ithna-'Ashariyyih sect 
of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam into a world religion whose unnumbered followers are 
organically and indissolubly united; whose light has overspread the 
earth as far as Iceland in the North and Magellanes in the South; 
whose ramifications have spread to no less than sixty countries of the 
world; whose literature has been translated and disseminated in no 
less than forty languages; whose endowments in the five continents 
of the globe, whether local, national or international, already run 
into several million dollars; whose incorporated elective bodies have 
secured the official recognition of a number of governments in East 
and West; whose adherents are recruited from the diversified races 
and chief religions of mankind; whose representatives are to be found 
in hundreds of cities in both Persia and the United States of America; 
to whose verities royalty has publicly and repeatedly testified; whose 
independent status its enemies, from the ranks of its parent religion 
and in the leading center of both the Arab and Muslim worlds, have 
 
xiii 
proclaimed and demonstrated; and whose claims have been virtually 
recognized, entitling it to rank as the fourth religion of a Land in 
which its world spiritual center has been established, and which is 
at once the heart of Christendom, the holiest shrine of the Jewish 
people, and, save Mecca alone, the most sacred spot in &amp;Islam.  
     It is not my purpose--nor does the occasion demand it,--to write 
a detailed history of the last hundred years of the &amp;Baha'i Faith, nor 
do I intend to trace the origins of so tremendous a Movement, or to 
portray the conditions under which it was born, or to examine the 
character of the religion from which it has sprung, or to arrive at an 
estimate of the effects which its impact upon the fortunes of mankind 
has produced.  I shall rather content myself with a review of the 
salient features of its birth and rise, as well as of the initial stages in the 
establishment of its administrative institutions--institutions which 
must be regarded as the nucleus and herald of that World Order 
that must incarnate the soul, execute the laws, and fulfill the purpose 
of the Faith of God in this day.  
     Nor will it be my intention to ignore, whilst surveying the 
panorama which the revolution of a hundred years spreads before our 
gaze, the swift interweaving of seeming reverses with evident victories, 
out of which the hand of an inscrutable Providence has chosen 
to form the pattern of the Faith from its earliest days, or to minimize 
those disasters that have so often proved themselves to be the prelude 
to fresh triumphs which have, in turn, stimulated its growth and 
consolidated its past achievements.  Indeed, the history of the first 
hundred years of its evolution resolves itself into a series of internal 
and external crises, of varying severity, devastating in their immediate 
effects, but each mysteriously releasing a corresponding measure of 
divine power, lending thereby a fresh impulse to its unfoldment, this 
further unfoldment engendering in its turn a still graver calamity, 
followed by a still more liberal effusion of celestial grace enabling its 
upholders to accelerate still further its march and win in its service 
still more compelling victories.  
     In its broadest outline the first century of the &amp;Baha'i Era may be 
said to comprise the Heroic, the Primitive, the Apostolic Age of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and also the initial stages of the Formative, the 
Transitional, the Iron Age which is to witness the crystallization and 
shaping of the creative energies released by His Revelation.  The first 
eighty years of this century may roughly be said to have covered the 
entire period of the first age, while the last two decades may be 
regarded as having witnessed the beginnings of the second.  The 
 
xiv 
former commences with the Declaration of the &amp;Bab, includes the 
mission of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and terminates with the passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
The latter is ushered in by His Will and Testament, which 
defines its character and establishes its foundation.  
     The century under our review may therefore be considered as 
falling into four distinct periods, of unequal duration, each of specific 
import and of tremendous and indeed unappraisable significance.  
These four periods are closely interrelated, and constitute successive 
acts of one, indivisible, stupendous and sublime drama, whose 
mystery no intellect can fathom, whose climax no eye can even 
dimly perceive, whose conclusion no mind can adequately foreshadow.  
Each of these acts revolves around its own theme, boasts of its own 
heroes, registers its own tragedies, records its own triumphs, and contributes 
its own share to the execution of one common, immutable 
Purpose.  To isolate any one of them from the others, to dissociate the 
later manifestations of one universal, all-embracing Revelation from 
the pristine purpose that animated it in its earliest days, would be 
tantamount to a mutilation of the structure on which it rests, and 
to a lamentable perversion of its truth and of its history.  
     The first period (1844-1853), centers around the gentle, the 
youthful and irresistible person of the &amp;Bab, matchless in His meekness, 
imperturbable in His serenity, magnetic in His utterance, unrivaled 
in the dramatic episodes of His swift and tragic ministry.  It begins 
with the Declaration of His Mission, culminates in His martyrdom, 
and ends in a veritable orgy of religious massacre revolting in its 
hideousness.  It is characterized by nine years of fierce and relentless 
contest, whose theatre was the whole of Persia, in which above ten 
thousand heroes laid down their lives, in which two sovereigns of the 
&amp;Qajar dynasty and their wicked ministers participated, and which 
was supported by the entire &amp;Shi'ah ecclesiastical hierarchy, by the 
military resources of the state, and by the implacable hostility of the 
masses.  The second period (1853-1892) derives its inspiration from 
the august figure of &amp;Baha'u'llah, preeminent in holiness, awesome in 
the majesty of His strength and power, unapproachable in the transcendent 
brightness of His glory.  It opens with the first stirrings, 
in the soul of &amp;Baha'u'llah while in the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran, of the 
Revelation anticipated by the &amp;Bab, attains its plenitude in the 
proclamation of that Revelation to the kings and ecclesiastical leaders 
of the earth, and terminates in the ascension of its Author in the 
vicinity of the prison-town of &amp;Akka.  It extends over thirty-nine 
years of continuous, of unprecedented and overpowering Revelation, 
 
xv 
is marked by the propagation of the Faith to the neighboring territories 
of Turkey, of Russia, of &amp;Iraq, of Syria, of Egypt and of India, 
and is distinguished by a corresponding aggravation of hostility, 
represented by the united attacks launched by the &amp;Shah of Persia and 
the &amp;Sultan of Turkey, the two admittedly most powerful potentates 
of the East, as well as by the opposition of the twin sacerdotal orders 
of &amp;Shi'ah and &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam.  The third period (1892-1921) revolves 
around the vibrant personality of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, mysterious in His 
essence, unique in His station, astoundingly potent in both the charm 
and strength of His character.  It commences with the announcement 
of the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, a document without parallel in the 
history of any earlier Dispensation, attains its climax in the emphatic 
assertion by the Center of that Covenant, in the City of the Covenant, 
of the unique character and far-reaching implications of that Document, 
and closes with His passing and the interment of His remains 
on Mt. Carmel.  It will go down in history as a period of almost thirty 
years' duration, in which tragedies and triumphs have been so intertwined 
as to eclipse at one time the Orb of the Covenant, and at 
another time to pour forth its light over the continent of Europe, 
and as far as Australasia, the Far East and the North American continent.  
The fourth period (1921-1944) is motivated by the forces 
radiating from the Will and Testament of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, that Charter 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's New World Order, the offspring resulting from the 
mystic intercourse between Him Who is the Source of the Law of 
God and the mind of the One Who is the vehicle and interpreter of 
that Law.  The inception of this fourth, this last period of the first 
&amp;Baha'i century synchronizes with the birth of the Formative Age of 
the &amp;Baha'i Era, with the founding of the Administrative Order of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah--a system which is at once the harbinger, the 
nucleus and pattern of His World Order.  This period, covering the 
first twenty-three years of this Formative Age, has already been distinguished 
by an outburst of further hostility, of a different character, 
accelerating on the one hand the diffusion of the Faith over a still 
wider area in each of the five continents of the globe, and resulting 
on the other in the emancipation and the recognition of the independent 
status of several communities within its pale.  
     These four periods are to be regarded not only as the component, 
the inseparable parts of one stupendous whole, but as progressive stages 
in a single evolutionary process, vast, steady and irresistible.  For as 
we survey the entire range which the operation of a century-old Faith 
has unfolded before us, we cannot escape the conclusion that from 
 
xvi 
whatever angle we view this colossal scene, the events associated with 
these periods present to us unmistakable evidences of a slowly maturing 
process, of an orderly development, of internal consolidation, of 
external expansion, of a gradual emancipation from the fetters of 
religious orthodoxy, and of a corresponding diminution of civil disabilities 
and restrictions.  
     Viewing these periods of &amp;Baha'i history as the constituents of a 
single entity, we note the chain of events proclaiming successfully the 
rise of a Forerunner, the Mission of One Whose advent that Forerunner 
had promised, the establishment of a Covenant generated 
through the direct authority of the Promised One Himself, and lastly 
the birth of a System which is the child sprung from both the Author 
of the Covenant and its appointed Center.  We observe how the &amp;Bab, 
the Forerunner, announced the impending inception of a divinely-conceived 
Order, how &amp;Baha'u'llah, the Promised One, formulated its 
laws and ordinances, how &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the appointed Center, delineated 
its features, and how the present generation of their followers 
have commenced to erect the framework of its institutions.  We 
watch, through these periods, the infant light of the Faith diffuse itself 
from its cradle, eastward to India and the Far East, westward to the 
neighboring territories of &amp;Iraq, of Turkey, of Russia, and of Egypt, 
travel as far as the North American continent, illuminate subsequently 
the major countries of Europe, envelop with its radiance, 
at a later stage, the Antipodes, brighten the fringes of the Arctic, 
and finally set aglow the Central and South American horizons.  We 
witness a corresponding increase in the diversity of the elements 
within its fellowship, which from being confined, in the first period of 
its history, to an obscure body of followers chiefly recruited from the 
ranks of the masses in &amp;Shi'ah Persia, has expanded into a fraternity 
representative of the leading religious systems of the world, of almost 
every caste and color, from the humblest worker and peasant to 
royalty itself.  We notice a similar development in the extent of its 
literature--a literature which, restricted at first to the narrow range 
of hurriedly transcribed, often corrupted, secretly circulated, manuscripts, 
so furtively perused, so frequently effaced, and at times even 
eaten by the terrorized members of a proscribed sect, has, within the 
space of a century, swelled into innumerable editions, comprising tens 
of thousands of printed volumes, in diverse scripts, and in no less than 
forty languages, some elaborately reproduced, others profusely illustrated, 
all methodically and vigorously disseminated through the 
agency of world-wide, properly constituted and specially organized 
 
xvii 
committees and Assemblies.  We perceive a no less apparent evolution 
in the scope of its teachings, at first designedly rigid, complex and 
severe, subsequently recast, expanded, and liberalized under the succeeding 
Dispensation, later expounded, reaffirmed and amplified by an 
appointed Interpreter, and lastly systematized and universally applied 
to both individuals and institutions.  We can discover a no less distinct 
gradation in the character of the opposition it has had to encounter--
an opposition, at first kindled in the bosom of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, which, at a 
later stage, gathered momentum with the banishment of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
to the domains of the Turkish &amp;Sultan and the consequent hostility of 
the more powerful &amp;Sunni hierarchy and its Caliph, the head of the vast 
majority of the followers of &amp;Muhammad--an opposition which, now, 
through the rise of a divinely appointed Order in the Christian West, 
and its initial impact on civil and ecclesiastical institutions, bids fair 
to include among its supporters established governments and systems 
associated with the most ancient, the most deeply entrenched sacerdotal 
hierarchies in Christendom.  We can, at the same time, recognize, 
through the haze of an ever-widening hostility, the progress, painful 
yet persistent, of certain communities within its pale through the 
stages of obscurity, of proscription, of emancipation, and of recognition
--stages that must needs culminate in the course of succeeding 
centuries, in the establishment of the Faith, and the founding, in the 
plenitude of its power and authority, of the world-embracing &amp;Baha'i 
Commonwealth.  We can likewise discern a no less appreciable 
advance in the rise of its institutions, whether as administrative 
centers or places of worship--institutions, clandestine and subterrene 
in their earliest beginnings, emerging imperceptibly into the broad 
daylight of public recognition, legally protected, enriched by pious 
endowments, ennobled at first by the erection of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
of &amp;Ishqabad, the first &amp;Baha'i House of Worship, and more 
recently immortalized, through the rise in the heart of the North 
American continent of the Mother Temple of the West, the forerunner 
of a divine, a slowly maturing civilization.  And finally, we 
can even bear witness to the marked improvement in the conditions 
surrounding the pilgrimages performed by its devoted adherents to 
its consecrated shrines at its world center--pilgrimages originally 
arduous, perilous, tediously long, often made on foot, at times ending 
in disappointment, and confined to a handful of harassed Oriental 
followers, gradually attracting, under steadily improving circumstances 
of security and comfort, an ever swelling number of new 
converts converging from the four corners of the globe, and culminating 
 
xviii 
in the widely publicized yet sadly frustrated visit of a noble 
Queen, who, at the very threshold of the city of her heart's desire, 
was compelled, according to her own written testimony, to divert her 
steps, and forego the privilege of so priceless a benefit.

                                  CHAPTER I 
                       The Birth of the &amp;Babi Revelation 
 
     May 23, 1844, signalizes the commencement of the most turbulent 
period of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Era, an age which marks the 
opening of the most glorious epoch in the greatest cycle which the 
spiritual history of mankind has yet witnessed.  No more than a 
span of nine short years marks the duration of this most spectacular, 
this most tragic, this most eventful period of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
It was ushered in by the birth of a Revelation whose Bearer posterity 
will acclaim as the "Point round Whom the realities of the Prophets 
and Messengers revolve," and terminated with the first stirrings of a 
still more potent Revelation, "whose day," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself affirms, 
"every Prophet hath announced," for which "the soul of every Divine 
Messenger hath thirsted," and through which "God hath proved the 
hearts of the entire company of His Messengers and Prophets."  Little 
wonder that the immortal chronicler of the events associated with 
the birth and rise of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation has seen fit to devote no 
less than half of his moving narrative to the description of those 
happenings that have during such a brief space of time so greatly 
enriched, through their tragedy and heroism, the religious annals of 
mankind.  In sheer dramatic power, in the rapidity with which events 
of momentous importance succeeded each other, in the holocaust 
which baptized its birth, in the miraculous circumstances attending 
the martyrdom of the One Who had ushered it in, in the potentialities 
with which it had been from the outset so thoroughly impregnated, 
in the forces to which it eventually gave birth, this nine-year 
period may well rank as unique in the whole range of man's religious 
experience.  We behold, as we survey the episodes of this first act of a 
sublime drama, the figure of its Master Hero, the &amp;Bab, arise meteor-like 
above the horizon of &amp;Shiraz, traverse the sombre sky of Persia 
from south to north, decline with tragic swiftness, and perish in a 
blaze of glory.  We see His satellites, a galaxy of God-intoxicated 
heroes, mount above that same horizon, irradiate that same incandescent 
light, burn themselves out with that self-same swiftness, and 
impart in their turn an added impetus to the steadily gathering 
momentum of God's nascent Faith.  
 
+P4 
     He Who communicated the original impulse to so incalculable a 
Movement was none other than the promised &amp;Qa'im (He who 
ariseth), the &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman (the Lord of the Age), Who assumed 
the exclusive right of annulling the whole &amp;Qur'anic Dispensation, 
Who styled Himself "the Primal Point from which have been generated 
all created things ... the Countenance of God Whose splendor can 
never be obscured, the Light of God Whose radiance can never fade."  
The people among whom He appeared were the most decadent race 
in the civilized world, grossly ignorant, savage, cruel, steeped in 
prejudice, servile in their submission to an almost deified hierarchy, 
recalling in their abjectness the Israelites of Egypt in the days of 
Moses, in their fanaticism the Jews in the days of Jesus, and in their 
perversity the idolators of Arabia in the days of &amp;Muhammad.  The 
arch-enemy who repudiated His claim, challenged His authority, 
persecuted His Cause, succeeded in almost quenching His light, and 
who eventually became disintegrated under the impact of His Revelation 
was the &amp;Shi'ah priesthood.  Fiercely fanatic, unspeakably corrupt, 
enjoying unlimited ascendancy over the masses, jealous of their 
position, and irreconcilably opposed to all liberal ideas, the members 
of this caste had for one thousand years invoked the name of the 
Hidden &amp;Imam, their breasts had glowed with the expectation of His 
advent, their pulpits had rung with the praises of His world-embracing 
dominion, their lips were still devoutly and perpetually murmuring 
prayers for the hastening of His coming.  The willing tools 
who prostituted their high office for the accomplishment of the 
enemy's designs were no less than the sovereigns of the &amp;Qajar dynasty, 
first, the bigoted, the sickly, the vacillating &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, who 
at the last moment cancelled the &amp;Bab's imminent visit to the capital, 
and, second, the youthful and inexperienced &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, who 
gave his ready assent to the sentence of his Captive's death.  The 
arch villains who joined hands with the prime movers of so wicked a 
conspiracy were the two grand vizirs, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, the idolized 
tutor of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, a vulgar, false-hearted and fickle-minded 
schemer, and the arbitrary, bloodthirsty, reckless &amp;Amir-Nizam, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Taqi &amp;Khan, the first of whom exiled the &amp;Bab to the mountain fastnesses 
of &amp;Adhirbayjan, and the latter decreed His death in &amp;Tabriz.  
Their accomplice in these and other heinous crimes was a government 
bolstered up by a flock of idle, parasitical princelings and governors, 
corrupt, incompetent, tenaciously holding to their ill-gotten privileges, 
and utterly subservient to a notoriously degraded clerical order.  
The heroes whose deeds shine upon the record of this fierce spiritual 
 
+P5 
contest, involving at once people, clergy, monarch and government, 
were the &amp;Bab's chosen disciples, the Letters of the Living, and their 
companions, the trail-breakers of the New Day, who to so much 
intrigue, ignorance, depravity, cruelty, superstition and cowardice 
opposed a spirit exalted, unquenchable and awe-inspiring, a knowledge 
surprisingly profound, an eloquence sweeping in its force, a piety 
unexcelled in fervor, a courage leonine in its fierceness, a self-abnegation 
saintly in its purity, a resolve granite-like in its firmness, a 
vision stupendous in its range, a veneration for the Prophet and His 
&amp;Imams disconcerting to their adversaries, a power of persuasion alarming 
to their antagonists, a standard of faith and a code of conduct 
that challenged and revolutionized the lives of their countrymen.  
     The opening scene of the initial act of this great drama was laid 
in the upper chamber of the modest residence of the son of a mercer 
of &amp;Shiraz, in an obscure corner of that city.  The time was the hour 
before sunset, on the 22nd day of May, 1844.  The participants were 
the &amp;Bab, a twenty-five year old siyyid, of pure and holy lineage, and 
the young &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the first to believe in Him.  Their meeting 
immediately before that interview seemed to be purely fortuitous.  
The interview itself was protracted till the hour of dawn.  The Host 
remained closeted alone with His guest, nor was the sleeping city 
remotely aware of the import of the conversation they held with 
each other.  No record has passed to posterity of that unique night 
save the fragmentary but highly illuminating account that fell from 
the lips of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn.  
     "I sat spellbound by His utterance, oblivious of time and of those 
who awaited me," he himself has testified, after describing the nature 
of the questions he had put to his Host and the conclusive replies he 
had received from Him, replies which had established beyond the 
shadow of a doubt the validity of His claim to be the promised &amp;Qa'im.  
"Suddenly the call of the &amp;Mu'adhdhin, summoning the faithful to 
their morning prayer, awakened me from the state of ecstasy into 
which I seemed to have fallen.  All the delights, all the ineffable 
glories, which the Almighty has recounted in His Book as the priceless 
possessions of the people of Paradise--these I seemed to be experiencing 
that night.  Methinks I was in a place of which it could be 
truly said:  `Therein no toil shall reach us, and therein no weariness 
shall touch us;' `no vain discourse shall they hear therein, nor any 
falsehood, but only the cry, "Peace!  Peace!"'; `their cry therein shall 
be, "Glory to Thee, O God!" and their salutation therein, "Peace!", 
and the close of their cry, "Praise be to God, Lord of all creatures!"'  
 
+P6 
Sleep had departed from me that night.  I was enthralled by the 
music of that voice which rose and fell as He chanted; now swelling 
forth as He revealed verses of the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', again acquiring 
ethereal, subtle harmonies as He uttered the prayers He was revealing.  
At the end of each invocation, He would repeat this verse:  `Far from 
the glory of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, be that which His creatures 
affirm of Him!  And peace be upon His Messengers!  And praise be 
to God, the Lord of all beings!'"  
     "This Revelation," &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn has further testified, "so suddenly 
and impetuously thrust upon me, came as a thunderbolt which, 
for a time, seemed to have benumbed my faculties.  I was blinded by 
its dazzling splendor and overwhelmed by its crushing force.  Excitement, 
joy, awe, and wonder stirred the depths of my soul.  Predominant 
among these emotions was a sense of gladness and strength 
which seemed to have transfigured me.  How feeble and impotent, 
how dejected and timid, I had felt previously!  Then I could neither 
write nor walk, so tremulous were my hands and feet.  Now, however, 
the knowledge of His Revelation had galvanized my being.  I 
felt possessed of such courage and power that were the world, all its 
peoples and its potentates, to rise against me, I would, alone and 
undaunted, withstand their onslaught.  The universe seemed but a 
handful of dust in my grasp.  I seemed to be the voice of Gabriel 
personified, calling unto all mankind:  `Awake, for, lo! the morning 
Light has broken.  Arise, for His Cause is made manifest.  The portal 
of His grace is open wide; enter therein, O peoples of the world!  
For He Who is your promised One is come!'"  
     A more significant light, however, is shed on this episode, marking 
the Declaration of the Mission of the &amp;Bab, by the perusal of that 
"first, greatest and mightiest" of all books in the &amp;Babi Dispensation, 
the celebrated commentary on the &amp;Surih of Joseph, the first chapter 
of which, we are assured, proceeded, in its entirety, in the course of 
that night of nights from the pen of its divine Revealer.  The description 
of this episode by &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, as well as the opening pages of 
that Book attest the magnitude and force of that weighty Declaration.  
A claim to be no less than the mouthpiece of God Himself, 
promised by the Prophets of bygone ages; the assertion that He was, 
at the same time, the Herald of One immeasurably greater than Himself; 
the summons which He trumpeted forth to the kings and princes 
of the earth; the dire warnings directed to the Chief Magistrate of 
the realm, &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah; the counsel imparted to &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Aqasi to fear God, and the peremptory command to abdicate his 
 
+P7 
authority as grand vizir of the &amp;Shah and submit to the One Who is 
the "Inheritor of the earth and all that is therein"; the challenge 
issued to the rulers of the world proclaiming the self-sufficiency of 
His Cause, denouncing the vanity of their ephemeral power, and 
calling upon them to "lay aside, one and all, their dominion," and 
deliver His Message to "lands in both the East and the West"--these 
constitute the dominant features of that initial contact that marked 
the birth, and fixed the date, of the inception of the most glorious 
era in the spiritual life of mankind.  
     With this historic Declaration the dawn of an Age that signalizes 
the consummation of all ages had broken.  The first impulse of a 
momentous Revelation had been communicated to the one "but for 
whom," according to the testimony of the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, "God would 
not have been established upon the seat of His mercy, nor ascended 
the throne of eternal glory."  Not until forty days had elapsed, however, 
did the enrollment of the seventeen remaining Letters of the 
Living commence.  Gradually, spontaneously, some in sleep, others 
while awake, some through fasting and prayer, others through dreams 
and visions, they discovered the Object of their quest, and were 
enlisted under the banner of the new-born Faith.  The last, but in 
rank the first, of these Letters to be inscribed on the Preserved Tablet 
was the erudite, the twenty-two year old &amp;Quddus, a direct descendant 
of the &amp;Imam &amp;Hasan and the most esteemed disciple of Siyyid &amp;Kazim.  
Immediately preceding him, a woman, the only one of her sex, who, 
unlike her fellow-disciples, never attained the presence of the &amp;Bab, 
was invested with the rank of apostleship in the new Dispensation.  
A poetess, less than thirty years of age, of distinguished birth, of 
bewitching charm, of captivating eloquence, indomitable in spirit, 
unorthodox in her views, audacious in her acts, immortalized as 
&amp;Tahirih (the Pure One) by the "Tongue of Glory," and surnamed 
&amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn (Solace of the Eyes) by Siyyid &amp;Kazim, her teacher, 
she had, in consequence of the appearance of the &amp;Bab to her in a 
dream, received the first intimation of a Cause which was destined 
to exalt her to the fairest heights of fame, and on which she, through 
her bold heroism, was to shed such imperishable luster.  
     These "first Letters generated from the Primal Point," this "company 
of angels arrayed before God on the Day of His coming," these 
"Repositories of His Mystery," these "Springs that have welled out 
from the Source of His Revelation," these first companions who, in 
the words of the Persian &amp;Bayan, "enjoy nearest access to God," these 
"Luminaries that have, from everlasting, bowed down, and will everlastingly 
 
+P8 
continue to bow down, before the Celestial Throne," and 
lastly these "elders" mentioned in the Book of Revelation as "sitting 
before God on their seats," "clothed in white raiment" and wearing 
on their heads "crowns of gold"--these were, ere their dispersal, 
summoned to the &amp;Bab's presence, Who addressed to them His parting 
words, entrusted to each a specific task, and assigned to some of them 
as the proper field of their activities their native provinces.  He 
enjoined them to observe the utmost caution and moderation in their 
behavior, unveiled the loftiness of their rank, and stressed the magnitude 
of their responsibilities.  He recalled the words addressed by 
Jesus to His disciples, and emphasized the superlative greatness of 
the New Day.  He warned them lest by turning back they forfeit 
the Kingdom of God, and assured them that if they did God's bidding, 
God would make them His heirs and spiritual leaders among men.  
He hinted at the secret, and announced the approach, of a still 
mightier Day, and bade them prepare themselves for its advent.  
He called to remembrance the triumph of Abraham over Nimrod, 
of Moses over Pharaoh, of Jesus over the Jewish people, and of 
&amp;Muhammad over the tribes of Arabia, and asserted the inevitability 
and ultimate ascendancy of His own Revelation.  To the care of 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn He committed a mission, more specific in character 
and mightier in import.  He affirmed that His covenant with him had 
been established, cautioned him to be forbearing with the divines he 
would encounter, directed him to proceed to &amp;Tihran, and alluded, in 
the most glowing terms, to the as yet unrevealed Mystery enshrined 
in that city--a Mystery that would, He affirmed, transcend the light 
shed by both &amp;Hijaz and &amp;Shiraz.  
     Galvanized into action by the mandate conferred upon them, 
launched on their perilous and revolutionizing mission, these lesser 
luminaries who, together with the &amp;Bab, constitute the First &amp;Vahid 
(Unity) of the Dispensation of the &amp;Bayan, scattered far and wide 
through the provinces of their native land, where, with matchless 
heroism, they resisted the savage and concerted onslaught of the forces 
arrayed against them, and immortalized their Faith by their own 
exploits and those of their co-religionists, raising thereby a tumult 
that convulsed their country and sent its echoes reverberating as far 
as the capitals of Western Europe.  
     It was not until, however, the &amp;Bab had received the eagerly anticipated 
letter of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, His trusted and beloved lieutenant, 
communicating the joyful tidings of his interview with &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
that He decided to undertake His long and arduous pilgrimage to the 
 
+P9 
Tombs of His ancestors.  In the month of &amp;Sha'ban, of the year 1260 
A.H. (September, 1844) He Who, both on His father's and mother's 
side, was of the seed of the illustrious &amp;Fatimih, and Who was a 
descendant of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, the most eminent among the lawful 
successors of the Prophet of &amp;Islam, proceeded, in fulfillment of Islamic 
traditions, to visit the Kaaba.  He embarked from &amp;Bushihr on the 
19th of &amp;Ramadan (October, 1844) on a sailing vessel, accompanied 
by &amp;Quddus whom He was assiduously preparing for the assumption of 
his future office.  Landing at Jaddih after a stormy voyage of over a 
month's duration, He donned the pilgrim's garb, mounted a camel, 
and set out for Mecca, arriving on the first of &amp;Dhi'l-Hajjih (December 
12).  &amp;Quddus, holding the bridle in his hands, accompanied his 
Master on foot to that holy Shrine.  On the day of &amp;Arafih, the 
Prophet-pilgrim of &amp;Shiraz, His chronicler relates, devoted His whole 
time to prayer.  On the day of Nahr He proceeded to &amp;Muna, where 
He sacrificed according to custom nineteen lambs, nine in His own 
name, seven in the name of &amp;Quddus, and three in the name of the 
Ethiopian servant who attended Him.  He afterwards, in company 
with the other pilgrims, encompassed the Kaaba and performed the 
rites prescribed for the pilgrimage.  
     His visit to &amp;Hijaz was marked by two episodes of particular importance.  
The first was the declaration of His mission and His open 
challenge to the haughty &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhit-i-Kirmani, one of the most 
outstanding exponents of the &amp;Shaykhi school, who at times went so 
far as to assert his independence of the leadership of that school 
assumed after the death of Siyyid &amp;Kazim by &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad &amp;Karim 
&amp;Khan, a redoubtable enemy of the &amp;Babi Faith.  The second was the 
invitation, in the form of an Epistle, conveyed by &amp;Quddus, to the 
Sherif of Mecca, in which the custodian of the House of God was 
called upon to embrace the truth of the new Revelation.  Absorbed 
in his own pursuits the Sherif however failed to respond.  Seven years 
later, when in the course of a conversation with a certain &amp;Haji 
&amp;Niyaz-i-Baghdadi, this same Sherif was informed of the circumstances 
attending the mission and martyrdom of the Prophet of 
&amp;Shiraz, he listened attentively to the description of those events and 
expressed his indignation at the tragic fate that had overtaken Him.  
     The &amp;Bab's visit to Medina marked the conclusion of His pilgrimage.  
Regaining Jaddih, He returned to &amp;Bushihr, where one of His first acts 
was to bid His last farewell to His fellow-traveler and disciple, and 
to assure him that he would meet the Beloved of their hearts.  He, 
moreover, announced to him that he would be crowned with a 
 
+P10 
martyr's death, and that He Himself would subsequently suffer a 
similar fate at the hands of their common foe.  
     The &amp;Bab's return to His native land (&amp;Safar 1261) (February-
March, 1845) was the signal for a commotion that rocked the entire 
country.  The fire which the declaration of His mission had lit was 
being fanned into flame through the dispersal and activities of His 
appointed disciples.  Already within the space of less than two years 
it had kindled the passions of friend and foe alike.  The outbreak of 
the conflagration did not even await the return to His native city of 
the One Who had generated it.  The implications of a Revelation, 
thrust so dramatically upon a race so degenerate, so inflammable in 
temper, could indeed have had no other consequence than to excite 
within men's bosoms the fiercest passions of fear, of hate, of rage 
and envy.  A Faith Whose Founder did not content Himself with 
the claim to be the Gate of the Hidden &amp;Imam, Who assumed a rank 
that excelled even that of the &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman, Who regarded Himself 
as the precursor of one incomparably greater than Himself, Who 
peremptorily commanded not only the subjects of the &amp;Shah, but the 
monarch himself, and even the kings and princes of the earth, to 
forsake their all and follow Him, Who claimed to be the inheritor of 
the earth and all that is therein--a Faith Whose religious doctrines, 
Whose ethical standards, social principles and religious laws challenged 
the whole structure of the society in which it was born, soon 
ranged, with startling unanimity, the mass of the people behind their 
priests, and behind their chief magistrate, with his ministers and his 
government, and welded them into an opposition sworn to destroy, 
root and branch, the movement initiated by One Whom they regarded 
as an impious and presumptuous pretender.  
     With the &amp;Bab's return to &amp;Shiraz the initial collision of irreconcilable 
forces may be said to have commenced.  Already the energetic 
and audacious &amp;Mulla &amp;Aliy-i-Bastami, one of the Letters of the Living, 
"the first to leave the House of God (&amp;Shiraz) and the first to 
suffer for His sake," who, in the presence of one of the leading exponents 
of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, the far-famed &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad &amp;Hasan, 
had audaciously asserted that from the pen of his new-found Master 
within the space of forty-eight hours, verses had streamed that 
equalled in number those of the &amp;Qur'an, which it took its Author 
twenty-three years to reveal, had been excommunicated, chained, 
disgraced, imprisoned, and, in all probability, done to death.  &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Sadiq-i-Khurasani, impelled by the injunction of the &amp;Bab in the 
&amp;Khasa'il-i-Sab'ih to alter the sacrosanct formula of the &amp;adhan, sounded 
 
+P11 
it in its amended form before a scandalized congregation in &amp;Shiraz, 
and was instantly arrested, reviled, stripped of his garments, and 
scourged with a thousand lashes.  The villainous &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, the 
&amp;Nizamu'd-Dawlih, the governor of &amp;Fars, who had read the challenge 
thrown out in the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', having ordered that &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Sadiq together with &amp;Quddus and another believer be summarily and 
publicly punished, caused their beards to be burned, their noses 
pierced, and threaded with halters; then, having been led through 
the streets in this disgraceful condition, they were expelled from 
the city.  
     The people of &amp;Shiraz were by that time wild with excitement.  A 
violent controversy was raging in the masjids, the madrisihs, the 
bazaars, and other public places.  Peace and security were gravely 
imperiled.  Fearful, envious, thoroughly angered, the &amp;mullas were 
beginning to perceive the seriousness of their position.  The governor, 
greatly alarmed, ordered the &amp;Bab to be arrested.  He was brought to 
&amp;Shiraz under escort, and, in the presence of &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, was 
severely rebuked, and so violently struck in the face that His turban 
fell to the ground.  Upon the intervention of the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih He 
was released on parole, and entrusted to the custody of His maternal 
uncle &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza Siyyid &amp;Ali.  A brief lull ensued, enabling the 
captive Youth to celebrate the &amp;Naw-Ruz of that and the succeeding 
year in an atmosphere of relative tranquillity in the company of His 
mother, His wife, and His uncle.  Meanwhile the fever that had 
seized His followers was communicating itself to the members of the 
clergy and to the merchant classes, and was invading the higher circles 
of society.  Indeed, a wave of passionate inquiry had swept the whole 
country, and unnumbered congregations were listening with wonder 
to the testimonies eloquently and fearlessly related by the &amp;Bab's 
itinerant messengers.  
     The commotion had assumed such proportions that the &amp;Shah, 
unable any longer to ignore the situation, delegated the trusted 
Siyyid &amp;Yahyay-i-Darabi, surnamed &amp;Vahid, one of the most erudite, 
eloquent and influential of his subjects--a man who had committed 
to memory no less than thirty thousand traditions--to investigate 
and report to him the true situation.  Broad-minded, highly imaginative, 
zealous by nature, intimately associated with the court, he, in 
the course of three interviews, was completely won over by the 
arguments and personality of the &amp;Bab.  Their first interview centered 
around the metaphysical teachings of &amp;Islam, the most obscure passages 
of the &amp;Qur'an, and the traditions and prophecies of the &amp;Imams.  In 
 
+P12 
the course of the second interview &amp;Vahid was astounded to find that 
the questions which he had intended to submit for elucidation had 
been effaced from his retentive memory, and yet, to his utter amazement, 
he discovered that the &amp;Bab was answering the very questions 
he had forgotten.  During the third interview the circumstances 
attending the revelation of the &amp;Bab's commentary on the &amp;surih of 
&amp;Kawthar, comprising no less than two thousand verses, so overpowered 
the delegate of the &amp;Shah that he, contenting himself with a 
mere written report to the Court Chamberlain, arose forthwith to 
dedicate his entire life and resources to the service of a Faith that 
was to requite him with the crown of martyrdom during the &amp;Nayriz 
upheaval.  He who had firmly resolved to confute the arguments of 
an obscure siyyid of &amp;Shiraz, to induce Him to abandon His ideas, 
and to conduct Him to &amp;Tihran as an evidence of the ascendancy he 
had achieved over Him, was made to feel, as he himself later acknowledged, 
as "lowly as the dust beneath His feet."  Even &amp;Husayn 
&amp;Khan, who had been &amp;Vahid's host during his stay in &amp;Shiraz, was 
compelled to write to the &amp;Shah and express the conviction that his 
Majesty's illustrious delegate had become a &amp;Babi.  
     Another famous advocate of the Cause of the &amp;Bab, even fiercer 
in zeal than &amp;Vahid, and almost as eminent in rank, was &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Zanjani, surnamed &amp;Hujjat.  An &amp;Akhbari, a vehement 
controversialist, of a bold and independent temper of mind, impatient 
of restraint, a man who had dared condemn the whole 
ecclesiastical hierarchy from the &amp;Abvab-i-Arba'ih down to the humblest 
&amp;mulla, he had more than once, through his superior talents and 
fervid eloquence, publicly confounded his orthodox &amp;Shi'ah adversaries.  
Such a person could not remain indifferent to a Cause that was 
producing so grave a cleavage among his countrymen.  The disciple 
he sent to &amp;Shiraz to investigate the matter fell immediately under the 
spell of the &amp;Bab.  The perusal of but a page of the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', 
brought by that messenger to &amp;Hujjat, sufficed to effect such a transformation 
within him that he declared, before the assembled &amp;ulamas 
of his native city, that should the Author of that work pronounce 
day to be night and the sun to be a shadow he would unhesitatingly 
uphold his verdict.  
     Yet another recruit to the ever-swelling army of the new Faith 
was the eminent scholar, &amp;Mirza &amp;Ahmad-i-Azghandi, the most learned, 
the wisest and the most outstanding among the &amp;ulamas of &amp;Khurasan, 
who, in anticipation of the advent of the promised &amp;Qa'im, had compiled 
above twelve thousand traditions and prophecies concerning the 
 
+P13 
time and character of the expected Revelation, had circulated them 
among His fellow-disciples, and had encouraged them to quote them 
extensively to all congregations and in all meetings.  
     While the situation was steadily deteriorating in the provinces, 
the bitter hostility of the people of &amp;Shiraz was rapidly moving towards 
a climax.  &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, vindictive, relentless, exasperated by the 
reports of his sleepless agents that his Captive's power and fame were 
hourly growing, decided to take immediate action.  It is even reported 
that his accomplice, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, had ordered him to 
kill secretly the would-be disrupter of the state and the wrecker of 
its established religion.  By order of the governor the chief constable, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Hamid &amp;Khan, scaled, in the dead of night, the wall and 
entered the house of &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza Siyyid &amp;Ali, where the &amp;Bab was 
confined, arrested Him, and confiscated all His books and documents.  
That very night, however, took place an event which, in its dramatic 
suddenness, was no doubt providentially designed to confound the 
schemes of the plotters, and enable the Object of their hatred to 
prolong His ministry and consummate His Revelation.  An outbreak 
of cholera, devastating in its virulence, had, since midnight, already 
smitten above a hundred people.  The dread of the plague had entered 
every heart, and the inhabitants of the stricken city were, amid 
shrieks of pain and grief, fleeing in confusion.  Three of the governor's 
domestics had already died.  Members of his family were lying dangerously 
ill.  In his despair he, leaving the dead unburied, had fled to a 
garden in the outskirts of the city.  &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid &amp;Khan, confronted 
by this unexpected development, decided to conduct the &amp;Bab to His 
own home.  He was appalled, upon his arrival, to learn that his son 
lay in the death-throes of the plague.  In his despair he threw himself 
at the feet of the &amp;Bab, begged to be forgiven, adjured Him not to 
visit upon the son the sins of the father, and pledged his word to 
resign his post, and never again to accept such a position.  Finding 
that his prayer had been answered, he addressed a plea to the governor 
begging him to release his Captive, and thereby deflect the fatal 
course of this dire visitation.  &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan acceded to his request, 
and released his Prisoner on condition of His quitting the city.  
     Miraculously preserved by an almighty and watchful Providence, 
the &amp;Bab proceeded to &amp;Isfahan (September, 1846), accompanied by 
Siyyid &amp;Kazim-i-Zanjani.  Another lull ensued, a brief period of 
comparative tranquillity during which the Divine processes which 
had been set in motion gathered further momentum, precipitating a 
series of events leading to the imprisonment of the &amp;Bab in the 
 
+P14 
fortresses of &amp;Mah-Ku and &amp;Chihriq, and culminating in His martyrdom 
in the barrack-square of &amp;Tabriz.  Well aware of the impending trials 
that were to afflict Him, the &amp;Bab had, ere His final separation from 
His family, bequeathed to His mother and His wife all His possessions, 
had confided to the latter the secret of what was to befall Him, 
and revealed for her a special prayer the reading of which, He assured 
her, would resolve her perplexities and allay her sorrows.  The first 
forty days of His sojourn in &amp;Isfahan were spent as the guest of &amp;Mirza 
Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, the &amp;Sultanu'l-'Ulama, the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih, one of 
the principal ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm, in accordance with 
the instructions of the governor of the city, &amp;Manuchihr &amp;Khan, the 
Mu &amp;Tamidu'd-Dawlih, who had received from the &amp;Bab a letter requesting 
him to appoint the place where He should dwell.  He was 
ceremoniously received, and such was the spell He cast over the 
people of that city that, on one occasion, after His return from the 
public bath, an eager multitude clamored for the water that had 
been used for His ablutions.  So magic was His charm that His host, 
forgetful of the dignity of his high rank, was wont to wait personally 
upon Him.  It was at the request of this same prelate that the &amp;Bab, 
one night, after supper, revealed His well-known commentary on 
the &amp;surih of &amp;Va'l-'Asr.  Writing with astonishing rapidity, He, in a 
few hours, had devoted to the exposition of the significance of only 
the first letter of that &amp;surih--a letter which &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i 
had stressed, and which &amp;Baha'u'llah refers to in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas--
verses that equalled in number a third of the &amp;Qur'an, a feat that called 
forth such an outburst of reverent astonishment from those who 
witnessed it that they arose and kissed the hem of His robe.  
     The tumultuous enthusiasm of the people of &amp;Isfahan was meanwhile 
visibly increasing.  Crowds of people, some impelled by curiosity, 
others eager to discover the truth, still others anxious to be 
healed of their infirmities, flocked from every quarter of the city to 
the house of the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih.  The wise and judicious &amp;Manuchihr 
&amp;Khan could not resist the temptation of visiting so strange, so intriguing 
a Personage.  Before a brilliant assemblage of the most accomplished 
divines he, a Georgian by origin and a Christian by birth, 
requested the &amp;Bab to expound and demonstrate the truth of &amp;Muhammad's 
specific mission.  To this request, which those present had felt 
compelled to decline, the &amp;Bab readily responded.  In less than two 
hours, and in the space of fifty pages, He had not only revealed a 
minute, a vigorous and original dissertation on this noble theme, but 
had also linked it with both the coming of the &amp;Qa'im and the return 
 
+P15 
of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn--an exposition that prompted &amp;Manuchihr &amp;Khan 
to declare before that gathering his faith in the Prophet of &amp;Islam, as 
well as his recognition of the supernatural gifts with which the 
Author of so convincing a treatise was endowed.  
     These evidences of the growing ascendancy exercised by an unlearned 
Youth on the governor and the people of a city rightly 
regarded as one of the strongholds of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, alarmed the 
ecclesiastical authorities.  Refraining from any act of open hostility which 
they knew full well would defeat their purpose, they sought, by 
encouraging the circulation of the wildest rumors, to induce the 
Grand Vizir of the &amp;Shah to save a situation that was growing hourly 
more acute and menacing.  The popularity enjoyed by the &amp;Bab, His 
personal prestige, and the honors accorded Him by His countrymen, 
had now reached their high watermark.  The shadows of an impending 
doom began to fast gather about Him.  A series of tragedies from then 
on followed in rapid sequence destined to culminate in His own death 
and the apparent extinction of the influence of His Faith.  
     The overbearing and crafty &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, fearful lest the 
sway of the &amp;Bab encompass his sovereign and thus seal his own doom, 
was aroused as never before.  Prompted by a suspicion that the &amp;Bab 
possessed the secret sympathies of the &amp;Mu'tamid, and well aware of 
the confidence reposed in him by the &amp;Shah, he severely upbraided the 
&amp;Imam-Jum'ih for the neglect of his sacred duty.  He, at the same 
time, lavished, in several letters, his favors upon the &amp;ulamas of 
&amp;Isfahan, whom he had hitherto ignored.  From the pulpits of that 
city an incited clergy began to hurl vituperation and calumny upon 
the Author of what was to them a hateful and much to be feared 
heresy.  The &amp;Shah himself was induced to summon the &amp;Bab to his 
capital.  &amp;Manuchihr &amp;Khan, bidden to arrange for His departure, 
decided to transfer His residence temporarily to his own home.  
Meanwhile the mujtahids and &amp;ulamas, dismayed at the signs of so 
pervasive an influence, summoned a gathering which issued an abusive 
document signed and sealed by the ecclesiastical leaders of the city, 
denouncing the &amp;Bab as a heretic and condemning Him to death.  
Even the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih was constrained to add his written testimony 
that the Accused was devoid of reason and judgment.  The &amp;Mu'tamid, 
in his great embarrassment, and in order to appease the rising tumult, 
conceived a plan whereby an increasingly restive populace were made 
to believe that the &amp;Bab had left for &amp;Tihran, while he succeeded in 
insuring for Him a brief respite of four months in the privacy of the 
&amp;Imarat-i-Khurshid, the governor's private residence in &amp;Isfahan.  It 
 
+P16 
was in those days that the host expressed the desire to consecrate all 
his possessions, evaluated by his contemporaries at no less than forty 
million francs, to the furtherance of the interests of the new Faith, 
declared his intention of converting &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, of inducing 
him to rid himself of a shameful and profligate minister, and of 
obtaining his royal assent to the marriage of one of his sisters with the 
&amp;Bab.  The sudden death of the &amp;Mu'tamid, however, foretold by the 
&amp;Bab Himself, accelerated the course of the approaching crisis.  The 
ruthless and rapacious &amp;Gurgin &amp;Khan, the deputy governor, induced 
the &amp;Shah to issue a second summons ordering that the captive Youth 
be sent in disguise to &amp;Tihran, accompanied by a mounted escort.  To 
this written mandate of the sovereign the vile &amp;Gurgin &amp;Khan, who 
had previously discovered and destroyed the will of his uncle, the 
&amp;Mu'tamid, and seized his property, unhesitatingly responded.  At the 
distance of less than thirty miles from the capital, however, in the 
fortress of &amp;Kinar-Gird, a messenger delivered to &amp;Muhammad Big, 
who headed the escort, a written order from &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi instructing 
him to proceed to Kulayn, and there await further instructions.  
This was, shortly after, followed by a letter which the &amp;Shah 
had himself addressed to the &amp;Bab, dated &amp;Rabi'u'th-thani 1263 (March 
19-April 17, 1847), and which, though couched in courteous terms, 
clearly indicated the extent of the baneful influence exercised by the 
Grand Vizir on his sovereign.  The plans so fondly cherished by 
&amp;Manuchihr &amp;Khan were now utterly undone.  The fortress of &amp;Mah-Ku, 
not far from the village of that same name, whose inhabitants had 
long enjoyed the patronage of the Grand Vizir, situated in the remotest 
northwestern corner of &amp;Adhirbayjan, was the place of incarceration 
assigned by &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, on the advice of his perfidious 
minister, for the &amp;Bab.  No more than one companion and 
one attendant from among His followers were allowed to keep Him 
company in those bleak and inhospitable surroundings.  All-powerful 
and crafty, that minister had, on the pretext of the necessity of his 
master's concentrating his immediate attention on a recent rebellion 
in &amp;Khurasan and a revolt in &amp;Kirman, succeeded in foiling a plan, 
which, had it materialized, would have had the most serious repercussions 
on his own fortunes, as well as on the immediate destinies of his 
government, its ruler and its people.

                                  CHAPTER II 
                      The &amp;Bab's Captivity in &amp;Adhirbayjan 
 
     The period of the &amp;Bab's banishment to the mountains of &amp;Adhirbayjan, 
lasting no less than three years, constitutes the saddest, 
the most dramatic, and in a sense the most pregnant phase of His six 
year ministry.  It comprises His nine months' unbroken confinement 
in the fortress of &amp;Mah-Ku, and His subsequent incarceration in the 
fortress of &amp;Chihriq, which was interrupted only by a brief yet 
memorable visit to &amp;Tabriz.  It was overshadowed throughout by the 
implacable and mounting hostility of the two most powerful adversaries 
of the Faith, the Grand Vizir of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Aqasi, and the &amp;Amir-Nizam, the Grand Vizir of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din 
&amp;Shah.  It corresponds to the most critical stage of the mission of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, during His exile to Adrianople, when confronted with 
the despotic &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz and his ministers, &amp;Ali &amp;Pasha and 
&amp;Fu'ad &amp;Pasha, and is paralleled by the darkest days of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
ministry in the Holy Land, under the oppressive rule of the tyrannical 
&amp;Abdu'l-Hamid and the equally tyrannical &amp;Jamal &amp;Pasha.  &amp;Shiraz had 
been the memorable scene of the &amp;Bab's historic Declaration; &amp;Isfahan 
had provided Him, however briefly, with a haven of relative peace 
and security; whilst &amp;Adhirbayjan was destined to become the theatre 
of His agony and martyrdom.  These concluding years of His earthly 
life will go down in history as the time when the new Dispensation 
attained its full stature, when the claim of its Founder was fully and 
publicly asserted, when its laws were formulated, when the Covenant 
of its Author was firmly established, when its independence was proclaimed, 
and when the heroism of its champions blazed forth in 
immortal glory.  For it was during these intensely dramatic, fate-laden 
years that the full implications of the station of the &amp;Bab were 
disclosed to His disciples, and formally announced by Him in the 
capital of &amp;Adhirbayjan, in the presence of the Heir to the Throne; 
that the Persian &amp;Bayan, the repository of the laws ordained by the 
&amp;Bab, was revealed; that the time and character of the Dispensation of 
"the One Whom God will make manifest" were unmistakably determined; 
that the Conference of &amp;Badasht proclaimed the annulment 
of the old order; and that the great conflagrations of &amp;Mazindaran, 
of &amp;Nayriz and of &amp;Zanjan were kindled.  
 
+P18 
     And yet, the foolish and short-sighted &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi fondly 
imagined that by confounding the plan of the &amp;Bab to meet the &amp;Shah 
face to face in the capital, and by relegating Him to the farthest 
corner of the realm, he had stifled the Movement at its birth, and 
would soon conclusively triumph over its Founder.  Little did he 
imagine that the very isolation he was forcing upon his Prisoner 
would enable Him to evolve the System designed to incarnate the 
soul of His Faith, and would afford Him the opportunity of safeguarding 
it from disintegration and schism, and of proclaiming 
formally and unreservedly His mission.  Little did he imagine that 
this very confinement would induce that Prisoner's exasperated 
disciples and companions to cast off the shackles of an antiquated 
theology, and precipitate happenings that would call forth from them 
a prowess, a courage, a self-renunciation unexampled in their country's 
history.  Little did he imagine that by this very act he would be 
instrumental in fulfilling the authentic tradition ascribed to the 
Prophet of &amp;Islam regarding the inevitability of that which should 
come to pass in &amp;Adhirbayjan.  Untaught by the example of the 
governor of &amp;Shiraz, who, with fear and trembling, had, at the first 
taste of God's avenging wrath, fled ignominiously and relaxed his 
hold on his Captive, the Grand Vizir of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah was, in 
his turn, through the orders he had issued, storing up for himself 
severe and inevitable disappointment, and paving the way for his own 
ultimate downfall.  
     His orders to &amp;Ali &amp;Khan, the warden of the fortress of &amp;Mah-Ku, 
were stringent and explicit.  On His way to that fortress the &amp;Bab 
passed a number of days in &amp;Tabriz, days that were marked by such an 
intense excitement on the part of the populace that, except for a few 
persons, neither the public nor His followers were allowed to meet 
Him.  As He was escorted through the streets of the city the shout 
of "&amp;Allah-u-Akbar" resounded on every side.  So great, indeed, 
became the clamor that the town crier was ordered to warn the 
inhabitants that any one who ventured to seek the &amp;Bab's presence 
would forfeit all his possessions and be imprisoned.  Upon His arrival 
in &amp;Mah-Ku, surnamed by Him &amp;Jabal-i-Basit (the Open Mountain) 
no one was allowed to see Him for the first two weeks except His 
amanuensis, Siyyid &amp;Husayn, and his brother.  So grievous was His 
plight while in that fortress that, in the Persian &amp;Bayan, He Himself 
has stated that at night-time He did not even have a lighted lamp, 
and that His solitary chamber, constructed of sun-baked bricks, 
lacked even a door, while, in His Tablet to &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, He 
 
+P19 
has complained that the inmates of the fortress were confined to two 
guards and four dogs.  
     Secluded on the heights of a remote and dangerously situated 
mountain on the frontiers of the Ottoman and Russian empires; 
imprisoned within the solid walls of a four-towered fortress; cut off 
from His family, His kindred and His disciples; living in the vicinity 
of a bigoted and turbulent community who, by race, tradition, 
language and creed, differed from the vast majority of the inhabitants 
of Persia; guarded by the people of a district which, as the birthplace 
of the Grand Vizir, had been made the recipient of the special 
favors of his administration, the Prisoner of &amp;Mah-Ku seemed in the 
eyes of His adversary to be doomed to languish away the flower of 
His youth, and witness, at no distant date, the complete annihilation 
of His hopes.  That adversary was soon to realize, however, how 
gravely he had misjudged both his Prisoner and those on whom he 
had lavished his favors.  An unruly, a proud and unreasoning people 
were gradually subdued by the gentleness of the &amp;Bab, were chastened 
by His modesty, were edified by His counsels, and instructed by His 
wisdom.  They were so carried away by their love for Him that their 
first act every morning, notwithstanding the remonstrations of the 
domineering &amp;Ali &amp;Khan, and the repeated threats of disciplinary measures 
received from &amp;Tihran, was to seek a place where they could 
catch a glimpse of His face, and beseech from afar His benediction 
upon their daily work.  In cases of dispute it was their wont to 
hasten to the foot of the fortress, and, with their eyes fixed upon His 
abode, invoke His name, and adjure one another to speak the truth.  
&amp;Ali &amp;Khan himself, under the influence of a strange vision, felt such 
mortification that he was impelled to relax the severity of his discipline, 
as an atonement for his past behavior.  Such became his leniency 
that an increasing stream of eager and devout pilgrims began to be 
admitted at the gates of the fortress.  Among them was the dauntless 
and indefatigable &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, who had walked on foot the entire 
way from &amp;Mashad in the east of Persia to &amp;Mah-Ku, the westernmost 
outpost of the realm, and was able, after so arduous a journey, to 
celebrate the festival of &amp;Naw-Ruz (1848) in the company of his 
Beloved.  
     Secret agents, however, charged to watch &amp;Ali &amp;Khan, informed &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi of the turn events were taking, whereupon he immediately 
decided to transfer the &amp;Bab to the fortress of &amp;Chihriq (about 
April 10, 1848), surnamed by Him the &amp;Jabal-i-Shadid (the Grievous 
Mountain).  There He was consigned to the keeping of &amp;Yahya &amp;Khan, 
 
+P20 
a brother-in-law of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah.  Though at the outset he acted 
with the utmost severity, he was eventually compelled to yield to 
the fascination of his Prisoner.  Nor were the kurds, who lived in the 
village of &amp;Chihriq, and whose hatred of the &amp;Shi'ahs exceeded even 
that of the inhabitants of &amp;Mah-Ku, able to resist the pervasive power 
of the Prisoner's influence.  They too were to be seen every morning, 
ere they started for their daily work, to approach the fortress and 
prostrate themselves in adoration before its holy Inmate.  "So great 
was the confluence of the people," is the testimony of a European 
eye-witness, writing in his memoirs of the &amp;Bab, "that the courtyard, 
not being large enough to contain His hearers, the majority remained 
in the street and listened with rapt attention to the verses of the 
new &amp;Qur'an."  
     Indeed the turmoil raised in &amp;Chihriq eclipsed the scenes which 
&amp;Mah-Ku had witnessed.  Siyyids of distinguished merit, eminent 
&amp;ulamas, and even government officials were boldly and rapidly 
espousing the Cause of the Prisoner.  The conversion of the zealous, 
the famous &amp;Mirza &amp;Asadu'llah, surnamed &amp;Dayyan, a prominent official 
of high literary repute, who was endowed by the &amp;Bab with the 
"hidden and preserved knowledge," and extolled as the "repository 
of the trust of the one true God," and the arrival of a dervish, a 
former &amp;navvab, from India, whom the &amp;Bab in a vision had bidden 
renounce wealth and position, and hasten on foot to meet Him in 
&amp;Adhirbayjan, brought the situation to a head.  Accounts of these 
startling events reached &amp;Tabriz, were thence communicated to &amp;Tihran, 
and forced &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi again to intervene.  &amp;Dayyan's father, an 
intimate friend of that minister, had already expressed to him his 
grave apprehension at the manner in which the able functionaries of 
the state were being won over to the new Faith.  To allay the rising 
excitement the &amp;Bab was summoned to &amp;Tabriz.  Fearful of the enthusiasm 
of the people of &amp;Adhirbayjan, those into whose custody He had 
been delivered decided to deflect their route, and avoid the town of 
&amp;Khuy, passing instead through &amp;Urumiyyih.  On His arrival in that 
town Prince Malik &amp;Qasim &amp;Mirza ceremoniously received Him, and 
was even seen, on a certain Friday, when his Guest was riding on His 
way to the public bath, to accompany Him on foot, while the 
Prince's footmen endeavored to restrain the people who, in their 
overflowing enthusiasm, were pressing to catch a glimpse of so 
marvelous a Prisoner.  &amp;Tabriz, in its turn in the throes of wild excitement, 
joyously hailed His arrival.  Such was the fervor of popular 
feeling that the &amp;Bab was assigned a place outside the gates of the city.  
 
+P21 
This, however, failed to allay the prevailing emotion.  Precautions, 
warnings and restrictions served only to aggravate a situation that 
had already become critical.  It was at this juncture that the Grand 
Vizir issued his historic order for the immediate convocation of the 
ecclesiastical dignitaries of &amp;Tabriz to consider the most effectual 
measures which would, once and for all, extinguish the flames of so 
devouring a conflagration.  
     The circumstances attending the examination of the &amp;Bab, as a 
result of so precipitate an act, may well rank as one of the chief 
landmarks of His dramatic career.  The avowed purpose of that convocation 
was to arraign the Prisoner, and deliberate on the steps to 
be taken for the extirpation of His so-called heresy.  It instead 
afforded Him the supreme opportunity of His mission to assert in 
public, formally and without any reservation, the claims inherent in 
His Revelation.  In the official residence, and in the presence, of the 
governor of &amp;Adhirbayjan, &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Mirza, the heir to the throne; 
under the presidency of &amp;Haji &amp;Mulla &amp;Mahmud, the &amp;Nizamu'l-'Ulama, 
the Prince's tutor; before the assembled ecclesiastical dignitaries of 
&amp;Tabriz, the leaders of the &amp;Shaykhi community, the &amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam, 
and the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih, the &amp;Bab, having seated Himself in the chief 
place which had been reserved for the &amp;Vali-'Ahd (the heir to the 
throne), gave, in ringing tones, His celebrated answer to the question 
put to Him by the President of that assembly.  "I am," He exclaimed, 
"I am, I am the Promised One!  I am the One Whose name 
you have for a thousand years invoked, at Whose mention you have 
risen, Whose advent you have longed to witness, and the hour of 
Whose Revelation you have prayed God to hasten.  Verily, I say, it is 
incumbent upon the peoples of both the East and the West to obey 
My word, and to pledge allegiance to My person."  
     Awe-struck, those present momentarily dropped their heads in 
silent confusion.  Then &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-i-Mamaqani, that one-eyed 
white-bearded renegade, summoning sufficient courage, with characteristic 
insolence, reprimanded Him as a perverse and contemptible 
follower of Satan; to which the undaunted Youth retorted that He 
maintained what He had already asserted.  To the query subsequently 
addressed to Him by the &amp;Nizamu'l-'Ulama the &amp;Bab affirmed that His 
words constituted the most incontrovertible evidence of His mission, 
adduced verses from the &amp;Qur'an to establish the truth of His assertion, 
and claimed to be able to reveal, within the space of two days 
and two nights, verses equal to the whole of that Book.  In answer to a 
criticism calling His attention to an infraction by Him of the rules 
 
+P22 
of grammar, He cited certain passages from the &amp;Qur'an as corroborative 
evidence, and, turning aside, with firmness and dignity, a 
frivolous and irrelevant remark thrown at Him by one of those who 
were present, summarily disbanded that gathering by Himself rising 
and quitting the room.  The convocation thereupon dispersed, its 
members confused, divided among themselves, bitterly resentful and 
humiliated through their failure to achieve their purpose.  Far from 
daunting the spirit of their Captive, far from inducing Him to 
recant or abandon His mission, that gathering was productive of no 
other result than the decision, arrived at after considerable argument 
and discussion, to inflict the bastinado on Him, at the hands, and in 
the prayer-house of the heartless and avaricious &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Asghar, 
the &amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam of that city.  Confounded in his schemes &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi was forced to order the &amp;Bab to be taken back to 
&amp;Chihriq.  
     This dramatic, this unqualified and formal declaration of the 
&amp;Bab's prophetic mission was not the sole consequence of the foolish 
act which condemned the Author of so weighty a Revelation to a 
three years' confinement in the mountains of &amp;Adhirbayjan.  This 
period of captivity, in a remote corner of the realm, far removed 
from the storm centers of &amp;Shiraz, &amp;Isfahan, and &amp;Tihran, afforded Him 
the necessary leisure to launch upon His most monumental work, as 
well as to engage on other subsidiary compositions designed to unfold 
the whole range, and impart the full force, of His short-lived yet 
momentous Dispensation.  Alike in the magnitude of the writings 
emanating from His pen, and in the diversity of the subjects treated 
in those writings, His Revelation stands wholly unparalleled in the 
annals of any previous religion.  He Himself affirms, while confined 
in &amp;Mah-Ku, that up to that time His writings, embracing highly 
diversified subjects, had amounted to more than five hundred thousand 
verses.  "The verses which have rained from this Cloud of Divine 
mercy," is &amp;Baha'u'llah's testimony in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, "have been so 
abundant that none hath yet been able to estimate their number.  A 
score of volumes are now available.  How many still remain beyond 
our reach!  How many have been plundered and have fallen into the 
hands of the enemy, the fate of which none knoweth!"  No less 
arresting is the variety of themes presented by these voluminous 
writings, such as prayers, homilies, orations, Tablets of visitation, 
scientific treatises, doctrinal dissertations, exhortations, commentaries 
on the &amp;Qur'an and on various traditions, epistles to the highest religious 
and ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm, and laws and 
 
+P23 
ordinances for the consolidation of His Faith and the direction of 
its activities.  
     Already in &amp;Shiraz, at the earliest stage of His ministry, He had 
revealed what &amp;Baha'u'llah has characterized as "the first, the greatest, 
and mightiest of all books" in the &amp;Babi Dispensation, the celebrated 
commentary on the &amp;surih of Joseph, entitled the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', 
whose fundamental purpose was to forecast what the true Joseph 
(&amp;Baha'u'llah) would, in a succeeding Dispensation, endure at the 
hands of one who was at once His arch-enemy and blood brother.  
This work, comprising above nine thousand three hundred verses, 
and divided into one hundred and eleven chapters, each chapter a 
commentary on one verse of the above-mentioned &amp;surih, opens with 
the &amp;Bab's clarion-call and dire warnings addressed to the "concourse 
of kings and of the sons of kings;" forecasts the doom of &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah; commands his Grand Vizir, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, to abdicate his 
authority; admonishes the entire Muslim ecclesiastical order; cautions 
more specifically the members of the &amp;Shi'ah community; extols the 
virtues, and anticipates the coming, of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the "Remnant of 
God," the "Most Great Master;" and proclaims, in unequivocal language, 
the independence and universality of the &amp;Babi Revelation, 
unveils its import, and affirms the inevitable triumph of its Author.  
It, moreover, directs the "people of the West" to "issue forth from 
your cities and aid the Cause of God;" warns the peoples of the earth 
of the "terrible, the most grievous vengeance of God;" threatens the 
whole Islamic world with "the Most Great Fire" were they to turn 
aside from the newly-revealed Law; foreshadows the Author's 
martyrdom; eulogizes the high station ordained for the people of 
&amp;Baha, the "Companions of the crimson-colored ruby Ark;" prophesies 
the fading out and utter obliteration of some of the greatest luminaries 
in the firmament of the &amp;Babi Dispensation; and even predicts "afflictive 
torment," in both the "Day of Our Return" and in "the world 
which is to come," for the usurpers of the Imamate, who "waged war 
against &amp;Husayn (&amp;Imam &amp;Husayn) in the Land of the Euphrates."  
     It was this Book which the &amp;Babis universally regarded, during 
almost the entire ministry of the &amp;Bab, as the &amp;Qur'an of the people of 
the &amp;Bayan; whose first and most challenging chapter was revealed in 
the presence of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, on the night of its Author's Declaration; 
some of whose pages were borne, by that same disciple, to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, as the first fruits of a Revelation which instantly won 
His enthusiastic allegiance; whose entire text was translated into 
Persian by the brilliant and gifted &amp;Tahirih; whose passages inflamed 
 
+P24 
the hostility of &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan and precipitated the initial outbreak 
of persecution in &amp;Shiraz; a single page of which had captured the 
imagination and entranced the soul of &amp;Hujjat; and whose contents 
had set afire the intrepid defenders of the Fort of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi 
and the heroes of &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Zanjan.  
     This work, of such exalted merit, of such far-reaching influence, 
was followed by the revelation of the &amp;Bab's first Tablet to &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah; of His Tablets to &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Majid and to &amp;Najib &amp;Pasha, 
the &amp;Vali of &amp;Baghdad; of the &amp;Sahifiy-i-baynu'l-Haramayn, revealed 
between Mecca and Medina, in answer to questions posed by &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhit-i-Kirmani; of the Epistle to the &amp;Sherif of Mecca; of the 
&amp;Kitabu'r-Ruh, comprising seven hundred &amp;surihs; of the &amp;Khasa'il-i-Sab'ih, 
which enjoined the alteration of the formula of the &amp;adhan; 
of the &amp;Risaliy-i-Furu'-i-'Adliyyih, rendered into Persian by &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Muhammad-Taqiy-i-Harati; of the commentary on the &amp;surih of 
&amp;Kawthar, which effected such a transformation in the soul of &amp;Vahid; 
of the commentary on the &amp;surih of &amp;Va'l-'Asr, in the house of the 
&amp;Imam-Jum'ih of &amp;Isfahan; of the dissertation on the Specific Mission 
of &amp;Muhammad, written at the request of &amp;Manuchihr &amp;Khan; of the 
second Tablet to &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, craving an audience in which to 
set forth the truths of the new Revelation, and dissipate his doubts; 
and of the Tablets sent from the village of &amp;Siyah-Dihan to the &amp;ulamas 
of &amp;Qasvin and to &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, inquiring from him as to the 
cause of the sudden change in his decision.  
     The great bulk of the writings emanating from the &amp;Bab's prolific 
mind was, however, reserved for the period of His confinement in 
&amp;Mah-Ku and &amp;Chihriq.  To this period must probably belong the 
unnumbered Epistles which, as attested by no less an authority than 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, the &amp;Bab specifically addressed to the divines of every city 
in Persia, as well as to those residing in Najaf and &amp;Karbila, wherein 
He set forth in detail the errors committed by each one of them.  It 
was during His incarceration in the fortress of &amp;Mah-Ku that He, 
according to the testimony of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Hasan-i-Zunuzi, who transcribed 
during those nine months the verses dictated by the &amp;Bab to 
His amanuensis, revealed no less than nine commentaries on the whole 
of the &amp;Qur'an--commentaries whose fate, alas, is unknown, and one 
of which, at least the Author Himself affirmed, surpassed in some 
respects a book as deservedly famous as the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma.  
     Within the walls of that same fortress the &amp;Bayan (Exposition)--
that monumental repository of the laws and precepts of the new 
Dispensation and the treasury enshrining most of the &amp;Bab's references 
 
+P25 
and tributes to, as well as His warning regarding, "Him Whom 
God will make manifest"--was revealed.  Peerless among the doctrinal 
works of the Founder of the &amp;Babi Dispensation; consisting of nine 
&amp;Vahids (Unities) of nineteen chapters each, except the last &amp;Vahid 
comprising only ten chapters; not to be confounded with the 
smaller and less weighty Arabic &amp;Bayan, revealed during the same 
period; fulfilling the &amp;Muhammadan prophecy that "a Youth from 
&amp;Bani-Hashim ... will reveal a new Book and promulgate a new 
Law;" wholly safeguarded from the interpolation and corruption 
which has been the fate of so many of the &amp;Bab's lesser works, this 
Book, of about eight thousand verses, occupying a pivotal position 
in &amp;Babi literature, should be regarded primarily as a eulogy of the 
Promised One rather than a code of laws and ordinances designed 
to be a permanent guide to future generations.  This Book at once 
abrogated the laws and ceremonials enjoined by the &amp;Qur'an regarding 
prayer, fasting, marriage, divorce and inheritance, and upheld, in its 
integrity, the belief in the prophetic mission of &amp;Muhammad, even as 
the Prophet of &amp;Islam before Him had annulled the ordinances of 
the Gospel and yet recognized the Divine origin of the Faith of Jesus 
Christ.  It moreover interpreted in a masterly fashion the meaning of 
certain terms frequently occurring in the sacred Books of previous 
Dispensations such as Paradise, Hell, Death, Resurrection, the Return, 
the Balance, the Hour, the Last Judgment, and the like.  Designedly 
severe in the rules and regulations it imposed, revolutionizing in the 
principles it instilled, calculated to awaken from their age-long torpor 
the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and fatal blow 
to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed, through its drastic 
provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day, the Day when "the 
Summoner shall summon to a stern business," when He will "demolish 
whatever hath been before Him, even as the Apostle of God demolished 
the ways of those that preceded Him."  
     It should be noted, in this connection, that in the third &amp;Vahid of 
this Book there occurs a passage which, alike in its explicit reference 
to the name of the Promised One, and in its anticipation of the 
Order which, in a later age, was to be identified with His Revelation, 
deserves to rank as one of the most significant statements recorded in 
any of the &amp;Bab's writings.  "Well is it with him," is His prophetic 
announcement, "who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and rendereth thanks unto his Lord.  For He will assuredly be made 
manifest.  God hath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the &amp;Bayan."  
It is with that self-same Order that the Founder of the promised 
 
+P26 
Revelation, twenty years later--incorporating that same term in His 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas--identified the System envisaged in that Book, affirming 
that "this most great Order" had deranged the world's equilibrium, 
and revolutionized mankind's ordered life.  It is the features of that 
self-same Order which, at a later stage in the evolution of the Faith, 
the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant and the appointed Interpreter 
of His teachings, delineated through the provisions of His Will and 
Testament.  It is the structural basis of that self-same Order which, 
in the Formative Age of that same Faith, the stewards of that same 
Covenant, the elected representatives of the world-wide &amp;Baha'i community, 
are now laboriously and unitedly establishing.  It is the 
superstructure of that self-same Order, attaining its full stature 
through the emergence of the &amp;Baha'i World Commonwealth--the 
Kingdom of God on earth--which the Golden Age of that same 
Dispensation must, in the fullness of time, ultimately witness.  
     The &amp;Bab was still in &amp;Mah-Ku when He wrote the most detailed 
and illuminating of His Tablets to &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah.  Prefaced by a 
laudatory reference to the unity of God, to His Apostles and to the 
twelve &amp;Imams; unequivocal in its assertion of the divinity of its 
Author and of the supernatural powers with which His Revelation 
had been invested; precise in the verses and traditions it cites in 
confirmation of so audacious a claim; severe in its condemnation of 
some of the officials and representatives of the &amp;Shah's administration, 
particularly of the "wicked and accursed" &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan; moving in 
its description of the humiliation and hardships to which its writer 
had been subjected, this historic document resembles, in many of its 
features, the &amp;Lawh-i-Sultan, the Tablet addressed, under similar 
circumstances, from the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka by &amp;Baha'u'llah to 
&amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, and constituting His lengthiest epistle to any 
single sovereign.  
     The &amp;Dala'il-i-Sab'ih (Seven Proofs), the most important of the 
polemical works of the &amp;Bab, was revealed during that same period.  
Remarkably lucid, admirable in its precision, original in conception, 
unanswerable in its argument, this work, apart from the many and 
divers proofs of His mission which it adduces, is noteworthy for the 
blame it assigns to the "seven powerful sovereigns ruling the world" 
in His day, as well as for the manner in which it stresses the 
responsibilities, and censures the conduct, of the Christian divines of a 
former age who, had they recognized the truth of &amp;Muhammad's 
mission, He contends, would have been followed by the mass of their 
co-religionists.  
 
+P27 
     During the &amp;Bab's confinement in the fortress of &amp;Chihriq, where 
He spent almost the whole of the two remaining years of His life, 
the &amp;Lawh-i-Huru'fat (Tablet of the Letters) was revealed, in honor 
of &amp;Dayyan--a Tablet which, however misconstrued at first as an 
exposition of the science of divination, was later recognized to have 
unravelled, on the one hand, the mystery of the &amp;Mustaghath, and to 
have abstrusely alluded, on the other, to the nineteen years which 
must needs elapse between the Declaration of the &amp;Bab and that of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  It was during these years--years darkened throughout 
by the rigors of the &amp;Bab's captivity, by the severe indignities inflicted 
upon Him, and by the news of the disasters that overtook the heroes 
of &amp;Mazindaran and &amp;Nayriz--that He revealed, soon after His return 
from &amp;Tabriz, His denunciatory Tablet to &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi.  Couched 
in bold and moving language, unsparing in its condemnation, this 
epistle was forwarded to the intrepid &amp;Hujjat who, as corroborated 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah, delivered it to that wicked minister.  
     To this period of incarceration in the fortresses of &amp;Mah-Ku and 
&amp;Chihriq--a period of unsurpassed fecundity, yet bitter in its humiliations 
and ever-deepening sorrows--belong almost all the written 
references, whether in the form of warnings, appeals or exhortations, 
which the &amp;Bab, in anticipation of the approaching hour of His 
supreme affliction, felt it necessary to make to the Author of a 
Revelation that was soon to supersede His own.  Conscious from the 
very beginning of His twofold mission, as the Bearer of a wholly 
independent Revelation and the Herald of One still greater than His 
own, He could not content Himself with the vast number of commentaries, 
of prayers, of laws and ordinances, of dissertations and 
epistles, of homilies and orations that had incessantly streamed from 
His pen.  The Greater Covenant into which, as affirmed in His writings, 
God had, from time immemorial, entered, through the Prophets 
of all ages, with the whole of mankind, regarding the newborn 
Revelation, had already been fulfilled.  It had now to be supplemented 
by a Lesser Covenant which He felt bound to make with the entire 
body of His followers concerning the One Whose advent He characterized 
as the fruit and ultimate purpose of His Dispensation.  
Such a Covenant had invariably been the feature of every previous 
religion.  It had existed, under various forms, with varying degrees 
of emphasis, had always been couched in veiled language, and had 
been alluded to in cryptic prophecies, in abstruse allegories, in 
unauthenticated traditions, and in the fragmentary and obscure 
passages of the sacred Scriptures.  In the &amp;Babi Dispensation, however, 
 
+P28 
it was destined to be established in clear and unequivocal language, 
though not embodied in a separate document.  Unlike the Prophets 
gone before Him, Whose Covenants were shrouded in mystery, unlike 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, Whose clearly defined Covenant was incorporated in a 
specially written Testament, and designated by Him as "the Book 
of My Covenant," the &amp;Bab chose to intersperse His Book of Laws, 
the Persian &amp;Bayan, with unnumbered passages, some designedly 
obscure, mostly indubitably clear and conclusive, in which He fixes 
the date of the promised Revelation, extols its virtues, asserts its 
pre-eminent character, assigns to it unlimited powers and prerogatives, 
and tears down every barrier that might be an obstacle to its 
recognition.  "He, verily," &amp;Baha'u'llah, referring to the &amp;Bab in His 
&amp;Kitab-i-Badi', has stated, "hath not fallen short of His duty to 
exhort the people of the &amp;Bayan and to deliver unto them His Message.  
In no age or dispensation hath any Manifestation made mention, in 
such detail and in such explicit language, of the Manifestation 
destined to succeed Him."  
     Some of His disciples the &amp;Bab assiduously prepared to expect the 
imminent Revelation.  Others He orally assured would live to see its 
day.  To &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir, one of the Letters of the Living, He actually 
prophesied, in a Tablet addressed to him, that he would meet the 
Promised One face to face.  To &amp;Sayyah, another disciple, He gave 
verbally a similar assurance.  &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn He directed to &amp;Tihran, 
assuring him that in that city was enshrined a Mystery Whose light 
neither &amp;Hijaz nor &amp;Shiraz could rival.  &amp;Quddus, on the eve of his 
final separation from Him, was promised that he would attain the 
presence of the One Who was the sole Object of their adoration and 
love.  To &amp;Shaykh &amp;Hasan-i-Zunuzi He declared while in &amp;Mah-Ku that 
he would behold in &amp;Karbila the countenance of the promised &amp;Husayn.  
On &amp;Dayyan He conferred the title of "the third Letter to believe in 
Him Whom God shall make manifest," while to &amp;Azim He divulged, 
in the &amp;Kitab-i-Panj-Sha'n, the name, and announced the approaching 
advent, of Him Who was to consummate His own Revelation.  
     A successor or vicegerent the &amp;Bab never named, an interpreter of 
His teachings He refrained from appointing.  So transparently clear 
were His references to the Promised One, so brief was to be the 
duration of His own Dispensation, that neither the one nor the other 
was deemed necessary.  All He did was, according to the testimony of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in "A Traveller's Narrative," to nominate, on the 
advice of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of another disciple, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, who 
would act solely as a figure-head pending the manifestation of the 
 
+P29 
Promised One, thus enabling &amp;Baha'u'llah to promote, in relative 
security, the Cause so dear to His heart.  
     "The &amp;Bayan," the &amp;Bab in that Book, referring to the Promised 
One, affirms, "is, from beginning to end, the repository of all of His 
attributes, and the treasury of both His fire and His light."  "If thou 
attainest unto His Revelation," He, in another connection declares, 
"and obeyest Him, thou wilt have revealed the fruit of the &amp;Bayan; 
if not, thou art unworthy of mention before God."  "O people of 
the &amp;Bayan!" He, in that same Book, thus warns the entire company 
of His followers, "act not as the people of the &amp;Qur'an have acted, 
for if ye do so, the fruits of your night will come to naught."  "Suffer 
not the &amp;Bayan," is His emphatic injunction, "and all that hath been 
revealed therein to withhold you from that Essence of Being and 
Lord of the visible and invisible."  "Beware, beware," is His significant 
warning addressed to &amp;Vahid, "lest in the days of His Revelation the 
&amp;Vahid of the &amp;Bayan (eighteen Letters of the Living and the &amp;Bab) 
shut thee out as by a veil from Him, inasmuch as this &amp;Vahid is but a 
creature in His sight."  And again:  "O congregation of the &amp;Bayan, 
and all who are therein!  Recognize ye the limits imposed upon you, 
for such a One as the Point of the &amp;Bayan Himself hath believed in 
Him Whom God shall make manifest before all things were created.  
Therein, verily, do I glory before all who are in the kingdom of 
heaven and earth."  
     "In the year nine," He, referring to the date of the advent of the 
promised Revelation, has explicitly written, "ye shall attain unto all 
good."  "In the year nine, ye will attain unto the presence of God."  
And again:  "After &amp;Hin (68) a Cause shall be given unto you which 
ye shall come to know."  "Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception 
of this Cause," He more particularly has stated, "the realities of 
the created things will not be made manifest.  All that thou hast as 
yet seen is but the stage from the moist germ until We clothed it 
with flesh.  Be patient, until thou beholdest a new creation.  Say:  
`Blessed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of Makers!'"  "Wait 
thou," is His statement to &amp;Azim, "until nine will have elapsed from 
the time of the &amp;Bayan.  Then exclaim:  `Blessed, therefore, be God, 
the most excellent of Makers!'"  "Be attentive," He, referring in a 
remarkable passage to the year nineteen, has admonished, "from the 
inception of the Revelation till the number of &amp;Vahid (19)."  "The 
Lord of the Day of Reckoning," He, even more explicitly, has stated, 
"will be manifested at the end of &amp;Vahid (19) and the beginning of 
eighty (1280 A.H.)."  "Were He to appear this very moment," He, 
 
+P30 
in His eagerness to insure that the proximity of the promised Revelation 
should not withhold men from the Promised One, has revealed, 
"I would be the first to adore Him, and the first to bow down 
before Him."  
     "I have written down in My mention of Him," He thus extols 
the Author of the anticipated Revelation, "these gem-like words:  `No 
allusion of Mine can allude unto Him, neither anything mentioned in 
the &amp;Bayan.'"  "I, Myself, am but the first servant to believe in Him 
and in His signs...."  "The year-old germ," He significantly affirms, 
"that holdeth within itself the potentialities of the Revelation that is 
to come is endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces 
of the whole of the &amp;Bayan."  And again:  "The whole of the &amp;Bayan is 
only a leaf amongst the leaves of His Paradise."  "Better is it for thee," 
He similarly asserts, "to recite but one of the verses of Him Whom 
God shall make manifest than to set down the whole of the &amp;Bayan, 
for on that Day that one verse can save thee, whereas the entire &amp;Bayan 
cannot save thee."  "Today the &amp;Bayan is in the stage of seed; at the 
beginning of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest 
its ultimate perfection will become apparent."  "The &amp;Bayan 
deriveth all its glory from Him Whom God shall make manifest."  
"All that hath been revealed in the &amp;Bayan is but a ring upon My hand, 
and I Myself am, verily, but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom 
God shall make manifest...  He turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever 
He pleaseth, and through whatsoever He pleaseth.  He, verily, 
is the Help in Peril, the Most High."  "Certitude itself," He, in reply 
to &amp;Vahid and to one of the Letters of the Living who had inquired 
regarding the promised One, had declared, "is ashamed to be called 
upon to certify His truth ... and Testimony itself is ashamed to 
testify unto Him."  Addressing this same &amp;Vahid, He moreover had 
stated:  "Were I to be assured that in the day of His manifestation 
thou wilt deny Him, I would unhesitatingly disown thee...  If, on 
the other hand, I be told that a Christian, who beareth no allegiance 
to My Faith, will believe in Him, the same will I regard as the apple 
of My eye."  
     And finally is this, His moving invocation to God:  "Bear Thou 
witness that, through this Book, I have covenanted with all created 
things concerning the mission of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, 
ere the covenant concerning My own mission had been established.  
Sufficient witness art Thou and they that have believed in Thy 
signs."  "I, verily, have not fallen short of My duty to admonish that 
people," is yet another testimony from His pen, "...If on the day of 
 
+P31 
His Revelation all that are on earth bear Him allegiance, Mine inmost 
being will rejoice, inasmuch as all will have attained the summit of 
their existence....  If not, My soul will be saddened.  I truly have 
nurtured all things for this purpose.  How, then, can any one be 
veiled from Him?"  
     The last three and most eventful years of the &amp;Bab's ministry had, 
as we have observed in the preceding pages, witnessed not only the 
formal and public declaration of His mission, but also an unprecedented 
effusion of His inspired writings, including both the revelation 
of the fundamental laws of His Dispensation and also the establishment 
of that Lesser Covenant which was to safeguard the unity of 
His followers and pave the way for the advent of an incomparably 
mightier Revelation.  It was during this same period, in the early 
days of His incarceration in the fortress of &amp;Chihriq, that the independence 
of the new-born Faith was openly recognized and asserted 
by His disciples.  The laws underlying the new Dispensation had 
been revealed by its Author in a prison-fortress in the mountains of 
&amp;Adhirbayjan, while the Dispensation itself was now to be inaugurated 
in a plain on the border of &amp;Mazindaran, at a conference of His 
assembled followers.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah, maintaining through continual correspondence close 
contact with the &amp;Bab, and Himself the directing force behind the 
manifold activities of His struggling fellow-disciples, unobtrusively 
yet effectually presided over that conference, and guided and controlled 
its proceedings.  &amp;Quddus, regarded as the exponent of the 
conservative element within it, affected, in pursuance of a pre-conceived 
plan designed to mitigate the alarm and consternation which 
such a conference was sure to arouse, to oppose the seemingly 
extremist views advocated by the impetuous &amp;Tahirih.  The primary 
purpose of that gathering was to implement the revelation of the 
&amp;Bayan by a sudden, a complete and dramatic break with the past--
with its order, its ecclesiasticism, its traditions, and ceremonials.  The 
subsidiary purpose of the conference was to consider the means of 
emancipating the &amp;Bab from His cruel confinement in &amp;Chihriq.  The 
first was eminently successful; the second was destined from the 
outset to fail.  
     The scene of such a challenging and far-reaching proclamation 
was the hamlet of &amp;Badasht, where &amp;Baha'u'llah had rented, amidst 
pleasant surroundings, three gardens, one of which He assigned to 
&amp;Quddus, another to &amp;Tahirih, whilst the third He reserved for Himself.  
The eighty-one disciples who had gathered from various provinces 
 
+P32 
were His guests from the day of their arrival to the day they dispersed.  
On each of the twenty-two days of His sojourn in that 
hamlet He revealed a Tablet, which was chanted in the presence of 
the assembled believers.  On every believer He conferred a new name, 
without, however, disclosing the identity of the one who had bestowed 
it.  He Himself was henceforth designated by the name &amp;Baha.  Upon 
the Last Letter of the Living was conferred the appellation of 
&amp;Quddus, while &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn was given the title of &amp;Tahirih.  By 
these names they were all subsequently addressed by the &amp;Bab in the 
Tablets He revealed for each one of them.  
     It was &amp;Baha'u'llah Who steadily, unerringly, yet unsuspectedly, 
steered the course of that memorable episode, and it was &amp;Baha'u'llah 
Who brought the meeting to its final and dramatic climax.  One day 
in His presence, when illness had confined Him to bed, &amp;Tahirih, regarded 
as the fair and spotless emblem of chastity and the incarnation 
of the holy &amp;Fatimih, appeared suddenly, adorned yet unveiled, before 
the assembled companions, seated herself on the right-hand of the 
affrighted and infuriated &amp;Quddus, and, tearing through her fiery 
words the veils guarding the sanctity of the ordinances of &amp;Islam, 
sounded the clarion-call, and proclaimed the inauguration, of a new 
Dispensation.  The effect was electric and instantaneous.  She, of such 
stainless purity, so reverenced that even to gaze at her shadow was 
deemed an improper act, appeared for a moment, in the eyes of her 
scandalized beholders, to have defamed herself, shamed the Faith 
she had espoused, and sullied the immortal Countenance she symbolized.  
Fear, anger, bewilderment, swept their inmost souls, and 
stunned their faculties.  &amp;Abdu'l-Khaliq-i-Isfahani, aghast and deranged 
at such a sight, cut his throat with his own hands.  Spattered 
with blood, and frantic with excitement, he fled away from her face.  
A few, abandoning their companions, renounced their Faith.  Others 
stood mute and transfixed before her.  Still others must have recalled 
with throbbing hearts the Islamic tradition foreshadowing the appearance 
of &amp;Fatimih herself unveiled while crossing the Bridge (&amp;Sirat) 
on the promised Day of Judgment.  &amp;Quddus, mute with rage, seemed 
to be only waiting for the moment when he could strike her down 
with the sword he happened to be then holding in his hand.  
     Undeterred, unruffled, exultant with joy, &amp;Tahirih arose, and, 
without the least premeditation and in a language strikingly resembling 
that of the &amp;Qur'an, delivered a fervid and eloquent appeal 
to the remnant of the assembly, ending it with this bold assertion:  
"I am the Word which the &amp;Qa'im is to utter, the Word which shall 
 
+P33 
put to flight the chiefs and nobles of the earth!"  Thereupon, she 
invited them to embrace each other and celebrate so great an occasion.  
     On that memorable day the "Bugle" mentioned in the &amp;Qur'an was 
sounded, the "stunning trumpet-blast" was loudly raised, and the 
"Catastrophe" came to pass.  The days immediately following so 
startling a departure from the time-honored traditions of &amp;Islam 
witnessed a veritable revolution in the outlook, habits, ceremonials 
and manner of worship of these hitherto zealous and devout upholders 
of the &amp;Muhammadan Law.  Agitated as had been the Conference 
from first to last, deplorable as was the secession of the few who 
refused to countenance the annulment of the fundamental statutes 
of the Islamic Faith, its purpose had been fully and gloriously 
accomplished.  Only four years earlier the Author of the &amp;Babi Revelation 
had declared His mission to &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn in the privacy of His 
home in &amp;Shiraz.  Three years after that Declaration, within the walls 
of the prison-fortress of &amp;Mah-Ku, He was dictating to His amanuensis 
the fundamental and distinguishing precepts of His Dispensation.  
A year later, His followers, under the actual leadership of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
their fellow-disciple, were themselves, in the hamlet of &amp;Badasht, 
abrogating the &amp;Qur'anic Law, repudiating both the divinely-ordained 
and man-made precepts of the Faith of &amp;Muhammad, and shaking off 
the shackles of its antiquated system.  Almost immediately after, the 
&amp;Bab Himself, still a prisoner, was vindicating the acts of His disciples 
by asserting, formally and unreservedly, His claim to be the promised 
&amp;Qa'im, in the presence of the Heir to the Throne, the leading exponents 
of the &amp;Shaykhi community, and the most illustrious ecclesiastical 
dignitaries assembled in the capital of &amp;Adhirbayjan.  
     A little over four years had elapsed since the birth of the &amp;Bab's 
Revelation when the trumpet-blast announcing the formal extinction 
of the old, and the inauguration of the new Dispensation was sounded.  
No pomp, no pageantry marked so great a turning-point in the world's 
religious history.  Nor was its modest setting commensurate with 
such a sudden, startling, complete emancipation from the dark and 
embattled forces of fanaticism, of priestcraft, of religious orthodoxy 
and superstition.  The assembled host consisted of no more than a 
single woman and a handful of men, mostly recruited from the very 
ranks they were attacking, and devoid, with few exceptions, of wealth, 
prestige and power.  The Captain of the host was Himself an absentee, 
a captive in the grip of His foes.  The arena was a tiny hamlet in the 
plain of &amp;Badasht on the border of &amp;Mazindaran.  The trumpeter was a 
lone woman, the noblest of her sex in that Dispensation, whom even 
 
+P34 
some of her co-religionists pronounced a heretic.  The call she sounded 
was the death-knell of the twelve hundred year old law of &amp;Islam.  
     Accelerated, twenty years later, by another trumpet-blast, announcing 
the formulation of the laws of yet another Dispensation, 
this process of disintegration, associated with the declining fortunes 
of a superannuated, though divinely revealed Law, gathered further 
momentum, precipitated, in a later age, the annulment of the &amp;Shari'ah 
canonical Law in Turkey, led to the virtual abandonment of that 
Law in &amp;Shi'ah Persia, has, more recently, been responsible for the 
dissociation of the System envisaged in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas from the 
&amp;Sunni ecclesiastical Law in Egypt, has paved the way for the recognition 
of that System in the Holy Land itself, and is destined to 
culminate in the secularization of the Muslim states, and in the 
universal recognition of the Law of &amp;Baha'u'llah by all the nations, 
and its enthronement in the hearts of all the peoples, of the 
Muslim world.  
 
+P35 
                            CHAPTER III 
                   Upheavals in &amp;Mazindaran, &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Zanjan 
 
     The &amp;Bab's captivity in a remote corner of &amp;Adhirbayjan, immortalized 
by the proceedings of the Conference of &amp;Badasht, and distinguished 
by such notable developments as the public declaration of His 
mission, the formulation of the laws of His Dispensation and the establishment 
of His Covenant, was to acquire added significance through 
the dire convulsions that sprang from the acts of both His adversaries 
and His disciples.  The commotions that ensued, as the years of that 
captivity drew to a close, and that culminated in His own martyrdom, 
called forth a degree of heroism on the part of His followers and a 
fierceness of hostility on the part of His enemies which had never been 
witnessed during the first three years of His ministry.  Indeed, this 
brief but most turbulent period may be rightly regarded as the 
bloodiest and most dramatic of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Era.  
     The momentous happenings associated with the &amp;Bab's incarceration 
in &amp;Mah-Ku and &amp;Chihriq, constituting as they did the high watermark 
of His Revelation, could have no other consequence than to 
fan to fiercer flame both the fervor of His lovers and the fury of 
His enemies.  A persecution, grimmer, more odious, and more 
shrewdly calculated than any which &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, or even &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, had kindled was soon to be unchained, to be accompanied 
by a corresponding manifestation of heroism unmatched by 
any of the earliest outbursts of enthusiasm that had greeted the birth 
of the Faith in either &amp;Shiraz or &amp;Isfahan.  This period of ceaseless and 
unprecedented commotion was to rob that Faith, in quick succession, 
of its chief protagonists, was to attain its climax in the extinction 
of the life of its Author, and was to be followed by a further and 
this time an almost complete elimination of its eminent supporters, 
with the sole exception of One Who, at its darkest hour, was entrusted, 
through the dispensations of Providence, with the dual function 
of saving a sorely-stricken Faith from annihilation, and of 
ushering in the Dispensation destined to supersede it.  
     The formal assumption by the &amp;Bab of the authority of the 
promised &amp;Qa'im, in such dramatic circumstances and in so challenging 
a tone, before a distinguished gathering of eminent &amp;Shi'ah 
 
+P36 
ecclesiastics, powerful, jealous, alarmed and hostile, was the explosive 
force that loosed a veritable avalanche of calamities which swept 
down upon the Faith and the people among whom it was born.  
It raised to fervid heat the zeal that glowed in the souls of the &amp;Bab's 
scattered disciples, who were already incensed by the cruel captivity 
of their Leader, and whose ardor was now further inflamed by the 
outpourings of His pen which reached them unceasingly from the 
place of His confinement.  It provoked a heated and prolonged controversy 
throughout the length and breadth of the land, in bazaars, 
masjids, madrisihs and other public places, deepening thereby the 
cleavage that had already sundered its people.  &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, at 
so perilous an hour, was meanwhile rapidly sinking under the weight 
of his physical infirmities.  The shallow-minded &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, 
now the pivot of state affairs, exhibited a vacillation and incompetence 
that seemed to increase with every extension in the range of his grave 
responsibilities.  At one time he would feel inclined to support the 
verdict of the &amp;ulamas; at another he would censure their aggressiveness 
and distrust their assertions; at yet another, he would relapse into 
mysticism, and, wrapt in his reveries, lose sight of the gravity of the 
emergency that confronted him.  
     So glaring a mismanagement of national affairs emboldened the 
clerical order, whose members were now hurling with malignant zeal 
anathemas from their pulpits, and were vociferously inciting superstitious 
congregations to take up arms against the upholders of a 
much hated creed, to insult the honor of their women folk, to plunder 
their property and harass and injure their children.  "What of the 
signs and prodigies," they thundered before countless assemblies, 
"that must needs usher in the advent of the &amp;Qa'im?  What of the 
Major and Minor Occultations?  What of the cities of &amp;Jabulqa and 
&amp;Jabulsa?  How are we to explain the sayings of &amp;Husayn-ibn-Ruh, 
and what interpretation should be given to the authenticated traditions 
ascribed to &amp;Ibn-i-Mihriyar?  Where are the Men of the Unseen, 
who are to traverse, in a week, the whole surface of the earth?  What 
of the conquest of the East and West which the &amp;Qa'im is to effect on 
His appearance?  Where is the one-eyed Anti-Christ and the ass on 
which he is to mount?  What of &amp;Sufyan and his dominion?"  "Are 
we," they noisily remonstrated, "are we to account as a dead letter 
the indubitable, the unnumbered traditions of our holy &amp;Imams, or 
are we to extinguish with fire and sword this brazen heresy that has 
dared to lift its head in our land?"  
     To these defamations, threats and protestations the learned and 
 
+P37 
resolute champions of a misrepresented Faith, following the example 
of their Leader, opposed unhesitatingly treatises, commentaries and 
refutations, assiduously written, cogent in their argument, replete 
with testimonies, lucid, eloquent and convincing, affirming their 
belief in the Prophethood of &amp;Muhammad, in the legitimacy of the 
&amp;Imams, in the spiritual sovereignty of the &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman (the 
Lord of the Age), interpreting in a masterly fashion the obscure, the 
designedly allegorical and abstruse traditions, verses and prophecies 
in the Islamic holy Writ, and adducing, in support of their contention, 
the meekness and apparent helplessness of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn 
who, despite his defeat, his discomfiture and ignominious martyrdom, 
had been hailed by their antagonists as the very embodiment and the 
matchless symbol of God's all-conquering sovereignty and power.  
     This fierce, nation-wide controversy had assumed alarming proportions 
when &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah finally succumbed to his illness, precipitating 
by his death the downfall of his favorite and all-powerful 
minister, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, who, soon stripped of the treasures he 
had amassed, fell into disgrace, was expelled from the capital, and 
sought refuge in &amp;Karbila.  The seventeen year old &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Mirza 
ascended the throne, leaving the direction of affairs to the obdurate, 
the iron-hearted &amp;Amir-Nizam, &amp;Mirza &amp;Taqi &amp;Khan, who, without 
consulting his fellow-ministers, decreed that immediate and condign 
punishment be inflicted on the hapless &amp;Babis.  Governors, magistrates 
and civil servants, throughout the provinces, instigated by the 
monstrous campaign of vilification conducted by the clergy, and 
prompted by their lust for pecuniary rewards, vied in their respective 
spheres with each other in hounding and heaping indignities on the 
adherents of an outlawed Faith.  For the first time in the Faith's 
history a systematic campaign in which the civil and ecclesiastical 
powers were banded together was being launched against it, a campaign 
that was to culminate in the horrors experienced by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran and His subsequent banishment to &amp;Iraq.  
Government, clergy and people arose, as one man, to assault and 
exterminate their common enemy.  In remote and isolated centers 
the scattered disciples of a persecuted community were pitilessly 
struck down by the sword of their foes, while in centers where 
large numbers had congregated measures were taken in self-defense, 
which, misconstrued by a cunning and deceitful adversary, served in 
their turn to inflame still further the hostility of the authorities, and 
multiply the outrages perpetrated by the oppressor.  In the East at 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi, in the south in &amp;Nayriz, in the west in &amp;Zanjan, and 
 
+P38 
in the capital itself, massacres, upheavals, demonstrations, engagements, 
sieges, acts of treachery proclaimed, in rapid succession, the 
violence of the storm which had broken out, and exposed the bankruptcy, 
and blackened the annals, of a proud yet degenerate people.  
     The audacity of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn who, at the command of the 
&amp;Bab, had attired his head with the green turban worn and sent to 
him by his Master, who had hoisted the Black Standard, the unfurling 
of which would, according to the Prophet &amp;Muhammad, herald the 
advent of the vicegerent of God on earth, and who, mounted on 
his steed, was marching at the head of two hundred and two of his 
fellow-disciples to meet and lend his assistance to &amp;Quddus in the 
&amp;Jaziriy-i-Khadra (Verdant Isle)--his audacity was the signal for a 
clash the reverberations of which were to resound throughout the 
entire country.  The contest lasted no less than eleven months.  Its 
theatre was for the most part the forest of &amp;Mazindaran.  Its heroes 
were the flower of the &amp;Bab's disciples.  Its martyrs comprised no less 
than half of the Letters of the Living, not excluding &amp;Quddus and 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, respectively the last and the first of these Letters.  
The directive force which however unobtrusively sustained it was 
none other than that which flowed from the mind of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
It was caused by the unconcealed determination of the dawn-breakers 
of a new Age to proclaim, fearlessly and befittingly, its advent, and 
by a no less unyielding resolve, should persuasion prove a failure, to 
resist and defend themselves against the onslaughts of malicious and 
unreasoning assailants.  It demonstrated beyond the shadow of a 
doubt what the indomitable spirit of a band of three hundred and 
thirteen untrained, unequipped yet God-intoxicated students, mostly 
sedentary recluses of the college and cloister, could achieve when 
pitted in self-defense against a trained army, well equipped, supported 
by the masses of the people, blessed by the clergy, headed by a prince 
of the royal blood, backed by the resources of the state, acting with 
the enthusiastic approval of its sovereign, and animated by the unfailing 
counsels of a resolute and all-powerful minister.  Its outcome 
was a heinous betrayal ending in an orgy of slaughter, staining with 
everlasting infamy its perpetrators, investing its victims with a halo 
of imperishable glory, and generating the very seeds which, in a 
later age, were to blossom into world-wide administrative institutions, 
and which must, in the fullness of time, yield their golden fruit in 
the shape of a world-redeeming, earth-encircling Order.  
     It will be unnecessary to attempt even an abbreviated narrative 
of this tragic episode, however grave its import, however much misconstrued 
 
+P39 
by adverse chroniclers and historians.  A glance over its 
salient features will suffice for the purpose of these pages.  We note, 
as we conjure up the events of this great tragedy, the fortitude, the 
intrepidity, the discipline and the resourcefulness of its heroes, contrasting 
sharply with the turpitude, the cowardice, the disorderliness 
and the inconstancy of their opponents.  We observe the sublime 
patience, the noble restraint exercised by one of its principal actors, 
the lion-hearted &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, who persistently refused to unsheathe 
his sword until an armed and angry multitude, uttering the foulest 
invectives, had gathered at a farsang's distance from &amp;Barfurush to 
block his way, and had mortally struck down seven of his innocent 
and staunch companions.  We are filled with admiration for the 
tenacity of faith of that same &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, demonstrated by his 
resolve to persevere in sounding the &amp;adhan, while besieged in the caravanserai 
of &amp;Sabsih-Maydan, though three of his companions, who had 
successively ascended to the roof of the inn, with the express purpose 
of performing that sacred rite, had been instantly killed by the bullets 
of the enemy.  We marvel at the spirit of renunciation that prompted 
those sore pressed sufferers to contemptuously ignore the possessions 
left behind by their fleeing enemy; that led them to discard their own 
belongings, and content themselves with their steeds and swords; that 
induced the father of &amp;Badi', one of that gallant company, to fling 
unhesitatingly by the roadside the satchel, full of turquoises which 
he had brought from his father's mine in &amp;Nishapur; that led &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhammad-Taqiy-i-Juvayni to cast away a sum equivalent in value in 
silver and gold; and impelled those same companions to disdain, and 
refuse even to touch, the costly furnishings and the coffers of gold 
and silver which the demoralized and shame-laden Prince &amp;Mihdi-Quli 
&amp;Mirza, the commander of the army of &amp;Mazindaran and a brother of 
&amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, had left behind in his headlong flight from his 
camp.  We cannot but esteem the passionate sincerity with which 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn pleaded with the Prince, and the formal assurance he 
gave him, disclaiming, in no uncertain terms, any intention on his 
part or that of his fellow-disciples of usurping the authority of the 
&amp;Shah or of subverting the foundations of his state.  We cannot but view 
with contempt the conduct of that arch-villain, the hysterical, the 
cruel and overbearing &amp;Sa'idu'l-'Ulama, who, alarmed at the approach 
of those same companions, flung, in a frenzy of excitement, and 
before an immense crowd of men and women, his turban to the 
ground, tore open the neck of his shirt, and, bewailing the plight 
into which &amp;Islam had fallen, implored his congregation to fly to arms 
 
+P40 
and cut down the approaching band.  We are struck with wonder as 
we contemplate the super-human prowess of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn which 
enabled him, notwithstanding his fragile frame and trembling hand, 
to slay a treacherous foe who had taken shelter behind a tree, by 
cleaving with a single stroke of his sword the tree, the man and his 
musket in twain.  We are stirred, moreover, by the scene of the 
arrival of &amp;Baha'u'llah at the Fort, and the indefinable joy it imparted 
to &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the reverent reception accorded Him by His 
fellow-disciples, His inspection of the fortifications which they had 
hurriedly erected for their protection, and the advice He gave them, 
which resulted in the miraculous deliverance of &amp;Quddus, in his subsequent 
and close association with the defenders of that Fort, and in 
his effective participation in the exploits connected with its siege 
and eventual destruction.  We are amazed at the serenity and sagacity 
of that same &amp;Quddus, the confidence he instilled on his arrival, the 
resourcefulness he displayed, the fervor and gladness with which the 
besieged listened, at morn and at even-tide, to the voice intoning the 
verses of his celebrated commentary on the &amp;Sad of &amp;Samad, to which 
he had already, while in &amp;Sari, devoted a treatise thrice as voluminous 
as the &amp;Qur'an itself, and which he was now, despite the tumultuary 
attacks of the enemy and the privations he and his companions were 
enduring, further elucidating by adding to that interpretation as 
many verses as he had previously written.  We remember with 
thrilling hearts that memorable encounter when, at the cry "Mount 
your steeds, O heroes of God!" &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, accompanied by two 
hundred and two of the beleaguered and sorely-distressed companions, 
and preceded by &amp;Quddus, emerged before daybreak from the Fort, 
and, raising the shout of "&amp;Ya &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman!", rushed at full charge 
towards the stronghold of the Prince, and penetrated to his private 
apartments, only to find that, in his consternation, he had thrown 
himself from a back window into the moat, and escaped bare-footed, 
leaving his host confounded and routed.  We see relived in poignant 
memory that last day of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn's earthly life, when, soon after 
midnight, having performed his ablutions, clothed himself in new 
garments, and attired his head with the &amp;Bab's turban, he mounted his 
charger, ordered the gate of the Fort to be opened, rode out at the 
head of three hundred and thirteen of his companions, shouting aloud 
"&amp;Ya &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman!", charged successively the seven barricades 
erected by the enemy, captured every one of them, notwithstanding 
the bullets that were raining upon him, swiftly dispatched their 
defenders, and had scattered their forces when, in the ensuing tumult, 
 
+P41 
his steed became suddenly entangled in the rope of a tent, and before 
he could extricate himself he was struck in the breast by a bullet 
which the cowardly &amp;Abbas-Quli &amp;Khan-i-Larijani had discharged, 
while lying in ambush in the branches of a neighboring tree.  We 
acclaim the magnificent courage that, in a subsequent encounter, 
inspired nineteen of those stout-hearted companions to plunge headlong 
into the camp of an enemy that consisted of no less than two 
regiments of infantry and cavalry, and to cause such consternation 
that one of their leaders, the same &amp;Abbas-Quli &amp;Khan, falling from 
his horse, and leaving in his distress one of his boots hanging from the 
stirrup, ran away, half-shod and bewildered, to the Prince, and confessed 
the ignominious reverse he had suffered.  Nor can we fail to 
note the superb fortitude with which these heroic souls bore the load 
of their severe trials; when their food was at first reduced to the flesh 
of horses brought away from the deserted camp of the enemy; when 
later they had to content themselves with such grass as they could 
snatch from the fields whenever they obtained a respite from their 
besiegers; when they were forced, at a later stage, to consume the 
bark of the trees and the leather of their saddles, of their belts, of 
their scabbards and of their shoes; when during eighteen days they 
had nothing but water of which they drank a mouthful every morning; 
when the cannon fire of the enemy compelled them to dig 
subterranean passages within the Fort, where, dwelling amid mud 
and water, with garments rotting away with damp, they had to 
subsist on ground up bones; and when, at last, oppressed by gnawing 
hunger, they, as attested by a contemporary chronicler, were driven 
to disinter the steed of their venerated leader, &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, cut it 
into pieces, grind into dust its bones, mix it with the putrified meat, 
and, making it into a stew, avidly devour it.  
     Nor can reference be omitted to the abject treachery to which the 
impotent and discredited Prince eventually resorted, and his violation 
of his so-called irrevocable oath, inscribed and sealed by him on the 
margin of the opening &amp;surih of the &amp;Qur'an, whereby he, swearing by 
that holy Book, undertook to set free all the defenders of the Fort, 
pledged his honor that no man in his army or in the neighborhood 
would molest them, and that he would himself, at his own expense, 
arrange for their safe departure to their homes.  And lastly, we call 
to remembrance, the final scene of that sombre tragedy, when, as a 
result of the Prince's violation of his sacred engagement, a number 
of the betrayed companions of &amp;Quddus were assembled in the camp 
of the enemy, were stripped of their possessions, and sold as slaves, 
 
+P42 
the rest being either killed by the spears and swords of the officers, or 
torn asunder, or bound to trees and riddled with bullets, or blown 
from the mouths of cannon and consigned to the flames, or else being 
disemboweled and having their heads impaled on spears and lances.  
&amp;Quddus, their beloved leader, was by yet another shameful act of the 
intimidated Prince surrendered into the hands of the diabolical 
&amp;Sa'idu'l-'Ulama who, in his unquenchable hostility and aided by 
the mob whose passions he had sedulously inflamed, stripped his 
victim of his garments, loaded him with chains, paraded him through 
the streets of &amp;Barfurush, and incited the scum of its female inhabitants 
to execrate and spit upon him, assail him with knives and 
axes, mutilate his body, and throw the tattered fragments into a fire.  
     This stirring episode, so glorious for the Faith, so blackening to 
the reputation of its enemies--an episode which must be regarded as a 
rare phenomenon in the history of modern times--was soon succeeded 
by a parallel upheaval, strikingly similar in its essential features.  
The scene of woeful tribulations was now shifted to the south, to the 
province of &amp;Fars, not far from the city where the dawning light of 
the Faith had broken.  &amp;Nayriz and its environs were made to sustain 
the impact of this fresh ordeal in all its fury.  The Fort of &amp;Khajih, in 
the vicinity of the &amp;Chinar-Sukhtih quarter of that hotly agitated 
village became the storm-center of the new conflagration.  The hero 
who towered above his fellows, valiantly struggled, and fell a victim 
to its devouring flames was that "unique and peerless figure of his 
age," the far-famed Siyyid &amp;Yahyay-i-Darabi, better known as &amp;Vahid.  
Foremost among his perfidious adversaries, who kindled and fed the 
fire of this conflagration was the base and fanatical governor of 
&amp;Nayriz, &amp;Zaynu'l-'Abidin &amp;Khan, seconded by &amp;Abdu'llah &amp;Khan, the 
&amp;Shuja'u'l-Mulk, and reinforced by Prince &amp;Firuz &amp;Mirza, the governor 
of &amp;Shiraz.  Of a much briefer duration than the &amp;Mazindaran upheaval, 
which lasted no less than eleven months, the atrocities that 
marked its closing stage were no less devastating in their consequences.  
Once again a handful of men, innocent, law-abiding, peace-loving, 
yet high-spirited and indomitable, consisting partly, in this case, of 
untrained lads and men of advanced age, were surprised, challenged, 
encompassed and assaulted by the superior force of a cruel and 
crafty enemy, an innumerable host of able-bodied men who, though 
well-trained, adequately equipped and continually reinforced, were 
impotent to coerce into submission, or subdue, the spirit of their 
adversaries.  
     This fresh commotion originated in declarations of faith as fearless 
 
+P43 
and impassioned, and in demonstrations of religious enthusiasm 
almost as vehement and dramatic, as those which had ushered in the 
&amp;Mazindaran upheaval.  It was instigated by a no less sustained and 
violent outburst of uncompromising ecclesiastical hostility.  It was 
accompanied by corresponding manifestations of blind religious 
fanaticism.  It was provoked by similar acts of naked aggression on 
the part of both clergy and people.  It demonstrated afresh the same 
purpose, was animated throughout by the same spirit, and rose to 
almost the same height of superhuman heroism, of fortitude, courage, 
and renunciation.  It revealed a no less shrewdly calculated coordination 
of plans and efforts between the civil and ecclesiastical authorities 
designed to challenge and overthrow a common enemy.  It was preceded 
by a similar categorical repudiation, on the part of the &amp;Babis, 
of any intention of interfering with the civil jurisdiction of the 
realm, or of undermining the legitimate authority of its sovereign.  
It provided a no less convincing testimony to the restraint and forbearance 
of the victims, in the face of the ruthless and unprovoked 
aggression of the oppressor.  It exposed, as it moved toward its 
climax, and in hardly less striking a manner, the cowardice, the want 
of discipline and the degradation of a spiritually bankrupt foe.  It 
was marked, as it approached its conclusion, by a treachery as vile 
and shameful.  It ended in a massacre even more revolting in the horrors 
it evoked and the miseries it engendered.  It sealed the fate 
of &amp;Vahid who, by his green turban, the emblem of his proud lineage, 
was bound to a horse and dragged ignominiously through the streets, 
after which his head was cut off, was stuffed with straw, and sent 
as a trophy to the feasting Prince in &amp;Shiraz, while his body was 
abandoned to the mercy of the infuriated women of &amp;Nayriz, who, 
intoxicated with barbarous joy by the shouts of exultation raised by 
a triumphant enemy, danced, to the accompaniment of drums and 
cymbals, around it.  And finally, it brought in its wake, with the aid 
of no less than five thousand men, specially commissioned for this 
purpose, a general and fierce onslaught on the defenseless &amp;Babis, 
whose possessions were confiscated, whose houses were destroyed, 
whose stronghold was burned to the ground, whose women and 
children were captured, and some of whom, stripped almost naked, 
were mounted on donkeys, mules and camels, and led through rows 
of heads hewn from the lifeless bodies of their fathers, brothers, sons 
and husbands, who previously had been either branded, or had their 
nails torn out, or had been lashed to death, or had spikes hammered 
into their hands and feet, or had incisions made in their noses through 
 
+P44 
which strings were passed, and by which they were led through the 
streets before the gaze of an irate and derisive multitude.  
     This turmoil, so ravaging, so distressing, had hardly subsided 
when another conflagration, even more devastating than the two 
previous upheavals, was kindled in &amp;Zanjan and its immediate surroundings.  
Unprecedented in both its duration and in the number of 
those who were swept away by its fury, this violent tempest that 
broke out in the west of Persia, and in which &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Zanjani, 
surnamed &amp;Hujjat, one of the ablest and most formidable 
champions of the Faith, together with no less than eighteen 
hundred of his fellow-disciples, drained the cup of martyrdom, defined 
more sharply than ever the unbridgeable gulf that separated 
the torchbearers of the newborn Faith from the civil and ecclesiastical 
exponents of a gravely shaken Order.  The chief figures 
mainly responsible for, and immediately concerned with, this ghastly 
tragedy were the envious and hypocritical &amp;Amir &amp;Arslan &amp;Khan, the 
&amp;Majdu'd-Dawlih, a maternal uncle of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, and his 
associates, the &amp;Sadru'd-Dawliy-i-Isfahani and &amp;Muhammad &amp;Khan, the 
&amp;Amir-Tuman, who were assisted, on the one hand, by substantial 
military reinforcements dispatched by order of the &amp;Amir-Nizam, 
and aided, on the other, by the enthusiastic moral support of the 
entire ecclesiastical body in &amp;Zanjan.  The spot that became the theatre 
of heroic exertions, the scene of intense sufferings, and the target for 
furious and repeated assaults, was the Fort of &amp;Ali-Mardan &amp;Khan, 
which at one time sheltered no less than three thousand &amp;Babis, including 
men, women and children, the tale of whose agonies is unsurpassed 
in the annals of a whole century.  
     A brief reference to certain outstanding features of this mournful 
episode, endowing the Faith, in its infancy, with measureless potentialities, 
will suffice to reveal its distinctive character.  The pathetic 
scenes following upon the division of the inhabitants of &amp;Zanjan into 
two distinct camps, by the order of its governor--a decision dramatically 
proclaimed by a crier, and which dissolved ties of worldly 
interest and affection in favor of a mightier loyalty; the reiterated 
exhortations addressed by &amp;Hujjat to the besieged to refrain from 
aggression and acts of violence; his affirmation, as he recalled the 
tragedy of &amp;Mazindaran, that their victory consisted solely in sacrificing 
their all on the altar of the Cause of the &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman, and 
his declaration of the unalterable intention of his companions to serve 
their sovereign loyally and to be the well-wishers of his people; the 
astounding intrepidity with which these same companions repelled 
 
+P45 
the ferocious onslaught launched by the &amp;Sadru'd-Dawlih, who eventually 
was obliged to confess his abject failure, was reprimanded by the 
&amp;Shah and was degraded from his rank; the contempt with which the 
occupants of the Fort met the appeals of the crier seeking on behalf 
of an exasperated enemy to inveigle them into renouncing their Cause 
and to beguile them by the generous offers and promises of the 
sovereign; the resourcefulness and incredible audacity of Zaynab, a 
village maiden, who, fired with an irrepressible yearning to throw in 
her lot with the defenders of the Fort, disguised herself in male 
attire, cut off her locks, girt a sword about her waist, and, raising 
the cry of &amp;Ya &amp;Sahibu'z-Zaman!" rushed headlong in pursuit of the 
assailants, and who, disdainful of food and sleep, continued, during a 
period of five months, in the thick of the turmoil, to animate the 
zeal and to rush to the rescue of her men companions; the stupendous 
uproar raised by the guards who manned the barricades as they 
shouted the five invocations prescribed by the &amp;Bab, on the very night 
on which His instructions had been received--an uproar which 
precipitated the death of a few persons in the camp of the enemy, 
caused the dissolute officers to drop instantly their wine-glasses to 
the ground and to overthrow the gambling-tables, and hurry forth 
bare-footed, and induced others to run half-dressed into the wilderness, 
or flee panic-stricken to the homes of the &amp;ulamas--these stand 
out as the high lights of this bloody contest.  We recall, likewise, the 
contrast between the disorder, the cursing, the ribald laughter, the 
debauchery and shame that characterized the camp of the enemy, 
and the atmosphere of reverent devotion that filled the Fort, from 
which anthems of praise and hymns of joy were continually ascending.  
Nor can we fail to note the appeal addressed by &amp;Hujjat and his chief 
supporters to the &amp;Shah, repudiating the malicious assertions of their 
foes, assuring him of their loyalty to him and his government, and 
of their readiness to establish in his presence the soundness of their 
Cause; the interception of these messages by the governor and the 
substitution by him of forged letters loaded with abuse which he 
dispatched in their stead to &amp;Tihran; the enthusiastic support extended 
by the female occupants of the Fort, the shouts of exultation which 
they raised, the eagerness with which some of them, disguised in the 
garb of men, rushed to reinforce its defences and to supplant their 
fallen brethren, while others ministered to the sick, and carried on 
their shoulders skins of water for the wounded, and still others, like 
the Carthaginian women of old, cut off their long hair and bound 
the thick coils around the guns to reinforce them; the foul treachery 
 
+P46 
of the besiegers, who, on the very day they had drawn up and written 
out an appeal for peace and, enclosing with it a sealed copy of the 
&amp;Qur'an as a testimony of their pledge, had sent it to &amp;Hujjat, did not 
shrink from throwing into a dungeon the members of the delegation, 
including the children, which had been sent by him to treat with 
them, from tearing out the beard of the venerated leader of that 
delegation, and from savagely mutilating one of his fellow-disciples.  
We call to mind, moreover, the magnanimity of &amp;Hujjat who, though 
afflicted with the sudden loss of both his wife and child, continued 
with unruffled calm in exhorting his companions to exercise forbearance 
and to resign themselves to the will of God, until he himself 
succumbed to a wound he had received from the enemy; the barbarous 
revenge which an adversary incomparably superior in numbers 
and equipment wreaked upon its victims, giving them over to a 
massacre and pillage, unexampled in scope and ferocity, in which 
a rapacious army, a greedy populace and an unappeasable clergy 
freely indulged; the exposure of the captives, of either sex, hungry 
and ill-clad, during no less than fifteen days and nights, to the 
biting cold of an exceptionally severe winter, while crowds of women 
danced merrily around them, spat in their faces and insulted them 
with the foulest invectives; the savage cruelty that condemned 
others to be blown from guns, to be plunged into ice-cold water and 
lashed severely, to have their skulls soaked in boiling oil, to be 
smeared with treacle and left to perish in the snow; and finally, the 
insatiable hatred that impelled the crafty governor to induce through 
his insinuations the seven year old son of &amp;Hujjat to disclose the 
burial-place of his father, that drove him to violate the grave, 
disinter the corpse, order it to be dragged to the sound of drums 
and trumpets through the streets of &amp;Zanjan, and be exposed, for 
three days and three nights, to unspeakable injuries.  These, and other 
similar incidents connected with the epic story of the &amp;Zanjan upheaval, 
characterized by Lord Curzon as a "terrific siege and 
slaughter," combine to invest it with a sombre glory unsurpassed 
by any episode of a like nature in the records of the Heroic Age of 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     To the tide of calamity which, during the concluding years of 
the &amp;Bab's ministry, was sweeping with such ominous fury the 
provinces of Persia, whether in the East, in the South, or in the 
West, the heart and center of the realm itself could not remain 
impervious.  Four months before the &amp;Bab's martyrdom &amp;Tihran in its 
turn was to participate, to a lesser degree and under less dramatic 
 
+P47 
circumstances, in the carnage that was besmirching the face of the 
country.  A tragedy was being enacted in that city which was to 
prove but a prelude to the orgy of massacre which, after the &amp;Bab's 
execution, convulsed its inhabitants and sowed consternation as far 
as the outlying provinces.  It originated in the orders and was perpetrated 
under the very eyes of the irate and murderous &amp;Amir-Nizam, 
supported by &amp;Mahmud &amp;Khan-i-Kalantar, and aided by a certain 
&amp;Husayn, one of the &amp;ulamas of &amp;Kashan.  The heroes of that tragedy 
were the Seven Martyrs of &amp;Tihran, who represented the more important 
classes among their countrymen, and who deliberately refused 
to purchase life by that mere lip-denial which, under the name 
of &amp;taqiyyih, &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam had for centuries recognized as a wholly 
justifiable and indeed commendable subterfuge in the hour of peril.  
Neither the repeated and vigorous intercessions of highly placed 
members of the professions to which these martyrs belonged, nor the 
considerable sums which, in the case of one of them--the noble and 
serene &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza Siyyid &amp;Ali, the &amp;Bab's maternal uncle--affluent 
merchants of &amp;Shiraz and &amp;Tihran were eager to offer as ransom, nor 
the impassioned pleas of state officials on behalf of another--the 
pious and highly esteemed dervish, &amp;Mirza &amp;Qurban-'Ali--nor even 
the personal intervention of the &amp;Amir-Nizam, who endeavored to 
induce both of these brave men to recant, could succeed in persuading 
any of the seven to forego the coveted laurels of martyrdom.  The 
defiant answers which they flung at their persecutors; the ecstatic 
joy which seized them as they drew near the scene of their death; 
the jubilant shouts they raised as they faced their executioner; the 
poignancy of the verses which, in their last moments, some of them 
recited; the appeals and challenges they addressed to the multitude 
of onlookers who gazed with stupefaction upon them; the eagerness 
with which the last three victims strove to precede one another in 
sealing their faith with their blood; and lastly, the atrocities which a 
bloodthirsty foe degraded itself by inflicting upon their dead bodies 
which lay unburied for three days and three nights in the &amp;Sabzih-Maydan, 
during which time thousands of so-called devout &amp;Shi'ahs 
kicked their corpses, spat upon their faces, pelted, cursed, derided, 
and heaped refuse upon them--these were the chief features of the 
tragedy of the Seven Martyrs of &amp;Tihran, a tragedy which stands out 
as one of the grimmest scenes witnessed in the course of the early 
unfoldment of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Little wonder that the &amp;Bab, 
bowed down by the weight of His accumulated sorrows in the Fortress 
of &amp;Chihriq, should have acclaimed and glorified them, in the pages 
 
+P48 
of a lengthy eulogy which immortalized their fidelity to His Cause, 
as those same "Seven Goats" who, according to Islamic tradition, 
should, on the Day of Judgment, "walk in front" of the promised 
&amp;Qa'im, and whose death was to precede the impending martyrdom 
of their true Shepherd.  
 
+P49 
                                  CHAPTER IV 
                           The Execution of the &amp;Bab 
 
     The waves of dire tribulation that violently battered at the Faith, 
and eventually engulfed, in rapid succession, the ablest, the dearest 
and most trusted disciples of the &amp;Bab, plunged Him, as already 
observed, into unutterable sorrow.  For no less than six months the 
Prisoner of &amp;Chihriq, His chronicler has recorded, was unable to either 
write or dictate.  Crushed with grief by the evil tidings that came so 
fast upon Him, of the endless trials that beset His ablest lieutenants, 
by the agonies suffered by the besieged and the shameless betrayal of 
the survivors, by the woeful afflictions endured by the captives and 
the abominable butchery of men, women and children, as well as 
the foul indignities heaped on their corpses, He, for nine days, His 
amanuensis has affirmed, refused to meet any of His friends, and was 
reluctant to touch the meat and drink that was offered Him.  Tears 
rained continually from His eyes, and profuse expressions of anguish 
poured forth from His wounded heart, as He languished, for no less 
than five months, solitary and disconsolate, in His prison.  
     The pillars of His infant Faith had, for the most part, been 
hurled down at the first onset of the hurricane that had been loosed 
upon it.  &amp;Quddus, immortalized by Him as &amp;Ismu'llahi'l-Akhir (the 
Last Name of God); on whom &amp;Baha'u'llah's Tablet of &amp;Kullu't-Ta'am 
later conferred the sublime appellation of &amp;Nuqtiy-i-Ukhra (the Last 
Point); whom He elevated, in another Tablet, to a rank second to 
none except that of the Herald of His Revelation; whom He identifies, 
in still another Tablet, with one of the "Messengers charged 
with imposture" mentioned in the &amp;Qur'an; whom the Persian &amp;Bayan 
extolled as that fellow-pilgrim round whom mirrors to the number of 
eight &amp;Vahids revolve; on whose "detachment and the sincerity of whose 
devotion to God's will God prideth Himself amidst the Concourse on 
high;" whom &amp;Abdu'l-Baha designated as the "Moon of Guidance;" 
and whose appearance the Revelation of St. John the Divine anticipated 
as one of the two "Witnesses" into whom, ere the "second woe 
is past," the "spirit of life from God" must enter--such a man had, 
in the full bloom of his youth, suffered, in the &amp;Sabzih-Maydan of 
&amp;Barfurush, a death which even Jesus Christ, as attested by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
 
+P50 
had not faced in the hour of His greatest agony.  &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the 
first Letter of the Living, surnamed the &amp;Babu'l-Bab (the Gate of the 
Gate); designated as the "Primal Mirror;" on whom eulogies, prayers 
and visiting Tablets of a number equivalent to thrice the volume of 
the &amp;Qur'an had been lavished by the pen of the &amp;Bab; referred to in 
these eulogies as "beloved of My Heart;" the dust of whose grave, 
that same Pen had declared, was so potent as to cheer the sorrowful 
and heal the sick; whom "the creatures, raised in the beginning and 
in the end" of the &amp;Babi Dispensation, envy, and will continue to envy 
till the "Day of Judgment;" whom the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan acclaimed as 
the one but for whom "God would not have been established upon 
the seat of His mercy, nor ascended the throne of eternal glory;" to 
whom Siyyid &amp;Kazim had paid such tribute that his disciples suspected 
that the recipient of such praise might well be the promised One 
Himself--such a one had likewise, in the prime of his manhood, died a 
martyr's death at &amp;Tabarsi.  &amp;Vahid, pronounced in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan 
to be the "unique and peerless figure of his age," a man of immense 
erudition and the most preeminent figure to enlist under the banner 
of the new Faith, to whose "talents and saintliness," to whose "high 
attainments in the realm of science and philosophy" the &amp;Bab had 
testified in His &amp;Dala'il-i-Sab'ih (Seven Proofs), had already, under 
similar circumstances, been swept into the maelstrom of another 
upheaval, and was soon to quaff in his turn the cup drained by the 
heroic martyrs of &amp;Mazindaran.  &amp;Hujjat, another champion of conspicuous 
audacity, of unsubduable will, of remarkable originality and 
vehement zeal, was being, swiftly and inevitably, drawn into the 
fiery furnace whose flames had already enveloped &amp;Zanjan and its 
environs.  The &amp;Bab's maternal uncle, the only father He had known 
since His childhood, His shield and support and the trusted guardian 
of both His mother and His wife, had, moreover, been sundered from 
Him by the axe of the executioner in &amp;Tihran.  No less than half of 
His chosen disciples, the Letters of the Living, had already preceded 
Him in the field of martyrdom.  &amp;Tahirih, though still alive, was 
courageously pursuing a course that was to lead her inevitably to 
her doom.  
     A fast ebbing life, so crowded with the accumulated anxieties, 
disappointments, treacheries and sorrows of a tragic ministry, now 
moved swiftly towards its climax.  The most turbulent period of the 
Heroic Age of the new Dispensation was rapidly attaining its culmination.  
The cup of bitter woes which the Herald of that Dispensation 
had tasted was now full to overflowing.  Indeed, He Himself had 
 
+P51 
already foreshadowed His own approaching death.  In the &amp;Kitab-i-Panj-Sha'n, 
one of His last works, He had alluded to the fact that 
the sixth &amp;Naw-Ruz after the declaration of His mission would be 
the last He was destined to celebrate on earth.  In His interpretation 
of the letter &amp;Ha, He had voiced His craving for martyrdom, while in 
the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma' He had actually prophesied the inevitability 
of such a consummation of His glorious career.  Forty days before 
His final departure from &amp;Chihriq He had even collected all the documents 
in His possession, and placed them, together with His pen-case, 
His seals and His rings, in the hands of &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir, a Letter of the 
Living, whom He instructed to entrust them to &amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini, 
surnamed &amp;Mirza &amp;Ahmad, who was to deliver them to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Tihran.  
     While the convulsions of &amp;Mazindaran and &amp;Nayriz were pursuing 
their bloody course the Grand Vizir of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, anxiously 
pondering the significance of these dire happenings, and apprehensive 
of their repercussions on his countrymen, his government and his 
sovereign, was feverishly revolving in his mind that fateful decision 
which was not only destined to leave its indelible imprint on the 
fortunes of his country, but was to be fraught with such incalculable 
consequences for the destinies of the whole of mankind.  The repressive 
measures taken against the followers of the &amp;Bab, he was by now fully 
convinced, had but served to inflame their zeal, steel their resolution 
and confirm their loyalty to their persecuted Faith.  The &amp;Bab's isolation 
and captivity had produced the opposite effect to that which the 
&amp;Amir-Nizam had confidently anticipated.  Gravely perturbed, he 
bitterly condemned the disastrous leniency of his predecessor, &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, which had brought matters to such a pass.  A more 
drastic and still more exemplary punishment, he felt, must now be 
administered to what he regarded as an abomination of heresy which 
was polluting the civil and ecclesiastical institutions of the realm.  
Nothing short, he believed, of the extinction of the life of Him Who 
was the fountain-head of so odious a doctrine and the driving force 
behind so dynamic a movement could stem the tide that had wrought 
such havoc throughout the land.  
     The siege of &amp;Zanjan was still in progress when he, dispensing with 
an explicit order from his sovereign, and acting independently of his 
counsellors and fellow-ministers, dispatched his order to Prince 
&amp;Hamzih &amp;Mirza, the &amp;Hishmatu'd-Dawlih, the governor of &amp;Adhirbayjan, 
instructing him to execute the &amp;Bab.  Fearing lest the infliction of such 
condign punishment in the capital of the realm would set in motion 
 
+P52 
forces he might be powerless to control, he ordered that his Captive 
be taken to &amp;Tabriz, and there be done to death.  Confronted with a 
flat refusal by the indignant Prince to perform what he regarded as a 
flagitious crime, the &amp;Amir-Nizam commissioned his own brother, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan &amp;Khan, to execute his orders.  The usual formalities designed 
to secure the necessary authorization from the leading mujtahids 
of &amp;Tabriz were hastily and easily completed.  Neither &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Muhammad-i-Mamaqani, however, who had penned the &amp;Bab's death-warrant 
on the very day of His examination in &amp;Tabriz, nor &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Baqir, nor &amp;Mulla &amp;Murtada-Quli, to whose houses their Victim 
was ignominiously led by the &amp;farrash-bashi, by order of the Grand 
Vizir, condescended to meet face to face their dreaded Opponent.  
     Immediately before and soon after this humiliating treatment 
meted out to the &amp;Bab two highly significant incidents occurred, incidents 
that cast an illuminating light on the mysterious circumstances 
surrounding the opening phase of His martyrdom.  The &amp;farrash-bashi 
had abruptly interrupted the last conversation which the &amp;Bab was 
confidentially having in one of the rooms of the barracks with His 
amanuensis Siyyid &amp;Husayn, and was drawing the latter aside, and 
severely rebuking him, when he was thus addressed by his Prisoner:  
"Not until I have said to him all those things that I wish to say can 
any earthly power silence Me.  Though all the world be armed against 
Me, yet shall it be powerless to deter Me from fulfilling, to the last 
word, My intention."  To the Christian &amp;Sam &amp;Khan--the colonel of the 
Armenian regiment ordered to carry out the execution--who, seized 
with fear lest his act should provoke the wrath of God, had begged 
to be released from the duty imposed upon him, the &amp;Bab gave the 
following assurance:  "Follow your instructions, and if your intention 
be sincere, the Almighty is surely able to relieve you of your 
perplexity."  
     &amp;Sam &amp;Khan accordingly set out to discharge his duty.  A spike was 
driven into a pillar which separated two rooms of the barracks facing 
the square.  Two ropes were fastened to it from which the &amp;Bab and 
one of his disciples, the youthful and devout &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali-i-Zunuzi, 
surnamed &amp;Anis, who had previously flung himself at the 
feet of his Master and implored that under no circumstances he be 
sent away from Him, were separately suspended.  The firing squad 
ranged itself in three files, each of two hundred and fifty men.  Each 
file in turn opened fire until the whole detachment had discharged 
its bullets.  So dense was the smoke from the seven hundred and 
fifty rifles that the sky was darkened.  As soon as the smoke had 
 
+P53 
cleared away the astounded multitude of about ten thousand souls, 
who had crowded onto the roof of the barracks, as well as the tops 
of the adjoining houses, beheld a scene which their eyes could 
scarcely believe.  
     The &amp;Bab had vanished from their sight!  Only his companion 
remained, alive and unscathed, standing beside the wall on which 
they had been suspended.  The ropes by which they had been hung 
alone were severed.  "The &amp;Siyyid-i-Bab has gone from our sight!" 
cried out the bewildered spectators.  A frenzied search immediately 
ensued.  He was found, unhurt and unruffled, in the very room He 
had occupied the night before, engaged in completing His interrupted 
conversation with His amanuensis.  "I have finished My conversation 
with Siyyid &amp;Husayn" were the words with which the Prisoner, so 
providentially preserved, greeted the appearance of the &amp;farrash-bashi, 
"Now you may proceed to fulfill your intention."  Recalling the bold 
assertion his Prisoner had previously made, and shaken by so stunning 
a revelation, the &amp;farrash-bashi quitted instantly the scene, and resigned 
his post.  
     &amp;Sam &amp;Khan, likewise, remembering, with feelings of awe and 
wonder, the reassuring words addressed to him by the &amp;Bab, ordered 
his men to leave the barracks immediately, and swore, as he left the 
courtyard, never again, even at the cost of his life, to repeat that act.  
&amp;Aqa &amp;Jan-i-Khamsih, colonel of the body-guard, volunteered to replace 
him.  On the same wall and in the same manner the &amp;Bab and His companion 
were again suspended, while the new regiment formed in line 
and opened fire upon them.  This time, however, their breasts were 
riddled with bullets, and their bodies completely dissected, with the 
exception of their faces which were but little marred.  "O wayward 
generation!" were the last words of the &amp;Bab to the gazing multitude, 
as the regiment prepared to fire its volley, "Had you believed in Me 
every one of you would have followed the example of this youth, who 
stood in rank above most of you, and would have willingly sacrificed 
himself in My path.  The day will come when you will have recognized 
Me; that day I shall have ceased to be with you."  
     Nor was this all.  The very moment the shots were fired a gale of 
exceptional violence arose and swept over the city.  From noon till 
night a whirlwind of dust obscured the light of the sun, and blinded 
the eyes of the people.  In &amp;Shiraz an "earthquake," foreshadowed in no 
less weighty a Book than the Revelation of St. John, occurred in 
1268 A.H. which threw the whole city into turmoil and wrought 
havoc amongst its people, a havoc that was greatly aggravated by 
 
+P54 
the outbreak of cholera, by famine and other afflictions.  In that same 
year no less than two hundred and fifty of the firing squad, that had 
replaced &amp;Sam &amp;Khan's regiment, met their death, together with their 
officers, in a terrible earthquake, while the remaining five hundred 
suffered, three years later, as a punishment for their mutiny, the same 
fate as that which their hands had inflicted upon the &amp;Bab.  To insure 
that none of them had survived, they were riddled with a second 
volley, after which their bodies, pierced with spears and lances, were 
exposed to the gaze of the people of &amp;Tabriz.  The prime instigator of 
the &amp;Bab's death, the implacable &amp;Amir-Nizam, together with his 
brother, his chief accomplice, met their death within two years of 
that savage act.  
     On the evening of the very day of the &amp;Bab's execution, which fell 
on the ninth of July 1850 (28th of &amp;Sha'ban 1266 A.H.), during the 
thirty-first year of His age and the seventh of His ministry, the 
mangled bodies were transferred from the courtyard of the barracks 
to the edge of the moat outside the gate of the city.  Four companies, 
each consisting of ten sentinels, were ordered to keep watch in turn 
over them.  On the following morning the Russian Consul in 
&amp;Tabriz visited the spot, and ordered the artist who had accompanied 
him to make a drawing of the remains as they lay beside the moat.  
In the middle of the following night a follower of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Haji 
&amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan, succeeded, through the instrumentality of a certain 
&amp;Haji &amp;Allah-Yar, in removing the bodies to the silk factory owned by 
one of the believers of &amp;Milan, and laid them, the next day, in a 
specially made wooden casket, which he later transferred to a place 
of safety.  Meanwhile the &amp;mullas were boastfully proclaiming from 
the pulpits that, whereas the holy body of the Immaculate &amp;Imam 
would be preserved from beasts of prey and from all creeping things, 
this man's body had been devoured by wild animals.  No sooner had 
the news of the transfer of the remains of the &amp;Bab and of His fellow-sufferer 
been communicated to &amp;Baha'u'llah than He ordered that 
same &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan to bring them to &amp;Tihran, where they were 
taken to the &amp;Imam-Zadih-Hasan, from whence they were removed to 
different places, until the time when, in pursuance of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
instructions, they were transferred to the Holy Land, and were permanently 
and ceremoniously laid to rest by Him in a specially erected 
mausoleum on the slopes of Mt. Carmel.  
     Thus ended a life which posterity will recognize as standing at 
the confluence of two universal prophetic cycles, the Adamic Cycle 
stretching back as far as the first dawnings of the world's recorded 
 
+P55 
religious history and the &amp;Baha'i Cycle destined to propel itself across 
the unborn reaches of time for a period of no less than five thousand 
centuries.  The apotheosis in which such a life attained its consummation 
marks, as already observed, the culmination of the most 
heroic phase of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  It can, 
moreover, be regarded in no other light except as the most dramatic, 
the most tragic event transpiring within the entire range of the first 
&amp;Baha'i century.  Indeed it can be rightly acclaimed as unparalleled 
in the annals of the lives of all the Founders of the world's existing 
religious systems.  
     So momentous an event could hardly fail to arouse widespread 
and keen interest even beyond the confines of the land in which it 
had occurred.  "C'est un des plus magnifiques exemples de courage 
qu'il ait &amp;ete &amp;donne &amp;a &amp;l'humanite de contempler," is the testimony 
recorded by a Christian scholar and government official, who had 
lived in Persia and had familiarized himself with the life and teachings 
of the &amp;Bab, "et c'est aussi une admirable preuve de l'amour que 
notre &amp;heros portait &amp;a ses concitoyens.  Il s'est &amp;sacrifie pour &amp;l'humanite:  
pour elle il a &amp;donne son corps et son &amp;ame, pour elle il a subi les 
privations, les affronts, les injures, la torture et le martyre.  Il a &amp;scelle 
de son sang le pacte de la &amp;fraternite universelle, et comme &amp;Jesus 
il a &amp;paye de sa vie l'annonce du &amp;regne de la concorde, de &amp;l'equite et de 
l'amour du prochain."  "Un fait &amp;etrange, unique dans les annales de 
&amp;l'humanite," is a further testimony from the pen of that same scholar 
commenting on the circumstances attending the &amp;Bab's martyrdom.  
"A veritable miracle," is the pronouncement made by a noted French 
Orientalist.  "A true God-man," is the verdict of a famous British 
traveler and writer.  "The finest product of his country," is the tribute 
paid Him by a noted French publicist.  "That Jesus of the age ... 
a prophet, and more than a prophet," is the judgment passed by a 
distinguished English divine.  "The most important religious movement 
since the foundation of Christianity," is the possibility that was 
envisaged for the Faith the &amp;Bab had established by that far-famed 
Oxford scholar, the late Master of Balliol.  
     "Many persons from all parts of the world," is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
written assertion, "set out for Persia and began to investigate wholeheartedly 
the matter."  The Czar of Russia, a contemporary chronicler 
has written, had even, shortly before the &amp;Bab's martyrdom, instructed 
the Russian Consul in &amp;Tabriz to fully inquire into, and report the 
circumstances of so startling a Movement, a commission that could 
not be carried out in view of the &amp;Bab's execution.  In countries as 
 
+P56 
remote as those of Western Europe an interest no less profound was 
kindled, and spread with great rapidity to literary, artistic, diplomatic 
and intellectual circles.  "All Europe," attests the above-mentioned 
French publicist, "was stirred to pity and indignation...  
Among the &amp;litterateurs of my generation, in the Paris of 1890, the 
martyrdom of the &amp;Bab was still as fresh a topic as had been the first 
news of His death.  We wrote poems about Him.  Sarah Bernhardt 
entreated Catulle &amp;Mendes for a play on the theme of this historic 
tragedy."  A Russian poetess, member of the Philosophic, Oriental 
and Bibliological Societies of St. Petersburg, published in 1903 a 
drama entitled "The &amp;Bab," which a year later was played in one of 
the principal theatres of that city, was subsequently given publicity 
in London, was translated into French in Paris, and into German by 
the poet Fiedler, was presented again, soon after the Russian Revolution, 
in the Folk Theatre in Leningrad, and succeeded in arousing the 
genuine sympathy and interest of the renowned Tolstoy, whose 
eulogy of the poem was later published in the Russian press.  
     It would indeed be no exaggeration to say that nowhere in the 
whole compass of the world's religious literature, except in the 
Gospels, do we find any record relating to the death of any of the 
religion-founders of the past comparable to the martyrdom suffered 
by the Prophet of &amp;Shiraz.  So strange, so inexplicable a phenomenon, 
attested by eye-witnesses, corroborated by men of recognized standing, 
and acknowledged by government as well as unofficial historians 
among the people who had sworn undying hostility to the &amp;Babi Faith, 
may be truly regarded as the most marvelous manifestation of the 
unique potentialities with which a Dispensation promised by all the 
Dispensations of the past had been endowed.  The passion of Jesus 
Christ, and indeed His whole public ministry, alone offer a parallel to 
the Mission and death of the &amp;Bab, a parallel which no student of comparative 
religion can fail to perceive or ignore.  In the youthfulness 
and meekness of the Inaugurator of the &amp;Babi Dispensation; in the 
extreme brevity and turbulence of His public ministry; in the 
dramatic swiftness with which that ministry moved towards its 
climax; in the apostolic order which He instituted, and the primacy 
which He conferred on one of its members; in the boldness of His 
challenge to the time-honored conventions, rites and laws which had 
been woven into the fabric of the religion He Himself had been born 
into; in the &amp;role which an officially recognized and firmly entrenched 
religious hierarchy played as chief instigator of the outrages which He 
was made to suffer; in the indignities heaped upon Him; in the 
 
+P57 
suddenness of His arrest; in the interrogation to which He was subjected; 
in the derision poured, and the scourging inflicted, upon Him; 
in the public affront He sustained; and, finally, in His ignominious 
suspension before the gaze of a hostile multitude--in all these we 
cannot fail to discern a remarkable similarity to the distinguishing 
features of the career of Jesus Christ.  
     It should be remembered, however, that apart from the miracle 
associated with the &amp;Bab's execution, He, unlike the Founder of the 
Christian religion, is not only to be regarded as the independent 
Author of a divinely revealed Dispensation, but must also be recognized 
as the Herald of a new Era and the Inaugurator of a great 
universal prophetic cycle.  Nor should the important fact be overlooked 
that, whereas the chief adversaries of Jesus Christ, in His lifetime, 
were the Jewish rabbis and their associates, the forces arrayed 
against the &amp;Bab represented the combined civil and ecclesiastical 
powers of Persia, which, from the moment of His declaration to the 
hour of His death, persisted, unitedly and by every means at their 
disposal, in conspiring against the upholders and in vilifying the 
tenets of His Revelation.  
     The &amp;Bab, acclaimed by &amp;Baha'u'llah as the "Essence of Essences," 
the "Sea of Seas," the "Point round Whom the realities of the Prophets 
and Messengers revolve," "from Whom God hath caused to proceed 
the knowledge of all that was and shall be," Whose "rank excelleth 
that of all the Prophets," and Whose "Revelation transcendeth the 
comprehension and understanding of all their chosen ones," had 
delivered His Message and discharged His mission.  He Who was, in 
the words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the "Morn of Truth" and "Harbinger of 
the Most Great Light," Whose advent at once signalized the termination 
of the "Prophetic Cycle" and the inception of the "Cycle of 
Fulfillment," had simultaneously through His Revelation banished the 
shades of night that had descended upon His country, and proclaimed 
the impending rise of that Incomparable Orb Whose radiance was to 
envelop the whole of mankind.  He, as affirmed by Himself, "the 
Primal Point from which have been generated all created things," 
"one of the sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God," the 
"Mystic Fane," the "Great Announcement," the "Flame of that 
supernal Light that glowed upon Sinai," the "Remembrance of God" 
concerning Whom "a separate Covenant hath been established with 
each and every Prophet" had, through His advent, at once fulfilled the 
promise of all ages and ushered in the consummation of all Revelations.  
He the "&amp;Qa'im" (He Who ariseth) promised to the &amp;Shi'ahs, 
 
+P58 
the "&amp;Mihdi" (One Who is guided) awaited by the &amp;Sunnis, the 
"Return of John the Baptist" expected by the Christians, the 
"&amp;Ushidar-Mah" referred to in the Zoroastrian scriptures, the "Return 
of Elijah" anticipated by the Jews, Whose Revelation was to show 
forth "the signs and tokens of all the Prophets", Who was to "manifest 
the perfection of Moses, the radiance of Jesus and the patience of Job" 
had appeared, proclaimed His Cause, been mercilessly persecuted and 
died gloriously.  The "Second Woe," spoken of in the Apocalypse of 
St. John the Divine, had, at long last, appeared, and the first of the 
two "Messengers," Whose appearance had been prophesied in the 
&amp;Qur'an, had been sent down.  The first "Trumpet-Blast", destined 
to smite the earth with extermination, announced in the latter Book, 
had finally been sounded.  "The Inevitable," "The Catastrophe," "The 
Resurrection," "The Earthquake of the Last Hour," foretold by that 
same Book, had all come to pass.  The "clear tokens" had been "sent 
down," and the "Spirit" had "breathed," and the "souls" had "waked 
up," and the "heaven" had been "cleft," and the "angels" had "ranged 
in order," and the "stars" had been "blotted out," and the "earth" had 
"cast forth her burden," and "Paradise" had been "brought near," 
and "hell" had been "made to blaze," and the "Book" had been "set," 
and the "Bridge" had been "laid out," and the "Balance" had been 
"set up," and the "mountains scattered in dust."  The "cleansing of 
the Sanctuary," prophesied by Daniel and confirmed by Jesus Christ 
in His reference to "the abomination of desolation," had been accomplished.  
The "day whose length shall be a thousand years," foretold by 
the Apostle of God in His Book, had terminated.  The "forty and 
two months," during which the "Holy City," as predicted by St. John 
the Divine, would be trodden under foot, had elapsed.  The "time of 
the end" had been ushered in, and the first of the "two Witnesses" 
into Whom, "after three days and a half the Spirit of Life from God" 
would enter, had arisen and had "ascended up to heaven in a cloud."  
The "remaining twenty and five letters to be made manifest," according 
to Islamic tradition, out of the "twenty and seven letters" of 
which Knowledge has been declared to consist, had been revealed.  
The "Man Child," mentioned in the Book of Revelation, destined to 
"rule all nations with a rod of iron," had released, through His coming, 
the creative energies which, reinforced by the effusions of a 
swiftly succeeding and infinitely mightier Revelation, were to instill 
into the entire human race the capacity to achieve its organic unification, 
attain maturity and thereby reach the final stage in its age-long 
evolution.  The clarion-call addressed to the "concourse of kings and 
 
+P59 
of the sons of kings," marking the inception of a process which, 
accelerated by &amp;Baha'u'llah's subsequent warnings to the entire company 
of the monarchs of East and West, was to produce so widespread 
a revolution in the fortunes of royalty, had been raised in the 
&amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma'.  The "Order," whose foundation the Promised One 
was to establish in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, and the features of which the 
Center of the Covenant was to delineate in His Testament, and whose 
administrative framework the entire body of His followers are now 
erecting, had been categorically announced in the Persian &amp;Bayan.  
The laws which were designed, on the one hand, to abolish at a stroke 
the privileges and ceremonials, the ordinances and institutions of a 
superannuated Dispensation, and to bridge, on the other, the gap 
between an obsolete system and the institutions of a world-encompassing 
Order destined to supersede it, had been clearly formulated 
and proclaimed.  The Covenant which, despite the determined assaults 
launched against it, succeeded, unlike all previous Dispensations, in 
preserving the integrity of the Faith of its Author, and in paving 
the way for the advent of the One Who was to be its Center and 
Object, had been firmly and irrevocably established.  The light which, 
throughout successive periods, was to propagate itself gradually from 
its cradle as far as Vancouver in the West and the China Sea in the 
East, and to diffuse its radiance as far as Iceland in the North and 
the Tasman Sea in the South, had broken.  The forces of darkness, at 
first confined to the concerted hostility of the civil and ecclesiastical 
powers of &amp;Shi'ah Persia, gathering momentum, at a later stage, 
through the avowed and persistent opposition of the Caliph of 
&amp;Islam and the &amp;Sunni hierarchy in Turkey, and destined to culminate 
in the fierce antagonism of the sacerdotal orders associated with other 
and still more powerful religious systems, had launched their initial 
assault.  The nucleus of the divinely ordained, world-embracing Community--
a Community whose infant strength had already plucked 
asunder the fetters of &amp;Shi'ah orthodoxy, and which was, with every 
expansion in the range of its fellowship, to seek and obtain a wider 
and still more significant recognition of its claims to be the world 
religion of the future, had been formed and was slowly crystallizing.  
And, lastly, the seed, endowed by the Hand of Omnipotence with 
such vast potentialities, though rudely trampled under foot and 
seemingly perished from the face of the earth, had, through this very 
process, been vouchsafed the opportunity to germinate and remanifest 
itself, in the shape of a still more compelling Revelation--a Revelation 
destined to blossom forth, in a later period into the flourishing 
 
+P60 
institutions of a world-wide administrative System, and to ripen, 
in the Golden Age as yet unborn, into mighty agencies functioning 
in consonance with the principles of a world-unifying, world-redeeming 
Order.

                         The Attempt on the Life of the &amp;Shah 
                                 and Its Consequences 
 
     The Faith that had stirred a whole nation to its depth, for whose 
sake thousands of precious and heroic souls had been immolated and 
on whose altar He Who had been its Author had sacrificed His life, 
was now being subjected to the strain and stress of yet another crisis 
of extreme violence and far-reaching consequences.  It was one of 
those periodic crises which, occurring throughout a whole century, 
succeeded in momentarily eclipsing the splendor of the Faith and in 
almost disrupting the structure of its organic institutions.  Invariably 
sudden, often unexpected, seemingly fatal to both its spirit and its 
life, these inevitable manifestations of the mysterious evolution of a 
world Religion, intensely alive, challenging in its claims, revolutionizing 
in its tenets, struggling against overwhelming odds, have either 
been externally precipitated by the malice of its avowed antagonists 
or internally provoked by the unwisdom of its friends, the apostasy 
of its supporters, or the defection of some of the most highly placed 
amongst the kith and kin of its founders.  No matter how disconcerting 
to the great mass of its loyal adherents, however much trumpeted 
by its adversaries as symptoms of its decline and impending dissolution, 
these admitted setbacks and reverses, from which it has time 
and again so tragically suffered, have, as we look back upon them, 
failed to arrest its march or impair its unity.  Heavy indeed has been 
the toll which they exacted, unspeakable the agonies they engendered, 
widespread and paralyzing for a time the consternation they provoked.  
Yet, viewed in their proper perspective, each of them can be 
confidently pronounced a blessing in disguise, affording a providential 
means for the release of a fresh outpouring of celestial strength, a 
miraculous escape from imminent and still more dreadful calamities, 
an instrument for the fulfillment of age-old prophecies, an agency for 
the purification and revitalization of the life of the community, an 
impetus for the enlargement of its limits and the propagation of its 
influence, and a compelling evidence of the indestructibility of its 
cohesive strength.  Sometimes at the height of the crisis itself, more 
often when the crisis was past, the significance of these trials has 
 
+P62 
manifested itself to men's eyes, and the necessity of such experiences 
has been demonstrated, far and wide and beyond the shadow of a 
doubt, to both friend and foe.  Seldom, if indeed at any time, has 
the mystery underlying these portentous, God-sent upheavals remained 
undisclosed, or the profound purpose and meaning of their 
occurrence been left hidden from the minds of men.  
     Such a severe ordeal the Faith of the &amp;Bab, still in the earliest 
stages of its infancy, was now beginning to experience.  Maligned and 
hounded from the moment it was born, deprived in its earliest days 
of the sustaining strength of the majority of its leading supporters, 
stunned by the tragic and sudden removal of its Founder, reeling 
under the cruel blows it had successively sustained in &amp;Mazindaran, 
&amp;Tihran, &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Zanjan, a sorely persecuted Faith was about to 
be subjected through the shameful act of a fanatical and irresponsible 
&amp;Babi, to a humiliation such as it had never before known.  To the 
trials it had undergone was now added the oppressive load of a fresh 
calamity, unprecedented in its gravity, disgraceful in its character, 
and devastating in its immediate consequences.  
     Obsessed by the bitter tragedy of the martyrdom of his beloved 
Master, driven by a frenzy of despair to avenge that odious deed, 
and believing the author and instigator of that crime to be none other 
than the &amp;Shah himself, a certain &amp;Sadiq-i-Tabrizi, an assistant in a 
confectioner's shop in &amp;Tihran, proceeded on an August day (August 
15, 1852), together with his accomplice, an equally obscure youth 
named &amp;Fathu'llah-i-Qumi, to &amp;Niyavaran where the imperial army 
had encamped and the sovereign was in residence, and there, waiting 
by the roadside, in the guise of an innocent bystander, fired a round 
of shot from his pistol at the &amp;Shah, shortly after the latter had 
emerged on horseback from the palace grounds for his morning 
promenade.  The weapon the assailant employed demonstrated beyond 
the shadow of a doubt the folly of that half-demented youth, and 
clearly indicated that no man of sound judgment could have possibly 
instigated so senseless an act.  
     The whole of &amp;Niyavaran where the imperial court and troops had 
congregated was, as a result of this assault, plunged into an unimaginable 
tumult.  The ministers of the state, headed by &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa 
&amp;Khan-i-Nuri, the &amp;I'timadu'd-Dawlih, the successor of the &amp;Amir-Nizam, 
rushed horror-stricken to the side of their wounded sovereign.  
The fanfare of the trumpets, the rolling of the drums and the shrill 
piping of the fifes summoned the hosts of His Imperial Majesty on 
all sides.  The &amp;Shah's attendants, some on horseback, others on foot, 
 
+P63 
poured into the palace grounds.  Pandemonium reigned in which every 
one issued orders, none listened, none obeyed, nor understood anything.  
&amp;Ardishir &amp;Mirza, the governor of &amp;Tihran, having in the meantime 
already ordered his troops to patrol the deserted streets of the 
capital, barred the gates of the citadel as well as of the city, charged 
his batteries and feverishly dispatched a messenger to ascertain the 
veracity of the wild rumors that were circulating amongst the 
populace, and to ask for special instructions.  
     No sooner had this act been perpetrated than its shadow fell 
across the entire body of the &amp;Babi community.  A storm of public 
horror, disgust and resentment, heightened by the implacable hostility 
of the mother of the youthful sovereign, swept the nation, casting 
aside all possibility of even the most elementary inquiry into the 
origins and the instigators of the attempt.  A sign, a whisper, was 
sufficient to implicate the innocent and loose upon him the most 
abominable afflictions.  An army of foes--ecclesiastics, state officials 
and people, united in relentless hate, and watching for an opportunity 
to discredit and annihilate a dreaded adversary--had, at long last, 
been afforded the pretext for which it was longing.  Now it could 
achieve its malevolent purpose.  Though the Faith had, from its inception, 
disclaimed any intention of usurping the rights and prerogatives 
of the state; though its exponents and disciples had sedulously 
avoided any act that might arouse the slightest suspicion of a desire 
to wage a holy war, or to evince an aggressive attitude, yet its enemies, 
deliberately ignoring the numerous evidences of the marked restraint 
exercised by the followers of a persecuted religion, proved themselves 
capable of inflicting atrocities as barbarous as those which will ever 
remain associated with the bloody episodes of &amp;Mazindaran, &amp;Nayriz 
and &amp;Zanjan.  To what depths of infamy and cruelty would not this 
same enemy be willing to descend now that an act so treasonable, so 
audacious had been committed?  What accusations would it not be 
prompted to level at, and what treatment would it not mete out to, 
those who, however unjustifiably, could be associated with so heinous 
a crime against one who, in his person, combined the chief magistracy 
of the realm and the trusteeship of the Hidden &amp;Imam?  
     The reign of terror which ensued was revolting beyond description.  
The spirit of revenge that animated those who had unleashed its 
horrors seemed insatiable.  Its repercussions echoed as far as the press 
of Europe, branding with infamy its bloodthirsty participants.  The 
Grand Vizir, wishing to reduce the chances of blood revenge, divided 
the work of executing those condemned to death among the princes 
 
+P64 
and nobles, his principal fellow-ministers, the generals and officers of 
the Court, the representatives of the sacerdotal and merchant classes, 
the artillery and the infantry.  Even the &amp;Shah himself had his allotted 
victim, though, to save the dignity of the crown, he delegated the 
steward of his household to fire the fatal shot on his behalf.  &amp;Ardishir 
&amp;Mirza, on his part, picketed the gates of the capital, and ordered the 
guards to scrutinize the faces of all those who sought to leave it.  
Summoning to his presence the kalantar, the &amp;darughih and the &amp;kadkhudas 
he bade them search out and arrest every one suspected of 
being a &amp;Babi.  A youth named &amp;Abbas, a former servant of a well-known 
adherent of the Faith, was, on threat of inhuman torture, 
induced to walk the streets of &amp;Tihran, and point out every one he 
recognized as being a &amp;Babi.  He was even coerced into denouncing 
any individual whom he thought would be willing and able to pay 
a heavy bribe to secure his freedom.  
     The first to suffer on that calamitous day was the ill-fated &amp;Sadiq, 
who was instantly slain on the scene of his attempted crime.  His 
body was tied to the tail of a mule and dragged all the way to &amp;Tihran, 
where it was hewn into two halves, each of which was suspended and 
exposed to the public view, while the &amp;Tihranis were invited by the 
city authorities to mount the ramparts and gaze upon the mutilated 
corpse.  Molten lead was poured down the throat of his accomplice, 
after having subjected him to the torture of red-hot pincers and 
limb-rending screws.  A comrade of his, &amp;Haji &amp;Qasim, was stripped of 
his clothes, lighted candles were thrust into holes made in his flesh, 
and was paraded before the multitude who shouted and cursed him.  
Others had their eyes gouged out, were sawn asunder, strangled, blown 
from the mouths of cannons, chopped in pieces, hewn apart with 
hatchets and maces, shod with horse shoes, bayoneted and stoned.  
Torture-mongers vied with each other in running the gamut of 
brutality, while the populace, into whose hands the bodies of the 
hapless victims were delivered, would close in upon their prey, and 
would so mutilate them as to leave no trace of their original form.  
The executioners, though accustomed to their own gruesome task, 
would themselves be amazed at the fiendish cruelty of the populace.  
Women and children could be seen led down the streets by their 
executioners, their flesh in ribbons, with candles burning in their 
wounds, singing with ringing voices before the silent spectators:  
"Verily from God we come, and unto Him we return!"  As some of 
the children expired on the way their tormentors would fling their 
bodies under the feet of their fathers and sisters who, proudly treading 
 
+P65 
upon them, would not deign to give them a second glance.  A 
father, according to the testimony of a distinguished French writer, 
rather than abjure his faith, preferred to have the throats of his two 
young sons, both already covered with blood, slit upon his breast, 
as he lay on the ground, whilst the elder of the two, a lad of fourteen, 
vigorously pressing his right of seniority, demanded to be the first to 
lay down his life.  
     An Austrian officer, Captain Von Goumoens, in the employ of 
the &amp;Shah at that time, was, it is reliably stated, so horrified at the 
cruelties he was compelled to witness that he tendered his resignation.  
"Follow me, my friend," is the Captain's own testimony in a letter 
he wrote two weeks after the attempt in question, which was published 
in the "Soldatenfreund," "you who lay claim to a heart and European 
ethics, follow me to the unhappy ones who, with gouged-out eyes, 
must eat, on the scene of the deed, without any sauce, their own 
amputated ears; or whose teeth are torn out with inhuman violence 
by the hand of the executioner; or whose bare skulls are simply 
crushed by blows from a hammer; or where the bazaar is illuminated 
with unhappy victims, because on right and left the people dig 
deep holes in their breasts and shoulders, and insert burning wicks in 
the wounds.  I saw some dragged in chains through the bazaar, preceded 
by a military band, in whom these wicks had burned so deep 
that now the fat flickered convulsively in the wound like a newly 
extinguished lamp.  Not seldom it happens that the unwearying 
ingenuity of the Oriental leads to fresh tortures.  They will skin the 
soles of the &amp;Babi's feet, soak the wounds in boiling oil, shoe the foot 
like the hoof of a horse, and compel the victim to run.  No cry 
escaped from the victim's breast; the torment is endured in dark 
silence by the numbed sensation of the fanatic; now he must run; 
the body cannot endure what the soul has endured; he falls.  Give 
him the coup de &amp;grace!  Put him out of his pain!  No!  The executioner 
swings the whip, and--I myself have had to witness it--the unhappy 
victim of hundredfold tortures runs!  This is the beginning of the 
end.  As for the end itself, they hang the scorched and perforated 
bodies by their hands and feet to a tree head downwards, and now 
every Persian may try his marksmanship to his heart's content from a 
fixed but not too proximate distance on the noble quarry placed at 
his disposal.  I saw corpses torn by nearly one hundred and fifty 
bullets."  "When I read over again," he continues, "what I have 
written, I am overcome by the thought that those who are with you 
in our dearly beloved Austria may doubt the full truth of the 
 
+P66 
picture, and accuse me of exaggeration.  Would to God that I had 
not lived to see it!  But by the duties of my profession I was unhappily 
often, only too often, a witness of these abominations.  At present 
I never leave my house, in order not to meet with fresh scenes of 
horror...  Since my whole soul revolts against such infamy ... I 
will no longer maintain my connection with the scene of such crimes."  
Little wonder that a man as far-famed as Renan should, in his "Les 
&amp;Apotres" have characterized the hideous butchery perpetrated in a 
single day, during the great massacre of &amp;Tihran, as "a day perhaps 
unparalleled in the history of the world!"  
     The hand that was stretched to deal so grievous a blow to the 
adherents of a sorely-tried Faith did not confine itself to the rank 
and file of the &amp;Bab's persecuted followers.  It was raised with equal 
fury and determination against, and struck down with equal force, 
the few remaining leaders who had survived the winnowing winds of 
adversity that had already laid low so vast a number of the supporters 
of the Faith.  &amp;Tahirih, that immortal heroine who had already shed 
imperishable luster alike on her sex and on the Cause she had espoused, 
was swept into, and ultimately engulfed by, the raging storm.  Siyyid 
&amp;Husayn, the amanuensis of the &amp;Bab, the companion of His exile, the 
trusted repository of His last wishes, and the witness of the prodigies 
attendant upon His martyrdom, fell likewise a victim of its fury.  
That hand had even the temerity to lift itself against the towering 
figure of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  But though it laid hold of Him it failed to 
strike Him down.  It imperilled His life, it imprinted on His body 
indelible marks of a pitiless cruelty, but was impotent to cut short a 
career that was destined not only to keep alive the fire which 
the Spirit of the &amp;Bab had kindled, but to produce a conflagration 
that would at once consummate and outshine the glories of His 
Revelation.  
     During those somber and agonizing days when the &amp;Bab was no 
more, when the luminaries that had shone in the firmament of His 
Faith had been successively extinguished, when His nominee, a 
"bewildered fugitive, in the guise of a dervish, with &amp;kashkul (alms-basket) 
in hand" roamed the mountains and plains in the neighborhood 
of &amp;Rasht, &amp;Baha'u'llah, by reason of the acts He had performed, 
appeared in the eyes of a vigilant enemy as its most redoubtable adversary 
and as the sole hope of an as yet unextirpated heresy.  His seizure 
and death had now become imperative.  He it was Who, scarce three 
months after the Faith was born, received, through the envoy of the 
&amp;Bab, &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the scroll which bore to Him the first tidings 
 
+P67 
of a newly announced Revelation, Who instantly acclaimed its 
truth, and arose to champion its cause.  It was to His native city and 
dwelling place that the steps of that envoy were first directed, as the 
place which enshrined "a Mystery of such transcendent holiness as 
neither &amp;Hijaz nor &amp;Shiraz can hope to rival."  It was &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn's 
report of the contact thus established which had been received with 
such exultant joy by the &amp;Bab, and had brought such reassurance to 
His heart as to finally decide Him to undertake His contemplated 
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.  &amp;Baha'u'llah alone was the object 
and the center of the cryptic allusions, the glowing eulogies, the 
fervid prayers, the joyful announcements and the dire warnings 
recorded in both the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma' and the &amp;Bayan, designed to be 
respectively the first and last written testimonials to the glory with 
which God was soon to invest Him.  It was He Who, through His 
correspondence with the Author of the newly founded Faith, and 
His intimate association with the most distinguished amongst its 
disciples, such as &amp;Vahid, &amp;Hujjat, &amp;Quddus, &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn and &amp;Tahirih, 
was able to foster its growth, elucidate its principles, reinforce its 
ethical foundations, fulfill its urgent requirements, avert some of the 
immediate dangers threatening it and participate effectually in its 
rise and consolidation.  It was to Him, "the one Object of our adoration 
and love" that the Prophet-pilgrim, on His return to &amp;Bushihr, 
alluded when, dismissing &amp;Quddus from His presence, He announced 
to him the double joy of attaining the presence of their Beloved 
and of quaffing the cup of martyrdom.  He it was Who, in the hey-day 
of His life, flinging aside every consideration of earthly fame, wealth 
and position, careless of danger, and risking the obloquy of His 
caste, arose to identify Himself, first in &amp;Tihran and later in His native 
province of &amp;Mazindaran, with the cause of an obscure and proscribed 
sect; won to its support a large number of the officials and notables 
of &amp;Nur, not excluding His own associates and relatives; fearlessly and 
persuasively expounded its truths to the disciples of the illustrious 
mujtahid, &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad; enlisted under its banner the mujtahid's 
appointed representatives; secured, in consequence of this act, the 
unreserved loyalty of a considerable number of ecclesiastical dignitaries, 
government officers, peasants and traders; and succeeded in 
challenging, in the course of a memorable interview, the mujtahid 
himself.  It was solely due to the potency of the written message 
entrusted by Him to &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad &amp;Mihdiy-i-Kandi and delivered 
to the &amp;Bab while in the neighborhood of the village of Kulayn, that 
the soul of the disappointed Captive was able to rid itself, at an 
 
+P68 
hour of uncertainty and suspense, of the anguish that had settled 
upon it ever since His arrest in &amp;Shiraz.  He it was Who, for the sake 
of &amp;Tahirih and her imprisoned companions, willingly submitted Himself 
to a humiliating confinement, lasting several days--the first He 
was made to suffer--in the house of one of the &amp;kad-khudas of &amp;Tihran.  
It was to His caution, foresight and ability that must be ascribed her 
successful escape from &amp;Qasvin, her deliverance from her opponents, 
her safe arrival in His home, and her subsequent removal to a place of 
safety in the vicinity of the capital from whence she proceeded to 
&amp;Khurasan.  It was into His presence that &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn was secretly 
ushered upon his arrival in &amp;Tihran, after which interview he traveled 
to &amp;Adhirbayjan on his visit to the &amp;Bab then confined in the fortress 
of &amp;Mah-Ku.  He it was Who unobtrusively and unerringly directed 
the proceedings of the Conference of &amp;Badasht; Who entertained as 
His guests &amp;Quddus, &amp;Tahirih and the eighty-one disciples who had 
gathered on that occasion; Who revealed every day a Tablet and 
bestowed on each of the participants a new name; Who faced unaided 
the assault of a mob of more than five hundred villagers in &amp;Niyala; 
Who shielded &amp;Quddus from the fury of his assailants; Who succeeded 
in restoring a part of the property which the enemy had plundered 
and Who insured the protection and safety of the continually harassed 
and much abused &amp;Tahirih.  Against Him was kindled the anger of 
&amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah who, as a result of the persistent representations of 
mischief-makers, was at last induced to order His arrest and summon 
Him to the capital--a summons that was destined to remain unfulfilled 
as a result of the sudden death of the sovereign.  It was to His 
counsels and exhortations, addressed to the occupants of &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Tabarsi, who had welcomed Him with such reverence and love during 
His visit to that Fort, that must be attributed, in no small measure, 
the spirit evinced by its heroic defenders, while it was to His explicit 
instructions that they owed the miraculous release of &amp;Quddus and 
his consequent association with them in the stirring exploits that have 
immortalized the &amp;Mazindaran upheaval.  It was for the sake of those 
same defenders, whom He had intended to join, that He suffered His 
second imprisonment, this time in the masjid of &amp;Amul to which He 
was led, amidst the tumult raised by no less than four thousand 
spectators,--for their sake that He was bastinadoed in the &amp;namaz-khanih 
of the mujtahid of that town until His feet bled, and later 
confined in the private residence of its governor; for their sake that 
He was bitterly denounced by the leading &amp;mulla, and insulted by 
the mob who, besieging the governor's residence, pelted Him with 
 
+P69 
stones, and hurled in His face the foulest invectives.  He alone was 
the One alluded to by &amp;Quddus who, upon his arrival at the Fort of 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi, uttered, as soon as he had dismounted and leaned 
against the shrine, the prophetic verse "The &amp;Baqiyyatu'llah (the 
Remnant of God) will be best for you if ye are of those who believe."  
He alone was the Object of that prodigious eulogy, that masterly 
interpretation of the &amp;Sad of &amp;Samad, penned in part, in that same Fort 
by that same youthful hero, under the most distressing circumstances, 
and equivalent in dimensions to six times the volume of the &amp;Qur'an.  
It was to the date of His impending Revelation that the &amp;Lawh-i-Hurufat, 
revealed in &amp;Chihriq by the &amp;Bab, in honor of &amp;Dayyan, 
abstrusely alluded, and in which the mystery of the "&amp;Mustaghath" 
was unraveled.  It was to the attainment of His presence that the 
attention of another disciple, &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir, one of the Letters of the 
Living, was expressly directed by none other than the &amp;Bab Himself.  
It was exclusively to His care that the documents of the &amp;Bab, His 
pen-case, His seals, and agate rings, together with a scroll on which 
He had penned, in the form of a pentacle, no less than three hundred 
and sixty derivatives of the word &amp;Baha, were delivered, in conformity 
with instructions He Himself had issued prior to His departure from 
&amp;Chihriq.  It was solely due to His initiative, and in strict accordance 
with His instructions, that the precious remains of the &amp;Bab were 
safely transferred from &amp;Tabriz to the capital, and were concealed and 
safeguarded with the utmost secrecy and care throughout the turbulent 
years following His martyrdom.  And finally, it was He Who, 
in the days preceding the attempt on the life of the &amp;Shah, had been 
instrumental, while sojourning in &amp;Karbila, in spreading, with that same 
enthusiasm and ability that had distinguished His earlier exertions 
in &amp;Mazindaran, the teachings of His departed Leader, in safeguarding 
the interests of His Faith, in reviving the zeal of its grief-stricken 
followers, and in organizing the forces of its scattered and bewildered 
adherents.  
     Such a man, with such a record of achievements to His credit, 
could not, indeed did not, escape either the detection or the fury of a 
vigilant and fully aroused enemy.  Afire from the very beginning 
with an uncontrollable enthusiasm for the Cause He had espoused; 
conspicuously fearless in His advocacy of the rights of the downtrodden; 
in the full bloom of youth; immensely resourceful; matchless 
in His eloquence; endowed with inexhaustible energy and penetrating 
judgment; possessed of the riches, and enjoying, in full measure, 
the esteem, power and prestige associated with an enviably high and 
 
+P70 
noble position, and yet contemptuous of all earthly pomp, rewards, 
vanities and possessions; closely associated, on the one hand, through 
His regular correspondence with the Author of the Faith He had 
risen to champion, and intimately acquainted, on the other, with the 
hopes and fears, the plans and activities of its leading exponents; 
at one time advancing openly and assuming a position of acknowledged 
leadership in the forefront of the forces struggling for that Faith's 
emancipation, at another deliberately drawing back with consummate 
discretion in order to remedy, with greater efficacy, an awkward or 
dangerous situation; at all times vigilant, ready and indefatigable in 
His exertions to preserve the integrity of that Faith, to resolve its 
problems, to plead its cause, to galvanize its followers, and to confound 
its antagonists, &amp;Baha'u'llah, at this supremely critical hour in its 
fortunes, was at last stepping into the very center of the stage so 
tragically vacated by the &amp;Bab--a stage on which He was destined, for 
no less a period than forty years, to play a part unapproached in its 
majesty, pathos and splendor by any of the great Founders of the 
world's historic religions.  
     Already so conspicuous and towering a figure had, through the 
accusations levelled against Him, kindled the wrath of &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah, who, after having heard what had transpired in &amp;Badasht, had 
ordered His arrest, in a number of &amp;farmans addressed to the &amp;khans of 
&amp;Mazindaran, and expressed his determination to put Him to death.  
&amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, previously alienated from the &amp;Vazir (&amp;Baha'u'llah's 
father), and infuriated by his own failure to appropriate by fraud 
an estate that belonged to &amp;Baha'u'llah, had sworn eternal enmity to 
the One Who had so brilliantly succeeded in frustrating his evil 
designs.  The &amp;Amir-Nizam, moreover, fully aware of the pervasive 
influence of so energetic an opponent, had, in the presence of a 
distinguished gathering, accused Him of having inflicted, as a result 
of His activities, a loss of no less than five &amp;kururs upon the government, 
and had expressly requested Him, at a critical moment in the 
fortunes of the Faith, to temporarily transfer His residence to &amp;Karbila.  
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Khan-i-Nuri, who succeeded the &amp;Amir-Nizam, had endeavored, 
at the very outset of his ministry, to effect a reconciliation 
between his government and the One Whom he regarded as the most 
resourceful of the &amp;Bab's disciples.  Little wonder that when, later, 
an act of such gravity and temerity was committed, a suspicion as 
dire as it was unfounded, should at once have crept into the minds 
of the &amp;Shah, his government, his court, and his people against 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  Foremost among them was the mother of the youthful 
 
+P71 
sovereign, who, inflamed with anger, was openly denouncing Him as 
the would-be murderer of her son.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah, when that attempt had been made on the life of the 
sovereign, was in &amp;Lavasan, the guest of the Grand Vizir, and was 
staying in the village of &amp;Afchih when the momentous news reached 
Him.  Refusing to heed the advice of the Grand Vizir's brother, 
&amp;Ja'far-Quli &amp;Khan, who was acting as His host, to remain for a time 
concealed in that neighborhood, and dispensing with the good offices 
of the messenger specially dispatched to insure His safety, He rode 
forth, the following morning, with cool intrepidity, to the headquarters 
of the Imperial army which was then stationed in &amp;Niyavaran, 
in the &amp;Shimiran district.  In the village of Zarkandih He was met 
by, and conducted to the home of, His brother-in-law, &amp;Mirza &amp;Majid, 
who, at that time, was acting as secretary to the Russian Minister, 
Prince Dolgorouki, and whose house adjoined that of his superior.  
Apprised of &amp;Baha'u'llah's arrival the attendants of the &amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih, 
&amp;Haji &amp;Ali &amp;Khan, straightway informed their master, who in 
turn brought the matter to the attention of his sovereign.  The &amp;Shah, 
greatly amazed, dispatched his trusted officers to the Legation, demanding 
that the Accused be forthwith delivered into his hands.  
Refusing to comply with the wishes of the royal envoys, the Russian 
Minister requested &amp;Baha'u'llah to proceed to the home of the Grand 
Vizir, to whom he formally communicated his wish that the safety 
of the Trust the Russian government was delivering into his keeping 
should be insured.  This purpose, however, was not achieved because 
of the Grand Vizir's apprehension that he might forfeit his position 
if he extended to the Accused the protection demanded for Him.  
     Delivered into the hands of His enemies, this much-feared, bitterly 
arraigned and illustrious Exponent of a perpetually hounded 
Faith was now made to taste of the cup which He Who had been its 
recognized Leader had drained to the dregs.  From &amp;Niyavaran He 
was conducted "on foot and in chains, with bared head and bare 
feet," exposed to the fierce rays of the midsummer sun, to the 
&amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran.  On the way He several times was stripped of 
His outer garments, was overwhelmed with ridicule, and pelted with 
stones.  As to the subterranean dungeon into which He was thrown, 
and which originally had served as a reservoir of water for one of 
the public baths of the capital, let His own words, recorded in His 
"Epistle to the Son of the Wolf," bear testimony to the ordeal which 
He endured in that pestilential hole.  "We were consigned for four 
months to a place foul beyond comparison....  Upon Our arrival 
 
+P72 
We were first conducted along a pitch-black corridor, from whence 
We descended three steep flights of stairs to the place of confinement 
assigned to Us.  The dungeon was wrapped in thick darkness, and 
Our fellow-prisoners numbered nearly one hundred and fifty souls:  
thieves, assassins and highwaymen.  Though crowded, it had no other 
outlet than the passage by which We entered.  No pen can depict 
that place, nor any tongue describe its loathsome smell.  Most of 
those men had neither clothes nor bedding to lie on.  God alone 
knoweth what befell Us in that most foul-smelling and gloomy place!"  
&amp;Baha'u'llah's feet were placed in stocks, and around His neck were 
fastened the &amp;Qara-Guhar chains of such galling weight that their 
mark remained imprinted upon His body all the days of His life.  
"A heavy chain," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself has testified, "was placed 
about His neck by which He was chained to five other &amp;Babis; these 
fetters were locked together by strong, very heavy, bolts and screws.  
His clothes were torn to pieces, also His headdress.  In this terrible 
condition He was kept for four months."  For three days and three 
nights, He was denied all manner of food and drink.  Sleep was impossible 
to Him.  The place was chill and damp, filthy, fever-stricken, 
infested with vermin, and filled with a noisome stench.  Animated 
by a relentless hatred His enemies went even so far as to intercept 
and poison His food, in the hope of obtaining the favor of the mother 
of their sovereign, His most implacable foe--an attempt which, 
though it impaired His health for years to come, failed to achieve 
its purpose.  "&amp;Abdu'l-Baha," Dr. J. E. Esslemont records in his book, 
"tells how, one day, He was allowed to enter the prison yard to see 
His beloved Father, where He came out for His daily exercise.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah was terribly altered, so ill He could hardly walk, His 
hair and beard unkempt, His neck galled and swollen from the 
pressure of a heavy steel collar, His body bent by the weight of 
His chains."  
     While &amp;Baha'u'llah was being so odiously and cruelly subjected to 
the trials and tribulations inseparable from those tumultuous days, 
another luminary of the Faith, the valiant &amp;Tahirih, was swiftly 
succumbing to their devastating power.  Her meteoric career, inaugurated 
in &amp;Karbila, culminating in &amp;Badasht, was now about to attain its 
final consummation in a martyrdom that may well rank as one of the 
most affecting episodes in the most turbulent period of &amp;Baha'i history.  
     A scion of the highly reputed family of &amp;Haji &amp;Mulla &amp;Salih-i-Baraqani, 
whose members occupied an enviable position in the 
Persian ecclesiastical hierarchy; the namesake of the illustrious 
 
+P73 
&amp;Fatimih; designated as &amp;Zarrin-Taj (Crown of Gold) and &amp;Zakiyyih 
(Virtuous) by her family and kindred; born in the same year as 
&amp;Baha'u'llah; regarded from childhood, by her fellow-townsmen, as a 
prodigy, alike in her intelligence and beauty; highly esteemed even 
by some of the most haughty and learned &amp;ulamas of her country, 
prior to her conversion, for the brilliancy and novelty of the views 
she propounded; acclaimed as &amp;Qurrat-i-'Ayni (solace of my eyes) 
by her admiring teacher, Siyyid &amp;Kazim; entitled &amp;Tahirih (the Pure 
One) by the "Tongue of Power and Glory;" and the only woman 
enrolled by the &amp;Bab as one of the Letters of the Living; she had, 
through a dream, referred to earlier in these pages, established her 
first contact with a Faith which she continued to propagate to her 
last breath, and in its hour of greatest peril, with all the ardor of 
her unsubduable spirit.  Undeterred by the vehement protests of her 
father; contemptuous of the anathemas of her uncle; unmoved by 
the earnest solicitations of her husband and her brothers; undaunted 
by the measures which, first in &amp;Karbila and subsequently in &amp;Baghdad, 
and later in &amp;Qasvin, the civil and ecclesiastical authorities had taken 
to curtail her activities, with eager energy she urged the &amp;Babi Cause.  
Through her eloquent pleadings, her fearless denunciations, her dissertations, 
poems and translations, her commentaries and correspondence, 
she persisted in firing the imagination and in enlisting the allegiance 
of Arabs and Persians alike to the new Revelation, in condemning the 
perversity of her generation, and in advocating a revolutionary transformation 
in the habits and manners of her people.  
     She it was who while in &amp;Karbila--the foremost stronghold of 
&amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam--had been moved to address lengthy epistles to each of 
the &amp;ulamas residing in that city, who relegated women to a rank 
little higher than animals and denied them even the possession of a 
soul--epistles in which she ably vindicated her high purpose and 
exposed their malignant designs.  She it was who, in open defiance of 
the customs of the fanatical inhabitants of that same city, boldly 
disregarded the anniversary of the martyrdom of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, 
commemorated with elaborate ceremony in the early days of &amp;Muharram, 
and celebrated instead the anniversary of the birthday of the 
&amp;Bab, which fell on the first day of that month.  It was through her 
prodigious eloquence and the astounding force of her argument that 
she confounded the representative delegation of &amp;Shi'ah, of &amp;Sunni, 
of Christian and Jewish notables of &amp;Baghdad, who had endeavored to 
dissuade her from her avowed purpose of spreading the tidings of the 
new Message.  She it was who, with consummate skill, defended her 
 
+P74 
faith and vindicated her conduct in the home and in the presence of 
that eminent jurist, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Mahmud-i-Alusi, the &amp;Mufti of &amp;Baghdad, 
and who later held her historic interviews with the princes, the 
&amp;ulamas and the government officials residing in &amp;Kirmanshah, in 
the course of which the &amp;Bab's commentary on the &amp;Surih of &amp;Kawthar 
was publicly read and translated, and which culminated in the conversion 
of the &amp;Amir (the governor) and his family.  It was this 
remarkably gifted woman who undertook the translation of the &amp;Bab's 
lengthy commentary on the &amp;Surih of Joseph (the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma') 
for the benefit of her Persian co-religionists, and exerted her utmost 
to spread the knowledge and elucidate the contents of that mighty 
Book.  It was her fearlessness, her skill, her organizing ability and her 
unquenchable enthusiasm which consolidated her newly won victories 
in no less inimical a center than &amp;Qasvin, which prided itself on the 
fact that no fewer than a hundred of the highest ecclesiastical leaders 
of &amp;Islam dwelt within its gates.  It was she who, in the house of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Tihran, in the course of her memorable interview 
with the celebrated &amp;Vahid, suddenly interrupted his learned discourse 
on the signs of the new Manifestation, and vehemently urged him, as 
she held &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, then a child, on her lap, to arise and demonstrate 
through deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice the depth and 
sincerity of his faith.  It was to her doors, during the height of her 
fame and popularity in &amp;Tihran, that the flower of feminine society in 
the capital flocked to hear her brilliant discourses on the matchless 
tenets of her Faith.  It was the magic of her words which won the 
wedding guests away from the festivities, on the occasion of the marriage 
of the son of &amp;Mahmud &amp;Khan-i-Kalantar--in whose house she 
was confined--and gathered them about her, eager to drink in her 
every word.  It was her passionate and unqualified affirmation of the 
claims and distinguishing features of the new Revelation, in a series of 
seven conferences with the deputies of the Grand Vizir commissioned 
to interrogate her, which she held while confined in that same house, 
which finally precipitated the sentence of her death.  It was from 
her pen that odes had flowed attesting, in unmistakable language, 
not only her faith in the Revelation of the &amp;Bab, but also her recognition 
of the exalted and as yet undisclosed mission of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  And 
last but not least it was owing to her initiative, while participating 
in the Conference of &amp;Badasht, that the most challenging implications 
of a revolutionary and as yet but dimly grasped Dispensation were 
laid bare before her fellow-disciples and the new Order permanently 
divorced from the laws and institutions of &amp;Islam.  Such marvelous 
 
+P75 
achievements were now to be crowned by, and attain their final 
consummation in, her martyrdom in the midst of the storm that was 
raging throughout the capital.  
     One night, aware that the hour of her death was at hand, she 
put on the attire of a bride, and annointed herself with perfume, and, 
sending for the wife of the Kalantar, she communicated to her the 
secret of her impending martyrdom, and confided to her her last 
wishes.  Then, closeting herself in her chambers, she awaited, in 
prayer and meditation, the hour which was to witness her reunion 
with her Beloved.  She was pacing the floor of her room, chanting a 
litany expressive of both grief and triumph, when the &amp;farrashes of 
&amp;Aziz &amp;Khan-i-Sardar arrived, in the dead of night, to conduct her to 
the &amp;Ilkhani garden, which lay beyond the city gates, and which was 
to be the site of her martyrdom.  When she arrived the &amp;Sardar was 
in the midst of a drunken debauch with his lieutenants, and was 
roaring with laughter; he ordered offhand that she be strangled at 
once and thrown into a pit.  With that same silken kerchief which 
she had intuitively reserved for that purpose, and delivered in her 
last moments to the son of Kalantar who accompanied her, the death 
of this immortal heroine was accomplished.  Her body was lowered 
into a well, which was then filled with earth and stones, in the 
manner she herself had desired.  
     Thus ended the life of this great &amp;Babi heroine, the first woman 
suffrage martyr, who, at her death, turning to the one in whose 
custody she had been placed, had boldly declared:  "You can kill me 
as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women."  
Her career was as dazzling as it was brief, as tragic as it was eventful.  
Unlike her fellow-disciples, whose exploits remained, for the most 
part unknown, and unsung by their contemporaries in foreign lands, 
the fame of this immortal woman was noised abroad, and traveling 
with remarkable swiftness as far as the capitals of Western Europe, 
aroused the enthusiastic admiration and evoked the ardent praise of 
men and women of divers nationalities, callings and cultures.  Little 
wonder that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha should have joined her name to those of 
Sarah, of &amp;Asiyih, of the Virgin Mary and of &amp;Fatimih, who, in the 
course of successive Dispensations, have towered, by reason of their 
intrinsic merits and unique position, above the rank and file of their 
sex.  "In eloquence," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself has written, "she was the 
calamity of the age, and in ratiocination the trouble of the world."  
He, moreover, has described her as "a brand afire with the love of 
God" and "a lamp aglow with the bounty of God."  
 
+P76 
     Indeed the wondrous story of her life propagated itself as far and 
as fast as that of the &amp;Bab Himself, the direct Source of her inspiration.  
"Prodige de science, mais aussi prodige de &amp;beaute" is the tribute paid 
her by a noted commentator on the life of the &amp;Bab and His disciples.  
"The Persian Joan of Arc, the leader of emancipation for women of 
the Orient ... who bore resemblance both to the mediaeval Heloise 
and the neo-platonic Hypatia," thus was she acclaimed by a noted 
playwright whom Sarah Bernhardt had specifically requested to write 
a dramatized version of her life.  "The heroism of the lovely but 
ill-fated poetess of &amp;Qasvin, &amp;Zarrin-Taj (Crown of Gold) ..." 
testifies Lord Curzon of Kedleston, "is one of the most affecting 
episodes in modern history."  "The appearance of such a woman as 
&amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn," wrote the well-known British Orientalist, Prof. 
E. G. Browne, "is, in any country and any age, a rare phenomenon, 
but in such a country as Persia it is a prodigy--nay, almost a miracle.  
...Had the &amp;Babi religion no other claim to greatness, this were 
sufficient ... that it produced a heroine like &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn."  
"The harvest sown in Islamic lands by &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn," significantly 
affirms the renowned English divine, Dr. T. K. Cheyne, in one of his 
books, "is now beginning to appear ... this noble woman ... 
has the credit of opening the catalogue of social reforms in Persia..."  
"Assuredly one of the most striking and interesting manifestations 
of this religion" is the reference to her by the noted French diplomat 
and brilliant writer, Comte de Gobineau.  "In &amp;Qasvin," he adds, 
"she was held, with every justification, to be a prodigy."  "Many 
people," he, moreover has written, "who knew her and heard her at 
different periods of her life have invariably told me ... that when 
she spoke one felt stirred to the depths of one's soul, was filled with 
admiration, and was moved to tears."  "No memory," writes Sir 
Valentine Chirol, "is more deeply venerated or kindles greater enthusiasm 
than hers, and the influence which she wielded in her lifetime 
still inures to her sex."  "O &amp;Tahirih!" exclaims in his book on the 
&amp;Babis the great author and poet of Turkey, &amp;Sulayman &amp;Nazim Bey, 
"you are worth a thousand &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shahs!"  "The greatest ideal 
of womanhood has been &amp;Tahirih" is the tribute paid her by the mother 
of one of the Presidents of Austria, Mrs. Marianna Hainisch, "... 
I shall try to do for the women of Austria what &amp;Tahirih gave her 
life to do for the women of Persia."  
     Many and divers are her ardent admirers who, throughout the 
five continents, are eager to know more about her.  Many are those 
whose conduct has been ennobled by her inspiring example, who have 
 
+P77 
committed to memory her matchless odes, or set to music her poems, 
before whose eyes glows the vision of her indomitable spirit, in whose 
hearts is enshrined a love and admiration that time can never dim, 
and in whose souls burns the determination to tread as dauntlessly, 
and with that same fidelity, the path she chose for herself, and from 
which she never swerved from the moment of her conversion to the 
hour of her death.  
     The fierce gale of persecution that had swept &amp;Baha'u'llah into a 
subterranean dungeon and snuffed out the light of &amp;Tahirih also sealed 
the fate of the &amp;Bab's distinguished amanuensis, Siyyid &amp;Husayn-i-Yazdi, 
surnamed &amp;Aziz, who had shared His confinement in both 
&amp;Mah-Ku and &amp;Chihriq.  A man of rich experience and high merit, 
deeply versed in the teachings of his Master, and enjoying His 
unqualified confidence, he, refusing every offer of deliverance from 
the leading officials of &amp;Tihran, yearned unceasingly for the martyrdom 
which had been denied him on the day the &amp;Bab had laid down His 
life in the barrack-square of &amp;Tabriz.  A fellow-prisoner of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran, from Whom he derived inspiration 
and solace as he recalled those precious days spent in the company of 
his Master in &amp;Adhirbayjan, he was finally struck down, in circumstances 
of shameful cruelty, by that same &amp;Aziz &amp;Khan-i-Sardar who 
had dealt the fatal blow to &amp;Tahirih.  
     Another victim of the frightful tortures inflicted by an unyielding 
enemy was the high-minded, the influential and courageous &amp;Haji 
&amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan.  So greatly was he esteemed that the &amp;Amir-Nizam 
had felt, on a previous occasion, constrained to ignore his connection 
with the Faith he had embraced and to spare his life.  The turmoil 
that convulsed &amp;Tihran as a result of the attempt on the life of the 
sovereign, however, precipitated his arrest and brought about his 
martyrdom.  The &amp;Shah, having failed to induce him through the 
&amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih to recant, commanded that he be put to death in 
any way he himself might choose.  Nine holes, at his express wish, 
were made in his flesh, in each of which a lighted candle was placed.  
As the executioner shrank from performing this gruesome task, he 
attempted to snatch the knife from his hand that he might himself 
plunge it into his own body.  Fearing lest he should attack him the 
executioner refused, and bade his men tie the victim's hands behind 
his back, whereupon the intrepid sufferer pleaded with them to pierce 
two holes in his breast, two in his shoulders, one in the nape of his 
neck, and four others in his back--a wish they complied with.  Standing 
erect as an arrow, his eyes glowing with stoic fortitude, unperturbed 
 
+P78 
by the howling multitude or the sight of his own blood 
streaming from his wounds, and preceded by minstrels and drummers, 
he led the concourse that pressed round him to the final place of his 
martyrdom.  Every few steps he would interrupt his march to address 
the bewildered bystanders in words in which he glorified the &amp;Bab 
and magnified the significance of his own death.  As his eyes beheld 
the candles flickering in their bloody sockets, he would burst forth in 
exclamations of unrestrained delight.  Whenever one of them fell 
from his body he would with his own hand pick it up, light it from 
the others, and replace it.  "Why dost thou not dance?" asked the 
executioner mockingly, "since thou findest death so pleasant?"  
"Dance?" cried the sufferer, "In one hand the wine-cup, in one hand 
the tresses of the Friend.  Such a dance in the midst of the market-place 
is my desire!"  He was still in the bazaar when the flowing of a 
breeze, fanning the flames of the candles now burning deep in his 
flesh, caused it to sizzle, whereupon he burst forth addressing the 
flames that ate into his wounds:  "You have long lost your sting, 
O flames, and have been robbed of your power to pain me.  Make 
haste, for from your very tongues of fire I can hear the voice that 
calls me to my Beloved."  In a blaze of light he walked as a conqueror 
might have marched to the scene of his victory.  At the foot of the 
gallows he once again raised his voice in a final appeal to the multitude 
of onlookers.  He then prostrated himself in the direction of the 
shrine of the &amp;Imam-Zadih &amp;Hasan, murmuring some words in Arabic.  
"My work is now finished," he cried to the executioner, "come and 
do yours."  Life still lingered in him as his body was sawn into two 
halves, with the praise of his Beloved still fluttering from his dying 
lips.  The scorched and bloody remnants of his corpse were, as he 
himself had requested, suspended on either side of the Gate of Naw, 
mute witnesses to the unquenchable love which the &amp;Bab had kindled 
in the breasts of His disciples.  
     The violent conflagration kindled as a result of the attempted 
assassination of the sovereign could not be confined to the capital.  It 
overran the adjoining provinces, ravaged &amp;Mazindaran, the native 
province of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and brought about in its wake, the confiscation, 
the plunder and the destruction of all His possessions.  In 
the village of &amp;Takur, in the district of &amp;Nur, His sumptuously furnished 
home, inherited from His father, was, by order of &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu-Talib 
&amp;Khan, nephew of the Grand Vizir, completely despoiled, and whatever 
could not be carried away was ordered to be destroyed, while its 
rooms, more stately than those of the palaces of &amp;Tihran, were disfigured 
 
+P79 
beyond repair.  Even the houses of the people were leveled 
with the ground, after which the entire village was set on fire.  
     The commotion that had seized &amp;Tihran and had given rise to the 
campaign of outrage and spoliation in &amp;Mazindaran spread even as far 
as Yazd, &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Shiraz, rocking the remotest hamlets, and 
rekindling the flames of persecution.  Once again greedy governors and 
perfidious subordinates vied with each other in despoiling the innocent, 
in massacring the guiltless, and in dishonoring the noblest of 
their race.  A carnage ensued which repeated the atrocities already 
perpetrated in &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Zanjan.  "My pen," writes the chronicler 
of the bloody episodes associated with the birth and rise of our Faith, 
"shrinks in horror in attempting to describe what befell those valiant 
men and women....  What I have attempted to recount of the 
horrors of the siege of &amp;Zanjan ... pales before the glaring ferocity 
of the atrocities perpetrated a few years later in &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Shiraz."  
The heads of no less than two hundred victims of these outbursts of 
ferocious fanaticism were impaled on bayonets, and carried triumphantly 
from &amp;Shiraz to &amp;Abadih.  Forty women and children were 
charred to a cinder by being placed in a cave, in which a vast quantity 
of firewood had been heaped up, soaked with naphtha and set alight.  
Three hundred women were forced to ride two by two on bare-backed 
horses all the way to &amp;Shiraz.  Stripped almost naked they were led 
between rows of heads hewn from the lifeless bodies of their husbands, 
sons, fathers and brothers.  Untold insults were heaped upon them, and 
the hardships they suffered were such that many among them perished.  
     Thus drew to a close a chapter which records for all time the 
bloodiest, the most tragic, the most heroic period of the first &amp;Baha'i 
century.  The torrents of blood that poured out during those crowded 
and calamitous years may be regarded as constituting the fertile seeds 
of that World Order which a swiftly succeeding and still greater 
Revelation was to proclaim and establish.  The tributes paid the noble 
army of the heroes, saints and martyrs of that Primitive Age, by 
friend and foe alike, from &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself down to the most 
disinterested observers in distant lands, and from the moment of its 
birth until the present day, bear imperishable witness to the glory of 
the deeds that immortalize that Age.  
     "The whole world," is &amp;Baha'u'llah's matchless testimony in the 
&amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, "marveled at the manner of their sacrifice....  The 
mind is bewildered at their deeds, and the soul marveleth at their 
fortitude and bodily endurance....  Hath any age witnessed such 
momentous happenings?"  And again:  "Hath the world, since the 
 
+P80 
days of Adam, witnessed such tumult, such violent commotion?...  
Methinks, patience was revealed only by virtue of their fortitude, and 
faithfulness itself was begotten only by their deeds."  "Through the 
blood which they shed," He, in a prayer, referring more specifically 
to the martyrs of the Faith, has significantly affirmed, "the earth hath 
been impregnated with the wondrous revelations of Thy might and 
the gem-like signs of Thy glorious sovereignty.  Ere-long shall she 
tell out her tidings, when the set time is come."  
     To whom else could these significant words of &amp;Muhammad, the 
Apostle of God, quoted by &amp;Quddus while addressing his companions 
in the Fort of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi, apply if not to those heroes of God 
who, with their life-blood, ushered in the Promised Day?  "O how I 
long to behold the countenance of My brethren, my brethren who 
will appear at the end of the world!  Blessed are We, blessed are they; 
greater is their blessedness than ours."  Who else could be meant by 
this tradition, called &amp;Hadith-i-Jabir, recorded in the &amp;Kafi, and 
authenticated by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, which, in indubitable 
language, sets forth the signs of the appearance of the promised 
&amp;Qa'im?  "His saints shall be abased in His time, and their heads shall 
be exchanged as presents, even as the heads of the Turk and the 
Daylamite are exchanged as presents; they shall be slain and burned, 
and shall be afraid, fearful and dismayed; the earth shall be dyed 
with their blood, and lamentation and wailing shall prevail amongst 
their women; these are My saints indeed."  
     "Tales of magnificent heroism," is the written testimony of Lord 
Curzon of Kedleston, "illumine the blood-stained pages of &amp;Babi 
history....  The fires of Smithfield did not kindle a nobler courage 
than has met and defied the more refined torture-mongers of &amp;Tihran.  
Of no small account, then, must be the tenets of a creed that can 
awaken in its followers so rare and beautiful a spirit of self-sacrifice.  
The heroism and martyrdom of His (the &amp;Bab) followers will appeal 
to many others who can find no similar phenomena in the contemporaneous 
records of &amp;Islam."  "&amp;Babism," wrote Prof. J. Darmesteter, 
"which diffused itself in less than five years from one end of 
Persia to another, which was bathed in 1852 in the blood of its 
martyrs, has been silently progressing and propagating itself.  If 
Persia is to be at all regenerate it will be through this new Faith."  
"Des milliers de martyrs," attests Renan in his "Les &amp;Apotres," "sont 
accourus pour lui (the &amp;Bab) avec &amp;allegresse au devant de la mort.  
Un jour sans pareil &amp;peut-etre dans l'histoire du monde fut celui de la 
grande boucherie qui se fit des &amp;Babis &amp;a Teheran."  "One of those 
 
+P81 
strange outbursts," declares the well-known Orientalist Prof. E. G. 
Browne, "of enthusiasm, faith, fervent devotion and indomitable 
heroism ... the birth of a Faith which may not impossibly win a 
place amidst the great religions of the world."  And again:  "The 
spirit which pervades the &amp;Babis is such that it can hardly fail to 
affect most powerfully all subjected to its influence....  Let those 
who have not seen disbelieve me if they will, but, should that spirit 
once reveal itself to them, they will experience an emotion which 
they are not likely to forget."  "J'avoue &amp;meme," is the assertion made 
by Comte de Gobineau in his book, "que, si je voyais en Europe une 
secte d'une nature analogue au Babysme se &amp;presenter avec des avantages 
tels que les siens, foi aveugle, enthousiasme &amp;extreme, courage et &amp;devouement 
&amp;eprouves, respect &amp;inspire aux &amp;indifferents, terreur profonde 
&amp;inspiree aux adversaires, et de plus, comme je l'ai dit, un &amp;proselytisme 
qui ne &amp;s'arrete pas, et donc les &amp;succes sont constants dans toutes les 
classes de la &amp;societe; si je voyais, dis-je, tout cela exister en Europe, je 
&amp;n'hesiterais pas &amp;a &amp;predire que, dans un temps &amp;donne, la puissance et 
le sceptre appartiendront de toute &amp;necessite aux possesseurs de ces 
grands avantages."  
     "The truth of the matter," is the answer which &amp;Abbas-Quli 
&amp;Khan-i-Larijani, whose bullet was responsible for the death of &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Husayn, is reported to have given to a query addressed to him by 
Prince &amp;Ahmad &amp;Mirza in the presence of several witnesses, "is that 
any one who had not seen &amp;Karbila would, if he had seen &amp;Tabarsi, not 
only have comprehended what there took place, but would have 
ceased to consider it; and had he seen &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn of &amp;Bushruyih, 
he would have been convinced that the Chief of Martyrs (&amp;Imam 
&amp;Husayn) had returned to earth; and had he witnessed my deeds, he 
would assuredly have said:  `This is &amp;Shimr come back with sword 
and lance...'  In truth, I know not what had been shown to these 
people, or what they had seen, that they came forth to battle with 
such alacrity and joy....  The imagination of man cannot conceive 
the vehemence of their courage and valor."  
     What, in conclusion, we may well ask ourselves, has been the 
fate of that flagitious crew who, actuated by malice, by greed or 
fanaticism, sought to quench the light which the &amp;Bab and His followers 
had diffused over their country and its people?  The rod of 
Divine chastisement, swiftly and with unyielding severity, spared 
neither the Chief Magistrate of the realm, nor his ministers and 
counselors, nor the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the religion with 
which his government was indissolubly connected, nor the governors 
 
+P82 
who acted as his representatives, nor the chiefs of his armed forces 
who, in varying degrees, deliberately or through fear or neglect, 
contributed to the appalling trials to which an infant Faith was so 
undeservedly subjected.  &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah himself, a sovereign at 
once bigoted and irresolute who, refusing to heed the appeal of the 
&amp;Bab to receive Him in the capital and enable Him to demonstrate 
the truth of His Cause, yielded to the importunities of a malevolent 
minister, succumbed, at the early age of forty, after sustaining a 
sudden reverse of fortune, to a complication of maladies, and was 
condemned to that "hell-fire" which, "on the Day of Resurrection," 
the Author of the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma' had sworn would inevitably 
devour him.  His evil genius, the omnipotent &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, the 
power behind the throne and the chief instigator of the outrages 
perpetrated against the &amp;Bab, including His imprisonment in the 
mountains of &amp;Adhirbayjan, was, after the lapse of scarcely a year 
and six months from the time he interposed himself between the 
&amp;Shah and his Captive, hurled from power, deprived of his ill-gotten 
riches, was disgraced by his sovereign, was driven to seek shelter from 
the rising wrath of his countrymen in the shrine of &amp;Shah &amp;Abdu'l-'Azim, 
and was later ignominiously expelled to &amp;Karbila, falling a 
prey to disease, poverty and gnawing sorrow--a piteous vindication 
of that denunciatory Tablet in which his Prisoner had foreshadowed 
his doom and denounced his infamy.  As to the low-born and infamous 
&amp;Amir-Nizam, &amp;Mirza &amp;Taqi &amp;Khan, the first year of whose short-lived 
ministry was stained with the ferocious onslaught against the defenders 
of the Fort of &amp;Tabarsi, who authorized and encouraged the 
execution of the Seven Martyrs of &amp;Tihran, who unleashed the assault 
against &amp;Vahid and his companions, who was directly responsible for 
the death-sentence of the &amp;Bab, and who precipitated the great upheaval 
of &amp;Zanjan, he forfeited, through the unrelenting jealousy of 
his sovereign and the vindictiveness of court intrigue, all the honors 
he had enjoyed, and was treacherously put to death by the royal 
order, his veins being opened in the bath of the Palace of &amp;Fin, near 
&amp;Kashan.  "Had the &amp;Amir-Nizam," &amp;Baha'u'llah is reported by &amp;Nabil 
to have stated, "been aware of My true position, he would certainly 
have laid hold on Me.  He exerted the utmost effort to discover the 
real situation, but was unsuccessful.  God wished him to be ignorant 
of it."  &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Khan, who had taken such an active part in the 
unbridled cruelties perpetrated as a result of the attempt on the life 
of the sovereign, was driven from office, and placed under strict 
surveillance in Yazd, where he ended his days in shame and despair.  
 
+P83 
     &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, the governor of &amp;Shiraz, stigmatized as a "wine-bibber" 
and a "tyrant," the first who arose to ill-treat the &amp;Bab, who 
publicly rebuked Him and bade his attendant strike Him violently 
in the face, was compelled not only to endure the dreadful calamity 
that so suddenly befell him, his family, his city and his province, 
but afterwards to witness the undoing of all his labors, and to lead 
in obscurity the remaining days of his life, till he tottered to his 
grave abandoned alike by his friends and his enemies.  &amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih, 
that bloodthirsty fiend, who had strenuously hounded down 
so many innocent and defenseless &amp;Babis, fell in his turn a victim to 
the fury of the turbulent Lurs, who, after despoiling him of his 
property, cut off his beard, and forced him to eat it, saddled and 
bridled him, and rode him before the eyes of the people, after which 
they inflicted under his very eyes shameful atrocities upon his womenfolk 
and children.  The &amp;Sa'idu'l-'Ulama, the fanatical, the ferocious 
and shameless mujtahid of &amp;Barfurush, whose unquenchable hostility 
had heaped such insults upon, and caused such sufferings to, the 
heroes of &amp;Tabarsi, fell, soon after the abominations he had perpetrated, 
a prey to a strange disease, provoking an unquenchable thirst 
and producing such icy chills that neither the furs he wrapped himself 
in, nor the fire that continually burned in his room could 
alleviate his sufferings.  The spectacle of his ruined and once luxurious 
home, fallen into such ill use after his death as to become the refuse-heap 
of the people of his town, impressed so profoundly the inhabitants 
of &amp;Mazindaran that in their mutual vituperations they would 
often invoke upon each other's home the same fate as that which 
had befallen that accursed habitation.  The false-hearted and ambitious 
&amp;Mahmud &amp;Khan-i-Kalantar, into whose custody &amp;Tahirih had 
been delivered before her martyrdom, incurred, nine years later, the 
wrath of his royal master, was dragged feet first by ropes through 
the bazaars to a place outside the city gates, and there hung on the 
gallows.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan &amp;Khan, who carried out the execution of the 
&amp;Bab under orders from his brother, the &amp;Amir-Nizam, was, within two 
years of that unpardonable act, subjected to a dreadful punishment 
which ended in his death.  The &amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam of &amp;Tabriz, the insolent, 
the avaricious and tyrannical &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali &amp;Asghar, who, after 
the refusal of the bodyguard of the governor of that city to inflict 
the bastinado on the &amp;Bab, proceeded to apply eleven times the rods 
to the feet of his Prisoner with his own hand, was, in that same year, 
struck with paralysis, and, after enduring the most excruciating 
ordeal, died a miserable death--a death that was soon followed by 
 
+P84 
the abolition of the function of the &amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam in that city.  
The haughty and perfidious &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu-Talib &amp;Khan who, disregarding 
the counsels of moderation given him by &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Khan, the 
Grand Vizir, ordered the plunder and burning of the village of 
&amp;Takur, as well as the destruction of the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah, was, a 
year later, stricken with plague and perished wretchedly, shunned 
by even his nearest kindred.  &amp;Mihr-'Ali &amp;Khan, the &amp;Shuja'u'l-Mulk, 
who, after the attempt on the &amp;Shah's life, so savagely persecuted the 
remnants of the &amp;Babi community in &amp;Nayriz, fell ill, according to 
the testimony of his own grandson, and was stricken with dumbness, 
which was never relieved till the day of his death.  His accomplice, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Na'im, fell into disgrace, was twice heavily fined, dismissed 
from office, and subjected to exquisite tortures.  The regiment which, 
scorning the miracle that warned &amp;Sam &amp;Khan and his men to dissociate 
themselves from any further attempt to destroy the life of the 
&amp;Bab, volunteered to take their place and riddled His body with its 
bullets, lost, in that same year, no less than two hundred and fifty 
of its officers and men, in a terrible earthquake between &amp;Ardibil and 
&amp;Tabriz; two years later the remaining five hundred were mercilessly 
shot in &amp;Tabriz for mutiny, and the people, gazing on their exposed 
and mutilated bodies, recalled their savage act, and indulged in such 
expressions of condemnation and wonder as to induce the leading 
mujtahids to chastise and silence them.  The head of that regiment, 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Jan Big, lost his life, six years after the &amp;Bab's martyrdom, during 
the bombardment of &amp;Muhammarih by the British naval forces.  
     The judgment of God, so rigorous and unsparing in its visitations 
on those who took a leading or an active part in the crimes committed 
against the &amp;Bab and His followers, was not less severe in its 
dealings with the mass of the people--a people more fanatical than 
the Jews in the days of Jesus--a people notorious for their gross 
ignorance, their ferocious bigotry, their willful perversity and savage 
cruelty, a people mercenary, avaricious, egotistical and cowardly.  
I can do no better than quote what the &amp;Bab Himself has written in 
the &amp;Dala'il-i-Sab'ih (Seven Proofs) during the last days of His 
ministry:  "Call thou to remembrance the early days of the Revelation.  
How great the number of those who died of cholera!  That was indeed 
one of the prodigies of the Revelation, and yet none recognized it!  
During four years the scourge raged among &amp;Shi'ah Muslims without 
any one grasping its significance!"  "As to the great mass of its people 
(Persia)," &amp;Nabil has recorded in his immortal narrative, "who 
watched with sullen indifference the tragedy that was being enacted 
 
+P85 
before their eyes, and who failed to raise a finger in protest against 
the hideousness of those cruelties, they fell, in their turn, victims to 
a misery which all the resources of the land and the energy of its 
statesmen were powerless to alleviate....  From the very day the 
hand of the assailant was stretched forth against the &amp;Bab ... visitation 
upon visitation crushed the spirit out of that ungrateful people, 
and brought them to the very brink of national bankruptcy.  Plagues, 
the very names of which were almost unknown to them except for 
a cursory reference in the dust-covered books which few cared to 
read, fell upon them with a fury that none could escape.  That 
scourge scattered devastation wherever it spread.  Prince and peasant 
alike felt its sting and bowed to its yoke.  It held the populace in 
its grip, and refused to relax its hold upon them.  As malignant as 
the fever which decimated the province of &amp;Gilan, these sudden afflictions 
continued to lay waste the land.  Grievous as were these calamities, 
the avenging wrath of God did not stop at the misfortunes that 
befell a perverse and faithless people.  It made itself felt in every 
living being that breathed on the surface of that stricken land.  It 
afflicted the life of plants and animals alike, and made the people 
feel the magnitude of their distress.  Famine added its horrors to the 
stupendous weight of afflictions under which the people were groaning.  
The gaunt spectre of starvation stalked abroad amidst them, 
and the prospect of a slow and painful death haunted their vision....  
People and government alike sighed for the relief which they could 
nowhere obtain.  They drank the cup of woe to its dregs, utterly 
unregardful of the Hand which had brought it to their lips, and 
of the Person for Whose sake they were made to suffer."

                                  CHAPTER VI 
                      The Birth of The &amp;Baha'i Revelation 
 
     The train of dire events that followed in swift succession the 
calamitous attempt on the life of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah mark, as already 
observed, the termination of the &amp;Babi Dispensation and the closing 
of the initial, the darkest and bloodiest chapter of the history of the 
first &amp;Baha'i century.  A phase of measureless tribulation had been 
ushered in by these events, in the course of which the fortunes of 
the Faith proclaimed by the &amp;Bab sank to their lowest ebb.  Indeed 
ever since its inception trials and vexations, setbacks and disappointments, 
denunciations, betrayals and massacres had, in a steadily rising 
crescendo, contributed to the decimation of the ranks of its followers, 
strained to the utmost the loyalty of its stoutest upholders, and all 
but succeeded in disrupting the foundations on which it rested.  
     From its birth, government, clergy and people had risen as one 
man against it and vowed eternal enmity to its cause.  &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah, weak alike in mind and will, had, under pressure, rejected the 
overtures made to him by the &amp;Bab Himself, had declined to meet 
Him face to face, and even refused Him admittance to the capital.  
The youthful &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, of a cruel and imperious nature, 
had, both as crown prince and as reigning sovereign, increasingly 
evinced the bitter hostility which, at a later stage in his reign, was 
to blaze forth in all its dark and ruthless savagery.  The powerful 
and sagacious &amp;Mu'tamid, the one solitary figure who could have 
extended Him the support and protection He so sorely needed, was 
taken from Him by a sudden death.  The Sherif of Mecca, who 
through the mediation of &amp;Quddus had been made acquainted with 
the new Revelation on the occasion of the &amp;Bab's pilgrimage to Mecca, 
had turned a deaf ear to the Divine Message, and received His 
messenger with curt indifference.  The prearranged gathering that 
was to have taken place in the holy city of &amp;Karbila, in the course 
of the &amp;Bab's return journey from &amp;Hijaz, had, to the disappointment 
of His followers who had been eagerly awaiting His arrival, to be 
definitely abandoned.  The eighteen Letters of the Living, the principal 
bastions that buttressed the infant strength of the Faith, had 
for the most part fallen.  The "Mirrors," the "Guides," the "Witnesses" 
 
+P90 
comprising the &amp;Babi hierarchy had either been put to the 
sword, or hounded from their native soil, or bludgeoned into silence.  
The program, whose essentials had been communicated to the foremost 
among them, had, owing to their excessive zeal, remained for 
the most part unfulfilled.  The attempts which two of those disciples 
had made to establish the Faith in Turkey and India had signally 
failed at the very outset of their mission.  The tempests that had 
swept &amp;Mazindaran, &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Zanjan had, in addition to blasting 
to their roots the promising careers of the venerated &amp;Quddus, the 
lion-hearted &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the erudite &amp;Vahid, and the indomitable 
&amp;Hujjat, cut short the lives of an alarmingly large number of the most 
resourceful and most valiant of their fellow-disciples.  The hideous 
outrages associated with the death of the Seven Martyrs of &amp;Tihran 
had been responsible for the extinction of yet another living symbol 
of the Faith, who, by reason of his close kinship to, and intimate 
association with, the &amp;Bab, no less than by virtue of his inherent qualities, 
would if spared have decisively contributed to the protection and 
furtherance of a struggling Cause.  
     The storm which subsequently burst, with unexampled violence, 
on a community already beaten to its knees, had, moreover, robbed 
it of its greatest heroine, the incomparable &amp;Tahirih, still in the full 
tide of her victories, had sealed the doom of Siyyid &amp;Husayn, the 
&amp;Bab's trusted amanuensis and chosen repository of His last wishes, had 
laid low &amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qasvini, admittedly one of the very 
few who could claim to possess a profound knowledge of the origins 
of the Faith, and had plunged into a dungeon &amp;Baha'u'llah, the sole 
survivor among the towering figures of the new Dispensation.  The 
&amp;Bab--the Fountainhead from whence the vitalizing energies of a newborn 
Revelation had flowed--had Himself, ere the outburst of that 
hurricane, succumbed, in harrowing circumstances, to the volleys of 
a firing squad leaving behind, as titular head of a well-nigh disrupted 
community, a mere figurehead, timid in the extreme, good-natured 
yet susceptible to the slightest influence, devoid of any outstanding 
qualities, who now (loosed from the controlling hand of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
the real Leader) was seeking, in the guise of a dervish, the protection 
afforded by the hills of his native &amp;Mazindaran against the threatened 
assaults of a deadly enemy.  The voluminous writings of the Founder 
of the Faith--in manuscript, dispersed, unclassified, poorly transcribed 
and ill-preserved, were in part, owing to the fever and tumult 
of the times, either deliberately destroyed, confiscated, or hurriedly 
dispatched to places of safety beyond the confines of the land in 
 
+P91 
which they were revealed.  Powerful adversaries, among whom towered 
the figure of the inordinately ambitious and hypocritical &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Karim &amp;Khan, who at the special request of the &amp;Shah had in a 
treatise viciously attacked the new Faith and its doctrines, had now 
raised their heads, and, emboldened by the reverses it had sustained, 
were heaping abuse and calumnies upon it.  Furthermore, under the 
stress of intolerable circumstances, a few of the &amp;Babis were constrained 
to recant their faith, while others went so far as to apostatize 
and join the ranks of the enemy.  And now to the sum of these dire 
misfortunes a monstrous calumny, arising from the outrage perpetrated 
by a handful of irresponsible enthusiasts, was added, branding 
a holy and innocent Faith with an infamy that seemed indelible, and 
which threatened to loosen it from its foundations.  
     And yet the Fire which the Hand of Omnipotence had lighted, 
though smothered by this torrent of tribulations let loose upon it, 
was not quenched.  The flame which for nine years had burned with 
such brilliant intensity was indeed momentarily extinguished, but 
the embers which that great conflagration had left behind still glowed, 
destined, at no distant date, to blaze forth once again, through the 
reviving breezes of an incomparably greater Revelation, and to shed 
an illumination that would not only dissipate the surrounding darkness 
but project its radiance as far as the extremities of both the 
Eastern and Western Hemispheres.  Just as the enforced captivity 
and isolation of the &amp;Bab had, on the one hand, afforded Him the 
opportunity of formulating His doctrine, of unfolding the full implications 
of His Revelation, of formally and publicly declaring His 
station and of establishing His Covenant, and, on the other hand, had 
been instrumental in the proclamation of the laws of His Dispensation 
through the voice of His disciples assembled in &amp;Badasht, so did 
the crisis of unprecedented magnitude, culminating in the execution 
of the &amp;Bab and the imprisonment of &amp;Baha'u'llah, prove to be the 
prelude of a revival which, through the quickening power of a far 
mightier Revelation, was to immortalize the fame, and fix on a still 
more enduring foundation, far beyond the confines of His native 
land, the original Message of the Prophet of &amp;Shiraz.  
     At a time when the Cause of the &amp;Bab seemed to be hovering on 
the brink of extinction, when the hopes and ambitions which animated 
it had, to all human seeming, been frustrated, when the 
colossal sacrifices of its unnumbered lovers appeared to have been 
made in vain, the Divine Promise enshrined within it was about to 
be suddenly redeemed, and its final perfection mysteriously manifested.  
 
+P92 
The &amp;Babi Dispensation was being brought to its close (not 
prematurely but in its own appointed time), and was yielding its 
destined fruit and revealing its ultimate purpose--the birth of the 
Mission of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In this most dark and dreadful hour a New 
Light was about to break in glory on Persia's somber horizon.  As a 
result of what was in fact an evolving, ripening process, the most 
momentous if not the most spectacular stage in the Heroic Age of the 
Faith was now about to open.  
     During nine years, as foretold by the &amp;Bab Himself, swiftly, 
mysteriously and irresistibly the embryonic Faith conceived by Him 
had been developing until, at the fixed hour, the burden of the 
promised Cause of God was cast amidst the gloom and agony of the 
&amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran.  "Behold," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, years later, 
testified, in refutation of the claims of those who had rejected the 
validity of His mission following so closely upon that of the &amp;Bab, 
"how immediately upon the completion of the ninth year of this 
wondrous, this most holy and merciful Dispensation, the requisite 
number of pure, of wholly consecrated and sanctified souls has been 
most secretly consummated."  "That so brief an interval," He, moreover 
has asserted, "should have separated this most mighty and 
wondrous Revelation from Mine own previous Manifestation is a 
secret that no man can unravel, and a mystery such as no mind can 
fathom.  Its duration had been foreordained."  
     St. John the Divine had himself, with reference to these two 
successive Revelations, clearly prophesied:  "The second woe is past; 
and, behold the third woe cometh quickly."  "This third woe," 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, commenting upon this verse, has explained, "is the day 
of the Manifestation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the Day of God, and it is near 
to the day of the appearance of the &amp;Bab."  "All the peoples of the 
world," He moreover has asserted, "are awaiting two Manifestations, 
Who must be contemporaneous; all wait for the fulfillment of this 
promise."  And again:  "The essential fact is that all are promised two 
Manifestations, Who will come one following on the other."  &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i, that luminous star of Divine guidance who had so 
clearly perceived, before the year sixty, the approaching glory of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, and laid stress upon "the twin Revelations which are to 
follow each other in rapid succession," had, on his part, made this 
significant statement regarding the approaching hour of that supreme 
Revelation, in an epistle addressed in his own hand to Siyyid &amp;Kazim:  
"The mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the 
secret of this Message must needs be divulged.  I can say no more.  
 
+P93 
I can appoint no time.  His Cause will be made known after &amp;Hin 
(68)."  
     The circumstances in which the Vehicle of this newborn Revelation, 
following with such swiftness that of the &amp;Bab, received the first 
intimations of His sublime mission recall, and indeed surpass in 
poignancy the soul-shaking experience of Moses when confronted by 
the Burning Bush in the wilderness of Sinai; of Zoroaster when 
awakened to His mission by a succession of seven visions; of Jesus 
when coming out of the waters of the Jordan He saw the heavens 
opened and the Holy Ghost descend like a dove and light upon Him; 
of &amp;Muhammad when in the Cave of Hira, outside of the holy city 
of Mecca, the voice of Gabriel bade Him "cry in the name of Thy 
Lord"; and of the &amp;Bab when in a dream He approached the bleeding 
head of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, and, quaffing the blood that dripped from 
his lacerated throat, awoke to find Himself the chosen recipient of 
the outpouring grace of the Almighty.  
     What, we may well inquire at this juncture, were the nature and 
implications of that Revelation which, manifesting itself so soon after 
the Declaration of the &amp;Bab, abolished, at one stroke, the Dispensation 
which that Faith had so newly proclaimed, and upheld, with such 
vehemence and force, the Divine authority of its Author?  What, we 
may well pause to consider, were the claims of Him Who, Himself 
a disciple of the &amp;Bab, had, at such an early stage, regarded Himself 
as empowered to abrogate the Law identified with His beloved 
Master?  What, we may further reflect, could be the relationship 
between the religious Systems established before Him and His own 
Revelation--a Revelation which, flowing out, in that extremely perilous 
hour, from His travailing soul, pierced the gloom that had settled 
upon that pestilential pit, and, bursting through its walls, and propagating 
itself as far as the ends of the earth, infused into the entire 
body of mankind its boundless potentialities, and is now under our 
very eyes, shaping the course of human society?  
     He Who in such dramatic circumstances was made to sustain the 
overpowering weight of so glorious a Mission was none other than 
the One Whom posterity will acclaim, and Whom innumerable followers 
already recognize, as the Judge, the Lawgiver and Redeemer 
of all mankind, as the Organizer of the entire planet, as the Unifier 
of the children of men, as the Inaugurator of the long-awaited 
millennium, as the Originator of a new "Universal Cycle," as the 
Establisher of the Most Great Peace, as the Fountain of the Most 
Great Justice, as the Proclaimer of the coming of age of the entire 
 
+P94 
human race, as the Creator of a new World Order, and as the Inspirer 
and Founder of a world civilization.  
     To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the 
"Everlasting Father," the "Lord of Hosts" come down "with ten 
thousands of saints"; to Christendom Christ returned "in the glory 
of the Father," to &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam the return of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn; to 
&amp;Sunni &amp;Islam the descent of the "Spirit of God" (Jesus Christ); to the 
Zoroastrians the promised &amp;Shah-Bahram; to the Hindus the reincarnation 
of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha.  
     In the name He bore He combined those of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, 
the most illustrious of the successors of the Apostle of God--the 
brightest "star" shining in the "crown" mentioned in the Revelation 
of St. John--and of the &amp;Imam &amp;Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, 
the second of the two "witnesses" extolled in that same Book.  He 
was formally designated &amp;Baha'u'llah, an appellation specifically recorded 
in the Persian &amp;Bayan, signifying at once the glory, the light 
and the splendor of God, and was styled the "Lord of Lords," the 
"Most Great Name," the "Ancient Beauty," the "Pen of the Most 
High," the "Hidden Name," the "Preserved Treasure," "He Whom 
God will make manifest," the "Most Great Light," the "All-Highest 
Horizon," the "Most Great Ocean," the "Supreme Heaven," the 
"Pre-Existent Root," the "Self-Subsistent," the "Day-Star of the Universe," 
the "Great Announcement," the "Speaker on Sinai," the 
"Sifter of Men," the "Wronged One of the World," the "Desire of 
the Nations," the "Lord of the Covenant," the "Tree beyond which 
there is no passing."  He derived His descent, on the one hand, from 
Abraham (the Father of the Faithful) through his wife Katurah, 
and on the other from Zoroaster, as well as from Yazdigird, the last 
king of the &amp;Sasaniyan dynasty.  He was moreover a descendant of 
Jesse, and belonged, through His father, &amp;Mirza &amp;Abbas, better known 
as &amp;Mirza Buzurg--a nobleman closely associated with the ministerial 
circles of the Court of &amp;Fath-'Ali &amp;Shah--to one of the most ancient 
and renowned families of &amp;Mazindaran.  
     To Him Isaiah, the greatest of the Jewish prophets, had alluded 
as the "Glory of the Lord," the "Everlasting Father," the "Prince of 
Peace," the "Wonderful," the "Counsellor," the "Rod come forth out 
of the stem of Jesse" and the "Branch grown out of His roots," Who 
"shall be established upon the throne of David," Who "will come 
with strong hand," Who "shall judge among the nations," Who 
"shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the 
breath of His lips slay the wicked," and Who "shall assemble the 
 
+P95 
outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from 
the four corners of the earth."  Of Him David had sung in his Psalms, 
acclaiming Him as the "Lord of Hosts" and the "King of Glory."  
To Him Haggai had referred as the "Desire of all nations," and 
Zachariah as the "Branch" Who "shall grow up out of His place," 
and "shall build the Temple of the Lord."  Ezekiel had extolled Him 
as the "Lord" Who "shall be king over all the earth," while to His 
day Joel and Zephaniah had both referred as the "day of Jehovah," 
the latter describing it as "a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, 
a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and 
gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet 
and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers."  
His Day Ezekiel and Daniel had, moreover, both acclaimed as the 
"day of the Lord," and Malachi described as "the great and dreadful 
day of the Lord" when "the Sun of Righteousness" will "arise, with 
healing in His wings," whilst Daniel had pronounced His advent as 
signalizing the end of the "abomination that maketh desolate."  
     To His Dispensation the sacred books of the followers of Zoroaster 
had referred as that in which the sun must needs be brought to a 
standstill for no less than one whole month.  To Him Zoroaster must 
have alluded when, according to tradition, He foretold that a period 
of three thousand years of conflict and contention must needs precede 
the advent of the World-Savior &amp;Shah-Bahram, Who would triumph 
over Ahriman and usher in an era of blessedness and peace.  
     He alone is meant by the prophecy attributed to Gautama Buddha 
Himself, that "a Buddha named Maitreye, the Buddha of universal 
fellowship" should, in the fullness of time, arise and reveal "His 
boundless glory."  To Him the Bhagavad-Gita of the Hindus had 
referred as the "Most Great Spirit," the "Tenth Avatar," the "Immaculate 
Manifestation of Krishna."  
     To Him Jesus Christ had referred as the "Prince of this world," 
as the "Comforter" Who will "reprove the world of sin, and of 
righteousness, and of judgment," as the "Spirit of Truth" Who "will 
guide you into all truth," Who "shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever 
He shall hear, that shall He speak," as the "Lord of the Vineyard," 
and as the "Son of Man" Who "shall come in the glory of His 
Father" "in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory," with 
"all the holy angels" about Him, and "all nations" gathered before 
His throne.  To Him the Author of the Apocalypse had alluded as 
the "Glory of God," as "Alpha and Omega," "the Beginning and the 
End," "the First and the Last."  Identifying His Revelation with 
 
+P96 
the "third woe," he, moreover, had extolled His Law as "a new heaven 
and a new earth," as the "Tabernacle of God," as the "Holy City," 
as the "New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared 
as a bride adorned for her husband."  To His Day Jesus Christ 
Himself had referred as "the regeneration when the Son of Man shall 
sit in the throne of His glory."  To the hour of His advent St. Paul 
had alluded as the hour of the "last trump," the "trump of God," 
whilst St. Peter had spoken of it as the "Day of God, wherein the 
heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt 
with fervent heat."  His Day he, furthermore, had described as "the 
times of refreshing," "the times of restitution of all things, which God 
hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets since the world 
began."  
     To Him &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God, had alluded in His 
Book as the "Great Announcement," and declared His Day to be the 
Day whereon "God" will "come down" "overshadowed with clouds," 
the Day whereon "thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank," 
and "The Spirit shall arise and the angels shall be ranged in order."  
His advent He, in that Book, in a &amp;surih said to have been termed 
by Him "the heart of the &amp;Qur'an," had foreshadowed as that of the 
"third" Messenger, sent down to "strengthen" the two who preceded 
Him.  To His Day He, in the pages of that same Book, had paid a 
glowing tribute, glorifying it as the "Great Day," the "Last Day," 
the "Day of God," the "Day of Judgment," the "Day of Reckoning," 
the "Day of Mutual Deceit," the "Day of Severing," the "Day of 
Sighing," the "Day of Meeting," the Day "when the Decree shall be 
accomplished," the Day whereon the second "Trumpet blast" will be 
sounded, the "Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the 
world," and "all shall come to Him in humble guise," the Day when 
"thou shalt see the mountains, which thou thinkest so firm, pass away 
with the passing of a cloud," the Day "wherein account shall be 
taken," "the approaching Day, when men's hearts shall rise up, 
choking them, into their throats," the Day when "all that are in the 
heavens and all that are on the earth shall be terror-stricken, save 
him whom God pleaseth to deliver," the Day whereon "every suckling 
woman shall forsake her sucking babe, and every woman that hath 
a burden in her womb shall cast her burden," the Day "when the 
earth shall shine with the light of her Lord, and the Book shall be 
set, and the Prophets shall be brought up, and the witnesses; and 
judgment shall be given between them with equity; and none shall 
be wronged."  
 
+P97 
     The plenitude of His glory the Apostle of God had, moreover, 
as attested by &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, compared to the "full moon on its 
fourteenth night."  His station the &amp;Imam &amp;Ali, the Commander of the 
Faithful, had, according to the same testimony, identified with 
"Him Who conversed with Moses from the Burning Bush on Sinai."  
To the transcendent character of His mission the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn 
had, again according to &amp;Baha'u'llah, borne witness as a "Revelation 
whose Revealer will be He Who revealed" the Apostle of God Himself.  
     About Him &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i, the herald of the &amp;Babi Dispensation, 
who had foreshadowed the "strange happenings" that 
would transpire "between the years sixty and sixty-seven," and had 
categorically affirmed the inevitability of His Revelation had, as 
previously mentioned, written the following:  "The Mystery of this 
Cause must needs be made manifest, and the Secret of this Message 
must needs be divulged.  I can say no more, I can appoint no time.  
His Cause will be made known after &amp;Hin (68)" (i.e., after a while).  
     Siyyid &amp;Kazim-i-Rashti, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad's disciple and successor, 
had likewise written:  "The &amp;Qa'im must needs be put to death.  After 
He has been slain the world will have attained the age of eighteen."  
In his &amp;Sharh-i-Qasidiy-i-Lamiyyih he had even alluded to the name 
"&amp;Baha."  Furthermore, to his disciples, as his days drew to a close, 
he had significantly declared:  "Verily, I say, after the &amp;Qa'im the 
&amp;Qayyum will be made manifest.  For when the star of the former has 
set the sun of the beauty of &amp;Husayn will rise and illuminate the whole 
world.  Then will be unfolded in all its glory the `Mystery' and the 
`Secret' spoken of by &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad....  To have attained unto 
that Day of Days is to have attained unto the crowning glory of 
past generations, and one goodly deed performed in that age is equal 
to the pious worship of countless centuries."  
     The &amp;Bab had no less significantly extolled Him as the "Essence of 
Being," as the "Remnant of God," as the "Omnipotent Master," as 
the "Crimson, all-encompassing Light," as "Lord of the visible and 
invisible," as the "sole Object of all previous Revelations, including 
The Revelation of the &amp;Qa'im Himself."  He had formally designated 
Him as "He Whom God shall make manifest," had alluded to Him as 
the "&amp;Abha Horizon" wherein He Himself lived and dwelt, had specifically 
recorded His title, and eulogized His "Order" in His best-known 
work, the Persian &amp;Bayan, had disclosed His name through 
His allusion to the "Son of &amp;Ali, a true and undoubted Leader of 
men," had, repeatedly, orally and in writing, fixed, beyond the 
shadow of a doubt, the time of His Revelation, and warned His 
 
+P98 
followers lest "the &amp;Bayan and all that hath been revealed therein" 
should "shut them out as by a veil" from Him.  He had, moreover, 
declared that He was the "first servant to believe in Him," that He 
bore Him allegiance "before all things were created," that "no allusion" 
of His "could allude unto Him," that "the year-old germ that 
holdeth within itself the potentialities of the Revelation that is to 
come is endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces of 
the whole of the &amp;Bayan."  He had, moreover, clearly asserted that He 
had "covenanted with all created things" concerning Him Whom 
God shall make manifest ere the covenant concerning His own 
mission had been established.  He had readily acknowledged that He 
was but "a letter" of that "Most Mighty Book," "a dew-drop" from 
that "Limitless Ocean," that His Revelation was "only a leaf amongst 
the leaves of His Paradise," that "all that hath been exalted in the 
&amp;Bayan" was but "a ring" upon His own hand, and He Himself 
"a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest," Who, 
"turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever He pleaseth, and through 
whatsoever He pleaseth."  He had unmistakably declared that He had 
"sacrificed" Himself "wholly" for Him, that He had "consented to be 
cursed" for His sake, and to have "yearned for naught but martyrdom" 
in the path of His love.  Finally, He had unequivocally 
prophesied:  "Today the &amp;Bayan is in the stage of seed; at the beginning 
of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest its 
ultimate perfection will become apparent."  "Ere nine will have elapsed 
from the inception of this Cause the realities of the created things will 
not be made manifest.  All that thou hast as yet seen is but the stage 
from the moist-germ until We clothed it with flesh.  Be patient until 
thou beholdest a new creation.  Say:  Blessed, therefore, be God, the 
Most Excellent of Makers!"  
     "He around Whom the Point of the &amp;Bayan (&amp;Bab) hath revolved 
is come" is &amp;Baha'u'llah's confirmatory testimony to the inconceivable 
greatness and preeminent character of His own Revelation.  "If all 
who are in heaven and on earth," He moreover affirms, "be invested 
in this day with the powers and attributes destined for the Letters of 
the &amp;Bayan, whose station is ten thousand times more glorious than 
that of the Letters of the &amp;Qur'anic Dispensation, and if they one and 
all should, swift as the twinkling of an eye, hesitate to recognize My 
Revelation, they shall be accounted, in the sight of God, of those that 
have gone astray, and regarded as `Letters of Negation.'"  "Powerful 
is He, the King of Divine might," He, alluding to Himself in the 
&amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, asserts, "to extinguish with one letter of His wondrous 
 
+P99 
words, the breath of life in the whole of the &amp;Bayan and the people 
thereof, and with one letter bestow upon them a new and everlasting 
life, and cause them to arise and speed out of the sepulchers of their 
vain and selfish desires."  "This," He furthermore declares, "is the king 
of days," the "Day of God Himself," the "Day which shall never be 
followed by night," the "Springtime which autumn will never overtake," 
"the eye to past ages and centuries," for which "the soul of every 
Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted," for which 
"all the divers kindreds of the earth have yearned," through which 
"God hath proved the hearts of the entire company of His Messengers 
and Prophets, and beyond them those that stand guard over His sacred 
and inviolable Sanctuary, the inmates of the Celestial Pavilion and 
dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory."  "In this most mighty Revelation," 
He moreover, states, "all the Dispensations of the past have 
attained their highest, their final consummation."  And again:  "None 
among the Manifestations of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath 
ever completely apprehended the nature of this Revelation."  Referring 
to His own station He declares:  "But for Him no Divine Messenger 
would have been invested with the Robe of Prophethood, nor would 
any of the sacred Scriptures have been revealed."  
     And last but not least is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's own tribute to the transcendent 
character of the Revelation identified with His Father:  
"Centuries, nay ages, must pass away, ere the Day-Star of Truth 
shineth again in its mid-summer splendor, or appeareth once more in 
the radiance of its vernal glory."  "The mere contemplation of the 
Dispensation inaugurated by the Blessed Beauty," He furthermore 
affirms, "would have sufficed to overwhelm the saints of bygone ages--
saints who longed to partake for one moment of its great glory."  
"Concerning the Manifestations that will come down in the future 
`in the shadows of the clouds,' know verily," is His significant statement, 
"that in so far as their relation to the source of their inspiration 
is concerned they are under the shadow of the Ancient Beauty.  In 
their relation, however, to the age in which they appear, each and 
every one of them `doeth whatsoever He willeth.'"  And finally stands 
this, His illuminating explanation, setting forth conclusively the 
true relationship between the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah and that of 
the &amp;Bab:  "The Revelation of the &amp;Bab may be likened to the sun, its 
station corresponding to the first sign of the Zodiac--the sign Aries--
which the sun enters at the vernal equinox.  The station of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Revelation, on the other hand, is represented by the sign Leo, 
the sun's mid-summer and highest station.  By this is meant that this 
 
+P100 
holy Dispensation is illumined with the light of the Sun of Truth 
shining from its most exalted station, and in the plenitude of its 
resplendency, its heat and glory."  
     To attempt an exhaustive survey of the prophetic references to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation would indeed be an impossible task.  To this 
the pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself bears witness:  "All the Divine Books 
and Scriptures have predicted and announced unto men the advent 
of the Most Great Revelation.  None can adequately recount the 
verses recorded in the Books of former ages which forecast this 
supreme Bounty, this most mighty Bestowal."  
     In conclusion of this theme, I feel, it should be stated that the 
Revelation identified with &amp;Baha'u'llah abrogates unconditionally all 
the Dispensations gone before it, upholds uncompromisingly the 
eternal verities they enshrine, recognizes firmly and absolutely the 
Divine origin of their Authors, preserves inviolate the sanctity of 
their authentic Scriptures, disclaims any intention of lowering the 
status of their Founders or of abating the spiritual ideals they inculcate, 
clarifies and correlates their functions, reaffirms their common, 
their unchangeable and fundamental purpose, reconciles their seemingly 
divergent claims and doctrines, readily and gratefully recognizes 
their respective contributions to the gradual unfoldment of one 
Divine Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one 
link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations, supplements 
their teachings with such laws and ordinances as conform to the 
imperative needs, and are dictated by the growing receptivity, of a 
fast evolving and constantly changing society, and proclaims its readiness 
and ability to fuse and incorporate the contending sects and 
factions into which they have fallen into a universal Fellowship, 
functioning within the framework, and in accordance with the precepts, 
of a divinely conceived, a world-unifying, a world-redeeming 
Order.  
     A Revelation, hailed as the promise and crowning glory of past 
ages and centuries, as the consummation of all the Dispensations 
within the Adamic Cycle, inaugurating an era of at least a thousand 
years' duration, and a cycle destined to last no less than five thousand 
centuries, signalizing the end of the Prophetic Era and the beginning 
of the Era of Fulfillment, unsurpassed alike in the duration of its 
Author's ministry and the fecundity and splendor of His mission--
such a Revelation was, as already noted, born amidst the darkness of a 
subterranean dungeon in &amp;Tihran--an abominable pit that had once 
served as a reservoir of water for one of the public baths of the city.  
 
+P101 
Wrapped in its stygian gloom, breathing its fetid air, numbed by its 
humid and icy atmosphere, His feet in stocks, His neck weighed 
down by a mighty chain, surrounded by criminals and miscreants of 
the worst order, oppressed by the consciousness of the terrible blot 
that had stained the fair name of His beloved Faith, painfully aware 
of the dire distress that had overtaken its champions, and of the 
grave dangers that faced the remnant of its followers--at so critical 
an hour and under such appalling circumstances the "Most Great 
Spirit," as designated by Himself, and symbolized in the Zoroastrian, 
the Mosaic, the Christian, and &amp;Muhammadan Dispensations by the 
Sacred Fire, the Burning Bush, the Dove and the Angel Gabriel 
respectively, descended upon, and revealed itself, personated by a 
"Maiden," to the agonized soul of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     "One night in a dream," He Himself, calling to mind, in the 
evening of His life, the first stirrings of God's Revelation within His 
soul, has written, "these exalted words were heard on every side:  
`Verily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy pen.  
Grieve Thou not for that which hath befallen Thee, neither be Thou 
afraid, for Thou art in safety.  Ere long will God raise up the treasures 
of the earth--men who will aid Thee through Thyself and through 
Thy Name, wherewith God hath revived the hearts of such as have 
recognized Him.'"  In another passage He describes, briefly and 
graphically, the impact of the onrushing force of the Divine Summons 
upon His entire being--an experience vividly recalling the 
vision of God that caused Moses to fall in a swoon, and the voice of 
Gabriel which plunged &amp;Muhammad into such consternation that, 
hurrying to the shelter of His home, He bade His wife, &amp;Khadijih, 
envelop Him in His mantle.  "During the days I lay in the prison of 
&amp;Tihran," are His own memorable words, "though the galling weight 
of the chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still 
in those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed 
from the crown of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent 
that precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit of a lofty 
mountain.  Every limb of My body would, as a result, be set afire.  
At such moments My tongue recited what no man could bear to hear."  
     In His &amp;Suratu'l-Haykal (the &amp;Surih of the Temple) He thus 
describes those breathless moments when the Maiden, symbolizing 
the "Most Great Spirit" proclaimed His mission to the entire creation:  
"While engulfed in tribulations I heard a most wondrous, a most sweet 
voice, calling above My head.  Turning My face, I beheld a Maiden--
the embodiment of the remembrance of the name of My Lord--suspended 
 
+P102 
in the air before Me.  So rejoiced was she in her very soul that 
her countenance shone with the ornament of the good-pleasure of 
God, and her cheeks glowed with the brightness of the All-Merciful.  
Betwixt earth and heaven she was raising a call which captivated the 
hearts and minds of men.  She was imparting to both My inward and 
outer being tidings which rejoiced My soul, and the souls of God's 
honored servants.  Pointing with her finger unto My head, she addressed 
all who are in heaven and all who are on earth, saying:  `By 
God!  This is the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and yet ye comprehend 
not.  This is the Beauty of God amongst you, and the power of His 
sovereignty within you, could ye but understand.  This is the Mystery 
of God and His Treasure, the Cause of God and His glory unto all 
who are in the kingdoms of Revelation and of creation, if ye be of 
them that perceive.'"  
     In His Epistle to &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, His royal adversary, revealed 
at the height of the proclamation of His Message, occur these passages 
which shed further light on the Divine origin of His mission:  
"O King!  I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when 
lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught 
Me the knowledge of all that hath been.  This thing is not from Me, 
but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing.  And he bade Me 
lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell 
Me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to 
flow....  This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of Thy Lord, 
the Almighty, the All-Praised, have stirred....  His all-compelling 
summons hath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst 
all people.  I was indeed as one dead when His behest was uttered.  
The hand of the will of Thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful, 
transformed Me."  "By My Life!"  He asserts in another Tablet, "Not 
of Mine own volition have I revealed Myself, but God, of His own 
choosing, hath manifested Me."  And again:  "Whenever I chose to 
hold My peace and be still, lo, the Voice of the Holy Spirit, standing 
on My right hand, aroused Me, and the Most Great Spirit appeared 
before My face, and Gabriel overshadowed Me, and the Spirit of Glory 
stirred within My bosom, bidding Me arise and break My silence."  
     Such were the circumstances in which the Sun of Truth arose in 
the city of &amp;Tihran--a city which, by reason of so rare a privilege 
conferred upon it, had been glorified by the &amp;Bab as the "Holy Land," 
and surnamed by &amp;Baha'u'llah "the Mother of the world," the "Day-spring 
of Light," the "Dawning-Place of the signs of the Lord," the 
"Source of the joy of all mankind."  The first dawnings of that Light 
 
+P103 
of peerless splendor had, as already described, broken in the city of 
&amp;Shiraz.  The rim of that Orb had now appeared above the horizon 
of the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran.  Its rays were to burst forth, a decade 
later, in &amp;Baghdad, piercing the clouds which immediately after its 
rise in those somber surroundings obscured its splendor.  It was destined 
to mount to its zenith in the far-away city of Adrianople, and ultimately 
to set in the immediate vicinity of the fortress-town of &amp;Akka.  
     The process whereby the effulgence of so dazzling a Revelation 
was unfolded to the eyes of men was of necessity slow and gradual.  
The first intimation which its Bearer received did not synchronize 
with, nor was it followed immediately by, a disclosure of its character 
to either His own companions or His kindred.  A period of no less 
than ten years had to elapse ere its far-reaching implications could be 
directly divulged to even those who had been intimately associated 
with Him--a period of great spiritual ferment, during which the 
Recipient of so weighty a Message restlessly anticipated the hour at 
which He could unburden His heavily laden soul, so replete with 
the potent energies released by God's nascent Revelation.  All He did, 
in the course of this pre-ordained interval, was to hint, in veiled and 
allegorical language, in epistles, commentaries, prayers and treatises, 
which He was moved to reveal, that the &amp;Bab's promise had already 
been fulfilled, and that He Himself was the One Who had been 
chosen to redeem it.  A few of His fellow-disciples, distinguished by 
their sagacity, and their personal attachment and devotion to Him, 
perceived the radiance of the as yet unrevealed glory that had flooded 
His soul, and would have, but for His restraining influence, divulged 
His secret and proclaimed it far and wide.  
 
+P104 
                                 CHAPTER VII 
                      &amp;Baha'u'llah's Banishment to &amp;Iraq 
 
     The attempt on the life of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, as stated in a 
previous chapter, was made on the 28th of the month of &amp;Shavval, 
1268 A.H., corresponding to the 15th of August, 1852.  Immediately 
after, &amp;Baha'u'llah was arrested in &amp;Niyavaran, was conducted 
with the greatest ignominy to &amp;Tihran and cast into the &amp;Siyah-Chal.  
His imprisonment lasted for a period of no less than four months, 
in the middle of which the "year nine" (1269), anticipated in such 
glowing terms by the &amp;Bab, and alluded to as the year "after &amp;Hin" by 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i, was ushered in, endowing with undreamt-of 
potentialities the whole world.  Two months after that year was born, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, the purpose of His imprisonment now accomplished, was 
released from His confinement, and set out, a month later, for 
&amp;Baghdad, on the first stage of a memorable and life-long exile which 
was to carry Him, in the course of years, as far as Adrianople in 
European Turkey, and which was to end with His twenty-four years' 
incarceration in &amp;Akka.  
     Now that He had been invested, in consequence of that potent 
dream, with the power and sovereign authority associated with His 
Divine mission, His deliverance from a confinement that had achieved 
its purpose, and which if prolonged would have completely fettered 
Him in the exercise of His newly-bestowed functions, became not 
only inevitable, but imperative and urgent.  Nor were the means and 
instruments lacking whereby his emancipation from the shackles that 
restrained Him could be effected.  The persistent and decisive intervention 
of the Russian Minister, Prince Dolgorouki, who left no 
stone unturned to establish the innocence of &amp;Baha'u'llah; the public 
confession of &amp;Mulla &amp;Shaykh &amp;Aliy-i-Turshizi, surnamed &amp;Azim, who, 
in the &amp;Siyah-Chal, in the presence of the &amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih and the 
Russian Minister's interpreter and of the government's representative, 
emphatically exonerated Him, and acknowledged his own complicity; 
the indisputable testimony established by competent tribunals; 
the unrelaxing efforts exerted by His own brothers, sisters and 
kindred,--all these combined to effect His ultimate deliverance from 
the hands of His rapacious enemies.  Another potent if less evident 
 
+P105 
influence which must be acknowledged as having had a share in His 
liberation was the fate suffered by so large a number of His self-sacrificing 
fellow-disciples who languished with Him in that same 
prison.  For, as &amp;Nabil truly remarks, "the blood, shed in the course 
of that fateful year in &amp;Tihran by that heroic band with whom 
&amp;Baha'u'llah had been imprisoned, was the ransom paid for His deliverance 
from the hand of a foe that sought to prevent Him from 
achieving the purpose for which God had destined Him."  
     With such overwhelming testimonies establishing beyond the 
shadow of a doubt the non-complicity of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the Grand Vizir, 
after having secured the reluctant consent of his sovereign to set free 
his Captive, was now in a position to dispatch his trusted representative, 
&amp;Haji &amp;Ali, to the &amp;Siyah-Chal, instructing him to deliver 
to &amp;Baha'u'llah the order for His release.  The sight which that emissary 
beheld upon his arrival evoked in him such anger that he cursed his 
master for the shameful treatment of a man of such high position 
and stainless renown.  Removing his mantle from his shoulders he 
presented it to &amp;Baha'u'llah, entreating Him to wear it when in the 
presence of the Minister and his counsellors, a request which He 
emphatically refused, preferring to appear, attired in the garb of a 
prisoner, before the members of the Imperial government.  
     No sooner had He presented Himself before them than the Grand 
Vizir addressed Him saying:  "Had you chosen to take my advice, 
and had you dissociated yourself from the Faith of the &amp;Siyyid-i-Bab, 
you would never have suffered the pains and indignities that have 
been heaped upon you."  "Had you, in your turn," &amp;Baha'u'llah retorted, 
"followed My counsels, the affairs of the government would 
not have reached so critical a stage."  &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Khan was thereupon 
reminded of the conversation he had had with Him on the occasion 
of the &amp;Bab's martyrdom, when he had been warned that "the flame 
that has been kindled will blaze forth more fiercely than ever."  "What 
is it that you advise me now to do?" he inquired from &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
"Command the governors of the realm," was the instant reply, "to 
cease shedding the blood of the innocent, to cease plundering their 
property, to cease dishonoring their women, and injuring their 
children."  That same day the Grand Vizir acted on the advice thus 
given him; but any effect it had, as the course of subsequent events 
amply demonstrated, proved to be momentary and negligible.  
     The relative peace and tranquillity accorded &amp;Baha'u'llah after His 
tragic and cruel imprisonment was destined, by the dictates of an 
unerring Wisdom, to be of an extremely short duration.  He had 
 
+P106 
hardly rejoined His family and kindred when a decree from &amp;Nasiri'd-Din 
&amp;Shah was communicated to Him, bidding Him leave the territory 
of Persia, fixing a time-limit of one month for His departure 
and allowing Him the right to choose the land of His exile.  
     The Russian Minister, as soon as he was informed of the Imperial 
decision, expressed the desire to take &amp;Baha'u'llah under the protection 
of his government, and offered to extend every facility for His removal 
to Russia.  This invitation, so spontaneously extended, &amp;Baha'u'llah declined, 
preferring, in pursuance of an unerring instinct, to establish 
His abode in Turkish territory, in the city of &amp;Baghdad.  "Whilst I 
lay chained and fettered in the prison," He Himself, years after, 
testified in His Epistle addressed to the Czar of Russia, Nicolaevitch 
Alexander II, "one of thy ministers extended Me his aid.  Whereupon 
God hath ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none 
can comprehend except His knowledge.  Beware lest thou barter away 
this sublime station."  "In the days," is yet another illuminating testimony 
revealed by His pen, "when this Wronged One was sore-afflicted 
in prison, the minister of the highly esteemed government 
(of Russia)--may God, glorified and exalted be He, assist him!--
exerted his utmost endeavor to compass My deliverance.  Several times 
permission for My release was granted.  Some of the &amp;ulamas of the 
city, however, would prevent it.  Finally, My freedom was gained 
through the solicitude and the endeavor of His Excellency the Minister.  
...His Imperial Majesty, the Most Great Emperor--may God, 
exalted and glorified be He, assist him!--extended to Me for the sake 
of God his protection--a protection which has excited the envy and 
enmity of the foolish ones of the earth."  
     The &amp;Shah's edict, equivalent to an order for the immediate expulsion 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah from Persian territory, opens a new and glorious 
chapter in the history of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  Viewed in its 
proper perspective it will be even recognized to have ushered in one 
of the most eventful and momentous epochs in the world's religious 
history.  It coincides with the inauguration of a ministry extending over 
a period of almost forty years--a ministry which, by virtue of its creative 
power, its cleansing force, its healing influences, and the irresistible 
operation of the world-directing, world-shaping forces it released, 
stands unparalleled in the religious annals of the entire human race.  
It marks the opening phase in a series of banishments, ranging over a 
period of four decades, and terminating only with the death of Him 
Who was the Object of that cruel edict.  The process which it set in 
motion, gradually progressing and unfolding, began by establishing 
 
+P107 
His Cause for a time in the very midst of the jealously-guarded stronghold 
of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, and brought Him in personal contact with its 
highest and most illustrious exponents; then, at a later stage, it confronted 
Him, at the seat of the Caliphate, with the civil and 
ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm and the representatives of the 
&amp;Sultan of Turkey, the most powerful potentate in the Islamic world; 
and finally carried Him as far as the shores of the Holy Land, thereby 
fulfilling the prophecies recorded in both the Old and the New Testaments, 
redeeming the pledge enshrined in various traditions attributed 
to the Apostle of God and the &amp;Imams who succeeded Him, and 
ushering in the long-awaited restoration of Israel to the ancient cradle 
of its Faith.  With it, may be said to have begun the last and most 
fruitful of the four stages of a life, the first twenty-seven years of 
which were characterized by the care-free enjoyment of all the 
advantages conferred by high birth and riches, and by an unfailing 
solicitude for the interests of the poor, the sick and the down-trodden; 
followed by nine years of active and exemplary discipleship in the 
service of the &amp;Bab; and finally by an imprisonment of four months' 
duration, overshadowed throughout by mortal peril, embittered by 
agonizing sorrows, and immortalized, as it drew to a close, by the 
sudden eruption of the forces released by an overpowering, soul-revolutionizing 
Revelation.  
     This enforced and hurried departure of &amp;Baha'u'llah from His 
native land, accompanied by some of His relatives, recalls in some of 
its aspects, the precipitate flight of the Holy Family into Egypt; the 
sudden migration of &amp;Muhammad, soon after His assumption of the 
prophetic office, from Mecca to Medina; the exodus of Moses, His 
brother and His followers from the land of their birth, in response 
to the Divine summons, and above all the banishment of Abraham 
from Ur of the Chaldees to the Promised Land--a banishment which, 
in the multitudinous benefits it conferred upon so many divers 
peoples, faiths and nations, constitutes the nearest historical approach 
to the incalculable blessings destined to be vouchsafed, in this day, 
and in future ages, to the whole human race, in direct consequence 
of the exile suffered by Him Whose Cause is the flower and fruit of 
all previous Revelations.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, after enumerating in His "Some Answered Questions" 
the far-reaching consequences of Abraham's banishment, 
significantly affirms that "since the exile of Abraham from Ur to 
Aleppo in Syria produced this result, we must consider what will be 
the effect of the exile of &amp;Baha'u'llah in His several removes from 
 
+P108 
&amp;Tihran to &amp;Baghdad, from thence to Constantinople, to Rumelia and 
to the Holy Land."  
     On the first day of the month of &amp;Rabi'u'th-Thani, of the year 
1269 A.H., (January 12, 1853), nine months after His return from 
&amp;Karbila, &amp;Baha'u'llah, together with some of the members of His 
family, and escorted by an officer of the Imperial body-guard and 
an official representing the Russian Legation, set out on His three 
months' journey to &amp;Baghdad.  Among those who shared His exile 
was His wife, the saintly &amp;Navvab, entitled by Him the "Most Exalted 
Leaf," who, during almost forty years, continued to evince a fortitude, 
a piety, a devotion and a nobility of soul which earned her 
from the pen of her Lord the posthumous and unrivalled tribute of 
having been made His "perpetual consort in all the worlds of God."  His 
nine-year-old son, later surnamed the "Most Great Branch," destined 
to become the Center of His Covenant and authorized Interpreter 
of His teachings, together with His seven-year-old sister, known in 
later years by the same title as that of her illustrious mother, and 
whose services until the ripe old age of four score years and six, no 
less than her exalted parentage, entitle her to the distinction of ranking 
as the outstanding heroine of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, were also 
included among the exiles who were now bidding their last farewell 
to their native country.  Of the two brothers who accompanied Him 
on that journey the first was &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, commonly called &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, 
His staunch and valued supporter, the ablest and most distinguished 
among His brothers and sisters, and one of the "only two 
persons who," according to &amp;Baha'u'llah's testimony, "were adequately 
informed of the origins" of His Faith.  The other was &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli, 
a half-brother, who, in spite of the defection of some 
of his relatives, remained to the end loyal to the Cause he had 
espoused.  
     The journey, undertaken in the depth of an exceptionally severe 
winter, carrying the little band of exiles, so inadequately equipped, 
across the snow-bound mountains of Western Persia, though long 
and perilous, was uneventful except for the warm and enthusiastic 
reception accorded the travelers during their brief stay in Karand by 
its governor &amp;Hayat-Quli &amp;Khan, of the &amp;Alliyu'llahi sect.  He was 
shown, in return, such kindness by &amp;Baha'u'llah that the people of the 
entire village were affected, and continued, long after, to extend such 
hospitality to His followers on their way to &amp;Baghdad that they 
gained the reputation of being known as &amp;Babis.  
     In a prayer revealed by Him at that time, &amp;Baha'u'llah, expatiating 
 
+P109 
upon the woes and trials He had endured in the &amp;Siyah-Chal, thus 
bears witness to the hardships undergone in the course of that "terrible 
journey":  "My God, My Master, My Desire!...  Thou hast created 
this atom of dust through the consummate power of Thy might, 
and nurtured Him with Thine hands which none can chain up....  
Thou hast destined for Him trials and tribulations which no tongue 
can describe, nor any of Thy Tablets adequately recount.  The throat 
Thou didst accustom to the touch of silk Thou hast, in the end, 
clasped with strong chains, and the body Thou didst ease with 
brocades and velvets Thou hast at last subjected to the abasement of 
a dungeon.  Thy decree hath shackled Me with unnumbered fetters, 
and cast about My neck chains that none can sunder.  A number of 
years have passed during which afflictions have, like showers of mercy, 
rained upon Me....  How many the nights during which the weight 
of chains and fetters allowed Me no rest, and how numerous the days 
during which peace and tranquillity were denied Me, by reason of 
that wherewith the hands and tongues of men have afflicted Me!  
Both bread and water which Thou hast, through Thy all-embracing 
mercy, allowed unto the beasts of the field, they have, for a time, 
forbidden unto this servant, and the things they refused to inflict 
upon such as have seceded from Thy Cause, the same have they 
suffered to be inflicted upon Me, until, finally, Thy decree was irrevocably 
fixed, and Thy behest summoned this servant to depart out 
of Persia, accompanied by a number of frail-bodied men and children 
of tender age, at this time when the cold is so intense that one cannot 
even speak, and ice and snow so abundant that it is impossible to 
move."  
     Finally, on the 28th of &amp;Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1269 A.H. (April 8, 
1853), &amp;Baha'u'llah arrived in &amp;Baghdad, the capital city of what was 
then the Turkish province of &amp;Iraq.  From there He proceeded, a 
few days after, to &amp;Kazimayn, about three miles north of the city, a 
town inhabited chiefly by Persians, and where the two &amp;Kazims, the 
seventh and the ninth &amp;Imams, are buried.  Soon after His arrival 
the representative of the &amp;Shah's government, stationed in &amp;Baghdad, 
called on Him, and suggested that it would be advisable for Him, in 
view of the many visitors crowding that center of pilgrimage, to 
establish His residence in Old &amp;Baghdad, a suggestion with which He 
readily concurred.  A month later, towards the end of Rajab, He 
rented the house of &amp;Haji &amp;Ali Madad, in an old quarter of the city, 
into which He moved with His family.  
     In that city, described in Islamic traditions as "&amp;Zahru'l-Kufih," 
 
+P110 
designated for centuries as the "Abode of Peace," and immortalized 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah as the "City of God," He, except for His two year 
retirement to the mountains of &amp;Kurdistan and His occasional visits 
to Najaf, &amp;Karbila and &amp;Kazimayn, continued to reside until His banishment 
to Constantinople.  To that city the &amp;Qur'an had alluded as 
the "Abode of Peace" to which God Himself "calleth."  To it, in 
that same Book, further allusion had been made in the verse "For 
them is a Dwelling of Peace with their Lord ... on the Day whereon 
God shall gather them all together."  From it radiated, wave after 
wave, a power, a radiance and a glory which insensibly reanimated 
a languishing Faith, sorely-stricken, sinking into obscurity, threatened 
with oblivion.  From it were diffused, day and night, and with 
ever-increasing energy, the first emanations of a Revelation which, 
in its scope, its copiousness, its driving force and the volume and 
variety of its literature, was destined to excel that of the &amp;Bab Himself.  
Above its horizon burst forth the rays of the Sun of Truth, Whose 
rising glory had for ten long years been overshadowed by the inky 
clouds of a consuming hatred, an ineradicable jealousy, an unrelenting 
malice.  In it the Tabernacle of the promised "Lord of Hosts" 
was first erected, and the foundations of the long-awaited Kingdom 
of the "Father" unassailably established.  Out of it went forth the 
earliest tidings of the Message of Salvation which, as prophesied by 
Daniel, was to mark, after the lapse of "a thousand two hundred 
and ninety days" (1290 A.H.), the end of "the abomination that 
maketh desolate."  Within its walls the "Most Great House of God," 
His "Footstool" and the "Throne of His Glory," "the Cynosure of 
an adoring world," the "Lamp of Salvation between earth and 
heaven," the "Sign of His remembrance to all who are in heaven and 
on earth," enshrining the "Jewel whose glory hath irradiated all creation," 
the "Standard" of His Kingdom, the "Shrine round which will 
circle the concourse of the faithful" was irrevocably founded and 
permanently consecrated.  Upon it, by virtue of its sanctity as 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's "Most Holy Habitation" and "Seat of His transcendent 
glory," was conferred the honor of being regarded as a center of 
pilgrimage second to none except the city of &amp;Akka, His "Most Great 
Prison," in whose immediate vicinity His holy Sepulcher, the Qiblih 
of the &amp;Baha'i world, is enshrined.  Around the heavenly Table, spread 
in its very heart, clergy and laity, &amp;Sunnis and &amp;Shi'ahs, Kurds, Arabs, 
and Persians, princes and nobles, peasants and dervishes, gathered 
in increasing numbers from far and near, all partaking, according to 
their needs and capacities, of a measure of that Divine sustenance 
 
+P111 
which was to enable them, in the course of time, to noise abroad the 
fame of that bountiful Giver, swell the ranks of His admirers, scatter 
far and wide His writings, enlarge the limits of His congregation, 
and lay a firm foundation for the future erection of the institutions 
of His Faith.  And finally, before the gaze of the diversified communities 
that dwelt within its gates, the first phase in the gradual 
unfoldment of a newborn Revelation was ushered in, the first effusions 
from the inspired pen of its Author were recorded, the first 
principles of His slowly crystallizing doctrine were formulated, the 
first implications of His august station were apprehended, the first 
attacks aiming at the disruption of His Faith from within were 
launched, the first victories over its internal enemies were registered, 
and the first pilgrimages to the Door of His Presence were undertaken.  
     This life-long exile to which the Bearer of so precious a Message 
was now providentially condemned did not, and indeed could not, 
manifest, either suddenly or rapidly, the potentialities latent within 
it.  The process whereby its unsuspected benefits were to be manifested 
to the eyes of men was slow, painfully slow, and was characterized, 
as indeed the history of His Faith from its inception to the 
present day demonstrates, by a number of crises which at times 
threatened to arrest its unfoldment and blast all the hopes which its 
progress had engendered.  
     One such crisis which, as it deepened, threatened to jeopardize 
His newborn Faith and to subvert its earliest foundations, overshadowed 
the first years of His sojourn in &amp;Iraq, the initial stage in 
His life-long exile, and imparted to them a special significance.  
Unlike those which preceded it, this crisis was purely internal in 
character, and was occasioned solely by the acts, the ambitions and 
follies of those who were numbered among His recognized fellow-disciples.  
     The external enemies of the Faith, whether civil or ecclesiastical, 
who had thus far been chiefly responsible for the reverses and humiliations 
it had suffered, were by now relatively quiescent.  The public 
appetite for revenge, which had seemed insatiable, had now, to some 
extent, in consequence of the torrents of blood that had flowed, 
abated.  A feeling, bordering on exhaustion and despair, had, moreover, 
settled on some of its most inveterate enemies, who were astute 
enough to perceive that though the Faith had bent beneath the 
grievous blows their hands had dealt it, its structure had remained 
essentially unimpaired and its spirit unbroken.  The orders issued to 
the governors of the provinces by the Grand Vizir had had, furthermore, 
 
+P112 
a sobering effect on the local authorities, who were now dissuaded 
from venting their fury upon, and from indulging in their 
sadistic cruelties against, a hated adversary.  
     A lull had, in consequence, momentarily ensued, which was destined 
to be broken, at a later stage, by a further wave of repressive 
measures in which the &amp;Sultan of Turkey and his ministers, as well 
as the &amp;Sunni sacerdotal order, were to join hands with the &amp;Shah and 
the &amp;Shi'ah clericals of Persia and &amp;Iraq in an endeavor to stamp out, 
once and for all, the Faith and all it stood for.  While this lull persisted 
the initial manifestations of the internal crisis, already mentioned, 
were beginning to reveal themselves--a crisis which, though 
less spectacular in the public eye, proved itself, as it moved to its 
climax, to be one of unprecedented gravity, reducing the numerical 
strength of the infant community, imperiling its unity, causing 
immense damage to its prestige, and tarnishing for a considerable 
period of time its glory.  
     This crisis had already been brewing in the days immediately 
following the execution of the &amp;Bab, was intensified during the months 
when the controlling hand of &amp;Baha'u'llah was suddenly withdrawn 
as a result of His confinement in the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran, was 
further aggravated by His precipitate banishment from Persia, and 
began to protrude its disturbing features during the first years of 
His sojourn in &amp;Baghdad.  Its devastating force gathered momentum 
during His two year retirement to the mountains of &amp;Kurdistan, and 
though it was checked, for a time, after His return from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, 
under the overmastering influences exerted preparatory 
to the Declaration of His Mission, it broke out later, with still greater 
violence, and reached its climax in Adrianople, only to receive finally 
its death-blow under the impact of the irresistible forces released 
through the proclamation of that Mission to all mankind.  
     Its central figure was no less a person than the nominee of the 
&amp;Bab Himself, the credulous and cowardly &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, to certain 
traits of whose character reference has already been made in the foregoing 
pages.  The black-hearted scoundrel who befooled and manipulated 
this vain and flaccid man with consummate skill and unyielding 
persistence was a certain Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, a native of &amp;Isfahan, 
notorious for his inordinate ambition, his blind obstinacy and uncontrollable 
jealousy.  To him &amp;Baha'u'llah had later referred in the 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas as the one who had "led astray" &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, and 
stigmatized him, in one of His Tablets, as the "source of envy and 
the quintessence of mischief," while &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had described the 
 
+P113 
relationship existing between these two as that of "the sucking child" 
to the "much-prized breast" of its mother.  Forced to abandon his 
studies in the &amp;madrisiyi-i-Sadr of &amp;Isfahan, this Siyyid had migrated, 
in shame and remorse, to &amp;Karbila, had there joined the ranks of the 
&amp;Bab's followers, and shown, after His martyrdom, signs of vacillation 
which exposed the shallowness of his faith and the fundamental 
weakness of his convictions.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's first visit to &amp;Karbila and 
the marks of undisguised reverence, love and admiration shown Him 
by some of the most distinguished among the former disciples and 
companions of Siyyid &amp;Kazim, had aroused in this calculating and 
unscrupulous schemer an envy, and bred in his soul an animosity, 
which the forbearance and patience shown him by &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
served only to inflame.  His deluded helpers, willing tools of his 
diabolical designs, were the not inconsiderable number of &amp;Babis who, 
baffled, disillusioned and leaderless, were already predisposed to be 
beguiled by him into pursuing a path diametrically opposed to the 
tenets and counsels of a departed Leader.  
     For, with the &amp;Bab no longer in the midst of His followers; with 
His nominee, either seeking a safe hiding place in the mountains of 
&amp;Mazindaran, or wearing the disguise of a dervish or of an Arab 
wandering from town to town; with &amp;Baha'u'llah imprisoned and 
subsequently banished beyond the limits of His native country; with 
the flower of the Faith mown down in a seemingly unending series 
of slaughters, the remnants of that persecuted community were sunk 
in a distress that appalled and paralyzed them, that stifled their spirit, 
confused their minds and strained to the utmost their loyalty.  Reduced 
to this extremity they could no longer rely on any voice that 
commanded sufficient authority to still their forebodings, resolve their 
problems, or prescribe to them their duties and obligations.  
     &amp;Nabil, traveling at that time through the province of &amp;Khurasan, 
the scene of the tumultuous early victories of a rising Faith, had 
himself summed up his impressions of the prevailing condition.  "The 
fire of the Cause of God," he testifies in his narrative, "had been well-nigh 
quenched in every place.  I could detect no trace of warmth 
anywhere."  In &amp;Qasvin, according to the same testimony, the remnant 
of the community had split into four factions, bitterly opposed to 
one another, and a prey to the most absurd doctrines and fancies.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah upon His arrival in &amp;Baghdad, a city which had witnessed 
the glowing evidences of the indefatigable zeal of &amp;Tahirih, found 
among His countrymen residing in that city no more than a single 
&amp;Babi, while in &amp;Kazimayn inhabited chiefly by Persians, a mere handful 
 
+P114 
of His compatriots remained who still professed, in fear and obscurity, 
their faith in the &amp;Bab.  
     The morals of the members of this dwindling community, no 
less than their numbers, had sharply declined.  Such was their "waywardness 
and folly," to quote &amp;Baha'u'llah's own words, that upon His 
release from prison, His first decision was "to arise ... and undertake, 
with the utmost vigor, the task of regenerating this people."  
     As the character of the professed adherents of the &amp;Bab declined 
and as proofs of the deepening confusion that afflicted them multiplied, 
the mischief-makers, who were lying in wait, and whose sole 
aim was to exploit the progressive deterioration in the situation for 
their own benefit, grew ever more and more audacious.  The conduct 
of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, who claimed to be the successor of the &amp;Bab, and 
who prided himself on his high sounding titles of &amp;Mir'atu'l-Azaliyyih 
(Everlasting Mirror), of &amp;Subh-i-Azal (Morning of Eternity), and 
of Ismu'l-Azal (Name of Eternity), and particularly the machinations 
of Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, exalted by him to the rank of the first 
among the "Witnesses" of the &amp;Bayan, were by now assuming such a 
character that the prestige of the Faith was becoming directly involved, 
and its future security seriously imperiled.  
     The former had, after the execution of the &amp;Bab, sustained such 
a violent shock that his faith almost forsook him.  Wandering for a 
time, in the guise of a dervish, in the mountains of &amp;Mazindaran, he, 
by his behavior, had so severely tested the loyalty of his fellow-believers 
in &amp;Nur, most of whom had been converted through the 
indefatigable zeal of &amp;Baha'u'llah, that they too wavered in their convictions, 
some of them going so far as to throw in their lot with the 
enemy.  He subsequently proceeded to &amp;Rasht, and remained concealed 
in the province of &amp;Gilan until his departure for &amp;Kirmanshah, where 
in order the better to screen himself he entered the service of a 
certain &amp;Abdu'llah-i-Qasvini, a maker of shrouds, and became a 
vendor of his goods.  He was still there when &amp;Baha'u'llah passed 
through that city on His way to &amp;Baghdad, and expressing a desire 
to live in close proximity to &amp;Baha'u'llah but in a house by himself 
where he could ply some trade incognito, he succeeded in obtaining 
from Him a sum of money with which he purchased several bales 
of cotton and then proceeded, in the garb of an Arab, by way of 
&amp;Mandalij to &amp;Baghdad.  He established himself there in the street 
of the Charcoal Dealers, situated in a dilapidated quarter of the city, 
and placing a turban upon his head, and assuming the name of 
&amp;Haji &amp;Aliy-i-Las-Furush, embarked on his newly-chosen occupation.  
 
+P115 
Siyyid &amp;Muhammad had meanwhile settled in &amp;Karbila, and was busily 
engaged, with &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya as his lever, in kindling dissensions and 
in deranging the life of the exiles and of the community that had 
gathered about them.  
     Little wonder that from the pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah, Who was as yet 
unable to divulge the Secret that stirred within His bosom, these 
words of warning, of counsel and of assurance should, at a time when 
the shadows were beginning to deepen around Him, have proceeded:  
"The days of tests are now come.  Oceans of dissension and tribulation 
are surging, and the Banners of Doubt are, in every nook and 
corner, occupied in stirring up mischief and in leading men to perdition.  
...Suffer not the voice of some of the soldiers of negation 
to cast doubt into your midst, neither allow yourselves to become 
heedless of Him Who is the Truth, inasmuch as in every Dispensation 
such contentions have been raised.  God, however, will establish His 
Faith, and manifest His light albeit the stirrers of sedition abhor it.  
...Watch ye every day for the Cause of God....  All are held 
captive in His grasp.  No place is there for any one to flee to.  Think 
not the Cause of God to be a thing lightly taken, in which any one 
can gratify his whims.  In various quarters a number of souls have, 
at the present time, advanced this same claim.  The time is approaching 
when ... every one of them will have perished and been lost, 
nay will have come to naught and become a thing unremembered, 
even as the dust itself."  
     To &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, "the first to believe" in Him, designated later 
as &amp;Khadimu'-llah (Servant of God)--a &amp;Babi youth, aflame with 
devotion, who, under the influence of a dream he had of the &amp;Bab, and 
as a result of the perusal of certain writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, had 
precipitately forsaken his home in &amp;Kashan and traveled to &amp;Iraq, in 
the hope of attaining His presence, and who from then on served 
Him assiduously for a period of forty years in his triple function of 
amanuensis, companion and attendant--to him &amp;Baha'u'llah, more 
than to any one else, was moved to disclose, at this critical juncture, 
a glimpse of the as yet unrevealed glory of His station.  This same 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, recounting to &amp;Nabil his experiences, on that first 
and never to be forgotten night spent in &amp;Karbila, in the presence of 
his newly-found Beloved, Who was then a guest of &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Hasan-i-Hakim-Bashi, had given the following testimony:  "As it 
was summer-time &amp;Baha'u'llah was in the habit of passing His evenings 
and of sleeping on the roof of the House....  That night, when 
He had gone to sleep, I, according to His directions, lay down for 
 
+P116 
a brief rest, at a distance of a few feet from Him.  No sooner had 
I risen, and ... started to offer my prayers, in a corner of the roof 
which adjoined a wall, than I beheld His blessed Person rise and 
walk towards me.  When He reached me He said:  `You, too, are 
awake.'  Whereupon He began to chant and pace back and forth.  
How shall I ever describe that voice and the verses it intoned, and 
His gait, as He strode before me!  Methinks, with every step He took 
and every word He uttered thousands of oceans of light surged 
before my face, and thousands of worlds of incomparable splendor 
were unveiled to my eyes, and thousands of suns blazed their light 
upon me!  In the moonlight that streamed upon Him, He thus continued 
to walk and to chant.  Every time He approached me He 
would pause, and, in a tone so wondrous that no tongue can describe 
it, would say:  `Hear Me, My son.  By God, the True One!  This 
Cause will assuredly be made manifest.  Heed thou not the idle talk 
of the people of the &amp;Bayan, who pervert the meaning of every word.'  
In this manner He continued to walk and chant, and to address me 
these words until the first streaks of dawn appeared....  Afterwards 
I removed His bedding to His room, and, having prepared His tea 
for Him, was dismissed from His presence."  
     The confidence instilled in &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan by this unexpected 
and sudden contact with the spirit and directing genius of a new-born 
Revelation stirred his soul to its depths--a soul already afire 
with a consuming love born of his recognition of the ascendancy 
which his newly-found Master had already achieved over His fellow-disciples 
in both &amp;Iraq and Persia.  This intense adoration that informed 
his whole being, and which could neither be suppressed nor 
concealed, was instantly detected by both &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and his 
fellow-conspirator Siyyid &amp;Muhammad.  The circumstances leading 
to the revelation of the Tablet of &amp;Kullu't-Ta'am, written during that 
period, at the request of &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Kamalu'd-Din-i-Naraqi, a 
&amp;Babi of honorable rank and high culture, could not but aggravate 
a situation that had already become serious and menacing.  Impelled 
by a desire to receive illumination from &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya concerning 
the meaning of the &amp;Qur'anic verse "All food was allowed to the 
children of Israel," &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Kamalu'd-Din had requested him to 
write a commentary upon it--a request which was granted, but 
with reluctance and in a manner which showed such incompetence 
and superficiality as to disillusion &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Kamalu'd-Din, and 
to destroy his confidence in its author.  Turning to &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
repeating his request, he was honored by a Tablet, in which Israel 
 
+P117 
and his children were identified with the &amp;Bab and His followers 
respectively--a Tablet which by reason of the allusions it contained, 
the beauty of its language and the cogency of its argument, so enraptured 
the soul of its recipient that he would have, but for the restraining 
hand of &amp;Baha'u'llah, proclaimed forthwith his discovery of God's 
hidden Secret in the person of the One Who had revealed it.  
     To these evidences of an ever deepening veneration for &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and of a passionate attachment to His person were now being added 
further grounds for the outbreak of the pent-up jealousies which 
His mounting prestige evoked in the breasts of His ill-wishers and 
enemies.  The steady extension of the circle of His acquaintances 
and admirers; His friendly intercourse with officials including the 
governor of the city; the unfeigned homage offered Him, on so many 
occasions and so spontaneously, by men who had once been distinguished 
companions of Siyyid &amp;Kazim; the disillusionment which the 
persistent concealment of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, and the unflattering reports 
circulated regarding his character and abilities, had engendered; the 
signs of increasing independence, of innate sagacity and inherent 
superiority and capacity for leadership unmistakably exhibited by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself--all combined to widen the breach which the 
infamous and crafty Siyyid &amp;Muhammad had sedulously contrived 
to create.  
     A clandestine opposition, whose aim was to nullify every effort 
exerted, and frustrate every design conceived, by &amp;Baha'u'llah for the 
rehabilitation of a distracted community, could now be clearly 
discerned.  Insinuations, whose purpose was to sow the seeds of doubt 
and suspicion and to represent Him as a usurper, as the subverter of 
the laws instituted by the &amp;Bab, and the wrecker of His Cause, were 
being incessantly circulated.  His Epistles, interpretations, invocations 
and commentaries were being covertly and indirectly criticized, challenged 
and misrepresented.  An attempt to injure His person was 
even set afoot but failed to materialize.  
     The cup of &amp;Baha'u'llah's sorrows was now running over.  All His 
exhortations, all His efforts to remedy a rapidly deteriorating situation, 
had remained fruitless.  The velocity of His manifold woes was 
hourly and visibly increasing.  Upon the sadness that filled His soul 
and the gravity of the situation confronting Him, His writings, 
revealed during that somber period, throw abundant light.  In some 
of His prayers He poignantly confesses that "tribulation upon tribulation" 
had gathered about Him, that "adversaries with one consent" 
had fallen upon Him, that "wretchedness" had grievously touched 
 
+P118 
Him, and that "woes at their blackest" had befallen Him.  God 
Himself He calls upon as a Witness to His "sighs and lamentations," 
His "powerlessness, poverty and destitution," to the "injuries" He 
sustained, and the "abasement" He suffered.  "So grievous hath been 
My weeping," He, in one of these prayers, avows, "that I have been 
prevented from making mention of Thee and singing Thy praises."  
"So loud hath been the voice of My lamentation," He, in another 
passage, avers, "that every mother mourning for her child would be 
amazed, and would still her weeping and her grief."  "The wrongs 
which I suffer," He, in His &amp;Lawh-i-Maryam, laments, "have blotted 
out the wrongs suffered by My First Name (the &amp;Bab) from the 
Tablet of creation."  "O Maryam!" He continues, "From the Land 
of &amp;Ta (&amp;Tihran), after countless afflictions, We reached &amp;Iraq, at the 
bidding of the Tyrant of Persia, where, after the fetters of Our foes, 
We were afflicted with the perfidy of Our friends.  God knoweth 
what befell Me thereafter!"  And again:  "I have borne what no man, 
be he of the past or of the future, hath borne or will bear."  "Oceans 
of sadness," He testifies in the Tablet of &amp;Qullu't-Ta'am, "have surged 
over Me, a drop of which no soul could bear to drink.  Such is My 
grief that My soul hath well nigh departed from My body."  "Give 
ear, O &amp;Kamal!" He, in that same Tablet, depicting His plight, exclaims, 
"to the voice of this lowly, this forsaken ant, that hath hid 
itself in its hole, and whose desire is to depart from your midst, and 
vanish from your sight, by reason of that which the hands of men 
have wrought.  God, verily, hath been witness between Me and His 
servants."  And again:  "Woe is Me, woe is Me!...  All that I have 
seen from the day on which I first drank the pure milk from the 
breast of My mother until this moment hath been effaced from My 
memory, in consequence of that which the hands of the people have 
committed."  Furthermore, in His &amp;Qasidiy-i-Varqa'iyyih, an ode 
revealed during the days of His retirement to the mountains of 
&amp;Kurdistan, in praise of the Maiden personifying the Spirit of God 
recently descended upon Him, He thus gives vent to the agonies of 
His sorrow-laden heart:  "Noah's flood is but the measure of the tears 
I have shed, and Abraham's fire an ebullition of My soul.  Jacob's 
grief is but a reflection of My sorrows, and Job's afflictions a fraction 
of my calamity."  "Pour out patience upon Me, O My Lord!"--
such is His supplication in one of His prayers, "and render Me victorious 
over the transgressors."  "In these days," He, describing in 
the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan the virulence of the jealousy which, at that time, 
was beginning to bare its venomous fangs, has written, "such odors 
 
+P119 
of jealousy are diffused, that ... from the beginning of the foundation 
of the world ... until the present day, such malice, envy and 
hate have in no wise appeared, nor will they ever be witnessed in the 
future."  "For two years or rather less," He, likewise, in another 
Tablet, declares, "I shunned all else but God, and closed Mine eyes to 
all except Him, that haply the fire of hatred may die down and the 
heat of jealousy abate."  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan himself has testified:  "That Blessed Beauty evinced 
such sadness that the limbs of my body trembled."  He has, likewise, 
related, as reported by &amp;Nabil in his narrative, that, shortly before 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's retirement, he had on one occasion seen Him, between 
dawn and sunrise, suddenly come out from His house, His night-cap 
still on His head, showing such signs of perturbation that he was 
powerless to gaze into His face, and while walking, angrily remark:  
"These creatures are the same creatures who for three thousand years 
have worshipped idols, and bowed down before the Golden Calf.  
Now, too, they are fit for nothing better.  What relation can there 
be between this people and Him Who is the Countenance of Glory?  
What ties can bind them to the One Who is the supreme embodiment 
of all that is lovable?"  "I stood," declared &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, "rooted 
to the spot, lifeless, dried up as a dead tree, ready to fall under the 
impact of the stunning power of His words.  Finally, He said:  `Bid 
them recite:  "Is there any Remover of difficulties save God?  Say:  
Praised be God!  He is God!  All are His servants, and all abide by 
His bidding!"  Tell them to repeat it five hundred times, nay, a 
thousand times, by day and by night, sleeping and waking, that haply 
the Countenance of Glory may be unveiled to their eyes, and tiers 
of light descend upon them.'  He Himself, I was subsequently informed, 
recited this same verse, His face betraying the utmost sadness.  
...Several times during those days, He was heard to remark:  `We 
have, for a while, tarried amongst this people, and failed to discern 
the slightest response on their part.'  Oftentimes He alluded to His 
disappearance from our midst, yet none of us understood His 
meaning."  
     Finally, discerning, as He Himself testifies in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, 
"the signs of impending events," He decided that before they happened 
He would retire.  "The one object of Our retirement," He, in 
that same Book affirms, "was to avoid becoming a subject of discord 
among the faithful, a source of disturbance unto Our companions, 
the means of injury to any soul, or the cause of sorrow to any heart."  
"Our withdrawal," He, moreover, in that same passage emphatically 
 
+P120 
asserts, "contemplated no return, and Our separation hoped for no 
reunion."  
     Suddenly, and without informing any one even among the members 
of His own family, on the 12th of Rajab 1270 A.H. (April 10, 
1854), He departed, accompanied by an attendant, a &amp;Muhammadan 
named &amp;Abu'l-Qasim-i-Hamadani, to whom He gave a sum of money, 
instructing him to act as a merchant and use it for his own purposes.  
Shortly after, that servant was attacked by thieves and killed, and 
&amp;Baha'u'llah was left entirely alone in His wanderings through the 
wastes of &amp;Kurdistan, a region whose sturdy and warlike people were 
known for their age-long hostility to the Persians, whom they regarded 
as seceders from the Faith of &amp;Islam, and from whom they 
differed in their outlook, race and language.  
     Attired in the garb of a traveler, coarsely clad, taking with Him 
nothing but his &amp;kashkul (alms-bowl) and a change of clothes, and 
assuming the name of &amp;Darvish &amp;Muhammad, &amp;Baha'u'llah retired to 
the wilderness, and lived for a time on a mountain named &amp;Sar-Galu, 
so far removed from human habitations that only twice a year, at 
seed sowing and harvest time, it was visited by the peasants of that 
region.  Alone and undisturbed, He passed a considerable part of 
His retirement on the top of that mountain in a rude structure, made 
of stone, which served those peasants as a shelter against the extremities 
of the weather.  At times His dwelling-place was a cave to which 
He refers in His Tablets addressed to the famous &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'r-Rahman 
and to Maryam, a kinswoman of His.  "I roamed the wilderness 
of resignation" He thus depicts, in the &amp;Lawh-i-Maryam, the 
rigors of His austere solitude, "traveling in such wise that in My exile 
every eye wept sore over Me, and all created things shed tears of 
blood because of My anguish.  The birds of the air were My companions 
and the beasts of the field My associates."  "From My eyes," 
He, referring in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan to those days, testifies, "there 
rained tears of anguish, and in My bleeding heart surged an ocean 
of agonizing pain.  Many a night I had no food for sustenance, and 
many a day My body found no rest....  Alone I communed with 
My spirit, oblivious of the world and all that is therein."  
     In the odes He revealed, whilst wrapped in His devotions during 
those days of utter seclusion, and in the prayers and soliloquies which, 
in verse and prose, both in Arabic and Persian, poured from His 
sorrow-laden soul, many of which He was wont to chant aloud to 
Himself, at dawn and during the watches of the night, He lauded 
the names and attributes of His Creator, extolled the glories and 
 
+P121 
mysteries of His own Revelation, sang the praises of that Maiden 
that personified the Spirit of God within Him, dwelt on His loneliness 
and His past and future tribulations, expatiated upon the 
blindness of His generation, the perfidy of His friends and the perversity 
of His enemies, affirmed His determination to arise and, if 
needs be, offer up His life for the vindication of His Cause, stressed 
those essential pre-requisites which every seeker after Truth must 
possess, and recalled, in anticipation of the lot that was to be His, 
the tragedy of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn in &amp;Karbila, the plight of &amp;Muhammad 
in Mecca, the sufferings of Jesus at the hands of the Jews, the trials 
of Moses inflicted by Pharaoh and his people and the ordeal of 
Joseph as He languished in a pit by reason of the treachery of His 
brothers.  These initial and impassioned outpourings of a Soul struggling 
to unburden itself, in the solitude of a self-imposed exile (many 
of them, alas lost to posterity) are, with the Tablet of &amp;Kullu't-Ta'am 
and the poem entitled &amp;Rashh-i-'Ama, revealed in &amp;Tihran, the first 
fruits of His Divine Pen.  They are the forerunners of those immortal 
works--the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, the Hidden Words and the Seven Valleys--
which in the years preceding His Declaration in &amp;Baghdad, were to 
enrich so vastly the steadily swelling volume of His writings, and 
which paved the way for a further flowering of His prophetic genius 
in His epoch-making Proclamation to the world, couched in the 
form of mighty Epistles to the kings and rulers of mankind, and 
finally for the last fruition of His Mission in the Laws and Ordinances 
of His Dispensation formulated during His confinement in the Most 
Great Prison of &amp;Akka.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah was still pursuing His solitary existence on that mountain 
when a certain &amp;Shaykh, a resident of &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, who 
owned a property in that neighborhood, sought Him out, as directed 
in a dream he had of the Prophet &amp;Muhammad.  Shortly after this 
contact was established, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Isma'il, the leader of the &amp;Khalidiyyih 
Order, who lived in &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, visited Him, and succeeded, 
after repeated requests, in obtaining His consent to transfer His 
residence to that town.  Meantime His friends in &amp;Baghdad had discovered 
His whereabouts, and had dispatched &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan, the 
father-in-law of &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, to beg Him to return; and it was 
now while He was living in &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, in a room belonging to 
the &amp;Takyiy-i-Mawlana &amp;Khalid (theological seminary) that their 
messenger arrived.  "I found," this same &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan, recounting 
his experiences to &amp;Nabil, has stated, "all those who lived with Him 
in that place, from their Master down to the humblest neophyte, so 
 
+P122 
enamoured of, and carried away by their love for &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
so unprepared to contemplate the possibility of His departure that 
I felt certain that were I to inform them of the purpose of my visit, 
they would not have hesitated to put an end to my life."  
     Not long after Baha'u'llah's arrival in &amp;Kurdistan, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan 
has related, He was able, through His personal contacts with &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Uthman, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'r-Rahman, and &amp;Shaykh &amp;Isma'il, the honored 
and undisputed leaders of the &amp;Naqshbandiyyih, the &amp;Qadiriyyih 
and the &amp;Khalidiyyih Orders respectively, to win their hearts completely 
and establish His ascendancy over them.  The first of these, 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Uthman, included no less a person than the &amp;Sultan himself 
and his entourage among his adherents.  The second, in reply to whose 
query the "Four Valleys" was later revealed, commanded the unwavering 
allegiance of at least a hundred thousand devout followers, 
while the third was held in such veneration by his supporters that 
they regarded him as co-equal with &amp;Khalid himself, the founder of 
the Order.  
     When &amp;Baha'u'llah arrived in &amp;Sulaymaniyyih none at first, owing to 
the strict silence and reserve He maintained, suspected Him of being 
possessed of any learning or wisdom.  It was only accidentally, through 
seeing a specimen of His exquisite penmanship shown to them by one 
of the students who waited upon Him, that the curiosity of the 
learned instructors and students of that seminary was aroused, and 
they were impelled to approach Him and test the degree of His 
knowledge and the extent of His familiarity with the arts and 
sciences current amongst them.  That seat of learning had been renowned 
for its vast endowments, its numerous takyihs, and its 
association with &amp;Salahi'd-Din-i-Ayyubi and his descendants; from it 
some of the most illustrious exponents of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam had gone forth 
to teach its precepts, and now a delegation, headed by &amp;Shaykh &amp;Isma'il 
himself, and consisting of its most eminent doctors and most distinguished 
students, called upon &amp;Baha'u'llah, and, finding Him willing 
to reply to any questions they might wish to address Him, they 
requested Him to elucidate for them, in the course of several interviews, 
the abstruse passages contained in the &amp;Futuhat-i-Makkiyyih, 
the celebrated work of the famous &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhyi'd-Din-i-'Arabi.  
"God is My witness," was &amp;Baha'u'llah's instant reply to the learned 
delegation, "that I have never seen the book you refer to.  I regard, 
however, through the power of God, ... whatever you wish me to 
do as easy of accomplishment."  Directing one of them to read aloud 
to Him, every day, a page of that book, He was able to resolve their 
 
+P123 
perplexities in so amazing a fashion that they were lost in admiration.  
Not contenting Himself with a mere clarification of the obscure 
passages of the text, He would interpret for them the mind of its 
author, and expound his doctrine, and unfold his purpose.  At times 
He would even go so far as to question the soundness of certain 
views propounded in that book, and would Himself vouchsafe a 
correct presentation of the issues that had been misunderstood, and 
would support it with proofs and evidences that were wholly convincing 
to His listeners.  
     Amazed by the profundity of His insight and the compass of His 
understanding, they were impelled to seek from Him what they 
considered to be a conclusive and final evidence of the unique power 
and knowledge which He now appeared in their eyes to possess.  
"No one among the mystics, the wise, and the learned," they claimed, 
while requesting this further favor from Him, "has hitherto proved 
himself capable of writing a poem in a rhyme and meter identical 
with that of the longer of the two odes, entitled &amp;Qasidiy-i-Ta'iyyih 
composed by &amp;Ibn-i-Farid.  We beg you to write for us a poem in that 
same meter and rhyme."  This request was complied with, and no 
less than two thousand verses, in exactly the manner they had 
specified, were dictated by Him, out of which He selected one hundred 
and twenty-seven, which He permitted them to keep, deeming the 
subject matter of the rest premature and unsuitable to the needs of 
the times.  It is these same one hundred and twenty-seven verses that 
constitute the &amp;Qasidiy-i-Varqa'iyyih, so familiar to, and widely circulated 
amongst, His Arabic speaking followers.  
     Such was their reaction to this marvelous demonstration of the 
sagacity and genius of &amp;Baha'u'llah that they unanimously acknowledged 
every single verse of that poem to be endowed with a force, 
beauty and power far surpassing anything contained in either the 
major or minor odes composed by that celebrated poet.  
     This episode, by far the most outstanding among the events that 
transpired during the two years of &amp;Baha'u'llah's absence from &amp;Baghdad, 
immensely stimulated the interest with which an increasing number 
of the &amp;ulamas, the scholars, the &amp;shaykhs, the doctors, the holy men 
and princes who had congregated in the seminaries of &amp;Sulaymaniyyih 
and &amp;Karkuk, were now following His daily activities.  Through His 
numerous discourses and epistles He disclosed new vistas to their eyes, 
resolved the perplexities that agitated their minds, unfolded the inner 
meaning of many hitherto obscure passages in the writings of various 
commentators, poets and theologians, of which they had remained 
 
+P124 
unaware, and reconciled the seemingly contradictory assertions which 
abounded in these dissertations, poems and treatises.  Such was the 
esteem and respect entertained for Him that some held Him as One 
of the "Men of the Unseen," others accounted Him an adept in 
alchemy and the science of divination, still others designated Him 
"a pivot of the universe," whilst a not inconsiderable number among 
His admirers went so far as to believe that His station was no less 
than that of a prophet.  Kurds, Arabs, and Persians, learned and 
illiterate, both high and low, young and old, who had come to know 
Him, regarded Him with equal reverence, and not a few among them 
with genuine and profound affection, and this despite certain assertions 
and allusions to His station He had made in public, which, had 
they fallen from the lips of any other member of His race, would 
have provoked such fury as to endanger His life.  Small wonder that 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself should have, in the &amp;Lawh-i-Maryam, pronounced 
the period of His retirement as "the mightiest testimony" to, and "the 
most perfect and conclusive evidence" of, the truth of His Revelation.  
"In a short time," is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's own testimony, "&amp;Kurdistan was 
magnetized with His love.  During this period &amp;Baha'u'llah lived in 
poverty.  His garments were those of the poor and needy.  His food 
was that of the indigent and lowly.  An atmosphere of majesty 
haloed Him as the sun at midday.  Everywhere He was greatly 
revered and loved."  
     While the foundations of &amp;Baha'u'llah's future greatness were being 
laid in a strange land and amidst a strange people, the situation of 
the &amp;Babi community was rapidly going from bad to worse.  Pleased 
and emboldened by His unexpected and prolonged withdrawal from 
the scene of His labors, the stirrers of mischief with their deluded 
associates were busily engaged in extending the range of their 
nefarious activities.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, closeted most of the time in his 
house, was secretly directing, through his correspondence with those 
&amp;Babis whom he completely trusted, a campaign designed to utterly 
discredit &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In his fear of any potential adversary he had 
dispatched &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-i-Mazindarani, one of his supporters, 
to &amp;Adhirbayjan for the express purpose of murdering &amp;Dayyan, the 
"repository of the knowledge of God," whom he surnamed "Father 
of Iniquities" and stigmatized as "&amp;Taghut," and whom the &amp;Bab had 
extolled as the "Third Letter to believe in Him Whom God shall 
make manifest."  In his folly he had, furthermore, induced &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Jan to proceed to &amp;Nur, and there await a propitious moment 
when he could make a successful attempt on the life of the sovereign.  
 
+P125 
His shamelessness and effrontery had waxed so great as to lead him 
to perpetrate himself, and permit Siyyid &amp;Muhammad to repeat after 
him, an act so odious that &amp;Baha'u'llah characterized it as "a most 
grievous betrayal," inflicting dishonor upon the &amp;Bab, and which 
"overwhelmed all lands with sorrow."  He even, as a further evidence 
of the enormity of his crimes, ordered that the cousin of the &amp;Bab, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Akbar, a fervent admirer of &amp;Dayyan, be secretly put to 
death--a command which was carried out in all its iniquity.  As to 
Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, now given free rein by his master, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, 
he had surrounded himself, as &amp;Nabil who was at that time with him 
in &amp;Karbila categorically asserts, with a band of ruffians, whom he 
allowed, and even encouraged, to snatch at night the turbans from 
the heads of wealthy pilgrims who had congregated in &amp;Karbila, to 
steal their shoes, to rob the shrine of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn of its divans 
and candles, and seize the drinking cups from the public fountains.  
The depths of degradation to which these so-called adherents of the 
Faith of the &amp;Bab had sunk could not but evoke in &amp;Nabil the memory 
of the sublime renunciation shown by the conduct of the companions 
of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, who, at the suggestion of their leader, had scornfully 
cast by the wayside the gold, the silver and turquoise in their 
possession, or shown by the behavior of &amp;Vahid who refused to allow 
even the least valuable amongst the treasures which his sumptuously 
furnished house in Yazd contained to be removed ere it was pillaged 
by the mob, or shown by the decision of &amp;Hujjat not to permit 
his companions, who were on the brink of starvation, to lay 
hands on the property of others, even though it were to save their 
own lives.  
     Such was the audacity and effrontery of these demoralized and 
misguided &amp;Babis that no less than twenty-five persons, according to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's testimony, had the presumption to declare themselves 
to be the Promised One foretold by the &amp;Bab!  Such was the decline 
in their fortunes that they hardly dared show themselves in public.  
Kurds and Persians vied with each other, when confronting them in 
the streets, in heaping abuse upon them, and in vilifying openly the 
Cause which they professed.  Little wonder that on His return to 
&amp;Baghdad &amp;Baha'u'llah should have described the situation then existing 
in these words:  "We found no more than a handful of souls, faint 
and dispirited, nay utterly lost and dead.  The Cause of God had 
ceased to be on any one's lips, nor was any heart receptive to its 
message."  Such was the sadness that overwhelmed Him on His arrival 
that He refused for some time to leave His house, except for His 
 
+P126 
visits to &amp;Kazimayn and for His occasional meeting with a few of 
His friends who resided in that town and in &amp;Baghdad.  
     The tragic situation that had developed in the course of His two 
years' absence now imperatively demanded His return.  "From the 
Mystic Source," He Himself explains in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, "there came 
the summons bidding Us return whence We came.  Surrendering Our 
will to His, We submitted to His injunction."  "By God besides Whom 
there is none other God!" is His emphatic assertion to &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan, 
as reported by &amp;Nabil in his narrative, "But for My recognition of the 
fact that the blessed Cause of the Primal Point was on the verge of 
being completely obliterated, and all the sacred blood poured out in 
the path of God would have been shed in vain, I would in no wise 
have consented to return to the people of the &amp;Bayan, and would have 
abandoned them to the worship of the idols their imaginations had 
fashioned."  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, realizing full well to what a pass his unrestrained 
leadership of the Faith had brought him, had, moreover, insistently 
and in writing, besought Him to return.  No less urgent were the 
pleadings of His own kindred and friends, particularly His twelve-year 
old Son, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Whose grief and loneliness had so consumed 
His soul that, in a conversation recorded by &amp;Nabil in his 
narrative, He had avowed that subsequent to the departure of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah He had in His boyhood grown old.  
     Deciding to terminate the period of His retirement &amp;Baha'u'llah 
bade farewell to the &amp;shaykhs of &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, who now numbered 
among His most ardent and, as their future conduct demonstrated, 
staunchest admirers.  Accompanied by &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan, He retraced 
His steps to &amp;Baghdad, on "the banks of the River of Tribulations," 
as He Himself termed it, proceeding by slow stages, realizing, as He 
declared to His fellow-traveler, that these last days of His retirement 
would be "the only days of peace and tranquillity" left to Him, 
"days which will never again fall to My lot."  
     On the 12th of Rajab 1272 A.H. (March 19, 1856) He arrived 
in &amp;Baghdad, exactly two lunar years after His departure for &amp;Kurdistan.

                      &amp;Baha'u'llah's Banishment to &amp;Iraq 
                                 (Continued) 
 
     The return of &amp;Baha'u'llah from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih to &amp;Baghdad marks 
a turning point of the utmost significance in the history of the first 
&amp;Baha'i century.  The tide of the fortunes of the Faith, having reached 
its lowest ebb, was now beginning to surge back, and was destined 
to roll on, steadily and mightily, to a new high water-mark, associated 
this time with the Declaration of His Mission, on the eve of 
His banishment to Constantinople.  With His return to &amp;Baghdad a 
firm anchorage was now being established, an anchorage such as the 
Faith had never known in its history.  Never before, except during 
the first three years of its life, could that Faith claim to have possessed 
a fixed and accessible center to which its adherents could turn for 
guidance, and from which they could derive continuous and unobstructed 
inspiration.  No less than half of the &amp;Bab's short-lived 
ministry was spent on the remotest border of His native country, 
where He was concealed and virtually cut off from the vast majority 
of His disciples.  The period immediately after His martyrdom was 
marked by a confusion that was even more deplorable than the isolation 
caused by His enforced captivity.  Nor when the Revelation 
which He had foretold made its appearance was it succeeded by an 
immediate declaration that could enable the members of a distracted 
community to rally round the person of their expected Deliverer.  
The prolonged self-concealment of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, the center provisionally 
appointed pending the manifestation of the Promised One; 
the nine months' absence of &amp;Baha'u'llah from His native land, while 
on a visit to &amp;Karbila, followed swiftly by His imprisonment in the 
&amp;Siyah-Chal, by His banishment to &amp;Iraq, and afterwards by His 
retirement to &amp;Kurdistan--all combined to prolong the phase of instability 
and suspense through which the &amp;Babi community had to pass.  
     Now at last, in spite of &amp;Baha'u'llah's reluctance to unravel the 
mystery surrounding His own position, the &amp;Babis found themselves 
able to center both their hopes and their movements round One Whom 
they believed (whatever their views as to His station) capable of 
insuring the stability and integrity of their Faith.  The orientation 
 
+P128 
which the Faith had thus acquired and the fixity of the center towards 
which it now gravitated continued, in one form or another, to be its 
outstanding features, of which it was never again to be deprived.  
     The Faith of the &amp;Bab, as already observed, had, in consequence of 
the successive and formidable blows it had received, reached the 
verge of extinction.  Nor was the momentous Revelation vouchsafed 
to &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Siyah-Chal productive at once of any tangible 
results of a nature that would exercise a stabilizing influence on a 
well-nigh disrupted community.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's unexpected banishment 
had been a further blow to its members, who had learned to 
place their reliance upon Him.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya's seclusion and inactivity 
further accelerated the process of disintegration that had set in.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah's prolonged retirement to &amp;Kurdistan seemed to have set 
the seal on its complete dissolution.  
     Now, however, the tide that had ebbed in so alarming a measure 
was turning, bearing with it, as it rose to flood point, those inestimable 
benefits that were to herald the announcement of the Revelation 
already secretly disclosed to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     During the seven years that elapsed between the resumption of 
His labors and the declaration of His prophetic mission--years to 
which we now direct our attention--it would be no exaggeration to 
say that the &amp;Baha'i community, under the name and in the shape of a 
re-arisen &amp;Babi community was born and was slowly taking shape, 
though its Creator still appeared in the guise of, and continued to 
labor as, one of the foremost disciples of the &amp;Bab.  It was a period 
during which the prestige of the community's nominal head steadily 
faded from the scene, paling before the rising splendor of Him Who 
was its actual Leader and Deliverer.  It was a period in the course 
of which the first fruits of an exile, endowed with incalculable 
potentialities, ripened and were garnered.  It was a period that will 
go down in history as one during which the prestige of a recreated 
community was immensely enhanced, its morals entirely reformed, 
its recognition of Him who rehabilitated its fortunes enthusiastically 
affirmed, its literature enormously enriched, and its victories over its 
new adversaries universally acknowledged.  
     The prestige of the community, and particularly that of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
now began from its first inception in &amp;Kurdistan to mount in a 
steadily rising crescendo.  &amp;Baha'u'llah had scarcely gathered up again the 
reins of the authority he had relinquished when the devout admirers 
He had left behind in &amp;Sulaymaniyyih started to flock to &amp;Baghdad, 
with the name of "&amp;Darvish &amp;Muhammad" on their lips, and the "house 
 
+P129 
of &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa the &amp;Babi" as their goal.  Astonished at the sight of 
so many &amp;ulamas and &amp;Sufis of Kurdish origin, of both the &amp;Qadiriyyih 
and &amp;Khalidiyyih Orders, thronging the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
impelled by racial and sectarian rivalry, the religious leaders of the 
city, such as the renowned &amp;Ibn-i-Alusi, the &amp;Mufti of &amp;Baghdad, together 
with &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu's-Salam, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'l-Qadir and Siyyid 
&amp;Dawudi, began to seek His presence, and, having obtained completely 
satisfying answers to their several queries, enrolled themselves among 
the band of His earliest admirers.  The unqualified recognition by 
these outstanding leaders of those traits that distinguished the character 
and conduct of &amp;Baha'u'llah stimulated the curiosity, and later 
evoked the unstinted praise, of a great many observers of less conspicuous 
position, among whom figured poets, mystics and notables, 
who either resided in, or visited, the city.  Government officials, foremost 
among whom were &amp;Abdu'llah &amp;Pasha and his lieutenant &amp;Mahmud 
&amp;Aqa, and &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali &amp;Mardan, a Kurd well-known in those circles, 
were gradually brought into contact with Him, and lent their share 
in noising abroad His fast-spreading fame.  Nor could those distinguished 
Persians, who either lived in &amp;Baghdad and its environs or 
visited as pilgrims the holy places, remain impervious to the spell of 
His charm.  Princes of the royal blood, amongst whom were such 
personages as the &amp;Na'ibu'l-Iyalih, the &amp;Shuja'u'd-Dawlih, the Sayfu'd-Dawlih, 
and &amp;Zaynu'l-Abidin &amp;Khan, the &amp;Fakhru'd-Dawlih, were, 
likewise, irresistibly drawn into the ever-widening circle of His associates 
and acquaintances.  
     Those who, during &amp;Baha'u'llah's two years' absence from &amp;Baghdad, 
had so persistently reviled and loudly derided His companions and 
kindred were, by now, for the most part, silenced.  Not an inconsiderable 
number among them feigned respect and esteem for Him, 
a few claimed to be His defenders and supporters, while others professed 
to share His beliefs, and actually joined the ranks of the 
community to which He belonged.  Such was the extent of the 
reaction that had set in that one of them was even heard to boast 
that, as far back as the year 1250 A.H.--a decade before the &amp;Bab's 
Declaration--he had already perceived and embraced the truth of 
His Faith!  
     Within a few years after &amp;Baha'u'llah's return from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih 
the situation had been completely reversed.  The house of &amp;Sulayman-i-Ghannam, 
on which the official designation of the &amp;Bayt-i-Azam 
(the Most Great House) was later conferred, known, at that time, 
as the house of &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, the &amp;Babi, an extremely modest residence, 
 
+P130 
situated in the &amp;Karkh quarter, in the neighborhood of the western 
bank of the river, to which &amp;Baha'u'llah's family had moved prior to 
His return from &amp;Kurdistan, had now become the focal center of a 
great number of seekers, visitors and pilgrims, including Kurds, 
Persians, Arabs and Turks, and derived from the Muslim, the Jewish 
and Christian Faiths.  It had, moreover, become a veritable sanctuary 
to which the victims of the injustice of the official representative of 
the Persian government were wont to flee, in the hope of securing 
redress for the wrongs they had suffered.  
     At the same time an influx of Persian &amp;Babis, whose sole object 
was to attain the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, swelled the stream of 
visitors that poured through His hospitable doors.  Carrying back, on 
their return to their native country, innumerable testimonies, both 
oral and written, to His steadily rising power and glory, they could 
not fail to contribute, in a vast measure, to the expansion and 
progress of a newly-reborn Faith.  Four of the &amp;Bab's cousins and 
His maternal uncle, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza Siyyid &amp;Muhammad; a grand-daughter 
of &amp;Fath-'Ali &amp;Shah and fervent admirer of &amp;Tahirih, surnamed 
&amp;Varaqatu'r-Ridvan; the erudite &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-i-Qa'ini, surnamed 
&amp;Nabil-i-Akbar; the already famous &amp;Mulla &amp;Sadiq-i-Khurasani, 
surnamed &amp;Ismu'llahu'l-Asdaq, who with &amp;Quddus had been ignominiously 
persecuted in &amp;Shiraz; &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir, one of the Letters of the 
Living; Siyyid &amp;Asadu'llah, surnamed &amp;Dayyan; the revered Siyyid 
&amp;Javad-i-Karbila'i; &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Hasan and &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Husayn, 
later immortalized by the titles of &amp;Sultanu'sh-Shuhada and 
&amp;Mahbubu'sh-Shuhada (King of Martyrs and Beloved of Martyrs) 
respectively; &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Nahri, whose daughter, at 
a later date, was joined in wedlock to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; the immortal 
Siyyid &amp;Isma'il-i-Zavari'i; &amp;Haji &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad, surnamed &amp;Nabil 
by the &amp;Bab; the accomplished &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqay-i-Munir, surnamed 
&amp;Ismu'llahu'l-Munib; the long-suffering &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Taqi, surnamed 
&amp;Ayyub; &amp;Mulla &amp;Zaynu'l-Abidin, surnamed &amp;Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, who 
had ranked as a highly esteemed mujtahid--all these were numbered 
among the visitors and fellow-disciples who crossed His threshold, 
caught a glimpse of the splendor of His majesty, and communicated 
far and wide the creative influences instilled into them through their 
contact with His spirit.  &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-i-Zarandi, surnamed 
&amp;Nabil-i-Azam, who may well rank as His Poet-Laureate, His chronicler 
and His indefatigable disciple, had already joined the exiles, 
and had launched out on his long and arduous series of journeys to 
Persia in furtherance of the Cause of his Beloved.  
 
+P131 
     Even those who, in their folly and temerity had, in &amp;Baghdad, in 
&amp;Karbila, in Qum, in &amp;Kashan, in &amp;Tabriz and in &amp;Tihran, arrogated to 
themselves the rights, and assumed the title of "Him Whom God 
shall make manifest" were for the most part instinctively led to seek 
His presence, confess their error and supplicate His forgiveness.  As 
time went on, fugitives, driven by the ever-present fear of persecution, 
sought, with their wives and children, the relative security 
afforded them by close proximity to One who had already become the 
rallying point for the members of a sorely-vexed community.  
Persians of high eminence, living in exile, rejecting, in the face of 
the mounting prestige of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the dictates of moderation and 
prudence, sat, forgetful of their pride, at His feet, and imbibed, 
each according to his capacity, a measure of His spirit and wisdom.  
Some of the more ambitious among them, such as &amp;Abbas &amp;Mirza, 
a son of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, the &amp;Vazir-Nizam, and &amp;Mirza Malkam 
&amp;Khan, as well as certain functionaries of foreign governments, attempted, 
in their short-sightedness, to secure His support and 
assistance for the furtherance of the designs they cherished, designs 
which He unhesitatingly and severely condemned.  Nor was the then 
representative of the British government, Colonel Sir Arnold Burrows 
Kemball, consul-general in &amp;Baghdad, insensible of the position which 
&amp;Baha'u'llah now occupied.  Entering into friendly correspondence 
with Him, he, as testified by &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, offered Him the 
protection of British citizenship, called on Him in person, and 
undertook to transmit to Queen Victoria any communication He 
might wish to forward to her.  He even expressed his readiness to 
arrange for the transfer of His residence to India, or to any place 
agreeable to Him.  This suggestion &amp;Baha'u'llah declined, choosing to 
abide in the dominions of the &amp;Sultan of Turkey.  And finally, during 
the last year of His sojourn in &amp;Baghdad the governor &amp;Namiq-Pasha, 
impressed by the many signs of esteem and veneration in which He 
was held, called upon Him to pay his personal tribute to One Who 
had already achieved so conspicuous a victory over the hearts and 
souls of those who had met Him.  So profound was the respect the 
governor entertained for Him, Whom he regarded as one of the 
Lights of the Age, that it was not until the end of three months, 
during which he had received five successive commands from &amp;Ali 
&amp;Pasha, that he could bring himself to inform &amp;Baha'u'llah that it was 
the wish of the Turkish government that He should proceed to the 
capital.  On one occasion, when &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim 
had been delegated by &amp;Baha'u'llah to visit him, he entertained them 
 
+P132 
with such elaborate ceremonial that the Deputy-Governor stated that 
so far as he knew no notable of the city had ever been accorded by 
any governor so warm and courteous a reception.  So struck, indeed, 
had the &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Majid been by the favorable reports received 
about &amp;Baha'u'llah from successive governors of &amp;Baghdad (this is the 
personal testimony given by the Governor's deputy to &amp;Baha'u'llah 
himself) that he consistently refused to countenance the requests of 
the Persian government either to deliver Him to their representative 
or to order His expulsion from Turkish territory.  
     On no previous occasion, since the inception of the Faith, not 
even during the days when the &amp;Bab in &amp;Isfahan, in &amp;Tabriz and in 
&amp;Chihriq was acclaimed by the ovations of an enthusiastic populace, 
had any of its exponents risen to such high eminence in the public 
mind, or exercised over so diversified a circle of admirers an influence 
so far reaching and so potent.  Yet unprecedented as was the sway 
which &amp;Baha'u'llah held while, in that primitive age of the Faith, He 
was dwelling in &amp;Baghdad, its range at that time was modest when 
compared with the magnitude of the fame which, at the close of that 
same age, and through the immediate inspiration of the Center of 
His Covenant, the Faith acquired in both the European and American 
continents.  
     The ascendancy achieved by &amp;Baha'u'llah was nowhere better 
demonstrated than in His ability to broaden the outlook and transform 
the character of the community to which He belonged.  Though 
Himself nominally a &amp;Babi, though the provisions of the &amp;Bayan were 
still regarded as binding and inviolable, He was able to inculcate a 
standard which, while not incompatible with its tenets, was ethically 
superior to the loftiest principles which the &amp;Babi Dispensation had 
established.  The salutary and fundamental truths advocated by the 
&amp;Bab, that had either been obscured, neglected or misrepresented, were 
moreover elucidated by &amp;Baha'u'llah, reaffirmed and instilled afresh 
into the corporate life of the community, and into the souls of the 
individuals who comprised it.  The dissociation of the &amp;Babi Faith 
from every form of political activity and from all secret associations 
and factions; the emphasis placed on the principle of non-violence; 
the necessity of strict obedience to established authority; the ban 
imposed on all forms of sedition, on back-biting, retaliation, and 
dispute; the stress laid on godliness, kindliness, humility and piety, 
on honesty and truthfulness, chastity and fidelity, on justice, toleration, 
sociability, amity and concord, on the acquisition of arts and 
sciences, on self-sacrifice and detachment, on patience, steadfastness 
 
+P133 
and resignation to the will of God--all these constitute the salient 
features of a code of ethical conduct to which the books, treatises 
and epistles, revealed during those years, by the indefatigable pen of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, unmistakably bear witness.  
     "By the aid of God and His divine grace and mercy," He Himself 
has written with reference to the character and consequences of His 
own labors during that period, "We revealed, as a copious rain, Our 
verses, and sent them to various parts of the world.  We exhorted all 
men, and particularly this people, through Our wise counsels and 
loving admonitions, and forbade them to engage in sedition, quarrels, 
disputes or conflict.  As a result of this, and by the grace of God, 
waywardness and folly were changed into piety and understanding, 
and weapons of war converted into instruments of peace."  "&amp;Baha'u'llah," 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha affirmed, "after His return (from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih) 
made such strenuous efforts in educating and training this 
community, in reforming its manners, in regulating its affairs and in 
rehabilitating its fortunes, that in a short while all these troubles and 
mischiefs were quenched, and the utmost peace and tranquillity 
reigned in men's hearts."  And again:  "When these fundamentals were 
established in the hearts of this people, they everywhere acted in such 
wise that, in the estimation of those in authority, they became famous 
for the integrity of their character, the steadfastness of their hearts, 
the purity of their motives, the praiseworthiness of their deeds, and 
the excellence of their conduct."  
     The exalted character of the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah propounded 
during that period is perhaps best illustrated by the following statement 
made by Him in those days to an official who had reported to 
Him that, because of the devotion to His person which an evildoer 
had professed, he had hesitated to inflict upon that criminal the 
punishment he deserved:  "Tell him, no one in this world can claim 
any relationship to Me except those who, in all their deeds and in 
their conduct, follow My example, in such wise that all the peoples 
of the earth would be powerless to prevent them from doing and 
saying that which is meet and seemly."  "This brother of Mine," He 
further declared to that official, "this &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, who is from the 
same mother and father as Myself, and who from his earliest childhood 
has kept Me company, should he perpetrate an act contrary to 
the interests of either the state or religion, and his guilt be established 
in your sight, I would be pleased and appreciate your action were 
you to bind his hands and cast him into the river to drown, and refuse 
to consider the intercession of any one on his behalf."  In another 
 
+P134 
connection He, wishing to stress His strong condemnation of all acts 
of violence, had written:  "It would be more acceptable in My sight 
for a person to harm one of My own sons or relatives rather than 
inflict injury upon any soul."  
     "Most of those who surrounded &amp;Baha'u'llah," wrote &amp;Nabil, describing 
the spirit that animated the reformed &amp;Babi community in 
&amp;Baghdad, "exercised such care in sanctifying and purifying their souls, 
that they would suffer no word to cross their lips that might not conform 
to the will of God, nor would they take a single step that might 
be contrary to His good-pleasure."  "Each one," he relates, "had 
entered into a pact with one of his fellow-disciples, in which they 
agreed to admonish one another, and, if necessary, chastise one another 
with a number of blows on the soles of the feet, proportioning the 
number of strokes to the gravity of the offense against the lofty 
standards they had sworn to observe."  Describing the fervor of their 
zeal, he states that "not until the offender had suffered the punishment 
he had solicited, would he consent to either eat or drink."  
     The complete transformation which the written and spoken 
word of &amp;Baha'u'llah had effected in the outlook and character of 
His companions was equalled by the burning devotion which His 
love had kindled in their souls.  A passionate zeal and fervor, that 
rivalled the enthusiasm that had glowed so fiercely in the breasts of 
the &amp;Bab's disciples in their moments of greatest exaltation, had now 
seized the hearts of the exiles of &amp;Baghdad and galvanized their entire 
beings.  "So inebriated," &amp;Nabil, describing the fecundity of this tremendously 
dynamic spiritual revival, has written, "so carried away 
was every one by the sweet savors of the Morn of Divine Revelation 
that, methinks, out of every thorn sprang forth heaps of blossoms, 
and every seed yielded innumerable harvests."  "The room of the 
Most Great House," that same chronicler has recorded, "set apart for 
the reception of &amp;Baha'u'llah's visitors, though dilapidated, and having 
long since outgrown its usefulness, vied, through having been trodden 
by the blessed footsteps of the Well Beloved, with the Most Exalted 
Paradise.  Low-roofed, it yet seemed to reach to the stars, and though 
it boasted but a single couch, fashioned from the branches of palms, 
whereon He Who is the King of Names was wont to sit, it drew to 
itself, even as a loadstone, the hearts of the princes."  
     It was this same reception room which, in spite of its rude simplicity, 
had so charmed the &amp;Shuja'u'd-Dawlih that he had expressed to 
his fellow-princes his intention of building a duplicate of it in his 
home in &amp;Kazimayn.  "He may well succeed," &amp;Baha'u'llah is reported 
 
+P135 
to have smilingly remarked when apprized of this intention, "in 
reproducing outwardly the exact counterpart of this low-roofed room 
made of mud and straw with its diminutive garden.  What of his 
ability to open onto it the spiritual doors leading to the hidden worlds 
of God?"  "I know not how to explain it," another prince, &amp;Zaynu'l-Abidin 
&amp;Khan, the &amp;Fakhru'd-Dawlih, describing the atmosphere which 
pervaded that reception-room, had affirmed, "were all the sorrows of 
the world to be crowded into my heart they would, I feel, all vanish, 
when in the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  It is as if I had entered Paradise 
itself."  
     The joyous feasts which these companions, despite their extremely 
modest earnings, continually offered in honor of their Beloved; the 
gatherings, lasting far into the night, in which they loudly celebrated, 
with prayers, poetry and song, the praises of the &amp;Bab, of &amp;Quddus 
and of &amp;Baha'u'llah; the fasts they observed; the vigils they kept; the 
dreams and visions which fired their souls, and which they recounted 
to each other with feelings of unbounded enthusiasm; the eagerness 
with which those who served &amp;Baha'u'llah performed His errands, 
waited upon His needs, and carried heavy skins of water for His 
ablutions and other domestic purposes; the acts of imprudence which, 
in moments of rapture, they occasionally committed; the expressions 
of wonder and admiration which their words and acts evoked in a 
populace that had seldom witnessed such demonstrations of religious 
transport and personal devotion--these, and many others, will forever 
remain associated with the history of that immortal period, intervening 
between the birth hour of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation and its 
announcement on the eve of His departure from &amp;Iraq.  
     Numerous and striking are the anecdotes which have been recounted 
by those whom duty, accident, or inclination had, in the 
course of these poignant years, brought into direct contact with 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  Many and moving are the testimonies of bystanders who 
were privileged to gaze on His countenance, observe His gait, or 
overhear His remarks, as He moved through the lanes and streets of 
the city, or paced the banks of the river; of the worshippers who 
watched Him pray in their mosques; of the mendicant, the sick, the 
aged, and the unfortunate whom He succored, healed, supported and 
comforted; of the visitors, from the haughtiest prince to the meanest 
beggar, who crossed His threshold and sat at His feet; of the merchant, 
the artisan, and the shopkeeper who waited upon Him and 
supplied His daily needs; of His devotees who had perceived the 
signs of His hidden glory; of His adversaries who were confounded 
 
+P136 
or disarmed by the power of His utterance and the warmth of His 
love; of the priests and laymen, the noble and learned, who besought 
Him with the intention of either challenging His authority, or testing 
His knowledge, or investigating His claims, or confessing their 
shortcomings, or declaring their conversion to the Cause He had 
espoused.  
     From such a treasury of precious memories it will suffice my 
purpose to cite but a single instance, that of one of His ardent lovers, 
a native of &amp;Zavarih, Siyyid &amp;Isma'il by name, surnamed &amp;Dhabih 
(the Sacrifice), formerly a noted divine, taciturn, meditative and 
wholly severed from every earthly tie, whose self-appointed task, on 
which he prided himself, was to sweep the approaches of the house 
in which &amp;Baha'u'llah was dwelling.  Unwinding his green turban, the 
ensign of his holy lineage, from his head, he would, at the hour of 
dawn, gather up, with infinite patience, the rubble which the footsteps 
of his Beloved had trodden, would blow the dust from the 
crannies of the wall adjacent to the door of that house, would collect 
the sweepings in the folds of his own cloak, and, scorning to cast 
his burden for the feet of others to tread upon, would carry it as far 
as the banks of the river and throw it into its waters.  Unable, at 
length, to contain the ocean of love that surged within his soul, he, 
after having denied himself for forty days both sleep and sustenance, 
and rendering for the last time the service so dear to his heart, 
betook himself, one day, to the banks of the river, on the road to 
&amp;Kazimayn, performed his ablutions, lay down on his back, with his 
face turned towards &amp;Baghdad, severed his throat with a razor, laid 
the razor upon his breast, and expired.  (1275 A.H.)  
     Nor was he the only one who had meditated such an act and 
was determined to carry it out.  Others were ready to follow suit, 
had not &amp;Baha'u'llah promptly intervened, and ordered the refugees 
living in &amp;Baghdad to return immediately to their native land.  Nor 
could the authorities, when it was definitely established that &amp;Dhabih 
had died by his own hand, remain indifferent to a Cause whose Leader 
could inspire so rare a devotion in, and hold such absolute sway 
over, the hearts of His lovers.  Apprized of the apprehensions that 
episode had evoked in certain quarters in &amp;Baghdad, &amp;Baha'u'llah is 
reported to have remarked:  "Siyyid &amp;Isma'il was possessed of such 
power and might that were he to be confronted by all the peoples 
of the earth, he would, without doubt, be able to establish his 
ascendancy over them."  "No blood," He is reported to have said 
with reference to this same &amp;Dhabih, whom He extolled as "King and 
 
+P137 
Beloved of Martyrs," "has, till now, been poured upon the earth as 
pure as the blood he shed."  
     "So intoxicated were those who had quaffed from the cup of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's presence," is yet another testimony from the pen of 
&amp;Nabil, who was himself an eye-witness of most of these stirring 
episodes, "that in their eyes the palaces of kings appeared more 
ephemeral than a spider's web....  The celebrations and festivities 
that were theirs were such as the kings of the earth had never dreamt 
of."  "I, myself with two others," he relates, "lived in a room which 
was devoid of furniture.  &amp;Baha'u'llah entered it one day, and, looking 
about Him, remarked: `Its emptiness pleases Me.  In My estimation 
it is preferable to many a spacious palace, inasmuch as the beloved 
of God are occupied in it with the remembrance of the Incomparable 
Friend, with hearts that are wholly emptied of the dross of this 
world.'"  His own life was characterized by that same austerity, 
and evinced that same simplicity which marked the lives of His 
beloved companions.  "There was a time in &amp;Iraq," He Himself affirms, 
in one of His Tablets, "when the Ancient Beauty ... had no change 
of linen.  The one shirt He possessed would be washed, dried and 
worn again."  
     "Many a night," continues &amp;Nabil, depicting the lives of those 
self-oblivious companions, "no less than ten persons subsisted on no 
more than a pennyworth of dates.  No one knew to whom actually 
belonged the shoes, the cloaks, or the robes that were to be found in 
their houses.  Whoever went to the bazaar could claim that the shoes 
upon his feet were his own, and each one who entered the presence 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah could affirm that the cloak and robe he then wore 
belonged to him.  Their own names they had forgotten, their hearts 
were emptied of aught else except adoration for their Beloved....  
O, for the joy of those days, and the gladness and wonder of those 
hours!"  
     The enormous expansion in the scope and volume of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
writings, after His return from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, is yet another distinguishing 
feature of the period under review.  The verses that 
streamed during those years from His pen, described as "a copious 
rain" by Himself, whether in the form of epistles, exhortations, commentaries, 
apologies, dissertations, prophecies, prayers, odes or specific 
Tablets, contributed, to a marked degree, to the reformation and 
progressive unfoldment of the &amp;Babi community, to the broadening 
of its outlook, to the expansion of its activities and to the enlightenment 
of the minds of its members.  So prolific was this period, that 
 
+P138 
during the first two years after His return from His retirement, 
according to the testimony of &amp;Nabil, who was at that time living in 
&amp;Baghdad, the unrecorded verses that streamed from His lips averaged, 
in a single day and night, the equivalent of the &amp;Qur'an!  As to those 
verses which He either dictated or wrote Himself, their number was 
no less remarkable than either the wealth of material they contained, 
or the diversity of subjects to which they referred.  A vast, and 
indeed the greater, proportion of these writings were, alas, lost irretrievably 
to posterity.  No less an authority than &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's amanuensis, affirms, as reported by &amp;Nabil, that by the 
express order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, hundreds of thousands of verses, mostly 
written by His own hand, were obliterated and cast into the river.  
"Finding me reluctant to execute His orders," &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan has 
related to &amp;Nabil, "&amp;Baha'u'llah would reassure me saying:  `None is 
to be found at this time worthy to hear these melodies.'  ...Not 
once, or twice, but innumerable times, was I commanded to repeat 
this act."  A certain &amp;Muhammad &amp;Karim, a native of &amp;Shiraz, who 
had been a witness to the rapidity and the manner in which the 
&amp;Bab had penned the verses with which He was inspired, has left the 
following testimony to posterity, after attaining, during those days, 
the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and beholding with his own eyes what 
he himself had considered to be the only proof of the mission of the 
Promised One:  "I bear witness that the verses revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
were superior, in the rapidity with which they were penned, in the 
ease with which they flowed, in their lucidity, their profundity and 
sweetness to those which I, myself saw pour from the pen of the 
&amp;Bab when in His presence.  Had &amp;Baha'u'llah no other claim to greatness, 
this were sufficient, in the eyes of the world and its people, that 
He produced such verses as have streamed this day from His pen."  
     Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing 
ocean of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation ranks the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan 
(Book of Certitude), revealed within the space of two days and two 
nights, in the closing years of that period (1278 A.H.--1862 A.D.).  
It was written in fulfillment of the prophecy of the &amp;Bab, Who had 
specifically stated that the Promised One would complete the text 
of the unfinished Persian &amp;Bayan, and in reply to the questions addressed 
to &amp;Baha'u'llah by the as yet unconverted maternal uncle of 
the &amp;Bab, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, while on a visit, with his 
brother, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan-'Ali, to &amp;Karbila.  A model of Persian 
prose, of a style at once original, chaste and vigorous, and remarkably 
lucid, both cogent in argument and matchless in its irresistible eloquence, 
 
+P139 
this Book, setting forth in outline the Grand Redemptive 
Scheme of God, occupies a position unequalled by any work in the entire 
range of &amp;Baha'i literature, except the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Most Holy Book.  Revealed on the eve of the declaration of His 
Mission, it proffered to mankind the "Choice Sealed Wine," whose 
seal is of "musk," and broke the "seals" of the "Book" referred to by 
Daniel, and disclosed the meaning of the "words" destined to remain 
"closed up" till the "time of the end."  
     Within a compass of two hundred pages it proclaims unequivocally 
the existence and oneness of a personal God, unknowable, 
inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent 
and almighty; asserts the relativity of religious truth and the 
continuity of Divine Revelation; affirms the unity of the Prophets, 
the universality of their Message, the identity of their fundamental 
teachings, the sanctity of their scriptures, and the twofold character 
of their stations; denounces the blindness and perversity of the divines 
and doctors of every age; cites and elucidates the allegorical passages 
of the New Testament, the abstruse verses of the &amp;Qur'an, and the 
cryptic &amp;Muhammadan traditions which have bred those age-long 
misunderstandings, doubts and animosities that have sundered and 
kept apart the followers of the world's leading religious systems; 
enumerates the essential prerequisites for the attainment by every 
true seeker of the object of his quest; demonstrates the validity, the 
sublimity and significance of the &amp;Bab's Revelation; acclaims the 
heroism and detachment of His disciples; foreshadows, and prophesies 
the world-wide triumph of the Revelation promised to the people 
of the &amp;Bayan; upholds the purity and innocence of the Virgin Mary; 
glorifies the &amp;Imams of the Faith of &amp;Muhammad; celebrates the 
martyrdom, and lauds the spiritual sovereignty, of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn; 
unfolds the meaning of such symbolic terms as "Return," "Resurrection," 
"Seal of the Prophets" and "Day of Judgment"; adumbrates 
and distinguishes between the three stages of Divine Revelation; and 
expatiates, in glowing terms, upon the glories and wonders of the 
"City of God," renewed, at fixed intervals, by the dispensation of 
Providence, for the guidance, the benefit and salvation of all mankind.  
Well may it be claimed that of all the books revealed by the 
Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation, this Book alone, by sweeping away 
the age-long barriers that have so insurmountably separated the great 
religions of the world, has laid down a broad and unassailable foundation 
for the complete and permanent reconciliation of their followers.  
     Next to this unique repository of inestimable treasures must rank 
 
+P140 
that marvelous collection of gem-like utterances, the "Hidden 
Words" with which &amp;Baha'u'llah was inspired, as He paced, wrapped in 
His meditations, the banks of the Tigris.  Revealed in the year 
1274 A.H., partly in Persian, partly in Arabic, it was originally 
designated the "Hidden Book of &amp;Fatimih," and was identified by its 
Author with the Book of that same name, believed by &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam 
to be in the possession of the promised &amp;Qa'im, and to consist of words 
of consolation addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God's command, 
to &amp;Fatimih, and dictated to the &amp;Imam &amp;Ali, for the sole purpose of 
comforting her in her hour of bitter anguish after the death of her 
illustrious Father.  The significance of this dynamic spiritual leaven 
cast into the life of the world for the reorientation of the minds of 
men, the edification of their souls and the rectification of their conduct 
can best be judged by the description of its character given in 
the opening passage by its Author:  "This is that which hath descended 
from the Realm of Glory, uttered by the tongue of power and might, 
and revealed unto the Prophets of old.  We have taken the inner 
essence thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token 
of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the 
Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in the realm 
of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue."  
     To these two outstanding contributions to the world's religious 
literature, occupying respectively, positions of unsurpassed preeminence 
among the doctrinal and ethical writings of the Author of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation, was added, during that same period, a treatise 
that may well be regarded as His greatest mystical composition, designated 
as the "Seven Valleys," which He wrote in answer to the questions 
of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhyi'd-Din, the &amp;Qadi of &amp;Khaniqayn, in which He 
describes the seven stages which the soul of the seeker must needs 
traverse ere it can attain the object of its existence.  
     The "Four Valleys," an epistle addressed to the learned &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Abdu'r-Rahman-i-Karkuti; the "Tablet of the Holy Mariner," in 
which &amp;Baha'u'llah prophesies the severe afflictions that are to befall 
Him; the "&amp;Lawh-i-Huriyyih" (Tablet of the Maiden), in which 
events of a far remoter future are foreshadowed; the "&amp;Suriy-i-Sabr" 
(&amp;Surih of Patience), revealed on the first day of &amp;Ridvan which 
extols &amp;Vahid and his fellow-sufferers in &amp;Nayriz; the commentary on 
the Letters prefixed to the &amp;Surihs of the &amp;Qur'an; His interpretation 
of the letter &amp;Vav, mentioned in the writings of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i, 
and of other abstruse passages in the works of Siyyid 
&amp;Kazim-i-Rashti; the "&amp;Lawh-i-Madinatu't-Tawhid" (Tablet of the 
 
+P141 
City of Unity); the "&amp;Sahifiy-i-Shattiyyih"; the 
"&amp;Musibat-i-Hurufat-i-'Aliyat"; the "&amp;Tafsir-i-Hu"; the "&amp;Javahiru'l-Asrar" and 
a host of other writings, in the form of epistles, odes, homilies, specific 
Tablets, commentaries and prayers, contributed, each in its own way, to swell 
the "rivers of everlasting life" which poured forth from the "Abode 
of Peace" and lent a mighty impetus to the expansion of the &amp;Bab's 
Faith in both Persia and &amp;Iraq, quickening the souls and transforming 
the character of its adherents.  
     The undeniable evidences of the range and magnificence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's rising power; His rapidly waxing prestige; the miraculous 
transformation which, by precept and example, He had effected 
in the outlook and character of His companions from &amp;Baghdad to 
the remotest towns and hamlets in Persia; the consuming love for 
Him that glowed in their bosoms; the prodigious volume of writings 
that streamed day and night from His pen, could not fail to fan 
into flame the animosity which smouldered in the breasts of His 
&amp;Shi'ah and &amp;Sunni enemies.  Now that His residence was transferred 
to the vicinity of the strongholds of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, and He Himself 
brought into direct and almost daily contact with the fanatical 
pilgrims who thronged the holy places of Najaf, &amp;Karbila and &amp;Kazimayn, 
a trial of strength between the growing brilliance of His glory 
and the dark and embattled forces of religious fanaticism could no 
longer be delayed.  A spark was all that was required to ignite this 
combustible material of all the accumulated hatreds, fears and jealousies 
which the revived activities of the &amp;Babis had inspired.  This 
was provided by a certain &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'l-Husayn, a crafty and 
obstinate priest, whose consuming jealousy of &amp;Baha'u'llah was surpassed 
only by his capacity to stir up mischief both among those of 
high degree and also amongst the lowest of the low, Arab or Persian, 
who thronged the streets and markets of &amp;Kazimayn, &amp;Karbila and 
&amp;Baghdad.  He it was whom &amp;Baha'u'llah had stigmatized in His Tablets 
by such epithets as the "scoundrel," the "schemer," the "wicked one," 
who "drew the sword of his self against the face of God," "in whose 
soul Satan hath whispered," and "from whose impiety Satan flies," 
the "depraved one," "from whom originated and to whom will return 
all infidelity, cruelty and crime."  Largely through the efforts of the 
Grand Vizir, who wished to get rid of him, this troublesome mujtahid 
had been commissioned by the &amp;Shah to proceed to &amp;Karbila to repair 
the holy sites in that city.  Watching for his opportunity, he allied 
himself with &amp;Mirza Buzurg &amp;Khan, a newly-appointed Persian consul-general, 
who being of the same iniquitous turn of mind as himself,  
 
+P142 
a man of mean intelligence, insincere, without foresight or honor, 
and a confirmed drunkard, soon fell a prey to the influence of that 
vicious plotter, and became the willing instrument of his designs.  
     Their first concerted endeavor was to obtain from the governor 
of &amp;Baghdad, &amp;Mustafa &amp;Pasha, through a gross distortion of the truth, 
an order for the extradition of &amp;Baha'u'llah and His companions, an 
effort which miserably failed.  Recognizing the futility of any 
attempt to achieve his purpose through the intervention of the local 
authorities, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'l-Husayn began, through the sedulous circulation 
of dreams which he first invented and then interpreted, to 
excite the passions of a superstitious and highly inflammable population.  
The resentment engendered by the lack of response he met with 
was aggravated by his ignominious failure to meet the challenge of 
an interview pre-arranged between himself and &amp;Baha'u'llah.  &amp;Mirza 
Buzurg &amp;Khan, on his part, used his influence in order to arouse the 
animosity of the lower elements of the population against the common 
Adversary, by inciting them to affront Him in public, in the 
hope of provoking some rash retaliatory act that could be used as 
a ground for false charges through which the desired order for 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's extradition might be procured.  This attempt too proved 
abortive, as the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, Who, despite the warnings 
and pleadings of His friends, continued to walk unescorted, both by 
day and by night, through the streets of the city, was enough to 
plunge His would-be molesters into consternation and shame.  Well 
aware of their motives, He would approach them, rally them on their 
intentions, joke with them, and leave them covered with confusion 
and firmly resolved to abandon whatever schemes they had in mind.  
The consul-general had even gone so far as to hire a ruffian, a Turk, 
named &amp;Rida, for the sum of one hundred &amp;tumans, provide him with 
a horse and with two pistols, and order him to seek out and kill 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, promising him that his own protection would be fully 
assured.  &amp;Rida, learning one day that his would-be-victim was attending 
the public bath, eluded the vigilance of the &amp;Babis in attendance, 
entered the bath with a pistol concealed in his cloak, and confronted 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in the inner chamber, only to discover that he lacked 
the courage to accomplish his task.  He himself, years later, related 
that on another occasion he was lying in wait for &amp;Baha'u'llah, pistol 
in hand, when, on &amp;Baha'u'llah's approach, he was so overcome with 
fear that the pistol dropped from his hand; whereupon &amp;Baha'u'llah 
bade &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, who accompanied Him, to hand it back to him, 
and show him the way to his home.  
 
+P143 
     Balked in his repeated attempts to achieve his malevolent purpose, 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'l-Husayn now diverted his energies into a new 
channel.  He promised his accomplice he would raise him to the rank 
of a minister of the crown, if he succeeded in inducing the government 
to recall &amp;Baha'u'llah to &amp;Tihran, and cast Him again into prison.  
He despatched lengthy and almost daily reports to the immediate 
entourage of the &amp;Shah.  He painted extravagant pictures of the 
ascendancy enjoyed by &amp;Baha'u'llah by representing Him as having 
won the allegiance of the nomadic tribes of &amp;Iraq.  He claimed that 
He was in a position to muster, in a day, fully one hundred thousand 
men ready to take up arms at His bidding.  He accused Him of 
meditating, in conjunction with various leaders in Persia, an insurrection 
against the sovereign.  By such means as these he succeeded in 
bringing sufficient pressure on the authorities in &amp;Tihran to induce 
the &amp;Shah to grant him a mandate, bestowing on him full powers, 
and enjoining the Persian &amp;ulamas and functionaries to render him 
every assistance.  This mandate the &amp;Shaykh instantly forwarded to 
the ecclesiastics of Najaf and &amp;Karbila, asking them to convene a 
gathering in &amp;Kazimayn, the place of his residence.  A concourse of 
&amp;shaykhs, &amp;mullas and mujtahids, eager to curry favor with the sovereign, 
promptly responded.  Upon being informed of the purpose 
for which they had been summoned, they determined to declare a 
holy war against the colony of exiles, and by launching a sudden 
and general assault on it to destroy the Faith at its heart.  To their 
amazement and disappointment, however, they found that the leading 
mujtahid amongst them, the celebrated &amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtaday-i-Ansari, 
a man renowned for his tolerance, his wisdom, his undeviating 
justice, his piety and nobility of character, refused, when apprized 
of their designs, to pronounce the necessary sentence against the 
&amp;Babis.  He it was whom &amp;Baha'u'llah later extolled in the "&amp;Lawh-i-Sultan," 
and numbered among "those doctors who have indeed drunk 
of the cup of renunciation," and "never interfered with Him," and 
to whom &amp;Abdu'l-Baha referred as "the illustrious and erudite doctor, 
the noble and celebrated scholar, the seal of seekers after truth."  
Pleading insufficient knowledge of the tenets of this community, and 
claiming to have witnessed no act on the part of its members at 
variance with the &amp;Qur'an, he, disregarding the remonstrances of his 
colleagues, abruptly left the gathering, and returned to Najaf, after 
having expressed, through a messenger, his regret to &amp;Baha'u'llah for 
what had happened, and his devout wish for His protection.  
     Frustrated in their designs, but unrelenting in their hostility, the 
 
+P144 
assembled divines delegated the learned and devout &amp;Haji &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Hasan-i-'Ammu, recognized for his integrity and wisdom, to submit 
various questions to &amp;Baha'u'llah for elucidation.  When these were 
submitted, and answers completely satisfactory to the messenger were 
given, &amp;Haji &amp;Mulla &amp;Hasan, affirming the recognition by the &amp;ulamas 
of the vastness of the knowledge of &amp;Baha'u'llah, asked, as an evidence 
of the truth of His mission, for a miracle that would satisfy completely 
all concerned.  "Although you have no right to ask this," 
&amp;Baha'u'llah replied, "for God should test His creatures, and they 
should not test God, still I allow and accept this request....  The 
&amp;ulamas must assemble, and, with one accord, choose one miracle, and 
write that, after the performance of this miracle they will no longer 
entertain doubts about Me, and that all will acknowledge and confess 
the truth of My Cause.  Let them seal this paper, and bring it 
to Me.  This must be the accepted criterion:  if the miracle is performed, 
no doubt will remain for them; and if not, We shall be 
convicted of imposture."  This clear, challenging and courageous 
reply, unexampled in the annals of any religion, and addressed to 
the most illustrious &amp;Shi'ah divines, assembled in their time-honored 
stronghold, was so satisfactory to their envoy that he instantly arose, 
kissed the knee of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and departed to deliver His message.  
Three days later he sent word that that august assemblage had failed 
to arrive at a decision, and had chosen to drop the matter, a decision 
to which he himself later gave wide publicity, in the course of his visit 
to Persia, and even communicated it in person to the then Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, &amp;Mirza &amp;Sa'id &amp;Khan.  "We have," &amp;Baha'u'llah is 
reported to have commented, when informed of their reaction to 
this challenge, "through this all-satisfying, all-embracing message 
which We sent, revealed and vindicated the miracles of all the 
Prophets, inasmuch as We left the choice to the &amp;ulamas themselves, 
undertaking to reveal whatever they would decide upon."  "If we 
carefully examine the text of the Bible," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has written 
concerning a similar challenge made later by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the 
"&amp;Lawh-i-Sultan," "we see that the Divine Manifestation never said 
to those who denied Him, `whatever miracle you desire, I am ready 
to perform, and I will submit to whatever test you propose.'  But 
in the Epistle to the &amp;Shah &amp;Baha'u'llah said clearly, `Gather the &amp;ulamas 
and summon Me, that the evidences and proofs may be established.'"  
     Seven years of uninterrupted, of patient and eminently successful 
consolidation were now drawing to a close.  A shepherdless community, 
subjected to a prolonged and tremendous strain, from both 
 
+P145 
within and without, and threatened with obliteration, had been 
resuscitated, and risen to an ascendancy without example in the 
course of its twenty years' history.  Its foundations reinforced, its 
spirit exalted, its outlook transformed, its leadership safeguarded, its 
fundamentals restated, its prestige enhanced, its enemies discomfited, 
the Hand of Destiny was gradually preparing to launch it on a new 
phase in its checkered career, in which weal and woe alike were to 
carry it through yet another stage in its evolution.  The Deliverer, 
the sole hope, and the virtually recognized leader of this community, 
Who had consistently overawed the authors of so many plots to 
assassinate Him, Who had scornfully rejected all the timid advice 
that He should flee from the scene of danger, Who had firmly declined 
repeated and generous offers made by friends and supporters 
to insure His personal safety, Who had won so conspicuous a victory 
over His antagonists--He was, at this auspicious hour, being impelled 
by the resistless processes of His unfolding Mission, to transfer His 
residence to the center of still greater preeminence, the capital city 
of the Ottoman Empire, the seat of the Caliphate, the administrative 
center of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam, the abode of the most powerful potentate in 
the Islamic world.  
     He had already flung a daring challenge to the sacerdotal order 
represented by the eminent ecclesiastics residing in Najaf, &amp;Karbila 
and &amp;Kazimayn.  He was now, while in the vicinity of the court of 
His royal adversary, to offer a similar challenge to the recognized 
head of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam, as well as to the sovereign of Persia, the trustee 
of the hidden &amp;Imam.  The entire company of the kings of the earth, 
and in particular the &amp;Sultan and his ministers, were, moreover, to 
be addressed by Him, appealed to and warned, while the kings of 
Christendom and the &amp;Sunni hierarchy were to be severely admonished.  
Little wonder that the exiled Bearer of a newly-announced 
Revelation should have, in anticipation of the future splendor of 
the Lamp of His Faith, after its removal from &amp;Iraq, uttered these 
prophetic words:  "It will shine resplendently within another globe, 
as predestined by Him who is the Omnipotent, the Ancient of Days.  
...That the Spirit should depart out of the body of &amp;Iraq is indeed 
a wondrous sign unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.  
Erelong will ye behold this Divine Youth riding upon the steed of 
victory.  Then will the hearts of the envious be seized with 
trembling."  
     The predestined hour of &amp;Baha'u'llah's departure from &amp;Iraq having 
now struck, the process whereby it could be accomplished was set 
 
+P146 
in motion.  The nine months of unremitting endeavor exerted by 
His enemies, and particularly by &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abdu'l-Husayn and his 
confederate &amp;Mirza Buzurg &amp;Khan, were about to yield their fruit.  
&amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah and his ministers, on the one hand, and the Persian 
Ambassador in Constantinople, on the other, were incessantly urged 
to take immediate action to insure &amp;Baha'u'llah's removal from 
&amp;Baghdad.  Through gross misrepresentation of the true situation and 
the dissemination of alarming reports a malignant and energetic 
enemy finally succeeded in persuading the &amp;Shah to instruct his foreign 
minister, &amp;Mirza &amp;Sa'id &amp;Khan, to direct the Persian Ambassador at the 
Sublime Porte, &amp;Mirza &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, a close friend of &amp;Ali &amp;Pasha, 
the Grand Vizir of the &amp;Sultan, and of &amp;Fu'ad &amp;Pasha, the Minister of 
foreign affairs, to induce &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz to order the immediate 
transfer of &amp;Baha'u'llah to a place remote from &amp;Baghdad, on the 
ground that His continued residence in that city, adjacent to Persian 
territory and close to so important a center of &amp;Shi'ah pilgrimage, constituted 
a direct menace to the security of Persia and its government.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Sa'id &amp;Khan, in his communication to the Ambassador, 
stigmatized the Faith as a "misguided and detestable sect," deplored 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's release from the &amp;Siyah-Chal, and denounced Him as 
one who did not cease from "secretly corrupting and misleading 
foolish persons and ignorant weaklings."  "In accordance with the 
royal command," he wrote, "I, your faithful friend, have been ordered 
... to instruct you to seek, without delay, an appointment 
with their Excellencies, the &amp;Sadr-i-A'zam and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs ... to request ... the removal of this source of mischief from 
a center like &amp;Baghdad, which is the meeting-place of many different 
peoples, and is situated near the frontiers of the provinces of Persia."  
In that same letter, quoting a celebrated verse, he writes:  "`I see 
beneath the ashes the glow of fire, and it wants but little to burst 
into a blaze,'" thus betraying his fears and seeking to instill them 
into his correspondent.  
     Encouraged by the presence on the throne of a monarch who 
had delegated much of his powers to his ministers, and aided by certain 
foreign ambassadors and ministers in Constantinople, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, by dint of much persuasion and the friendly pressure 
he brought to bear on these ministers, succeeded in securing the sanction 
of the &amp;Sultan for the transfer of &amp;Baha'u'llah and His companions 
(who had in the meantime been forced by circumstances to change 
their citizenship) to Constantinople.  It is even reported that the 
first request the Persian authorities made of a friendly Power, after 
 
+P147 
the accession of the new &amp;Sultan to the throne, was for its active and 
prompt intervention in this matter.  
     It was on the fifth of &amp;Naw-Ruz (1863), while &amp;Baha'u'llah was 
celebrating that festival in the &amp;Mazra'iy-i-Vashshash, in the outskirts 
of &amp;Baghdad, and had just revealed the "Tablet of the Holy Mariner," 
whose gloomy prognostications had aroused the grave apprehensions 
of His Companions, that an emissary of &amp;Namiq &amp;Pasha arrived and 
delivered into His hands a communication requesting an interview 
between Him and the governor.  
     Already, as &amp;Nabil has pointed out in his narrative, &amp;Baha'u'llah 
had, in the course of His discourses, during the last years of His 
sojourn in &amp;Baghdad, alluded to the period of trial and turmoil that 
was inexorably approaching, exhibiting a sadness and heaviness of 
heart which greatly perturbed those around Him.  A dream which 
He had at that time, the ominous character of which could not be 
mistaken, served to confirm the fears and misgivings that had assailed 
His companions.  "I saw," He wrote in a Tablet, "the Prophets and 
the Messengers gather and seat themselves around Me, moaning, weeping 
and loudly lamenting.  Amazed, I inquired of them the reason, 
whereupon their lamentation and weeping waxed greater, and they 
said unto me:  `We weep for Thee, O Most Great Mystery, O Tabernacle 
of Immortality!'  They wept with such a weeping that I too 
wept with them.  Thereupon the Concourse on high addressed Me 
saying:  `...Erelong shalt Thou behold with Thine own eyes what 
no Prophet hath beheld....  Be patient, be patient.'...  They continued 
addressing Me the whole night until the approach of dawn."  
"Oceans of sorrow," &amp;Nabil affirms, "surged in the hearts of the listeners 
when the Tablet of the Holy Mariner was read aloud to them....  
It was evident to every one that the chapter of &amp;Baghdad was about 
to be closed, and a new one opened, in its stead.  No sooner had that 
Tablet been chanted than &amp;Baha'u'llah ordered that the tents which 
had been pitched should be folded up, and that all His companions 
should return to the city.  While the tents were being removed He 
observed:  `These tents may be likened to the trappings of this world, 
which no sooner are they spread out than the time cometh for them 
to be rolled up.'  From these words of His they who heard them 
perceived that these tents would never again be pitched on that spot.  
They had not yet been taken away when the messenger arrived 
from &amp;Baghdad to deliver the afore-mentioned communication from 
the governor."  
     By the following day the Deputy-Governor had delivered to 
 
+P148 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in a mosque, in the neighborhood of the governor's house, 
&amp;Ali &amp;Pasha's letter, addressed to &amp;Namiq &amp;Pasha, couched in courteous 
language, inviting &amp;Baha'u'llah to proceed, as a guest of the Ottoman 
government, to Constantinople, placing a sum of money at His 
disposal, and ordering a mounted escort to accompany Him for His 
protection.  To this request &amp;Baha'u'llah gave His ready assent, but 
declined to accept the sum offered Him.  On the urgent representations 
of the Deputy that such a refusal would offend the authorities, 
He reluctantly consented to receive the generous allowance set aside 
for His use, and distributed it, that same day, among the poor.  
     The effect upon the colony of exiles of this sudden intelligence 
was instantaneous and overwhelming.  "That day," wrote an eyewitness, 
describing the reaction of the community to the news of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's approaching departure, "witnessed a commotion associated 
with the turmoil of the Day of Resurrection.  Methinks, the 
very gates and walls of the city wept aloud at their imminent separation 
from the &amp;Abha Beloved.  The first night mention was made of 
His intended departure His loved ones, one and all, renounced both 
sleep and food....  Not a soul amongst them could be tranquillized.  
Many had resolved that in the event of their being deprived of the 
bounty of accompanying Him, they would, without hesitation, kill 
themselves....  Gradually, however, through the words which He addressed 
them, and through His exhortations and His loving-kindness, 
they were calmed and resigned themselves to His good-pleasure."  
For every one of them, whether Arab or Persian, man or woman, 
child or adult, who lived in &amp;Baghdad, He revealed during those days, 
in His own hand, a separate Tablet.  In most of these Tablets He 
predicted the appearance of the "Calf" and of the "Birds of the 
Night," allusions to those who, as anticipated in the Tablet of the 
Holy Mariner, and foreshadowed in the dream quoted above, were 
to raise the standard of rebellion and precipitate the gravest crisis in 
the history of the Faith.  
     Twenty-seven days after that mournful Tablet had been so unexpectedly 
revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, and the fateful communication, 
presaging His departure to Constantinople had been delivered into 
His hands, on a Wednesday afternoon (April 22, 1863), thirty-one 
days after &amp;Naw-Ruz, on the third of &amp;Dhi'l-Qa'dih, 1279 A.H., He 
set forth on the first stage of His four months' journey to the capital 
of the Ottoman Empire.  That historic day, forever after designated 
as the first day of the &amp;Ridvan Festival, the culmination of innumerable 
farewell visits which friends and acquaintances of every class 
 
+P149 
and denomination, had been paying him, was one the like of which 
the inhabitants of &amp;Baghdad had rarely beheld.  A concourse of people 
of both sexes and of every age, comprising friends and strangers 
Arabs, Kurds and Persians, notables and clerics, officials and merchants, 
as well as many of the lower classes, the poor, the orphaned, 
the outcast, some surprised, others heartbroken, many tearful and 
apprehensive, a few impelled by curiosity or secret satisfaction, 
thronged the approaches of His house, eager to catch a final glimpse 
of One Who, for a decade, had, through precept and example, exercised 
so potent an influence on so large a number of the heterogeneous 
inhabitants of their city.  
     Leaving for the last time, amidst weeping and lamentation, His 
"Most Holy Habitation," out of which had "gone forth the breath 
of the All-Glorious," and from which had poured forth, in "ceaseless 
strains," the "melody of the All-Merciful," and dispensing on His 
way with a lavish hand a last alms to the poor He had so faithfully 
befriended, and uttering words of comfort to the disconsolate who 
besought Him on every side, He, at length, reached the banks of the 
river, and was ferried across, accompanied by His sons and amanuensis, 
to the &amp;Najibiyyih Garden, situated on the opposite shore.  
"O My companions," He thus addressed the faithful band that surrounded 
Him before He embarked, "I entrust to your keeping this 
city of &amp;Baghdad, in the state ye now behold it, when from the eyes 
of friends and strangers alike, crowding its housetops, its streets and 
markets, tears like the rain of spring are flowing down, and I depart.  
With you it now rests to watch lest your deeds and conduct dim the 
flame of love that gloweth within the breasts of its inhabitants."  
     The muezzin had just raised the afternoon call to prayer when 
&amp;Baha'u'llah entered the &amp;Najibiyyih Garden, where He tarried twelve 
days before His final departure from the city.  There His friends 
and companions, arriving in successive waves, attained His presence 
and bade Him, with feelings of profound sorrow, their last farewell.  
Outstanding among them was the renowned &amp;Alusi, the &amp;Mufti of 
&amp;Baghdad, who, with eyes dimmed with tears, execrated the name of 
&amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, whom he deemed to be primarily responsible for 
so unmerited a banishment.  "I have ceased to regard him," he openly 
asserted, "as &amp;Nasiri'd-Din (the helper of the Faith), but consider 
him rather to be its wrecker."  Another distinguished visitor was the 
governor himself, &amp;Namiq &amp;Pasha, who, after expressing in the most 
respectful terms his regret at the developments which had precipitated 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's departure, and assuring Him of his readiness to 
 
+P150 
aid Him in any way he could, handed to the officer appointed to 
accompany Him a written order, commanding the governors of the 
provinces through which the exiles would be passing to extend to 
them the utmost consideration.  "Whatever you require," he, after 
profuse apologies, informed &amp;Baha'u'llah, "you have but to command.  
We are ready to carry it out."  "Extend thy consideration to Our 
loved ones," was the reply to his insistent and reiterated offers, "and 
deal with them with kindness"--a request to which he gave his 
warm and unhesitating assent.  
     Small wonder that, in the face of so many evidences of deep-seated 
devotion, sympathy and esteem, so strikingly manifested by 
high and low alike, from the time &amp;Baha'u'llah announced His contemplated 
journey to the day of His departure from the &amp;Najibiyyih 
Garden--small wonder that those who had so tirelessly sought to 
secure the order for His banishment, and had rejoiced at the success 
of their efforts, should now have bitterly regretted their act.  "Such 
hath been the interposition of God," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, in a letter written 
by Him from that garden, with reference to these enemies, affirms, 
"that the joy evinced by them hath been turned to chagrin and sorrow, 
so much so that the Persian consul-general in &amp;Baghdad regrets 
exceedingly the plans and plots the schemers had devised.  &amp;Namiq 
&amp;Pasha himself, on the day he called on Him (&amp;Baha'u'llah) stated:  
`Formerly they insisted upon your departure.  Now, however, they 
are even more insistent that you should remain.'"  
 
+P151 
                                  CHAPTER IX 
               The Declaration of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Mission and His 
                          Journey to Constantinople 
 
     The arrival of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Najibiyyih Garden, subsequently 
designated by His followers the Garden of &amp;Ridvan, signalizes 
the commencement of what has come to be recognized as the holiest 
and most significant of all &amp;Baha'i festivals, the festival commemorating 
the Declaration of His Mission to His companions.  So momentous 
a Declaration may well be regarded both as the logical consummation 
of that revolutionizing process which was initiated by Himself upon 
His return from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, and as a prelude to the final proclamation 
of that same Mission to the world and its rulers from Adrianople.  
     Through that solemn act the "delay," of no less than a decade, 
divinely interposed between the birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation in 
the &amp;Siyah-Chal and its announcement to the &amp;Bab's disciples, was at 
long last terminated.  The "set time of concealment," during which 
as He Himself has borne witness, the "signs and tokens of a divinely-appointed 
Revelation" were being showered upon Him, was fulfilled.  
The "myriad veils of light," within which His glory had been wrapped, 
were, at that historic hour, partially lifted, vouchsafing to mankind 
"an infinitesimal glimmer" of the effulgence of His "peerless, His 
most sacred and exalted Countenance."  The "thousand two hundred 
and ninety days," fixed by Daniel in the last chapter of His Book, as 
the duration of the "abomination that maketh desolate" had now 
elapsed.  The "hundred lunar years," destined to immediately precede 
that blissful consummation (1335 days), announced by Daniel in 
that same chapter, had commenced.  The nineteen years, constituting 
the first "&amp;Vahid," preordained in the Persian &amp;Bayan by the pen of 
the &amp;Bab, had been completed.  The Lord of the Kingdom, Jesus Christ 
returned in the glory of the Father, was about to ascend His throne, 
and assume the sceptre of a world-embracing, indestructible sovereignty.  
The community of the Most Great Name, the "companions 
of the Crimson Colored Ark," lauded in glowing terms in the 
&amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', had visibly emerged.  The &amp;Bab's own prophecy 
regarding the "&amp;Ridvan," the scene of the unveiling of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
transcendent glory, had been literally fulfilled.  
 
+P152 
     Undaunted by the prospect of the appalling adversities which, as 
predicted by Himself, were soon to overtake Him; on the eve of a 
second banishment which would be fraught with many hazards and 
perils, and would bring Him still farther from His native land, the 
cradle of His Faith, to a country alien in race, in language and in 
culture; acutely conscious of the extension of the circle of His 
adversaries, among whom were soon to be numbered a monarch more 
despotic than &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, and ministers no less unyielding in 
their hostility than either &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi or the &amp;Amir-Nizam; 
undeterred by the perpetual interruptions occasioned by the influx 
of a host of visitors who thronged His tent, &amp;Baha'u'llah chose in that 
critical and seemingly unpropitious hour to advance so challenging a 
claim, to lay bare the mystery surrounding His person, and to 
assume, in their plenitude, the power and the authority which were 
the exclusive privileges of the One Whose advent the &amp;Bab had 
prophesied.  
     Already the shadow of that great oncoming event had fallen 
upon the colony of exiles, who awaited expectantly its consummation.  
As the year "eighty" steadily and inexorably approached, He 
Who had become the real leader of that community increasingly 
experienced, and progressively communicated to His future followers, 
the onrushing influences of its informing force.  The festive, the 
soul-entrancing odes which He revealed almost every day; the Tablets, 
replete with hints, which streamed from His pen; the allusions which, 
in private converse and public discourse, He made to the approaching 
hour; the exaltation which in moments of joy and sadness alike flooded 
His soul; the ecstasy which filled His lovers, already enraptured by 
the multiplying evidences of His rising greatness and glory; the 
perceptible change noted in His demeanor; and finally, His adoption 
of the &amp;taj (tall felt head-dress), on the day of His departure from 
His Most Holy House--all proclaimed unmistakably His imminent 
assumption of the prophetic office and of His open leadership of the 
community of the &amp;Bab's followers.  
     "Many a night," writes &amp;Nabil, depicting the tumult that had 
seized the hearts of &amp;Baha'u'llah's companions, in the days prior to the 
declaration of His mission, "would &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan gather them 
together in his room, close the door, light numerous camphorated 
candles, and chant aloud to them the newly revealed odes and Tablets 
in his possession.  Wholly oblivious of this contingent world, 
completely immersed in the realms of the spirit, forgetful of the 
necessity for food, sleep or drink, they would suddenly discover 
 
+P153 
that night had become day, and that the sun was approaching its 
zenith."  
     Of the exact circumstances attending that epoch-making Declaration 
we, alas, are but scantily informed.  The words &amp;Baha'u'llah actually 
uttered on that occasion, the manner of His Declaration, the 
reaction it produced, its impact on &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, the identity of those 
who were privileged to hear Him, are shrouded in an obscurity which 
future historians will find it difficult to penetrate.  The fragmentary 
description left to posterity by His chronicler &amp;Nabil is one of the 
very few authentic records we possess of the memorable days He 
spent in that garden.  "Every day," &amp;Nabil has related, "ere the hour 
of dawn, the gardeners would pick the roses which lined the four 
avenues of the garden, and would pile them in the center of the floor 
of His blessed tent.  So great would be the heap that when His companions 
gathered to drink their morning tea in His presence, they 
would be unable to see each other across it.  All these roses &amp;Baha'u'llah 
would, with His own hands, entrust to those whom He dismissed 
from His presence every morning to be delivered, on His behalf, to 
His Arab and Persian friends in the city."  "One night," he continues, 
"the ninth night of the waxing moon, I happened to be one of 
those who watched beside His blessed tent.  As the hour of midnight 
approached, I saw Him issue from His tent, pass by the places where 
some of His companions were sleeping, and begin to pace up and 
down the moonlit, flower-bordered avenues of the garden.  So loud 
was the singing of the nightingales on every side that only those who 
were near Him could hear distinctly His voice.  He continued to 
walk until, pausing in the midst of one of these avenues, He observed:  
`Consider these nightingales.  So great is their love for these roses, that 
sleepless from dusk till dawn, they warble their melodies and commune 
with burning passion with the object of their adoration.  How 
then can those who claim to be afire with the rose-like beauty of the 
Beloved choose to sleep?'  For three successive nights I watched and 
circled round His blessed tent.  Every time I passed by the couch 
whereon He lay, I would find Him wakeful, and every day, from 
morn till eventide, I would see Him ceaselessly engaged in conversing 
with the stream of visitors who kept flowing in from &amp;Baghdad.  Not 
once could I discover in the words He spoke any trace of dissimulation."  
     As to the significance of that Declaration let &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself 
reveal to us its import.  Acclaiming that historic occasion as the 
"Most Great Festival," the "King of Festivals," the "Festival of God," 
 
+P154 
He has, in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, characterized it as the Day whereon 
"all created things were immersed in the sea of purification," whilst 
in one of His specific Tablets, He has referred to it as the Day whereon 
"the breezes of forgiveness were wafted over the entire creation."  
"Rejoice, with exceeding gladness, O people of &amp;Baha!", He, in another 
Tablet, has written, "as ye call to remembrance the Day of supreme 
felicity, the Day whereon the Tongue of the Ancient of Days hath 
spoken, as He departed from His House proceeding to the Spot from 
which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of His Name, 
the All-Merciful...  Were We to reveal the hidden secrets of that 
Day, all that dwell on earth and in the heavens would swoon away 
and die, except such as will be preserved by God, the Almighty, the 
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.  Such is the inebriating effect of the 
words of God upon the Revealer of His undoubted proofs that His 
pen can move no longer."  And again:  "The Divine Springtime is 
come, O Most Exalted Pen, for the Festival of the All-Merciful is 
fast approaching....  The Day-Star of Blissfulness shineth above the 
horizon of Our Name, the Blissful, inasmuch as the Kingdom of the 
Name of God hath been adorned with the ornament of the Name of 
Thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens....  Take heed lest anything 
deter Thee from extolling the greatness of this Day--the Day whereon 
the Finger of Majesty and Power hath opened the seal of the Wine of 
Reunion, and called all who are in the heavens and all who are on 
earth....  This is the Day whereon the unseen world crieth out:  
`Great is thy blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been made the footstool 
of thy God, and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne' 
...Say ... He it is Who hath laid bare before you the hidden and 
treasured Gem, were ye to seek it.  He it is who is the One Beloved of 
all things, whether of the past or of the future."  And yet again:  
"Arise, and proclaim unto the entire creation the tidings that He who 
is the All-Merciful hath directed His steps towards the &amp;Ridvan and 
entered it.  Guide, then, the people unto the Garden of Delight which 
God hath made the Throne of His Paradise...  Within this Paradise, 
and from the heights of its loftiest chambers, the Maids of Heaven 
have cried out and shouted:  `Rejoice, ye dwellers of the realms above, 
for the fingers of Him Who is the Ancient of Days are ringing, in the 
name of the All-Glorious, the Most Great Bell, in the midmost heart 
of the heavens.  The hands of bounty have borne round the cups of 
everlasting life.  Approach, and quaff your fill.'"  And finally:  
"Forget the world of creation, O Pen, and turn Thou towards the 
face of Thy Lord, the Lord of all names.  Adorn, then, the world 
 
+P155 
with the ornament of the favors of Thy Lord, the King of everlasting 
days.  For We perceive the fragrance of the Day whereon He Who is 
the Desire of all nations hath shed upon the kingdoms of the unseen 
and of the seen the splendors of the light of His most excellent names, 
and enveloped them with the radiance of the luminaries of His most 
gracious favors, favors which none can reckon except Him Who is 
the Omnipotent Protector of the entire creation."  
     The departure of &amp;Baha'u'llah from the Garden of &amp;Ridvan, at 
noon, on the 14th of &amp;Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1279 A.H. (May 3, 1863), witnessed 
scenes of tumultuous enthusiasm no less spectacular, and even 
more touching, than those which greeted Him when leaving His 
Most Great House in &amp;Baghdad.  "The great tumult," wrote an eyewitness, 
"associated in our minds with the Day of Gathering, the Day 
of Judgment, we beheld on that occasion.  Believers and unbelievers 
alike sobbed and lamented.  The chiefs and notables who had congregated 
were struck with wonder.  Emotions were stirred to such 
depths as no tongue can describe, nor could any observer escape 
their contagion."  
     Mounted on His steed, a red roan stallion of the finest breed, 
the best His lovers could purchase for Him, and leaving behind Him a 
bowing multitude of fervent admirers, He rode forth on the first 
stage of a journey that was to carry Him to the city of Constantinople.  
"Numerous were the heads," &amp;Nabil himself a witness of that memorable 
scene, recounts, "which, on every side, bowed to the dust at 
the feet of His horse, and kissed its hoofs, and countless were those 
who pressed forward to embrace His stirrups."  "How great the 
number of those embodiments of fidelity," testifies a fellow-traveler, 
"who, casting themselves before that charger, preferred death to 
separation from their Beloved!  Methinks, that blessed steed trod upon 
the bodies of those pure-hearted souls."  "He (God) it was," &amp;Baha'u'llah 
Himself declares, "Who enabled Me to depart out of the city 
(&amp;Baghdad), clothed with such majesty as none, except the denier and 
the malicious, can fail to acknowledge."  These marks of homage and 
devotion continued to surround Him until He was installed in 
Constantinople.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, while hurrying on foot, by his own 
choice, behind &amp;Baha'u'llah's carriage, on the day of His arrival in 
that city, was overheard by &amp;Nabil to remark to Siyyid &amp;Muhammad:  
"Had I not chosen to hide myself, had I revealed my identity, the 
honor accorded Him (&amp;Baha'u'llah) on this day would have been 
mine too."  
     The same tokens of devotion shown &amp;Baha'u'llah at the time of 
 
+P156 
His departure from His House, and later from the Garden of &amp;Ridvan, 
were repeated when, on the 20th of &amp;Dhi'l-Qa'dih (May 9, 1863), 
accompanied by members of His family and twenty-six of His 
disciples, He left &amp;Firayjat, His first stopping-place in the course of 
that journey.  A caravan, consisting of fifty mules, a mounted guard 
of ten soldiers with their officer, and seven pairs of howdahs, each 
pair surmounted by four parasols, was formed, and wended its way, 
by easy stages, and in the space of no less than a hundred and ten 
days, across the uplands, and through the defiles, the woods, valleys 
and pastures, comprising the picturesque scenery of eastern Anatolia, 
to the port of &amp;Samsun, on the Black Sea.  At times on horseback, at 
times resting in the howdah reserved for His use, and which was 
oftentimes surrounded by His companions, most of whom were on 
foot, He, by virtue of the written order of &amp;Namiq &amp;Pasha, was accorded, 
as He traveled northward, in the path of spring, an enthusiastic 
reception by the &amp;valis, the &amp;mutisarrifs, the &amp;qa'im-maqams, the &amp;mudirs, 
the &amp;shaykhs, the &amp;muftis and &amp;qadis, the government officials and 
notables belonging to the districts through which He passed.  In 
&amp;Karkuk, in &amp;Irbil, in Mosul, where He tarried three days, in &amp;Nisibin, 
in &amp;Mardin, in &amp;Diyar-Bakr, where a halt of a couple of days was 
made, in &amp;Kharput, in &amp;Sivas, as well as in other villages and hamlets, 
He would be met by a delegation immediately before His arrival, 
and would be accompanied, for some distance, by a similar delegation 
upon His departure.  The festivities which, at some stations, 
were held in His honor, the food the villagers prepared and brought 
for His acceptance, the eagerness which time and again they exhibited 
in providing the means for His comfort, recalled the reverence which 
the people of &amp;Baghdad had shown Him on so many occasions.  
     "As we passed that morning through the town of &amp;Mardin," that 
same fellow-traveler relates, "we were preceded by a mounted escort 
of government soldiers, carrying their banners, and beating their 
drums in welcome.  The &amp;mutisarrif, together with officials and notables, 
accompanied us, while men, women and children, crowding the housetops 
and filling the streets, awaited our arrival.  With dignity and 
pomp we traversed that town, and resumed our journey, the &amp;mutisarrif 
and those with him escorting us for a considerable distance."  
"According to the unanimous testimony of those we met in the course 
of that journey," &amp;Nabil has recorded in his narrative, "never before 
had they witnessed along this route, over which governors and 
&amp;mushirs continually passed back and forth between Constantinople 
and &amp;Baghdad, any one travel in such state, dispense such hospitality 
 
+P157 
to all, and accord to each so great a share of his bounty."  Sighting 
from His howdah the Black Sea, as He approached the port of &amp;Samsun, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, at the request of &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, revealed a Tablet, 
designated &amp;Lawh-i-Hawdaj (Tablet of the Howdah), which by such 
allusions as the "Divine Touchstone," "the grievous and tormenting 
Mischief," reaffirmed and supplemented the dire predictions recorded 
in the recently revealed Tablet of the Holy Mariner.  
     In &amp;Samsun the Chief Inspector of the entire province, extending 
from &amp;Baghdad to Constantinople, accompanied by several &amp;pashas, 
called on Him, showed Him the utmost respect, and was entertained 
by Him at luncheon.  But seven days after His arrival, He, as foreshadowed 
in the Tablet of the Holy Mariner, was put on board a 
Turkish steamer and three days later was disembarked, at noon, 
together with His fellow-exiles, at the port of Constantinople, on 
the first of &amp;Rabi'u'l-Avval 1280 A.H. (August 16, 1863).  In two 
special carriages, which awaited Him at the landing-stage He and 
His family drove to the house of &amp;Shamsi Big, the official who had 
been appointed by the government to entertain its guests, and who 
lived in the vicinity of the &amp;Khirqiy-i-Sharif mosque.  Later they 
were transferred to the more commodious house of &amp;Visi &amp;Pasha, in 
the neighborhood of the mosque of &amp;Sultan &amp;Muhammad.  
     With the arrival of &amp;Baha'u'llah at Constantinople, the capital of 
the Ottoman Empire and seat of the Caliphate (acclaimed by the 
&amp;Muhammadans as "the Dome of Islam," but stigmatized by Him as 
the spot whereon the "throne of tyranny" had been established) the 
grimmest and most calamitous and yet the most glorious chapter in 
the history of the first &amp;Baha'i century may be said to have opened.  
A period in which untold privations and unprecedented trials were 
mingled with the noblest spiritual triumphs was now commencing.  
The day-star of &amp;Baha'u'llah's ministry was about to reach its zenith.  
The most momentous years of the Heroic Age of His Dispensation 
were at hand.  The catastrophic process, foreshadowed as far back 
as the year sixty by His Forerunner in the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', was 
beginning to be set in motion.  
     Exactly two decades earlier the &amp;Babi Revelation had been born in 
darkest Persia, in the city of &amp;Shiraz.  Despite the cruel captivity to 
which its Author had been subjected, the stupendous claims He had 
voiced had been proclaimed by Him before a distinguished assemblage 
in &amp;Tabriz, the capital of &amp;Adhirbayjan.  In the hamlet of 
&amp;Badasht the Dispensation which His Faith had ushered in had been 
fearlessly inaugurated by the champions of His Cause.  In the midst 
 
+P158 
of the hopelessness and agony of the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran, nine 
years later, that Revelation had, swiftly and mysteriously been 
brought to sudden fruition.  The process of rapid deterioration in 
the fortunes of that Faith, which had gradually set in, and was 
alarmingly accelerated during the years of &amp;Baha'u'llah's withdrawal 
to &amp;Kurdistan, had, in a masterly fashion after His return from 
&amp;Sulaymaniyyih, been arrested and reversed.  The ethical, the moral 
and doctrinal foundations of a nascent community had been subsequently, 
in the course of His sojourn in &amp;Baghdad, unassailably 
established.  And finally, in the Garden of &amp;Ridvan, on the eve of 
His banishment to Constantinople, the ten-year delay, ordained by 
an inscrutable Providence, had been terminated through the Declaration 
of His Mission and the visible emergence of what was to become 
the nucleus of a world-embracing Fellowship.  What now remained 
to be achieved was the proclamation, in the city of Adrianople, of 
that same Mission to the world's secular and ecclesiastical leaders, to 
be followed, in successive decades, by a further unfoldment, in the 
prison-fortress of &amp;Akka, of the principles and precepts constituting 
the bedrock of that Faith, by the formulation of the laws and 
ordinances designed to safeguard its integrity, by the establishment, 
immediately after His ascension, of the Covenant designed to preserve 
its unity and perpetuate its influence, by the prodigious and 
world-wide extension of its activities, under the guidance of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
the Center of that Covenant, and lastly, by the rise, in the 
Formative Age of that Faith, of its Administrative Order, the 
harbinger of its Golden Age and future glory.  
     This historic Proclamation was made at a time when the Faith 
was in the throes of a crisis of extreme violence, and it was in the 
main addressed to the kings of the earth, and to the Christian and 
Muslim ecclesiastical leaders who, by virtue of their immense prestige, 
ascendancy and authority, assumed an appalling and inescapable responsibility 
for the immediate destinies of their subjects and followers.  
     The initial phase of that Proclamation may be said to have opened 
in Constantinople with the communication (the text of which we, 
alas, do not possess) addressed by &amp;Baha'u'llah to &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz 
himself, the self-styled vicar of the Prophet of &amp;Islam and the absolute 
ruler of a mighty empire.  So potent, so august a personage was the 
first among the sovereigns of the world to receive the Divine Summons, 
and the first among Oriental monarchs to sustain the impact of 
God's retributive justice.  The occasion for this communication was 
provided by the infamous edict the &amp;Sultan had promulgated, less than 
 
+P159 
four months after the arrival of the exiles in his capital, banishing 
them, suddenly and without any justification whatsoever, in the 
depth of winter, and in the most humiliating circumstances, to 
Adrianople, situated on the extremities of his empire.  
     That fateful and ignominious decision, arrived at by the &amp;Sultan 
and his chief ministers, &amp;Ali &amp;Pasha and &amp;Fu'ad &amp;Pasha, was in no small 
degree attributable to the persistent intrigues of the &amp;Mushiru'd-Dawlih, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, the Persian Ambassador to the Sublime 
Porte, denounced by &amp;Baha'u'llah as His "calumniator," who awaited 
the first opportunity to strike at Him and the Cause of which He 
was now the avowed and recognized leader.  This Ambassador was 
pressed continually by his government to persist in the policy of 
arousing against &amp;Baha'u'llah the hostility of the Turkish authorities.  
He was encouraged by the refusal of &amp;Baha'u'llah to follow the invariable 
practice of government guests, however highly placed, of calling 
in person, upon their arrival at the capital, on the &amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam, 
on the &amp;Sadr-i-Azam, and on the Foreign Minister--&amp;Baha'u'llah did 
not even return the calls paid Him by several ministers, by &amp;Kamal 
&amp;Pasha and by a former Turkish envoy to the court of Persia.  He 
was not deterred by &amp;Baha'u'llah's upright and independent attitude 
which contrasted so sharply with the mercenariness of the Persian 
princes who were wont, on their arrival, to "solicit at every door such 
allowances and gifts as they might obtain."  He resented &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
unwillingness to present Himself at the Persian Embassy, and to 
repay the visit of its representative; and, being seconded, in his efforts, 
by his accomplice, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan-i-Safa, whom he instructed to 
circulate unfounded reports about Him, he succeeded through his 
official influence, as well as through his private intercourse with 
ecclesiastics, notables and government officials, in representing &amp;Baha'u'llah 
as a proud and arrogant person, Who regarded Himself as 
subject to no law, Who entertained designs inimical to all established 
authority, and Whose forwardness had precipitated the grave differences 
that had arisen between Himself and the Persian Government.  
Nor was he the only one who indulged in these nefarious schemes.  
Others, according to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "condemned and vilified" the 
exiles, as "a mischief to all the world," as "destructive of treaties and 
covenants," as "baleful to all lands" and as "deserving of every 
chastisement and punishment."  
     No less a personage than the highly-respected brother-in-law of 
the &amp;Sadr-i-A'zam was commissioned to apprize the Captive of the 
edict pronounced against Him--an edict which evinced a virtual 
 
+P160 
coalition of the Turkish and Persian imperial governments against a 
common adversary, and which in the end brought such tragic consequences 
upon the Sultanate, the Caliphate and the &amp;Qajar dynasty.  
Refused an audience by &amp;Baha'u'llah that envoy had to content himself 
with a presentation of his puerile observations and trivial arguments 
to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, who were delegated to see him, 
and whom he informed that, after three days, he would return to 
receive the answer to the order he had been bidden to transmit.  
     That same day a Tablet, severely condemnatory in tone, was 
revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, was entrusted by Him, in a sealed envelope, 
on the following morning, to &amp;Shamsi Big, who was instructed to 
deliver it into the hands of &amp;Ali &amp;Pasha, and to say that it was sent 
down from God.  "I know not what that letter contained," &amp;Shamsi 
Big subsequently informed &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, "for no sooner had the 
Grand Vizir perused it than he turned the color of a corpse, and 
remarked:  `It is as if the King of Kings were issuing his behest to 
his humblest vassal king and regulating his conduct.'  So grievous was 
his condition that I backed out of his presence."  "Whatever action," 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, commenting on the effect that Tablet had produced, is 
reported to have stated, "the ministers of the &amp;Sultan took against Us, 
after having become acquainted with its contents, cannot be regarded 
as unjustifiable.  The acts they committed before its perusal, however, 
can have no justification."  
     That Tablet, according to &amp;Nabil, was of considerable length, 
opened with words directed to the sovereign himself, severely censured 
his ministers, exposed their immaturity and incompetence, and 
included passages in which the ministers themselves were addressed, in 
which they were boldly challenged, and sternly admonished not to 
pride themselves on their worldly possessions, nor foolishly seek the 
riches of which time would inexorably rob them.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah was on the eve of His departure, which followed 
almost immediately upon the promulgation of the edict of His banishment, 
when, in a last and memorable interview with the aforementioned 
&amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan-i-Safa, He sent the following message 
to the Persian Ambassador:  "What did it profit thee, and such as 
are like thee, to slay, year after year, so many of the oppressed, and 
to inflict upon them manifold afflictions, when they have increased 
a hundredfold, and ye find yourselves in complete bewilderment, 
knowing not how to relieve your minds of this oppressive thought.  
...His Cause transcends any and every plan ye devise.  Know this 
much:  Were all the governments on earth to unite and take My life 
 
+P161 
and the lives of all who bear this Name, this Divine Fire would never 
be quenched.  His Cause will rather encompass all the kings of the 
earth, nay all that hath been created from water and clay....  Whatever 
may yet befall Us, great shall be our gain, and manifest the loss 
wherewith they shall be afflicted."  
     Pursuant to the peremptory orders issued for the immediate departure 
of the already twice banished exiles, &amp;Baha'u'llah, His family, 
and His companions, some riding in wagons, others mounted on pack 
animals, with their belongings piled in carts drawn by oxen, set out, 
accompanied by Turkish officers, on a cold December morning, 
amidst the weeping of the friends they were leaving behind, on their 
twelve-day journey, across a bleak and windswept country, to a city 
characterized by &amp;Baha'u'llah as "the place which none entereth 
except such as have rebelled against the authority of the sovereign."  
"They expelled Us," is His own testimony in the &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk, 
"from thy city (Constantinople) with an abasement with which no 
abasement on earth can compare."  "Neither My family, nor those who 
accompanied Me," He further states, "had the necessary raiment to 
protect them from the cold in that freezing weather."  And again:  
"The eyes of Our enemies wept over Us, and beyond them those of 
every discerning person."  "A banishment," laments &amp;Nabil, "endured 
with such meekness that the pen sheddeth tears when recounting it, 
and the page is ashamed to bear its description."  "A cold of such 
intensity," that same chronicler records, "prevailed that year, that 
nonagenarians could not recall its like.  In some regions, in both 
Turkey and Persia, animals succumbed to its severity and perished 
in the snows.  The upper reaches of the Euphrates, in Ma'dan-Nuqrih, 
were covered with ice for several days--an unprecedented phenomenon--
while in &amp;Diyar-Bakr the river froze over for no less than forty 
days."  "To obtain water from the springs," one of the exiles of 
Adrianople recounts, "a great fire had to be lighted in their immediate 
neighborhood, and kept burning for a couple of hours before 
they thawed out."  
     Traveling through rain and storm, at times even making night 
marches, the weary travelers, after brief halts at &amp;Kuchik-Chakmachih, 
&amp;Buyuk-Chakmachih, &amp;Salvari, &amp;Birkas, and &amp;Baba-Iski, arrived at their 
destination, on the first of Rajab 1280 A.H. (December 12, 1863), 
and were lodged in the &amp;Khan-i-'Arab, a two-story caravanserai, near 
the house of &amp;Izzat-Aqa.  Three days later, &amp;Baha'u'llah and His family 
were consigned to a house suitable only for summer habitation, in 
the &amp;Muradiyyih quarter, near the &amp;Takyiy-i-Mawlavi, and were moved 
 
+P162 
again, after a week, to another house, in the vicinity of a mosque 
in that same neighborhood.  About six months later they transferred 
to more commodious quarters, known as the house of &amp;Amru'llah 
(House of God's command) situated on the northern side of the 
mosque of &amp;Sultan &amp;Salim.  
     Thus closes the opening scene of one of the most dramatic episodes 
in the ministry of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The curtain now rises on what is 
admittedly the most turbulent and critical period of the first &amp;Baha'i 
century--a period that was destined to precede the most glorious 
phase of that ministry, the proclamation of His Message to the world 
and its rulers.  
 
+P163 
                                  CHAPTER X 
              The Rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and the Proclamation 
                    of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Mission in Adrianople 
 
     A twenty-year-old Faith had just begun to recover from a series 
of successive blows when a crisis of the first magnitude overtook it 
and shook it to its roots.  Neither the tragic martyrdom of the &amp;Bab 
nor the ignominious attempt on the life of the sovereign, nor its 
bloody aftermath, nor &amp;Baha'u'llah's humiliating banishment from 
His native land, nor even His two-year withdrawal to &amp;Kurdistan, 
devastating though they were in their consequences, could compare 
in gravity with this first major internal convulsion which seized a 
newly rearisen community, and which threatened to cause an irreparable 
breach in the ranks of its members.  More odious than the 
unrelenting hostility which &amp;Abu-Jahl, the uncle of &amp;Muhammad, had 
exhibited, more shameful than the betrayal of Jesus Christ by His 
disciple, Judas Iscariot, more perfidious than the conduct of the sons 
of Jacob towards Joseph their brother, more abhorrent than the deed 
committed by one of the sons of Noah, more infamous than even 
the criminal act perpetrated by Cain against Abel, the monstrous 
behavior of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, one of the half-brothers of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the 
nominee of the &amp;Bab, and recognized chief of the &amp;Babi community, 
brought in its wake a period of travail which left its mark on the 
fortunes of the Faith for no less than half a century.  This 
supreme crisis &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself designated as the &amp;Ayyam-i-Shidad 
(Days of Stress), during which "the most grievous veil" was torn 
asunder, and the "most great separation" was irrevocably effected.  It 
immensely gratified and emboldened its external enemies, both civil 
and ecclesiastical, played into their hands, and evoked their unconcealed 
derision.  It perplexed and confused the friends and supporters 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and seriously damaged the prestige of the Faith in the 
eyes of its western admirers.  It had been brewing ever since the 
early days of &amp;Baha'u'llah's sojourn in &amp;Baghdad, was temporarily suppressed 
by the creative forces which, under His as yet unproclaimed 
leadership, reanimated a disintegrating community, and finally broke 
out, in all its violence, in the years immediately preceding the proclamation 
of His Message.  It brought incalculable sorrow to &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
 
+P164 
visibly aged Him, and inflicted, through its repercussions, the heaviest 
blow ever sustained by Him in His lifetime.  It was engineered 
throughout by the tortuous intrigues and incessant machinations of 
that same diabolical Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, that vile whisperer who, disregarding 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's advice, had insisted on accompanying Him 
to Constantinople and Adrianople, and was now redoubling his 
efforts, with unrelaxing vigilance, to bring it to a head.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya had, ever since the return of &amp;Baha'u'llah from 
&amp;Sulaymaniyyih, either chosen to maintain himself in an inglorious 
seclusion in his own house, or had withdrawn, whenever danger 
threatened, to such places of safety as &amp;Hillih and Basra.  To the 
latter town he had fled, disguised as a &amp;Baghdad Jew, and become a 
shoe merchant.  So great was his terror that he is reported to have 
said on one occasion:  "Whoever claims to have seen me, or to have 
heard my voice, I pronounce an infidel."  On being informed of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's impending departure for Constantinople, he at first hid 
himself in the garden of Huvaydar, in the vicinity of &amp;Baghdad, 
meditating meanwhile on the advisability of fleeing either to Abyssinia, 
India or some other country.  Refusing to heed &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
advice to proceed to Persia, and there disseminate the writings of 
the &amp;Bab, he sent a certain &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad &amp;Kazim, who resembled 
him, to the government-house to procure for him a passport in the 
name of &amp;Mirza &amp;Aliy-i-Kirmanshahi, and left &amp;Baghdad, abandoning 
the writings there, and proceeded in disguise, accompanied by an 
Arab &amp;Babi, named &amp;Zahir, to Mosul, where he joined the exiles who 
were on their way to Constantinople.  
     A constant witness of the ever deepening attachment of the exiles 
to &amp;Baha'u'llah and of their amazing veneration for Him; fully aware 
of the heights to which his Brother's popularity had risen in &amp;Baghdad, 
in the course of His journey to Constantinople, and later through 
His association with the notables and governors of Adrianople; incensed 
by the manifold evidences of the courage, the dignity, and 
independence which that Brother had demonstrated in His dealings 
with the authorities in the capital; provoked by the numerous Tablets 
which the Author of a newly-established Dispensation had been 
ceaselessly revealing; allowing himself to be duped by the enticing 
prospects of unfettered leadership held out to him by Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, 
the Antichrist of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation, even as &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah had been misled by the Antichrist of the &amp;Babi Revelation, &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi; refusing to be admonished by prominent members of 
the community who advised him, in writing, to exercise wisdom and 
 
+P165 
restraint; forgetful of the kindness and counsels of &amp;Baha'u'llah, who, 
thirteen years his senior, had watched over his early youth and manhood; 
emboldened by the sin-covering eye of his Brother, Who, on 
so many occasions, had drawn a veil over his many crimes and follies, 
this arch-breaker of the Covenant of the &amp;Bab, spurred on by his 
mounting jealousy and impelled by his passionate love of leadership, 
was driven to perpetrate such acts as defied either concealment or 
toleration.  
     Irremediably corrupted through his constant association with Siyyid 
&amp;Muhammad, that living embodiment of wickedness, cupidity 
and deceit, he had already in the absence of &amp;Baha'u'llah from &amp;Baghdad, 
and even after His return from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, stained the annals 
of the Faith with acts of indelible infamy.  His corruption, in scores 
of instances, of the text of the &amp;Bab's writings; the blasphemous addition 
he made to the formula of the &amp;adhan by the introduction of a 
passage in which he identified himself with the Godhead; his insertion 
of references in those writings to a succession in which he nominated 
himself and his descendants as heirs of the &amp;Bab; the vacillation and 
apathy he had betrayed when informed of the tragic death which his 
Master had suffered; his condemnation to death of all the Mirrors 
of the &amp;Babi Dispensation, though he himself was one of those Mirrors; 
his dastardly act in causing the murder of &amp;Dayyan, whom he feared 
and envied; his foul deed in bringing about, during the absence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah from &amp;Baghdad, the assassination of &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Akbar, 
the &amp;Bab's cousin; and, most heinous of all, his unspeakably repugnant 
violation, during that same period, of the honor of the &amp;Bab Himself--
all these, as attested by &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, and reported by &amp;Nabil in his 
Narrative, were to be thrown into a yet more lurid light by further 
acts the perpetration of which were to seal irretrievably his doom.  
     Desperate designs to poison &amp;Baha'u'llah and His companions, and 
thereby reanimate his own defunct leadership, began, approximately 
a year after their arrival in Adrianople, to agitate his mind.  Well 
aware of the erudition of his half-brother, &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, in matters 
pertaining to medicine, he, under various pretexts, sought enlightenment 
from him regarding the effects of certain herbs and poisons, 
and then began, contrary to his wont, to invite &amp;Baha'u'llah to his 
home, where, one day, having smeared His tea-cup with a substance 
he had concocted, he succeeded in poisoning Him sufficiently to 
produce a serious illness which lasted no less than a month, and which 
was accompanied by severe pains and high fever, the aftermath of 
which left &amp;Baha'u'llah with a shaking hand till the end of His life.  
 
+P166 
So grave was His condition that a foreign doctor, named &amp;Shishman, 
was called in to attend Him.  The doctor was so appalled by His livid 
hue that he deemed His case hopeless, and, after having fallen at 
His feet, retired from His presence without prescribing a remedy.  
A few days later that doctor fell ill and died.  Prior to his death 
&amp;Baha'u'llah had intimated that doctor &amp;Shishman had sacrificed his 
life for Him.  To &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, sent by &amp;Baha'u'llah to visit him, 
the doctor had stated that God had answered his prayers, and that 
after his death a certain Dr. &amp;Chupan, whom he knew to be reliable, 
should, whenever necessary, be called in his stead.  
     On another occasion this same &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya had, according to 
the testimony of one of his wives, who had temporarily deserted him 
and revealed the details of the above-mentioned act, poisoned the well 
which provided water for the family and companions of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
in consequence of which the exiles manifested strange symptoms of 
illness.  He even had, gradually and with great circumspection, disclosed 
to one of the companions, &amp;Ustad &amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Salmani, 
the barber, on whom he had lavished great marks of favor, his wish 
that he, on some propitious occasion, when attending &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
His bath, should assassinate Him.  "So enraged was &amp;Ustad &amp;Muhammad-'Ali," 
&amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, recounting this episode to &amp;Nabil in Adrianople, 
has stated, "when apprized of this proposition, that he felt a strong 
desire to kill &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya on the spot, and would have done so but 
for his fear of &amp;Baha'u'llah's displeasure.  I happened to be the first 
person he encountered as he came out of the bath weeping....  I 
eventually succeeded, after much persuasion, in inducing him to 
return to the bath and complete his unfinished task."  Though ordered 
subsequently by &amp;Baha'u'llah not to divulge this occurrence to 
any one, the barber was unable to hold his peace and betrayed the 
secret, plunging thereby the community into great consternation.  
"When the secret nursed in his (&amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya) bosom was revealed 
by God," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself affirms, "he disclaimed such an intention, 
and imputed it to that same servant (&amp;Ustad &amp;Muhammad-'Ali)."  
     The moment had now arrived for Him Who had so recently, 
both verbally and in numerous Tablets, revealed the implications of 
the claims He had advanced, to acquaint formally the one who was 
the nominee of the &amp;Bab with the character of His Mission.  &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Jan was accordingly commissioned to bear to &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya the 
newly revealed &amp;Suriy-i-Amr, which unmistakably affirmed those 
claims, to read aloud to him its contents, and demand an unequivocal 
and conclusive reply.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya's request for a one day respite, 
 
+P167 
during which he could meditate his answer, was granted.  The only 
reply, however, that was forthcoming was a counter-declaration, 
specifying the hour and the minute in which he had been made the 
recipient of an independent Revelation, necessitating the unqualified 
submission to him of the peoples of the earth in both the East and 
the West.  
     So presumptuous an assertion, made by so perfidious an adversary 
to the envoy of the Bearer of so momentous a Revelation was the 
signal for the open and final rupture between &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Yahya--a rupture that marks one of the darkest dates in &amp;Baha'i 
history.  Wishing to allay the fierce animosity that blazed in the 
bosom of His enemies, and to assure to each one of the exiles a complete 
freedom to choose between Him and them, &amp;Baha'u'llah withdrew 
with His family to the house of &amp;Rida Big (&amp;Shavval 22, 1282 
A.H.), which was rented by His order, and refused, for two months, 
to associate with either friend or stranger, including His own companions.  
He instructed &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim to divide all the furniture, 
bedding, clothing and utensils that were to be found in His home, 
and send half to the house of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya; to deliver to him certain 
relics he had long coveted, such as the seals, rings, and manuscripts 
in the handwriting of the &amp;Bab; and to insure that he received his 
full share of the allowance fixed by the government for the maintenance 
of the exiles and their families.  He, moreover, directed &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim 
to order to attend to &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya's shopping, for several hours 
a day, any one of the companions whom he himself might select, and 
to assure him that whatever would henceforth be received in his name 
from Persia would be delivered into his own hands.  
     "That day," &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim is reported to have informed &amp;Nabil, 
"witnessed a most great commotion.  All the companions lamented 
in their separation from the Blessed Beauty."  "Those days," is the 
written testimony of one of those companions, "were marked by 
tumult and confusion.  We were sore-perplexed, and greatly feared 
lest we be permanently deprived of the bounty of His presence."  
     This grief and perplexity were, however, destined to be of short 
duration.  The calumnies with which both &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and Siyyid 
&amp;Muhammad now loaded their letters, which they disseminated in 
Persia and &amp;Iraq, as well as the petitions, couched in obsequious language, 
which the former had addressed to &amp;Khurshid &amp;Pasha, the 
governor of Adrianople, and to his assistant &amp;Aziz &amp;Pasha, impelled 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to emerge from His retirement.  He was soon after informed 
that this same brother had despatched one of his wives to the 
 
+P168 
government house to complain that her husband had been cheated 
of his rights, and that her children were on the verge of starvation--
an accusation that spread far and wide and, reaching Constantinople, 
became, to &amp;Baha'u'llah's profound distress, the subject of excited discussion 
and injurious comment in circles that had previously been 
greatly impressed by the high standard which His noble and dignified 
behavior had set in that city.  Siyyid &amp;Muhammad journeyed to the 
capital, begged the Persian Ambassador, the &amp;Mushiru'd-Dawlih, to 
allot &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and himself a stipend, accused &amp;Baha'u'llah of sending 
an agent to assassinate &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, and spared no effort 
to heap abuse and calumny on One Who had, for so long and so 
patiently, forborne with him, and endured in silence the enormities 
of which he had been guilty.  
     After a stay of about one year in the house of &amp;Rida Big &amp;Baha'u'llah 
returned to the house He had occupied before His withdrawal 
from His companions, and thence, after three months, He transferred 
His residence to the house of &amp;Izzat &amp;Aqa, in which He continued 
to live until His departure from Adrianople.  It was in this 
house, in the month of &amp;Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1284 A.H. (Sept. 1867) 
that an event of the utmost significance occurred, which completely 
discomfited &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and his supporters, and proclaimed to friend 
and foe alike &amp;Baha'u'llah's triumph over them.  A certain &amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad, 
a &amp;Babi of &amp;Shiraz, greatly resenting alike the claims and 
the cowardly seclusion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, succeeded in forcing Siyyid 
&amp;Muhammad to induce him to meet &amp;Baha'u'llah face to face, so that 
a discrimination might be publicly effected between the true and the 
false.  Foolishly assuming that his illustrious Brother would never 
countenance such a proposition, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya appointed the mosque 
of &amp;Sultan &amp;Salim as the place for their encounter.  No sooner had 
&amp;Baha'u'llah been informed of this arrangement than He set forth, on 
foot, in the heat of midday, and accompanied by this same &amp;Mir 
&amp;Muhammad, for the afore-mentioned mosque, which was situated in 
a distant part of the city, reciting, as He walked, through the streets 
and markets, verses, in a voice and in a manner that greatly astonished 
those who saw and heard Him.  
     "O &amp;Muhammad!", are some of the words He uttered on that 
memorable occasion, as testified by Himself in a Tablet, "He Who 
is the Spirit hath, verily, issued from His habitation, and with Him 
have come forth the souls of God's chosen ones and the realities of 
His Messengers.  Behold, then, the dwellers of the realms on high 
above Mine head, and all the testimonies of the Prophets in My grasp.  
 
+P169 
Say:  Were all the divines, all the wise men, all the kings and rulers 
on earth to gather together, I, in very truth, would confront them, 
and would proclaim the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, 
the All-Wise.  I am He Who feareth no one, though all who are in 
heaven and all who are on earth rise up against me....  This is Mine 
hand which God hath turned white for all the worlds to behold.  
This is My staff; were We to cast it down, it would, of a truth, 
swallow up all created things."  &amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad, who had been sent 
ahead to announce &amp;Baha'u'llah's arrival, soon returned, and informed 
Him that he who had challenged His authority wished, owing to unforeseen 
circumstances, to postpone for a day or two the interview.  
Upon His return to His house &amp;Baha'u'llah revealed a Tablet, wherein 
He recounted what had happened, fixed the time for the postponed 
interview, sealed the Tablet with His seal, entrusted it to &amp;Nabil, and 
instructed him to deliver it to one of the new believers, &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Muhammad-i-Tabrizi, for the information of Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, 
who was in the habit of frequenting that believer's shop.  It was 
arranged to demand from Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, ere the delivery of that 
Tablet, a sealed note pledging &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, in the event of failing 
to appear at the trysting-place, to affirm in writing that his claims 
were false.  Siyyid &amp;Muhammad promised that he would produce the 
next day the document required, and though &amp;Nabil, for three successive 
days, waited in that shop for the reply, neither did the Siyyid 
appear, nor was such a note sent by him.  That undelivered Tablet, 
&amp;Nabil, recording twenty-three years later this historic episode in 
his chronicle, affirms was still in his possession, "as fresh as the day 
on which the Most Great Branch had penned it, and the seal of the 
Ancient Beauty had sealed and adorned it," a tangible and irrefutable 
testimony to &amp;Baha'u'llah's established ascendancy over a routed 
opponent.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah's reaction to this most distressful episode in His ministry 
was, as already observed, characterized by acute anguish.  "He 
who for months and years," He laments, "I reared with the hand of 
loving-kindness hath risen to take My life."  "The cruelties inflicted 
by My oppressors," He wrote, in allusion to these perfidious enemies, 
"have bowed Me down, and turned My hair white.  Shouldst thou 
present thyself before My throne, thou wouldst fail to recognize the 
Ancient Beauty, for the freshness of His countenance is altered, and 
its brightness hath faded, by reason of the oppression of the infidels."  
"By God!"  He cries out, "No spot is left on My body that hath not 
been touched by the spears of thy machinations."  And again:  "Thou 
 
+P170 
hast perpetrated against thy Brother what no man hath perpetrated 
against another."  "What hath proceeded from thy pen," He, furthermore, 
has affirmed, "hath caused the Countenances of Glory to be 
prostrated upon the dust, hath rent in twain the Veil of Grandeur 
in the Sublime Paradise, and lacerated the hearts of the favored ones 
established upon the loftiest seats."  And yet, in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
a forgiving Lord assures this same brother, this "source of perversion," 
"from whose own soul the winds of passion had risen and 
blown upon him," to "fear not because of thy deeds," bids him "return 
unto God, humble, submissive and lowly," and affirms that "He will 
put away from thee thy sins," and that "thy Lord is the Forgiving, 
the Mighty, the All-Merciful."  
     The "Most Great Idol" had at the bidding and through the power 
of Him Who is the Fountain-head of the Most Great Justice been cast 
out of the community of the Most Great Name, confounded, 
abhorred and broken.  Cleansed from this pollution, delivered from 
this horrible possession, God's infant Faith could now forge ahead, 
and, despite the turmoil that had convulsed it, demonstrate its 
capacity to fight further battles, capture loftier heights, and win 
mightier victories.  
     A temporary breach had admittedly been made in the ranks of 
its supporters.  Its glory had been eclipsed, and its annals stained forever.  
Its name, however, could not be obliterated, its spirit was far 
from broken, nor could this so-called schism tear its fabric asunder.  
The Covenant of the &amp;Bab, to which reference has already been made, 
with its immutable truths, incontrovertible prophecies, and repeated 
warnings, stood guard over that Faith, insuring its integrity, demonstrating 
its incorruptibility, and perpetuating its influence.  
     Though He Himself was bent with sorrow, and still suffered from 
the effects of the attempt on His life, and though He was well aware 
a further banishment was probably impending, yet, undaunted by 
the blow which His Cause had sustained, and the perils with which 
it was encompassed, &amp;Baha'u'llah arose with matchless power, even 
before the ordeal was overpast, to proclaim the Mission with which 
He had been entrusted to those who, in East and West, had the reins 
of supreme temporal authority in their grasp.  The day-star of His 
Revelation was, through this very Proclamation, destined to shine in 
its meridian glory, and His Faith manifest the plenitude of its divine 
power.  
     A period of prodigious activity ensued which, in its repercussions, 
outshone the vernal years of &amp;Baha'u'llah's ministry.  "Day and night," 
 
+P171 
an eye-witness has written, "the Divine verses were raining down in 
such number that it was impossible to record them.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan 
wrote them as they were dictated, while the Most Great Branch was 
continually occupied in transcribing them.  There was not a moment 
to spare."  "A number of secretaries," &amp;Nabil has testified, "were busy 
day and night and yet they were unable to cope with the task.  
Among them was &amp;Mirza &amp;Baqir-i-Shirazi....  He alone transcribed 
no less than two thousand verses every day.  He labored during six 
or seven months.  Every month the equivalent of several volumes 
would be transcribed by him and sent to Persia.  About twenty 
volumes, in his fine penmanship, he left behind as a remembrance 
for &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan."  &amp;Baha'u'llah, Himself, referring to the verses 
revealed by Him, has written:  "Such are the outpourings ... from 
the clouds of Divine Bounty that within the space of an hour the 
equivalent of a thousand verses hath been revealed."  "So great is 
the grace vouchsafed in this day that in a single day and night, were 
an amanuensis capable of accomplishing it to be found, the equivalent 
of the Persian &amp;Bayan would be sent down from the heaven of 
Divine holiness."  "I swear by God!" He, in another connection has 
affirmed, "In those days the equivalent of all that hath been sent down 
aforetime unto the Prophets hath been revealed."  "That which hath 
already been revealed in this land (Adrianople)," He, furthermore, 
referring to the copiousness of His writings, has declared, "secretaries 
are incapable of transcribing.  It has, therefore, remained for the most 
part untranscribed."  
     Already in the very midst of that grievous crisis, and even before 
it came to a head, Tablets unnumbered were streaming from the pen 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, in which the implications of His newly-asserted claims 
were fully expounded.  The &amp;Suriy-i-Amr, the &amp;Lawh-i-Nuqtih, the 
&amp;Lawh-i-Ahmad, the &amp;Suriy-i-Ashab, the &amp;Lawh-i-Sayyah, the &amp;Suriy-i-Damm, 
the &amp;Suriy-i-Hajj, the &amp;Lawhu'r-Ruh, the &amp;Lawhu'r-Ridvan, 
the &amp;Lawhu't-Tuqa were among the Tablets which His pen had already 
set down when He transferred His residence to the house of &amp;Izzat 
&amp;Aqa.  Almost immediately after the "Most Great Separation" had 
been effected, the weightiest Tablets associated with His sojourn in 
Adrianople were revealed.  The &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk, the most momentous 
Tablet revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah (&amp;Surih of Kings) in which He, for 
the first time, directs His words collectively to the entire company 
of the monarchs of East and West, and in which the &amp;Sultan of 
Turkey, and his ministers, the kings of Christendom, the French and 
Persian Ambassadors accredited to the Sublime Porte, the Muslim 
 
+P172 
ecclesiastical leaders in Constantinople, its wise men and inhabitants, 
the people of Persia and the philosophers of the world are separately 
addressed; the &amp;Kitab-i-Badi', His apologia, written to refute the 
accusations levelled against Him by &amp;Mirza &amp;Mihdiy-i-Rashti, corresponding 
to the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, revealed in defense of the &amp;Babi Revelation; 
the &amp;Munajathay-i-Siyam (Prayers for Fasting), written in 
anticipation of the Book of His Laws; the first Tablet to Napoleon 
III, in which the Emperor of the French is addressed and the sincerity 
of his professions put to the test; the &amp;Lawh-i-Sultan, His detailed 
epistle to &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, in which the aims, purposes and principles 
of His Faith are expounded and the validity of His Mission 
demonstrated; the &amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is, begun in the village of &amp;Kashanih 
on His way to Gallipoli, and completed shortly after at &amp;Gyawur-Kyuy
--these may be regarded not only as the most outstanding 
among the innumerable Tablets revealed in Adrianople, but as 
occupying a foremost position among all the writings of the Author 
of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation.  
     In His message to the kings of the earth, &amp;Baha'u'llah, in the 
&amp;Suriy-i-Muluk, discloses the character of His Mission; exhorts them to 
embrace His Message; affirms the validity of the &amp;Bab's Revelation; 
reproves them for their indifference to His Cause; enjoins them to 
be just and vigilant, to compose their differences and reduce their 
armaments; expatiates on His afflictions; commends the poor to their 
care; warns them that "Divine chastisement" will "assail" them "from 
every direction," if they refuse to heed His counsels, and prophesies 
His "triumph upon earth" though no king be found who would turn 
his face towards Him.  
     The kings of Christendom, more specifically, &amp;Baha'u'llah, in that 
same Tablet, censures for having failed to "welcome" and "draw 
nigh" unto Him Who is the "Spirit of Truth," and for having persisted 
in "disporting" themselves with their "pastimes and fancies," 
and declares to them that they "shall be called to account" for their 
doings, "in the presence of Him Who shall gather together the entire 
creation."  
     He bids &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz "hearken to the speech ... of Him 
Who unerringly treadeth the Straight Path"; exhorts him to direct 
in person the affairs of his people, and not to repose confidence in 
unworthy ministers; admonishes him not to rely on his treasures, nor 
to "overstep the bounds of moderation" but to deal with his subjects 
with "undeviating justice"; and acquaints him with the overwhelming 
burden of His own tribulations.  In that same Tablet He asserts 
 
+P173 
His innocence and His loyalty to the &amp;Sultan and his ministers; 
describes the circumstances of His banishment from the capital; and 
assures him of His prayers to God on his behalf.  
     To this same &amp;Sultan He, moreover, as attested by the &amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is, 
transmitted, while in Gallipoli, a verbal message through a Turkish 
officer named &amp;Umar, requesting the sovereign to grant Him a ten 
minute interview, "so that he may demand whatsoever he would 
deem to be a sufficient testimony and would regard as proof of the 
veracity of Him Who is the Truth," adding that "should God enable 
Him to produce it, let him, then, release these wronged ones and 
leave them to themselves."  
     To Napoleon III &amp;Baha'u'llah addressed a specific Tablet, which was 
forwarded through one of the French ministers to the Emperor, in 
which He dwelt on the sufferings endured by Himself and His followers; 
avowed their innocence; reminded him of his two pronouncements 
on behalf of the oppressed and the helpless; and, desiring to 
test the sincerity of his motives, called upon him to "inquire into 
the condition of such as have been wronged," and "extend his care 
to the weak," and look upon Him and His fellow-exiles "with the eye 
of loving-kindness."  
     To &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah He revealed a Tablet, the lengthiest epistle 
to any single sovereign, in which He testified to the unparalleled 
severity of the troubles that had touched Him; recalled the sovereign's 
recognition of His innocence on the eve of His departure for 
&amp;Iraq; adjured him to rule with justice; described God's summons to 
Himself to arise and proclaim His Message; affirmed the disinterestedness 
of His counsels; proclaimed His belief in the unity of God and 
in His Prophets; uttered several prayers on the &amp;Shah's behalf; justified 
His own conduct in &amp;Iraq; stressed the beneficent influence of His 
teachings; and laid special emphasis on His condemnation of all forms 
of violence and mischief.  He, moreover, in that same Tablet, demonstrated 
the validity of His Mission; expressed the wish to be "brought 
face to face with the divines of the age, and produce proofs and 
testimonies in the presence of His Majesty," which would establish the 
truth of His Cause; exposed the perversity of the ecclesiastical leaders 
in His own days, as well as in the days of Jesus Christ and of 
&amp;Muhammad; prophesied that His sufferings will be followed by the 
"outpourings of a supreme mercy" and by an "overflowing prosperity"; 
drew a parallel between the afflictions that had befallen His 
kindred and those endured by the relatives of the Prophet &amp;Muhammad; 
expatiated on the instability of human affairs; depicted the 
 
+P174 
city to which He was about to be banished; foreshadowed the future 
abasement of the &amp;ulamas; and concluded with yet another expression 
of hope that the sovereign might be assisted by God to "aid His 
Faith and turn towards His justice."  
     To &amp;Ali &amp;Pasha, the Grand Vizir, &amp;Baha'u'llah addressed the 
&amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is.  In this He bids him "hearken to the voice of God"; declares 
that neither his "grunting," nor the "barking" of those around him, 
nor "the hosts of the world" can withhold the Almighty from achieving 
His purpose; accuses him of having perpetrated that which has 
caused "the Apostle of God to lament in the most sublime Paradise," 
and of having conspired with the Persian Ambassador to harm Him; 
forecasts "the manifest loss" in which he would soon find himself; 
glorifies the Day of His own Revelation; prophesies that this Revelation 
will "erelong encompass the earth and all that dwell therein," 
and that the "Land of Mystery (Adrianople) and what is beside 
it ... shall pass out of the hands of the King, and commotions shall 
appear, and the voice of lamentation shall be raised, and the evidences 
of mischief shall be revealed on all sides"; identifies that same Revelation 
with the Revelations of Moses and of Jesus; recalls the "arrogance" 
of the Persian Emperor in the days of &amp;Muhammad, the 
"transgression" of Pharaoh in the days of Moses, and of the "impiety" 
of Nimrod in the days of Abraham; and proclaims His purpose to 
"quicken the world and unite all its peoples."  
     The ministers of the &amp;Sultan, He, in the &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk, reprimands 
for their conduct, in passages in which He challenges the 
soundness of their principles, predicts that they will be punished for 
their acts, denounces their pride and injustice, asserts His integrity 
and detachment from the vanities of the world, and proclaims His 
innocence.  
     The French Ambassador accredited to the Sublime Porte, He, in 
that same &amp;Surih, rebukes for having combined with the Persian Ambassador 
against Him; reminds him of the counsels of Jesus Christ, 
as recorded in the Gospel of St. John; warns him that he will be held 
answerable for the things his hands have wrought; and counsels him, 
together with those like him, not to deal with any one as he has 
dealt with Him.  
     To the Persian Ambassador in Constantinople, He, in that same 
Tablet, addresses lengthy passages in which He exposes his delusions 
and calumnies, denounces his injustice and the injustice of his 
countrymen, assures him that He harbors no ill-will against him, 
declares that, should he realize the enormity of his deed, he would 
 
+P175 
mourn all the days of his life, affirms that he will persist till his death 
in his heedlessness, justifies His own conduct in &amp;Tihran and in &amp;Iraq, 
and bears witness to the corruption of the Persian minister in 
&amp;Baghdad and to his collusion with this minister.  
     To the entire company of the ecclesiastical leaders of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam 
in Constantinople He addresses a specific message in the same &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk 
in which He denounces them as heedless and spiritually dead; 
reproaches them for their pride and for failing to seek His presence; 
unveils to them the full glory and significance of His Mission; 
affirms that their leaders, had they been alive, would have "circled 
around Him"; condemns them as "worshippers of names" and lovers 
of leadership; and avows that God will find naught acceptable from 
them unless they "be made new" in His estimation.  
     To the wise men of the City of Constantinople and the philosophers 
of the world He devotes the concluding passages of the &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk, 
in which He cautions them not to wax proud before God; 
reveals to them the essence of true wisdom; stresses the importance 
of faith and upright conduct; rebukes them for having failed to 
seek enlightenment from Him; and counsels them not to "overstep 
the bounds of God," nor turn their gaze towards the "ways of men 
and their habits."  
     To the inhabitants of Constantinople He, in that same Tablet, 
declares that He "feareth no one except God," that He speaks 
"naught except at His (God) bidding," that He follows naught save 
God's truth, that He found the governors and elders of the city as 
"children gathered about and disporting themselves with clay," and 
that He perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire the truths 
which God had taught Him.  He bids them take firm hold on the 
precepts of God; warns them not to wax proud before God and His 
loved ones; recalls the tribulations, and extols the virtues, of the 
&amp;Imam &amp;Husayn; prays that He Himself may suffer similar afflictions; 
prophesies that erelong God will raise up a people who will recount 
His troubles and demand the restitution of His rights from His 
oppressors; and calls upon them to give ear to His words, and return 
unto God and repent.  
     And finally, addressing the people of Persia, He, in that same 
Tablet, affirms that were they to put Him to death God will assuredly 
raise up One in His stead, and asserts that the Almighty will "perfect 
His light" though they, in their secret hearts, abhor it.  
     So weighty a proclamation, at so critical a period, by the Bearer 
of so sublime a Message, to the kings of the earth, Muslim and Christian 
 
+P176 
alike, to ministers and ambassadors, to the ecclesiastical heads 
of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam, to the wise men and inhabitants of Constantinople--
the seat of both the Sultanate and the Caliphate--to the philosophers 
of the world and the people of Persia, is not to be regarded as the 
only outstanding event associated with &amp;Baha'u'llah's sojourn in 
Adrianople.  Other developments and happenings of great, though 
lesser, significance must be noted in these pages, if we would justly 
esteem the importance of this agitated and most momentous phase of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's ministry.  
     It was at this period, and as a direct consequence of the rebellion 
and appalling downfall of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, that certain disciples of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah (who may well rank among the "treasures" promised Him 
by God when bowed down with chains in the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran), 
including among them one of the Letters of the Living, some survivors 
of the struggle of &amp;Tabarsi, and the erudite &amp;Mirza &amp;Ahmad-i-Azghandi, 
arose to defend the newborn Faith, to refute, in numerous 
and detailed apologies, as their Master had done in the &amp;Kitab-i-Badi', 
the arguments of His opponents, and to expose their odious deeds.  
It was at this period that the limits of the Faith were enlarged, when 
its banner was permanently planted in the Caucasus by the hand of 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Abu-Talib and others whom &amp;Nabil had converted, when its 
first Egyptian center was established at the time when Siyyid 
&amp;Husayn-i-Kashani and &amp;Haji &amp;Baqir-i-Kashani took up their residence 
in that country, and when to the lands already warmed and illuminated 
by the early rays of God's Revelation--&amp;Iraq, Turkey and 
Persia--Syria was added.  It was in this period that the greeting of 
"&amp;Allah-u-Abha" superseded the old salutation of "&amp;Allah-u-Akbar," 
and was simultaneously adopted in Persia and Adrianople, the first 
to use it in the former country, at the suggestion of &amp;Nabil, being 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-i-Furughi, one of the defenders of the Fort of 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi.  It was in this period that the phrase "the people of 
the &amp;Bayan," now denoting the followers of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, was discarded, 
and was supplanted by the term "the people of &amp;Baha."  It 
was during those days that &amp;Nabil, recently honored with the title 
of &amp;Nabil-i-A'zam, in a Tablet specifically addressed to him, in which 
he was bidden to "deliver the Message" of his Lord "to East and 
West," arose, despite intermittent persecutions, to tear asunder the 
"most grievous veil," to implant the love of an adored Master in the 
hearts of His countrymen, and to champion the Cause which his 
Beloved had, under such tragic conditions, proclaimed.  It was during 
those same days that &amp;Baha'u'llah instructed this same &amp;Nabil to recite 
 
+P177 
on His behalf the two newly revealed Tablets of the Pilgrimage, 
and to perform, in His stead, the rites prescribed in them, when 
visiting the &amp;Bab's House in &amp;Shiraz and the Most Great House in 
&amp;Baghdad--an act that marks the inception of one of the holiest 
observances, which, in a later period, the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas was to 
formally establish.  It was during this period that the "Prayers of 
Fasting" were revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, in anticipation of the Law 
which that same Book was soon to promulgate.  It was, too, during 
the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah's banishment to Adrianople that a Tablet was 
addressed by Him to &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar-i-Shahmirzadi and &amp;Jamal-i-Burujirdi, 
two of His well-known followers in &amp;Tihran, instructing 
them to transfer, with the utmost secrecy, the remains of the &amp;Bab 
from the &amp;Imam-Zadih &amp;Ma'sum, where they were concealed, to some 
other place of safety--an act which was subsequently proved to have 
been providential, and which may be regarded as marking another 
stage in the long and laborious transfer of those remains to the heart 
of Mt. Carmel, and to the spot which He, in His instructions to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, was later to designate.  It was during that period that 
the &amp;Suriy-i-Ghusn (&amp;Surih of the Branch) was revealed, in which 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's future station is foreshadowed, and in which He is 
eulogized as the "Branch of Holiness," the "Limb of the Law of God," 
the "Trust of God," "sent down in the form of a human temple"--
a Tablet which may well be regarded as the harbinger of the rank 
which was to be bestowed upon Him, in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, and 
which was to be later elucidated and confirmed in the Book of His 
Covenant.  And finally, it was during that period that the first 
pilgrimages were made to the residence of One Who was now the 
visible Center of a newly-established Faith--pilgrimages which by 
reason of their number and nature, an alarmed government in Persia 
was first impelled to restrict, and later to prohibit, but which were 
the precursors of the converging streams of Pilgrims who, from East 
and West, at first under perilous and arduous circumstances, were 
to direct their steps towards the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka--pilgrimages 
which were to culminate in the historic arrival of a royal convert 
at the foot of Mt. Carmel, who, at the very threshold of a longed-for 
and much advertised pilgrimage, was so cruelly thwarted from 
achieving her purpose.  
     These notable developments, some synchronizing with, and others 
flowing from, the proclamation of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
from the internal convulsion which the Cause had undergone, could 
not escape the attention of the external enemies of the Movement, 
 
+P178 
who were bent on exploiting to the utmost every crisis which the 
folly of its friends or the perfidy of renegades might at any time 
precipitate.  The thick clouds had hardly been dissipated by the 
sudden outburst of the rays of a Sun, now shining from its meridian, 
when the darkness of another catastrophe--the last the Author of 
that Faith was destined to suffer--fell upon it, blackening its firmament 
and subjecting it to one of the severest trials it had as yet 
experienced.  
     Emboldened by the recent ordeals with which &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
been so cruelly afflicted, these enemies, who had been momentarily 
quiescent, began to demonstrate afresh, and in a number of ways, 
the latent animosity they nursed in their hearts.  A persecution, 
varying in the degree of its severity, began once more to break out in 
various countries.  In &amp;Adhirbayjan and &amp;Zanjan, in &amp;Nishapur and 
&amp;Tihran, the adherents of the Faith were either imprisoned, vilified, 
penalized, tortured or put to death.  Among the sufferers may be 
singled out the intrepid &amp;Najaf-'Aliy-i-Zanjani, a survivor of the 
struggle of &amp;Zanjan, and immortalized in the "Epistle to the Son of 
the Wolf," who, bequeathing the gold in his possession to his executioner, 
was heard to shout aloud "&amp;Ya &amp;Rabbiya'l-Abha" before he was 
beheaded.  In Egypt, a greedy and vicious consul-general extorted no 
less than a hundred thousand &amp;tumans from a wealthy Persian convert, 
named &amp;Haji &amp;Abu'l-Qasim-i-Shirazi; arrested &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Haydar-'Ali 
and six of his fellow-believers, and instigated their condemnation 
to a nine year exile in &amp;Khartum, confiscating all the writings in their 
possession, and then threw into prison &amp;Nabil, whom &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
sent to appeal to the Khedive on their behalf.  In &amp;Baghdad and 
&amp;Kazimayn indefatigable enemies, watching their opportunity, subjected 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's faithful supporters to harsh and ignominious 
treatment; savagely disemboweled &amp;Abdu'r-Rasul-i-Qumi, as he was 
carrying water in a skin, at the hour of dawn, from the river to the 
Most Great House, and banished, amidst scenes of public derision, 
about seventy companions to Mosul, including women and children.  
     No less active were &amp;Mirza &amp;Husayn-Khan, the &amp;Mushiru'd-Dawlih, 
and his associates, who, determined to take full advantage of the 
troubles that had recently visited &amp;Baha'u'llah, arose to encompass His 
destruction.  The authorities in the capital were incensed by the 
esteem shown Him by the governor &amp;Muhammad &amp;Pashay-i-Qibrisi, a 
former Grand Vizir, and his successors &amp;Sulayman &amp;Pasha, of the 
&amp;Qadiriyyih Order, and particularly &amp;Khurshid &amp;Pasha, who, openly and 
on many occasions, frequented the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah, entertained 
 
+P179 
Him in the days of &amp;Ramadan, and evinced a fervent admiration for 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  They were well aware of the challenging tone &amp;Baha'u'llah 
had assumed in some of His newly revealed Tablets, and 
conscious of the instability prevailing in their own country.  They 
were disturbed by the constant comings and goings of pilgrims in 
Adrianople, and by the exaggerated reports of &amp;Fu'ad &amp;Pasha, who had 
recently passed through on a tour of inspection.  The petitions of 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya which reached them through Siyyid &amp;Muhammad, his 
agent, had provoked them.  Anonymous letters (written by this same 
Siyyid and by an accomplice, &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, serving in the Turkish artillery) 
which perverted the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and which accused 
Him of having conspired with Bulgarian leaders and certain ministers 
of European powers to achieve, with the help of some thousands 
of His followers, the conquest of Constantinople, had filled their 
breasts with alarm.  And now, encouraged by the internal dissensions 
which had shaken the Faith, and irritated by the evident esteem in 
which &amp;Baha'u'llah was held by the consuls of foreign powers stationed 
in Adrianople, they determined to take drastic and immediate action 
which would extirpate that Faith, isolate its Author and reduce Him 
to powerlessness.  The indiscretions committed by some of its over-zealous 
followers, who had arrived in Constantinople, no doubt, 
aggravated an already acute situation.  
     The fateful decision was eventually arrived at to banish &amp;Baha'u'llah 
to the penal colony of &amp;Akka, and &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya to Famagusta 
in Cyprus.  This decision was embodied in a strongly worded &amp;Farman, 
issued by &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz.  The companions of &amp;Baha'u'llah, who 
had arrived in the capital, together with a few who later joined them, 
as well as &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, the notorious mischief-maker, were arrested, 
interrogated, deprived of their papers and flung into prison.  The 
members of the community in Adrianople were, several times, summoned 
to the governorate to ascertain their number, while rumors 
were set afloat that they were to be dispersed and banished to different 
places or secretly put to death.  
     Suddenly, one morning, the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah was surrounded 
by soldiers, sentinels were posted at its gates, His followers were again 
summoned by the authorities, interrogated, and ordered to make 
ready for their departure.  "The loved ones of God and His kindred," 
is &amp;Baha'u'llah's testimony in the &amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is, "were left on the first 
night without food...  The people surrounded the house, and Muslims 
and Christians wept over Us...  We perceived that the weeping of 
the people of the Son (Christians) exceeded the weeping of others--
 
+P180 
a sign for such as ponder."  "A great tumult seized the people," writes 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Rida, one of the stoutest supporters of &amp;Baha'u'llah, exiled with 
him all the way from &amp;Baghdad to &amp;Akka, "All were perplexed and 
full of regret...  Some expressed their sympathy, others consoled us, 
and wept over us...  Most of our possessions were auctioned at half 
their value."  Some of the consuls of foreign powers called on 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, and expressed their readiness to intervene with their 
respective governments on His behalf--suggestions for which He 
expressed appreciation, but which He firmly declined.  "The consuls 
of that city (Adrianople) gathered in the presence of this Youth at 
the hour of His departure," He Himself has written, "and expressed 
their desire to aid Him.  They, verily, evinced towards Us manifest 
affection."  
     The Persian Ambassador promptly informed the Persian consuls 
in &amp;Iraq and Egypt that the Turkish government had withdrawn its 
protection from the &amp;Babis, and that they were free to treat them as 
they pleased.  Several pilgrims, among whom was &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Isma'il-i-Kashani, surnamed &amp;Anis in the &amp;Lawh-i-Ra'is, had, in the 
meantime, arrived in Adrianople, and had to depart to Gallipoli, 
without even beholding the face of their Master.  Two of the companions 
were forced to divorce their wives, as their relatives refused 
to allow them to go into exile.  &amp;Khurshid &amp;Pasha, who had already 
several times categorically denied the written accusations sent him 
by the authorities in Constantinople, and had interceded vigorously 
on behalf of &amp;Baha'u'llah, was so embarrassed by the action of his 
government that he decided to absent himself when informed of His 
immediate departure from the city, and instructed the Registrar to 
convey to Him the purport of the &amp;Sultan's edict.  &amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far-i-Tabrizi, 
one of the believers, finding that his name had been omitted 
from the list of the exiles who might accompany &amp;Baha'u'llah, cut his 
throat with a razor, but was prevented in time from ending his life--
an act which &amp;Baha'u'llah, in the &amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is, characterizes as 
"unheard of in bygone centuries," and which "God hath set apart for 
this Revelation, as an evidence of the power of His might."  
     On the twenty-second of the month of &amp;Rabi'u'th-Thani 1285 
A.H. (August 12, 1868) &amp;Baha'u'llah and His family, escorted by a 
Turkish captain, &amp;Hasan Effendi by name, and other soldiers appointed 
by the local government, set out on their four-day journey to 
Gallipoli, riding in carriages and stopping on their way at &amp;Uzun-Kupru 
and &amp;Kashanih, at which latter place the &amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is was 
revealed.  "The inhabitants of the quarter in which &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
 
+P181 
been living, and the neighbors who had gathered to bid Him farewell, 
came one after the other," writes an eye-witness, "with the utmost 
sadness and regret to kiss His hands and the hem of His robe, expressing 
meanwhile their sorrow at His departure.  That day, too, 
was a strange day.  Methinks the city, its walls and its gates bemoaned 
their imminent separation from Him."  "On that day," writes another 
eye-witness, "there was a wonderful concourse of Muslims and 
Christians at the door of our Master's house.  The hour of departure 
was a memorable one.  Most of those present were weeping and wailing, 
especially the Christians."  "Say," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself declares in 
the &amp;Suriy-i-Ra'is, "this Youth hath departed out of this country and 
deposited beneath every tree and every stone a trust, which God will 
erelong bring forth through the power of truth."  
     Several of the companions who had been brought from Constantinople 
were awaiting them in Gallipoli.  On his arrival &amp;Baha'u'llah 
made the following pronouncement to &amp;Hasan Effendi, who, his duty 
discharged, was taking his leave:  "Tell the king that this territory 
will pass out of his hands, and his affairs will be thrown into confusion."  
"To this," &amp;Aqa &amp;Rida, the recorder of that scene has written, 
"&amp;Baha'u'llah furthermore added:  `Not I speak these words, but God 
speaketh them.'  In those moments He was uttering verses which we, 
who were downstairs, could overhear.  They were spoken with such 
vehemence and power that, methinks, the foundations of the house 
itself trembled."  
     Even in Gallipoli, where three nights were spent, no one knew 
what &amp;Baha'u'llah's destination would be.  Some believed that He and 
His brothers would be banished to one place, and the remainder dispersed, 
and sent into exile.  Others thought that His companions 
would be sent back to Persia, while still others expected their immediate 
extermination.  The government's original order was to banish 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim and &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli, with a 
servant to &amp;Akka, while the rest were to proceed to Constantinople.  
This order, which provoked scenes of indescribable distress, was, 
however, at the insistence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and by the instrumentality 
of &amp;Umar Effendi, a major appointed to accompany the exiles, revoked.  
It was eventually decided that all the exiles, numbering about 
seventy, should be banished to &amp;Akka.  Instructions were, moreover, 
issued that a certain number of the adherents of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, 
among whom were Siyyid &amp;Muhammad and &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, should accompany 
these exiles, whilst four of the companions of &amp;Baha'u'llah were 
ordered to depart with the &amp;Azalis for Cyprus.  
 
+P182 
     So grievous were the dangers and trials confronting &amp;Baha'u'llah 
at the hour of His departure from Gallipoli that He warned His 
companions that "this journey will be unlike any of the previous 
journeys," and that whoever did not feel himself "man enough to 
face the future" had best "depart to whatever place he pleaseth, and 
be preserved from tests, for hereafter he will find himself unable to 
leave"--a warning which His companions unanimously chose to 
disregard.  
     On the morning of the 2nd of &amp;Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1285 A.H. 
(August 21, 1868) they all embarked in an Austrian-Lloyd steamer 
for Alexandria, touching at &amp;Madelli, and stopping for two days at 
Smyrna, where &amp;Jinab-i-Munir, surnamed &amp;Ismu'llahu'l-Munib, became 
gravely ill, and had, to his great distress, to be left behind in a hospital 
where he soon after died.  In Alexandria they transhipped into a 
steamer of the same company, bound for Haifa, where, after brief 
stops at Port Said and Jaffa, they landed, setting out, a few hours 
later, in a sailing vessel, for &amp;Akka, where they disembarked, in the 
course of the afternoon of the 12th of &amp;Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1285 A.H. 
(August 31, 1868).  It was at the moment when &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
stepped into the boat which was to carry Him to the landing-stage in 
Haifa that &amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar, one of the four companions condemned 
to share the exile of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, and whose "detachment, love and 
trust in God" &amp;Baha'u'llah had greatly praised, cast himself, in his 
despair, into the sea, shouting "&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha," and was subsequently 
rescued and resuscitated with the greatest difficulty, only to 
be forced by adamant officials to continue his voyage, with &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Yahya's party, to the destination originally appointed for him.  
 
+P183 
                                  CHAPTER XI 
                     &amp;Baha'u'llah's Incarceration in &amp;Akka 
 
     The arrival of &amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Akka marks the opening of the 
last phase of His forty-year long ministry, the final stage, and indeed 
the climax, of the banishment in which the whole of that ministry 
was spent.  A banishment that had, at first, brought Him to the 
immediate vicinity of the strongholds of &amp;Shi'ah orthodoxy and into 
contact with its outstanding exponents, and which, at a later period, 
had carried Him to the capital of the Ottoman empire, and led Him 
to address His epoch-making pronouncements to the &amp;Sultan, to his 
ministers and to the ecclesiastical leaders of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam, had now 
been instrumental in landing Him upon the shores of the Holy Land
--the Land promised by God to Abraham, sanctified by the Revelation 
of Moses, honored by the lives and labors of the Hebrew 
patriarchs, judges, kings and prophets, revered as the cradle of 
Christianity, and as the place where Zoroaster, according to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
testimony, had "held converse with some of the Prophets of 
Israel," and associated by &amp;Islam with the Apostle's night-journey, 
through the seven heavens, to the throne of the Almighty.  Within 
the confines of this holy and enviable country, "the nest of all the 
Prophets of God," "the Vale of God's unsearchable Decree, the snow-white 
Spot, the Land of unfading splendor" was the Exile of &amp;Baghdad, 
of Constantinople and Adrianople condemned to spend no less than a 
third of the allotted span of His life, and over half of the total 
period of His Mission.  "It is difficult," declares &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "to 
understand how &amp;Baha'u'llah could have been obliged to leave Persia, 
and to pitch His tent in this Holy Land, but for the persecution of 
His enemies, His banishment and exile."  
     Indeed such a consummation, He assures us, had been actually 
prophesied "through the tongue of the Prophets two or three thousand 
years before."  God, "faithful to His promise," had, "to some of the 
Prophets" "revealed and given the good news that the `Lord of Hosts 
should be manifested in the Holy Land.'"  Isaiah had, in this connection, 
announced in his Book:  "Get thee up into the high mountain, 
O Zion that bringest good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, 
O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings.  Lift it up, be not afraid; 
 
+P184 
say unto the cities of Judah:  `Behold your God!  Behold the Lord 
God will come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him.'"  
David, in his Psalms, had predicted:  "Lift up your heads, O ye gates; 
even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall 
come in.  Who is this King of Glory?  The Lord of Hosts, He is the 
King of Glory."  "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath 
shined.  Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence."  Amos had, 
likewise, foretold His coming:  "The Lord will roar from Zion, and 
utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds 
shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither."  
     &amp;Akka, itself, flanked by the "glory of Lebanon," and lying in 
full view of the "splendor of Carmel," at the foot of the hills which 
enclose the home of Jesus Christ Himself, had been described by 
David as "the Strong City," designated by Hosea as "a door of hope," 
and alluded to by Ezekiel as "the gate that looketh towards the East," 
whereunto "the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of 
the East," His voice "like a noise of many waters."  To it the Arabian 
Prophet had referred as "a city in Syria to which God hath shown His 
special mercy," situated "betwixt two mountains ... in the middle 
of a meadow," "by the shore of the sea ... suspended beneath the 
Throne," "white, whose whiteness is pleasing unto God."  "Blessed 
the man," He, moreover, as confirmed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, had declared, 
"that hath visited &amp;Akka, and blessed he that hath visited the visitor 
of &amp;Akka."  Furthermore, "He that raiseth therein the call to prayer, 
his voice will be lifted up unto Paradise."  And again:  "The poor of 
&amp;Akka are the kings of Paradise and the princes thereof.  A month in 
&amp;Akka is better than a thousand years elsewhere."  Moreover, in a 
remarkable tradition, which is contained in &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ibnu'l-'Arabi's 
work, entitled "&amp;Futuhat-i-Makkiyyih," and which is recognized as an 
authentic utterance of &amp;Muhammad, and is quoted by &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl 
in his "&amp;Fara'id," this significant prediction has been made:  
"All of them (the companions of the &amp;Qa'im) shall be slain except One 
Who shall reach the plain of &amp;Akka, the Banquet-Hall of God."  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, as attested by &amp;Nabil in his narrative, had, 
as far back as the first years of His banishment to Adrianople, alluded 
to that same city in His &amp;Lawh-i-Sayyah, designating it as the "Vale of 
&amp;Nabil," the word &amp;Nabil being equal in numerical value to that of 
&amp;Akka.  "Upon Our arrival," that Tablet had predicted, "We were 
welcomed with banners of light, whereupon the Voice of the Spirit 
cried out saying:  `Soon will all that dwell on earth be enlisted under 
these banners.'"  
 
+P185 
     The banishment, lasting no less than twenty-four years, to which 
two Oriental despots had, in their implacable enmity and shortsightedness, 
combined to condemn &amp;Baha'u'llah, will go down in history 
as a period which witnessed a miraculous and truly revolutionizing 
change in the circumstances attending the life and activities of the 
Exile Himself, will be chiefly remembered for the widespread recrudescence 
of persecution, intermittent but singularly cruel, throughout 
His native country and the simultaneous increase in the number of 
His followers, and, lastly, for an enormous extension in the range 
and volume of His writings.  
     His arrival at the penal colony of &amp;Akka, far from proving the 
end of His afflictions, was but the beginning of a major crisis, characterized 
by bitter suffering, severe restrictions, and intense turmoil, 
which, in its gravity, surpassed even the agonies of the &amp;Siyah-Chal of 
&amp;Tihran, and to which no other event, in the history of the entire 
century can compare, except the internal convulsion that rocked the 
Faith in Adrianople.  "Know thou," &amp;Baha'u'llah, wishing to emphasize 
the criticalness of the first nine years of His banishment to that 
prison-city, has written, "that upon Our arrival at this Spot, We 
chose to designate it as the `Most Great Prison.'  Though previously 
subjected in another land (&amp;Tihran) to chains and fetters, We yet 
refused to call it by that name.  Say:  Ponder thereon, O ye endued 
with understanding!"  
     The ordeal He endured, as a direct consequence of the attempt 
on the life of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, was one which had been inflicted 
upon Him solely by the external enemies of the Faith.  The travail in 
Adrianople, the effects of which all but sundered the community of 
the &amp;Bab's followers, was, on the other hand, purely internal in character.  
This fresh crisis which, during almost a decade, agitated Him 
and His companions, was, however, marked throughout not only by 
the assaults of His adversaries from without, but by the machinations 
of enemies from within, as well as by the grievous misdeeds of those 
who, though bearing His name, perpetrated what made His heart 
and His pen alike to lament.  
     &amp;Akka, the ancient Ptolemais, the St. Jean d'Acre of the Crusaders, 
that had successfully defied the siege of Napoleon, had sunk, under 
the Turks, to the level of a penal colony to which murderers, highway 
robbers and political agitators were consigned from all parts of the 
Turkish empire.  It was girt about by a double system of ramparts; 
was inhabited by a people whom &amp;Baha'u'llah stigmatized as "the generation 
of vipers"; was devoid of any source of water within its gates; 
 
+P186 
was flea-infested, damp and honey-combed with gloomy, filthy and 
tortuous lanes.  "According to what they say," the Supreme Pen has 
recorded in the &amp;Lawh-i-Sultan, "it is the most desolate of the cities 
of the world, the most unsightly of them in appearance, the most 
detestable in climate, and the foulest in water.  It is as though it were 
the metropolis of the owl."  So putrid was its air that, according to a 
proverb, a bird when flying over it would drop dead.  
     Explicit orders had been issued by the &amp;Sultan and his ministers to 
subject the exiles, who were accused of having grievously erred and 
led others far astray, to the strictest confinement.  Hopes were confidently 
expressed that the sentence of life-long imprisonment pronounced 
against them would lead to their eventual extermination.  
The &amp;farman of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz, dated the fifth of &amp;Rabi'u'th-Thani 
1285 A.H. (July 26, 1868), not only condemned them to 
perpetual banishment, but stipulated their strict incarceration, and 
forbade them to associate either with each other or with the local inhabitants. 
The text of the &amp;farman itself was read publicly, soon after 
the arrival of the exiles, in the principal mosque of the city as a 
warning to the population.  The Persian Ambassador, accredited to 
the Sublime Porte, had thus assured his government, in a letter, 
written a little over a year after their banishment to &amp;Akka:  "I have 
issued telegraphic and written instructions, forbidding that He 
(&amp;Baha'u'llah) associate with any one except His wives and children, 
or leave under any circumstances, the house wherein He is imprisoned.  
&amp;Abbas-Quli &amp;Khan, the Consul-General in Damascus ... I have, three 
days ago, sent back, instructing him to proceed direct to &amp;Akka ... 
confer with its governor regarding all necessary measures for the 
strict maintenance of their imprisonment ... and appoint, before 
his return to Damascus, a representative on the spot to insure that the 
orders issued by the Sublime Porte will, in no wise, be disobeyed.  I 
have, likewise, instructed him that once every three months he should 
proceed from Damascus to &amp;Akka, and personally watch over them, 
and submit his report to the Legation."  Such was the isolation imposed 
upon them that the &amp;Baha'is of Persia, perturbed by the rumors 
set afloat by the &amp;Azalis of &amp;Isfahan that &amp;Baha'u'llah had been drowned, 
induced the British Telegraph office in &amp;Julfa to ascertain on their 
behalf the truth of the matter.  
     Having, after a miserable voyage, disembarked at &amp;Akka, all the 
exiles, men, women and children, were, under the eyes of a curious 
and callous population that had assembled at the port to behold the 
"God of the Persians," conducted to the army barracks, where they 
 
+P187 
were locked in, and sentinels detailed to guard them.  "The first night," 
&amp;Baha'u'llah testifies in the &amp;Lawh-i-Ra'is, "all were deprived of either 
food or drink...  They even begged for water, and were refused."  
So filthy and brackish was the water in the pool of the courtyard that 
no one could drink it.  Three loaves of black and salty bread were 
assigned to each, which they were later permitted to exchange, when 
escorted by guards to the market, for two of better quality.  Subsequently 
they were allowed a mere pittance as substitute for the 
allotted dole of bread.  All fell sick, except two, shortly after their 
arrival.  Malaria, dysentery, combined with the sultry heat, added to 
their miseries.  Three succumbed, among them two brothers, who died 
the same night, "locked," as testified by &amp;Baha'u'llah, "in each other's 
arms."  The carpet used by Him He gave to be sold in order to 
provide for their winding-sheets and burial.  The paltry sum obtained 
after it had been auctioned was delivered to the guards, who had 
refused to bury them without first being paid the necessary expenses.  
Later, it was learned that, unwashed and unshrouded, they had buried 
them, without coffins, in the clothes they wore, though, as affirmed by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, they were given twice the amount required for their 
burial.  "None," He Himself has written, "knoweth what befell Us, 
except God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing...  From the foundation 
of the world until the present day a cruelty such as this hath 
neither been seen nor heard of."  "He hath, during the greater part 
of His life," He, referring to Himself, has, moreover, recorded, "been 
sore-tried in the clutches of His enemies.  His sufferings have now 
reached their culmination in this afflictive Prison, into which His 
oppressors have so unjustly thrown Him."  
     The few pilgrims who, despite the ban that had been so rigidly 
imposed, managed to reach the gates of the Prison--some of whom 
had journeyed the entire distance from Persia on foot--had to content 
themselves with a fleeting glimpse of the face of the Prisoner, as they 
stood, beyond the second moat, facing the window of His Prison.  
The very few who succeeded in penetrating into the city had, to their 
great distress, to retrace their steps without even beholding His 
countenance.  The first among them, the self-denying &amp;Haji 
&amp;Abu'l-Hasan-i-Ardikani, surnamed &amp;Amin-i-Ilahi (Trusted of God), to 
enter His presence was only able to do so in a public bath, where it 
had been arranged that he should see &amp;Baha'u'llah without approaching 
Him or giving any sign of recognition.  Another pilgrim, &amp;Ustad 
&amp;Isma'il-i-Kashi, arriving from Mosul, posted himself on the far side 
of the moat, and, gazing for hours, in rapt adoration, at the window 
 
+P188 
of his Beloved, failed in the end, owing to the feebleness of his sight, 
to discern His face, and had to turn back to the cave which served as 
his dwelling-place on Mt. Carmel--an episode that moved to tears 
the Holy Family who had been anxiously watching from afar the 
frustration of his hopes.  &amp;Nabil himself had to precipitately flee the 
city, where he had been recognized, had to satisfy himself with a 
brief glimpse of &amp;Baha'u'llah from across that same moat, and continued 
to roam the countryside around Nazareth, Haifa, Jerusalem 
and Hebron, until the gradual relaxation of restrictions enabled him 
to join the exiles.  
     To the galling weight of these tribulations was now added the 
bitter grief of a sudden tragedy--the premature loss of the noble, the 
pious &amp;Mirza &amp;Mihdi, the Purest Branch, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's twenty-two 
year old brother, an amanuensis of &amp;Baha'u'llah and a companion of 
His exile from the days when, as a child, he was brought from &amp;Tihran 
to &amp;Baghdad to join his Father after His return from &amp;Sulaymaniyyih.  
He was pacing the roof of the barracks in the twilight, one evening, 
wrapped in his customary devotions, when he fell through the unguarded 
skylight onto a wooden crate, standing on the floor beneath, 
which pierced his ribs, and caused, twenty-two hours later, his death, 
on the 23rd of &amp;Rabi'u'l-Avval 1287 A.H. (June 23, 1870).  His 
dying supplication to a grieving Father was that his life might be 
accepted as a ransom for those who were prevented from attaining the 
presence of their Beloved.  
     In a highly significant prayer, revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah in memory 
of His son--a prayer that exalts his death to the rank of those great 
acts of atonement associated with Abraham's intended sacrifice of 
His son, with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the martyrdom of 
the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn--we read the following:  "I have, O my Lord, 
offered up that which Thou hast given Me, that Thy servants may be 
quickened, and all that dwell on earth be united."  And, likewise, 
these prophetic words, addressed to His martyred son:  "Thou art the 
Trust of God and His Treasure in this Land.  Erelong will God reveal 
through thee that which He hath desired."  
     After he had been washed in the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he "that 
was created of the light of &amp;Baha," to whose "meekness" the Supreme 
Pen had testified, and of the "mysteries" of whose ascension that same 
Pen had made mention, was borne forth, escorted by the fortress 
guards, and laid to rest, beyond the city walls, in a spot adjacent to 
the shrine of &amp;Nabi &amp;Salih, from whence, seventy years later, his remains, 
simultaneously with those of his illustrious mother, were to be 
 
+P189 
translated to the slopes of Mt. Carmel, in the precincts of the grave 
of his sister, and under the shadow of the &amp;Bab's holy sepulcher.  
     Nor was this the full measure of the afflictions endured by the 
Prisoner of &amp;Akka and His fellow-exiles.  Four months after this tragic 
event a mobilization of Turkish troops necessitated the removal of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and all who bore Him company from the barracks.  He 
and His family were accordingly assigned the house of Malik, in the 
western quarter of the city, whence, after a brief stay of three 
months, they were moved by the authorities to the house of &amp;Khavvam 
which faced it, and from which, after a few months, they were again 
obliged to take up new quarters in the house of &amp;Rabi'ih, being finally 
transferred, four months later, to the house of &amp;Udi &amp;Khammar, which 
was so insufficient to their needs that in one of its rooms no less than 
thirteen persons of both sexes had to accommodate themselves.  Some 
of the companions had to take up their residence in other houses, 
while the remainder were consigned to a caravanserai named the 
&amp;Khan-i-'Avamid.  
     Their strict confinement had hardly been mitigated, and the 
guards who had kept watch over them been dismissed, when an 
internal crisis, which had been brewing in the midst of the community, 
was brought to a sudden and catastrophic climax.  Such had 
been the conduct of two of the exiles, who had been included in the 
party that accompanied &amp;Baha'u'llah to &amp;Akka, that He was eventually 
forced to expel them, an act of which Siyyid &amp;Muhammad did not 
hesitate to take the fullest advantage.  Reinforced by these recruits, 
he, together with his old associates, acting as spies, embarked on a 
campaign of abuse, calumny and intrigue, even more pernicious than 
that which had been launched by him in Constantinople, calculated 
to arouse an already prejudiced and suspicious populace to a new pitch 
of animosity and excitement.  A fresh danger now clearly threatened 
the life of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Though He Himself had stringently forbidden 
His followers, on several occasions, both verbally and in writing, any 
retaliatory acts against their tormentors, and had even sent back to 
Beirut an irresponsible Arab convert, who had meditated avenging 
the wrongs suffered by his beloved Leader, seven of the companions 
clandestinely sought out and slew three of their persecutors, among 
whom were Siyyid &amp;Muhammad and &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan.  
     The consternation that seized an already oppressed community 
was indescribable.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's indignation knew no bounds.  "Were 
We," He thus voices His emotions, in a Tablet revealed shortly after 
this act had been committed, "to make mention of what befell Us, 
 
+P190 
the heavens would be rent asunder and the mountains would 
crumble."  "My captivity," He wrote on another occasion, "cannot 
harm Me.  That which can harm Me is the conduct of those who 
love Me, who claim to be related to Me, and yet perpetrate what 
causeth My heart and My pen to groan."  And again:  "My captivity 
can bring on Me no shame.  Nay, by My life, it conferreth on Me glory.  
That which can make Me ashamed is the conduct of such of My 
followers as profess to love Me, yet in fact follow the Evil One."  
     He was dictating His Tablets to His amanuensis when the governor, 
at the head of his troops, with drawn swords, surrounded His 
house.  The entire populace, as well as the military authorities, were 
in a state of great agitation.  The shouts and clamor of the people 
could be heard on all sides.  &amp;Baha'u'llah was peremptorily summoned 
to the Governorate, interrogated, kept in custody the first night, 
with one of His sons, in a chamber in the &amp;Khan-i-Shavirdi, transferred 
for the following two nights to better quarters in that neighborhood, 
and allowed only after the lapse of seventy hours to regain 
His home.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was thrown into prison and chained during 
the first night, after which He was permitted to join His Father.  
Twenty-five of the companions were cast into another prison and 
shackled, all of whom, except those responsible for that odious deed, 
whose imprisonment lasted several years, were, after six days, moved 
to the &amp;Khan-i-Shavirdi, and there placed, for six months, under 
confinement.  
     "Is it proper," the Commandant of the city, turning to &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
after He had arrived at the Governorate, boldly inquired, 
"that some of your followers should act in such a manner?"  "If one 
of your soldiers," was the swift rejoinder, "were to commit a reprehensible 
act, would you be held responsible, and be punished in his 
place?"  When interrogated, He was asked to state His name and 
that of the country from which He came.  "It is more manifest than 
the sun," He answered.  The same question was put to Him again, to 
which He gave the following reply:  "I deem it not proper to mention 
it.  Refer to the &amp;farman of the government which is in your possession."  
Once again they, with marked deference, reiterated their 
request, whereupon &amp;Baha'u'llah spoke with majesty and power these 
words:  "My name is &amp;Baha'u'llah (Light of God), and My country is 
&amp;Nur (Light).  Be ye apprized of it."  Turning then, to the &amp;Mufti, 
He addressed him words of veiled rebuke, after which He spoke to the 
entire gathering, in such vehement and exalted language that none 
made bold to answer Him.  Having quoted verses from the &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk, 
 
+P191 
He, afterwards, arose and left the gathering.  The Governor, 
soon after, sent word that He was at liberty to return to His home, 
and apologized for what had occurred.  
     A population, already ill-disposed towards the exiles, was, after 
such an incident, fired with uncontrollable animosity for all those 
who bore the name of the Faith which those exiles professed.  The 
charges of impiety, atheism, terrorism and heresy were openly and 
without restraint flung into their faces.  &amp;Abbud, who lived next door 
to &amp;Baha'u'llah, reinforced the partition that separated his house from 
the dwelling of his now much-feared and suspected Neighbor.  Even 
the children of the imprisoned exiles, whenever they ventured to 
show themselves in the streets during those days, would be pursued, 
vilified and pelted with stones.  
     The cup of &amp;Baha'u'llah's tribulations was now filled to overflowing.  
A situation, greatly humiliating, full of anxieties and even 
perilous, continued to face the exiles, until the time, set by an inscrutable 
Will, at which the tide of misery and abasement began to 
ebb, signalizing a transformation in the fortunes of the Faith even 
more conspicuous than the revolutionary change effected during the 
latter years of &amp;Baha'u'llah's sojourn in &amp;Baghdad.  
     The gradual recognition by all elements of the population of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's complete innocence; the slow penetration of the true 
spirit of His teachings through the hard crust of their indifference 
and bigotry; the substitution of the sagacious and humane governor, 
&amp;Ahmad Big &amp;Tawfiq, for one whose mind had been hopelessly poisoned 
against the Faith and its followers; the unremitting labors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
now in the full flower of His manhood, Who, through His 
contacts with the rank and file of the population, was increasingly 
demonstrating His capacity to act as the shield of His Father; the 
providential dismissal of the officials who had been instrumental in 
prolonging the confinement of the innocent companions--all paved 
the way for the reaction that was now setting in, a reaction with 
which the period of &amp;Baha'u'llah's banishment to &amp;Akka will ever 
remain indissolubly associated.  
     Such was the devotion gradually kindled in the heart of that 
governor, through his association with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and later 
through his perusal of the literature of the Faith, which mischief-makers, 
in the hope of angering him, had submitted for his consideration, 
that he invariably refused to enter His presence without 
first removing his shoes, as a token of his respect for Him.  It was 
even bruited about that his favored counselors were those very exiles 
 
+P192 
who were the followers of the Prisoner in his custody.  His own son 
he was wont to send to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha for instruction and enlightenment.  
It was on the occasion of a long-sought audience with 
&amp;Baha'u'llah that, in response to a request for permission to render Him 
some service, the suggestion was made to him to restore the aqueduct 
which for thirty years had been allowed to fall into disuse--a suggestion 
which he immediately arose to carry out.  To the inflow of 
pilgrims, among whom were numbered the devout and venerable 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Sadiq-i-Khurasani and the father of &amp;Badi, both survivors of 
the struggle of &amp;Tabarsi, he offered scarcely any opposition, though 
the text of the imperial &amp;farman forbade their admission into the 
city.  &amp;Mustafa &amp;Diya &amp;Pasha, who became governor a few years later, 
had even gone so far as to intimate that his Prisoner was free to pass 
through its gates whenever He pleased, a suggestion which &amp;Baha'u'llah 
declined.  Even the &amp;Mufti of &amp;Akka, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Mahmud, a man 
notorious for his bigotry, had been converted to the Faith, and, fired 
by his newborn enthusiasm, made a compilation of the &amp;Muhammadan 
traditions related to &amp;Akka.  Nor were the occasionally unsympathetic 
governors, despatched to that city, able, despite the arbitrary 
power they wielded, to check the forces which were carrying the 
Author of the Faith towards His virtual emancipation and the ultimate 
accomplishment of His purpose.  Men of letters, and even 
&amp;ulamas residing in Syria, were moved, as the years rolled by, to 
voice their recognition of &amp;Baha'u'llah's rising greatness and power.  
&amp;Aziz &amp;Pasha, who, in Adrianople, had evinced a profound attachment 
to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and had in the meantime been promoted to 
the rank of &amp;Vali, twice visited &amp;Akka for the express purpose of 
paying his respects to &amp;Baha'u'llah, and to renew his friendship with 
One Whom he had learned to admire and revere.  
     Though &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself practically never granted personal 
interviews, as He had been used to do in &amp;Baghdad, yet such was the 
influence He now wielded that the inhabitants openly asserted that 
the noticeable improvement in the climate and water of their city 
was directly attributable to His continued presence in their midst.  
The very designations by which they chose to refer to him, such as 
the "august leader," and "his highness" bespoke the reverence with 
which He inspired them.  On one occasion, a European general who, 
together with the governor, was granted an audience by Him, was 
so impressed that he "remained kneeling on the ground near the 
door."  &amp;Shaykh &amp;Aliy-i-Miri, the &amp;Mufti of &amp;Akka, had even, at the 
suggestion of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, to plead insistently that He might permit 
 
+P193 
the termination of His nine-year confinement within the walls 
of the prison-city, before He would consent to leave its gates.  The 
garden of &amp;Na'mayn, a small island, situated in the middle of a river 
to the east of the city, honored with the appellation of &amp;Ridvan, and 
designated by Him the "New Jerusalem" and "Our Verdant Isle," 
had, together with the residence of &amp;Abdu'llah &amp;Pasha,--rented and 
prepared for Him by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and situated a few miles north 
of &amp;Akka--become by now the favorite retreats of One Who, for 
almost a decade, had not set foot beyond the city walls, and Whose 
sole exercise had been to pace, in monotonous repetition, the floor of 
His bed-chamber.  
     Two years later the palace of &amp;Udi &amp;Khammar, on the construction 
of which so much wealth had been lavished, while &amp;Baha'u'llah lay 
imprisoned in the barracks, and which its owner had precipitately 
abandoned with his family owing to the outbreak of an epidemic 
disease, was rented and later purchased for Him--a dwelling-place 
which He characterized as the "lofty mansion," the spot which "God 
hath ordained as the most sublime vision of mankind."  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
visit to Beirut, at the invitation of &amp;Midhat &amp;Pasha, a former Grand 
Vizir of Turkey, occurring about this time; His association with the 
civil and ecclesiastical leaders of that city; His several interviews 
with the well-known &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad &amp;Abdu served to enhance 
immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad 
the fame of its most distinguished member.  The splendid welcome 
accorded him by the learned and highly esteemed &amp;Shaykh &amp;Yusuf, the 
&amp;Mufti of Nazareth, who acted as host to the &amp;valis of Beirut, and who 
had despatched all the notables of the community several miles on the 
road to meet Him as He approached the town, accompanied by His 
brother and the &amp;Mufti of &amp;Akka, as well as the magnificent reception 
given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to that same &amp;Shaykh &amp;Yusuf when the latter 
visited Him in &amp;Akka, were such as to arouse the envy of those who, 
only a few years before, had treated Him and His fellow-exiles with 
feelings compounded of condescension and scorn.  
     The drastic &amp;farman of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz, though officially 
unrepealed, had by now become a dead letter.  Though "&amp;Baha'u'llah 
was still nominally a prisoner, "the doors of majesty and true sovereignty 
were," in the words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "flung wide open."  "The 
rulers of Palestine," He moreover has written, "envied His influence 
and power.  Governors and &amp;mutisarrifs, generals and local officials, 
would humbly request the honor of attaining His presence--a request 
to which He seldom acceded."  
 
+P194 
     It was in that same mansion that the distinguished Orientalist, 
Prof. E. G. Browne of Cambridge, was granted his four successive 
interviews with &amp;Baha'u'llah, during the five days he was His guest 
at &amp;Bahji (April 15-20, 1890), interviews immortalized by the Exile's 
historic declaration that "these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars 
shall pass away and the `Most Great Peace' shall come."  "The face of 
Him on Whom I gazed," is the interviewer's memorable testimony 
for posterity, "I can never forget, though I cannot describe it.  Those 
piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority 
sat on that ample brow....  No need to ask in whose presence I 
stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion 
and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain."  
"Here," the visitor himself has testified, "did I spend five most 
memorable days, during which I enjoyed unparalleled and unhoped-for 
opportunities of holding intercourse with those who are the 
fountain-heads of that mighty and wondrous spirit, which works 
with invisible but ever-increasing force for the transformation and 
quickening of a people who slumber in a sleep like unto death.  It 
was, in truth, a strange and moving experience, but one whereof 
I despair of conveying any save the feeblest impression."  
     In that same year &amp;Baha'u'llah's tent, the "Tabernacle of Glory," 
was raised on Mt. Carmel, "the Hill of God and His Vineyard," the 
home of Elijah, extolled by Isaiah as the "mountain of the Lord," to 
which "all nations shall flow."  Four times He visited Haifa, His last 
visit being no less than three months long.  In the course of one of 
these visits, when His tent was pitched in the vicinity of the Carmelite 
Monastery, He, the "Lord of the Vineyard," revealed the Tablet of 
Carmel, remarkable for its allusions and prophecies.  On another occasion 
He pointed out Himself to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, as He stood on the 
slopes of that mountain, the site which was to serve as the permanent 
resting-place of the &amp;Bab, and on which a befitting mausoleum was 
later to be erected.  
     Properties, bordering on the Lake associated with the ministry 
of Jesus Christ, were, moreover, purchased at &amp;Baha'u'llah's bidding, 
designed to be consecrated to the glory of His Faith, and to be the 
forerunners of those "noble and imposing structures" which He, in 
His Tablets, had anticipated would be raised "throughout the length 
and breadth" of the Holy Land, as well as of the "rich and sacred territories 
adjoining the Jordan and its vicinity," which, in those Tablets, 
He had permitted to be dedicated "to the worship and service of the 
one true God."  
 
+P195 
     The enormous expansion in the volume of &amp;Baha'u'llah's correspondence; 
the establishment of a &amp;Baha'i agency in Alexandria for 
its despatch and distribution; the facilities provided by His staunch 
follower, &amp;Muhammad &amp;Mustafa, now established in Beirut to safeguard 
the interests of the pilgrims who passed through that city; the 
comparative ease with which a titular Prisoner communicated with 
the multiplying centers in Persia, &amp;Iraq, Caucasus, &amp;Turkistan, and 
Egypt; the mission entrusted by Him to &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan-i-Tanakabuni, 
known as &amp;Jamal Effendi, to initiate a systematic campaign of 
teaching in India and Burma; the appointment of a few of His followers 
as "Hands of the Cause of God"; the restoration of the Holy 
House in &amp;Shiraz, whose custodianship was now formally entrusted 
by Him to the &amp;Bab's wife and her sister; the conversion of a considerable 
number of the adherents of the Jewish, Zoroastrian and 
Buddhist Faiths, the first fruits of the zeal and the perseverance which 
itinerant teachers in Persia, India and Burma were so strikingly displaying
--conversions that automatically resulted in a firm recognition 
by them of the Divine origin of both Christianity and &amp;Islam--
all these attested the vitality of a leadership that neither kings nor 
ecclesiastics, however powerful or antagonistic, could either destroy 
or undermine.  
     Nor should reference be omitted to the emergence of a prosperous 
community in the newly laid out city of &amp;Ishqabad, in Russian &amp;Turkistan, 
assured of the good will of a sympathetic government, enabling 
it to establish a &amp;Baha'i cemetery and to purchase property and erect 
thereon structures that were to prove the precursors of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world; or to the establishment of 
new outposts of the Faith in far-off Samarqand and &amp;Bukhara, in the 
heart of the Asiatic continent, in consequence of the discourses and 
writings of the erudite &amp;Fadil-i-Qa'ini and the learned apologist 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl; or to the publication in India of five volumes of 
the writings of the Author of the Faith, including His "Most Holy 
Book"--publications which were to herald the vast multiplication of 
its literature, in various scripts and languages, and its dissemination, 
in later decades, throughout both the East and the West.  
     "&amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz," &amp;Baha'u'llah is reported by one of His 
fellow-exiles to have stated, "banished Us to this country in the greatest 
abasement, and since his object was to destroy Us and humble 
Us, whenever the means of glory and ease presented themselves, We 
did not reject them."  "Now, praise be to God," He, moreover, as 
reported by &amp;Nabil in his narrative, once remarked, "it has reached 
 
+P196 
the point when all the people of these regions are manifesting their 
submissiveness unto Us."  And again, as recorded in that same narrative:  
"The Ottoman &amp;Sultan, without any justification, or reason, 
arose to oppress Us, and sent Us to the fortress of &amp;Akka.  His imperial 
&amp;farman decreed that none should associate with Us, and that We 
should become the object of the hatred of every one.  The Hand of 
Divine power, therefore, swiftly avenged Us.  It first loosed the winds 
of destruction upon his two irreplaceable ministers and confidants, 
&amp;Ali and &amp;Fu'ad, after which that Hand was stretched out to roll up 
the panoply of &amp;Aziz himself, and to seize him, as He only can seize, 
Who is the Mighty, the Strong."  
     "His enemies," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, referring to this same theme, has 
written, "intended that His imprisonment should completely destroy 
and annihilate the blessed Cause, but this prison was, in reality, of 
the greatest assistance, and became the means of its development."  
"...This illustrious Being," He, moreover has affirmed, "uplifted His 
Cause in the Most Great Prison.  From this Prison His light was shed 
abroad; His fame conquered the world, and the proclamation of His 
glory reached the East and the West."  "His light at first had been 
a star; now it became a mighty sun."  "Until our time," He, moreover 
has affirmed, "no such thing has ever occurred."  
     Little wonder that, in view of so remarkable a reversal in the 
circumstances attending the twenty-four years of His banishment to 
&amp;Akka, &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself should have penned these weighty words:  
"The Almighty ... hath transformed this Prison-House into the Most 
Exalted Paradise, the Heaven of Heavens."  
 
+P197 
                                  CHAPTER XII 
                     &amp;Baha'u'llah's Incarceration in &amp;Akka 
                                 (Continued) 
 
     While &amp;Baha'u'llah and the little band that bore Him company 
were being subjected to the severe hardships of a banishment intended 
to blot them from the face of the earth, the steadily expanding community 
of His followers in the land of His birth were undergoing a 
persecution more violent and of longer duration than the trials with 
which He and His companions were being afflicted.  Though on a far 
smaller scale than the blood baths which had baptized the birth of 
the Faith, when in the course of a single year, as attested by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
"more than four thousand souls were slain, and a great multitude 
of women and children left without protector and helper," the murderous 
and horrible acts subsequently perpetrated by an insatiable 
and unyielding enemy covered as wide a range and were marked by an 
even greater degree of ferocity.  
     &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, stigmatized by &amp;Baha'u'llah as the "Prince of 
Oppressors," as one who had "perpetrated what hath caused the 
denizens of the cities of justice and equity to lament," was, during 
the period under review, in the full tide of his manhood and had 
reached the plenitude of his despotic power.  The sole arbiter of the 
fortunes of a country "firmly stereotyped in the immemorial traditions 
of the East"; surrounded by "venal, artful and false" ministers 
whom he could elevate or abase at his pleasure; the head of an administration 
in which "every actor was, in different aspects, both the 
briber and the bribed"; allied, in his opposition to the Faith, with a 
sacerdotal order which constituted a veritable "church-state"; supported 
by a people preeminent in atrocity, notorious for its fanaticism, 
its servility, cupidity and corrupt practices, this capricious 
monarch, no longer able to lay hands upon the person of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
had to content himself with the task of attempting to stamp out in 
his own dominions the remnants of a much-feared and newly resuscitated 
community.  Next to him in rank and power were his three 
eldest sons, to whom, for purposes of internal administration, he had 
practically delegated his authority, and in whom he had invested the 
governorship of all the provinces of his kingdom.  The province of 
 
+P198 
&amp;Adhirbayjan he had entrusted to the weak and timid &amp;Muzaffari'd-Din 
&amp;Mirza, the heir to his throne, who had fallen under the influence of 
the &amp;Shaykhi sect, and was showing a marked respect to the &amp;mullas.  
To the stern and savage rule of the astute &amp;Mas'ud &amp;Mirza, commonly 
known as &amp;Zillu's-Sultan, his eldest surviving son, whose mother had 
been of plebeian origin, he had committed over two-fifths of his 
kingdom, including the provinces of Yazd and &amp;Isfahan, whilst upon 
&amp;Kamran &amp;Mirza, his favorite son, commonly called by his title the 
&amp;Nayibu's-Saltanih, he had bestowed the rulership of &amp;Gilan and 
&amp;Mazindaran, and made him governor of &amp;Tihran, his minister of war 
and the commander-in-chief of his army.  Such was the rivalry 
between the last two princes, who vied with each other in courting 
the favor of their father, that each endeavored, with the support of 
the leading mujtahids within his jurisdiction, to outshine the other 
in the meritorious task of hunting, plundering and exterminating 
the members of a defenseless community, who, at the bidding of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, had ceased to offer armed resistance even in self-defense, 
and were carrying out His injunction that "it is better to be killed 
than kill."  Nor were the clerical firebrands, &amp;Haji &amp;Mulla &amp;Aliy-i-Kani 
and Siyyid &amp;Sadiq-i-Tabataba'i, the two leading mujtahids of &amp;Tihran, 
together with &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Baqir, their colleague in &amp;Isfahan, 
and &amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad-Husayn, the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih of that city, willing 
to allow the slightest opportunity to pass without striking, with all 
the force and authority they wielded, at an adversary whose liberalizing 
influences they had even more reason to fear than the sovereign 
himself.  
     Little wonder that, confronted by a situation so full of peril, the 
Faith should have been driven underground, and that arrests, interrogations, 
imprisonment, vituperation, spoliation, tortures and executions 
should constitute the outstanding features of this convulsive 
period in its development.  The pilgrimages that had been initiated 
in Adrianople, and which later assumed in &amp;Akka impressive proportions, 
together with the dissemination of the Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and the circulation of enthusiastic reports through the medium of 
those who had attained His presence served, moreover, to inflame the 
animosity of clergy and laity alike, who had foolishly imagined that 
the breach which had occurred in the ranks of the followers of the 
Faith in Adrianople and the sentence of life banishment pronounced 
subsequently against its Leader, would seal irretrievably its fate.  
     In &amp;Abadih a certain &amp;Ustad &amp;Ali-Akbar was, at the instigation of 
a local Siyyid, apprehended and so ruthlessly thrashed that he was 
 
+P199 
covered from head to foot with his own blood.  In the village of 
&amp;Takur, at the bidding of the &amp;Shah, the property of the inhabitants 
was pillaged, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Rida-Quli, a half-brother of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
was arrested, conducted to the capital and thrown into the &amp;Siyah-Chal, 
where he remained for a month, whilst the brother-in-law of &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Hasan, another half-brother of &amp;Baha'u'llah, was seized and branded 
with red-hot irons, after which the neighboring village of &amp;Dar-Kala 
was delivered to the flames.  
     &amp;Aqa Buzurg of &amp;Khurasan, the illustrious "&amp;Badi'" (Wonderful); 
converted to the Faith by &amp;Nabil; surnamed the "Pride of Martyrs"; 
the seventeen-year old bearer of the Tablet addressed to &amp;Nasiri'd-Din 
&amp;Shah; in whom, as affirmed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, "the spirit of might 
and power was breathed," was arrested, branded for three successive 
days, his head beaten to a pulp with the butt of a rifle, after which 
his body was thrown into a pit and earth and stones heaped upon it.  
After visiting &amp;Baha'u'llah in the barracks, during the second year of 
His confinement, he had arisen with amazing alacrity to carry that 
Tablet, alone and on foot, to &amp;Tihran and deliver it into the hands of 
the sovereign.  A four months' journey had taken him to that city, 
and, after passing three days in fasting and vigilance, he had met the 
&amp;Shah proceeding on a hunting expedition to &amp;Shimiran.  He had calmly 
and respectfully approached His Majesty, calling out, "O King!  I 
have come to thee from Sheba with a weighty message"; whereupon 
at the Sovereign's order, the Tablet was taken from him and delivered 
to the mujtahids of &amp;Tihran who were commanded to reply to that 
Epistle--a command which they evaded, recommending instead that 
the messenger should be put to death.  That Tablet was subsequently 
forwarded by the &amp;Shah to the Persian Ambassador in Constantinople, 
in the hope that its perusal by the &amp;Sultan's ministers might serve to 
further inflame their animosity.  For a space of three years &amp;Baha'u'llah 
continued to extol in His writings the heroism of that youth, characterizing 
the references made by Him to that sublime sacrifice as 
the "salt of My Tablets."  
     &amp;Aba-Basir and Siyyid &amp;Ashraf, whose fathers had been slain in the 
struggle of &amp;Zanjan, were decapitated on the same day in that city, 
the former going so far as to instruct, while kneeling in prayer, his 
executioner as to how best to deal his blow, while the latter, after 
having been so brutally beaten that blood flowed from under his 
nails, was beheaded, as he held in his arms the body of his martyred 
companion.  It was the mother of this same &amp;Ashraf who, when sent 
to the prison in the hope that she would persuade her only son to 
 
+P200 
recant, had warned him that she would disown him were he to denounce 
his faith, had bidden him follow the example of &amp;Aba-Basir, and had 
even watched him expire with eyes undimmed with tears.  The wealthy 
and prominent &amp;Muhammad-Hasan &amp;Khan-i-Kashi was so mercilessly 
bastinadoed in &amp;Burujird that he succumbed to his ordeal.  In &amp;Shiraz 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqay-i-Rikab-Saz, together with &amp;Mirza &amp;Rafi'-i-Khayyat and 
&amp;Mashhadi &amp;Nabi, were by order of the local mujtahid simultaneously 
strangled in the dead of night, their graves being later desecrated 
by a mob who heaped refuse upon them.  &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abu'l-Qasim-i-Mazkani 
in &amp;Kashan, who had declined a drink of water that was 
offered him before his death, affirming that he thirsted for the cup 
of martyrdom, was dealt a fatal blow on the nape of his neck, whilst 
he was prostrating himself in prayer.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Baqir-i-Shirazi, who had transcribed the Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in Adrianople with such unsparing devotion, was slain in 
&amp;Kirman, while in &amp;Ardikan the aged and infirm &amp;Gul-Muhammad was 
set upon by a furious mob, thrown to the ground, and so trampled 
upon by the hob-nailed boots of two siyyids that his ribs were 
crushed in and his teeth broken, after which his body was taken to 
the outskirts of the town and buried in a pit, only to be dug up the 
next day, dragged through the streets, and finally abandoned in the 
wilderness.  In the city of &amp;Mashhad, notorious for its unbridled 
fanaticism, &amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'l-Majid, who was the eighty-five year old 
father of the afore-mentioned &amp;Badi' and a survivor of the struggle of 
&amp;Tabarsi, and who, after the martyrdom of his son, had visited &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and returned afire with zeal to &amp;Khurasan, was ripped open 
from waist to throat, and his head exposed on a marble slab to the 
gaze of a multitude of insulting onlookers, who, after dragging his 
body ignominiously through the bazaars, left it at the morgue to be 
claimed by his relatives.  
     In &amp;Isfahan &amp;Mulla &amp;Kazim was beheaded by order of &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Muhammad-Baqir, and a horse made to gallop over his corpse, which 
was then delivered to the flames, while Siyyid &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan had his ears 
cut off, and was led by a halter through the streets and bazaars.  A 
month later occurred in that same city the tragedy of the two famous 
brothers &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Hasan and &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Husayn, 
the "twin shining lights," respectively surnamed "&amp;Sultanu'sh-Shuhada" 
(King of Martyrs) and "&amp;Mahbubu'sh-Shuhada" (Beloved of Martyrs), 
who were celebrated for their generosity, trustworthiness, kindliness 
and piety.  Their martyrdom was instigated by the wicked and dishonest 
&amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad-Husayn, the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih, stigmatized by 
 
+P201 
&amp;Baha'u'llah as the "she-serpent," who, in view of a large debt he had 
incurred in his transactions with them, schemed to nullify his obligations 
by denouncing them as &amp;Babis, and thereby encompassing their 
death.  Their richly-furnished houses were plundered, even to the 
trees and flowers in their gardens, all their remaining possessions were 
confiscated; &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Baqir, denounced by &amp;Baha'u'llah as 
the "wolf," pronounced their death-sentence; the &amp;Zillu's-Sultan ratified 
the decision, after which they were put in chains, decapitated, 
dragged to the &amp;Maydan-i-Shah, and there exposed to the indignities 
heaped upon them by a degraded and rapacious populace.  "In such 
wise," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has written, "was the blood of these two brothers 
shed that the Christian priest of &amp;Julfa cried out, lamented and wept 
on that day."  For several years &amp;Baha'u'llah in His Tablets continued 
to make mention of them, to voice His grief over their passing and to 
extol their virtues.  
     &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali &amp;Jan was conducted on foot from &amp;Mazindaran to &amp;Tihran, 
the hardships of that journey being so severe that his neck was 
wounded and his body swollen from the waist to the feet.  On the 
day of his martyrdom he asked for water, performed his ablutions, 
recited his prayers, bestowed a considerable gift of money on his 
executioner, and was still in the act of prayer when his throat was 
slit by a dagger, after which his corpse was spat upon, covered with 
mud, left exposed for three days, and finally hewn to pieces.  In 
&amp;Namiq &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali, converted to the Faith in the days of the &amp;Bab, 
was so severely attacked and his ribs so badly broken with a pick-axe 
that he died immediately.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Ashraf was slain in &amp;Isfahan, his 
corpse trampled under foot by &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad &amp;Taqiy-i-Najafi, 
the "son of the wolf," and his pupils, savagely mutilated, and 
delivered to the mob to be burnt, after which his charred bones were 
buried beneath the ruins of a wall that was pulled down to cover 
them.  
     In Yazd, at the instigation of the mujtahid of that city, and by 
order of the callous &amp;Mahmud &amp;Mirza, the &amp;Jalulu'l-Dawlih, the governor, 
a son of &amp;Zillu's-Sultan, seven were done to death in a single day in 
horrible circumstances.  The first of these, a twenty-seven year old 
youth, &amp;Ali-Asghar, was strangled, his body delivered into the hands 
of some Jews who, forcing the dead man's six companions to come 
with them, dragged the corpse through the streets, surrounded by a 
mob of people and soldiers beating drums and blowing trumpets, 
after which, arriving near the Telegraph Office, they beheaded the 
eighty-five year old &amp;Mulla &amp;Mihdi and dragged him in the same manner 
 
+P202 
to another quarter of the city, where, in view of a great throng of 
onlookers, frenzied by the throbbing strains of the music, they 
executed &amp;Aqa &amp;Ali in like manner.  Proceeding thence to the house 
of the local mujtahid, and carrying with them the four remaining 
companions, they cut the throat of &amp;Mulla &amp;Aliy-i-Sabzivari, who had 
been addressing the crowd and glorying in his imminent martyrdom, 
hacked his body to pieces with a spade, while he was still alive, and 
pounded his skull to a pulp with stones.  In another quarter, near 
the &amp;Mihriz gate, they slew &amp;Muhammad-Baqir, and afterwards, in the 
&amp;Maydan-i-Khan, as the music grew wilder and drowned the yells of 
the people, they beheaded the survivors who remained, two brothers 
in their early twenties, &amp;Ali-Asghar and &amp;Muhammad-Hasan.  The 
stomach of the latter was ripped open and his heart and liver plucked 
out, after which his head was impaled on a spear, carried aloft, to the 
accompaniment of music, through the streets of the city, and suspended 
on a mulberry tree, and stoned by a great concourse of people.  
His body was cast before the door of his mother's house, into which 
women deliberately entered to dance and make merry.  Even pieces 
of their flesh were carried away to be used as a medicament.  Finally, 
the head of &amp;Muhammad-Hasan was attached to the lower part of his 
body and, together with those of the other martyrs, was borne to the 
outskirts of the city and so viciously pelted with stones that the 
skulls were broken, whereupon they compelled the Jews to carry 
the remains and throw them into a pit in the plain of &amp;Salsabil.  A 
holiday was declared by the governor for the people, all the shops 
were closed by his order, the city was illuminated at night, and festivities 
proclaimed the consummation of one of the most barbarous acts 
perpetrated in modern times.  
     Nor were the Jews and the Parsis who had been newly converted 
to the Faith, and were living, the former in &amp;Hamadan, and the latter 
in Yazd, immune to the assaults of enemies whose fury was exasperated 
by the evidences of the penetration of the light of the Faith 
in quarters they had fondly imagined to be beyond its reach.  Even 
in the city of &amp;Ishqabad the newly established &amp;Shi'ah community, 
envious of the rising prestige of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah who 
were living in their midst, instigated two ruffians to assault the 
seventy-year old &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Riday-i-Isfahani, whom, in broad 
day and in the midst of the bazaar, they stabbed in no less than 
thirty-two places, exposing his liver, lacerating his stomach and tearing 
open his breast.  A military court dispatched by the Czar to 
&amp;Ishqabad established, after prolonged investigation, the guilt of the 
 
+P203 
&amp;Shi'ahs, sentencing two to death and banishing six others--a sentence 
which neither &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, nor the &amp;ulamas of &amp;Tihran, of 
&amp;Mashhad and of &amp;Tabriz, who were appealed to, could mitigate, but 
which the representatives of the aggrieved community, through their 
magnanimous intercession which greatly surprised the Russian authorities, 
succeeded in having commuted to a lighter punishment.  
     Such are some typical examples of the treatment meted out by 
the adversaries of the Faith to the newly resurgent community of its 
followers during the period of &amp;Baha'u'llah's banishment to &amp;Akka--a 
treatment which it may be truly said testified alternately to "the 
callousness of the brute and the ingenuity of the fiend."  
     The "inquisition and appalling tortures," following the attempt 
on the life of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, had already, in the words of no less 
eminent an observer than Lord Curzon of Kedleston, imparted to the 
Faith "a vitality which no other impulse could have secured."  This 
recrudescence of persecution, this fresh outpouring of the blood of 
martyrs, served to further enliven the roots which that holy Sapling 
had already struck in its native soil.  Careless of the policy of fire and 
blood which aimed at their annihilation, undismayed by the tragic 
blows rained upon a Leader so far removed from their midst, uncorrupted 
by the foul and seditious acts perpetrated by the Arch-Breaker 
of the &amp;Bab's Covenant, the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah were multiplying 
in number and silently gathering the necessary strength that was to 
enable them, at a later stage, to lift their heads in freedom, and rear 
the fabric of their institutions.  
     Soon after his visit to Persia in the autumn of 1889 Lord Curzon 
of Kedleston wrote, in the course of references designed to dispel 
the "great confusion" and "error" prevailing "among European and 
specially English writers" regarding the Faith, that "the &amp;Baha'is are 
now believed to comprise nineteen-twentieths of the &amp;Babi persuasion."  
Count Gobineau, writing as far back as the year 1865, testified 
as follows:  "L'opinion &amp;generale est que les &amp;Babis sont &amp;repandus dans 
toutes les classes de la population et parmi tous les religionnaires de la 
Perse, sauf les &amp;Nusayris et les &amp;Chretiens; mais ce sont surtout les 
classes &amp;eclairees, les hommes pratiquant les sciences du pays, qui sont 
&amp;donnes comme &amp;tres suspects.  On pense, et avec raison, ce semble, 
que beaucoup de &amp;mullas, et parmi eux des mujtahids &amp;considerables, 
des magistrats d'un rang &amp;eleve, des hommes qui occupent &amp;a la cour 
des fonctions importantes et qui approchent de &amp;pres la personne du 
Roi, sont des &amp;Babis.  &amp;D'apres un calcul fait &amp;recemment, il y aurait a 
&amp;Tihran cinq milles de ces religionnaires sur une population de quatre-vingt 
 
+P204 
milles &amp;ames a peu &amp;pres."  Furthermore:  "...Le &amp;Babisme a 
pris une action &amp;considerable sur l'intelligence de la nation persane, et, 
se rependant &amp;meme au &amp;dela des limites du territoire, il a &amp;deborde dans 
le pachalik de &amp;Baghdad, et &amp;passe aussi dans l'Inde."  And again:  
"...Un mouvement religieux tout particulier dont l'Asie Centrale, 
&amp;c'est-a-dire la Perse, quelques points de l'Inde et une partie de la 
Turquie d'Asie, aux environs de &amp;Baghdad, est aujourd'hui vivement 
&amp;preoccupee, mouvement remarquable et digne &amp;d'etre &amp;etudie &amp;a tous 
les titres.  Il permet d'assister &amp;a des &amp;developpements de faits, &amp;a des 
manifestations, &amp;a des catastrophes telles que l'on n'est pas &amp;habitue &amp;a les 
imaginer ailleurs que dans les temps &amp;recules &amp;ou se sont produites les 
grandes religions."  
     "These changes, however," Lord Curzon, alluding to the Declaration 
of the Mission of &amp;Baha'u'llah and the rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, 
has, moreover written, "have in no wise impaired, but appear on the 
contrary, to have stimulated its propaganda, which has advanced 
with a rapidity inexplicable to those who can only see therein a crude 
form of political or even of metaphysical fermentation.  The lowest 
estimate places the present number of &amp;Babis in Persia at half a 
million.  I am disposed to think, from conversations with persons 
well qualified to judge, that the total is nearer one million."  "They 
are to be found," he adds, "in every walk of life, from the ministers 
and nobles of the Court to the scavenger or the groom, not the least 
arena of their activity being the &amp;Musulman priesthood itself."  "From 
the facts," is another testimony of his, "that &amp;Babism in its earliest 
years found itself in conflict with the civil powers, and that an 
attempt was made by &amp;Babis upon the life of the &amp;Shah, it has been 
wrongly inferred that the movement was political in origin and 
Nihilist in character...  At the present time the &amp;Babis are equally 
loyal with any other subjects of the Crown.  Nor does there appear 
to be any greater justice in the charges of socialism, communism and 
immorality that have so freely been levelled at the youthful persuasion 
...The only communism known to and recommended by Him 
(the &amp;Bab) was that of the New Testament and the early Christian 
Church, viz., the sharing of goods in common by members of the 
Faith, and the exercise of alms-giving, and an ample charity.  The 
charge of immorality seems to have arisen partly from the malignant 
inventions of opponents, partly from the much greater freedom 
claimed for women by the &amp;Bab, which in the oriental mind is scarcely 
dissociable from profligacy of conduct."  And, finally, the following 
prognostication from his pen:  "If &amp;Babism continues to grow at its 
 
+P205 
present rate of progression, a time may conceivably come when it will 
oust &amp;Muhammadanism from the field in Persia.  This, I think, it 
would be unlikely to do, did it appear upon the ground under the 
flag of a hostile faith.  But since its recruits are won from the best 
soldiers of the garrison whom it is attacking, there is greater reason 
to believe that it may ultimately prevail."  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah's incarceration in the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka, the 
manifold tribulations He endured, the prolonged ordeal to which 
the community of His followers in Persia was being subjected, did not 
arrest, nor could they even impede, to the slightest degree, the mighty 
stream of Divine Revelation, which, without interruption, had been 
flowing from His pen, and on which the future orientation, the 
integrity, the expansion and the consolidation of His Faith directly 
depended.  Indeed, in their scope and volume, His writings, during the 
years of His confinement in the Most Great Prison, surpassed the outpourings 
of His pen in either Adrianople or &amp;Baghdad.  More remarkable 
than the radical transformation in the circumstances of His own life 
in &amp;Akka, more far-reaching in its spiritual consequences than the 
campaign of repression pursued so relentlessly by the enemies of His 
Faith in the land of His birth, this unprecedented extension in the 
range of His writings, during His exile in that Prison, must rank 
as one of the most vitalizing and fruitful stages in the evolution of 
His Faith.  
     The tempestuous winds that swept the Faith at the inception of 
His ministry and the wintry desolation that marked the beginnings 
of His prophetic career, soon after His banishment from &amp;Tihran, 
were followed during the latter part of His sojourn in &amp;Baghdad, by 
what may be described as the vernal years of His Mission--years 
which witnessed the bursting into visible activity of the forces inherent 
in that Divine Seed that had lain dormant since the tragic 
removal of His Forerunner.  With His arrival in Adrianople and the 
proclamation of His Mission the Orb of His Revelation climbed as it 
were to its zenith, and shone, as witnessed by the style and tone of 
His writings, in the plenitude of its summer glory.  The period of 
His incarceration in &amp;Akka brought with it the ripening of a slowly 
maturing process, and was a period during which the choicest fruits 
of that mission were ultimately garnered.  
     The writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah during this period, as we survey the 
vast field which they embrace, seem to fall into three distinct categories.  
The first comprises those writings which constitute the sequel 
to the proclamation of His Mission in Adrianople.  The second 
 
+P206 
includes the laws and ordinances of His Dispensation, which, for the 
most part, have been recorded in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, His Most Holy 
Book.  To the third must be assigned those Tablets which partly 
enunciate and partly reaffirm the fundamental tenets and principles 
underlying that Dispensation.  
     The Proclamation of His Mission had been, as already observed, 
directed particularly to the kings of the earth, who, by virtue of the 
power and authority they wielded, were invested with a peculiar and 
inescapable responsibility for the destinies of their subjects.  It was to 
these kings, as well as to the world's religious leaders, who exercised a 
no less pervasive influence on the mass of their followers, that the 
Prisoner of &amp;Akka directed His appeals, warnings, and exhortations 
during the first years of His incarceration in that city.  "Upon Our 
arrival at this Prison," He Himself affirms, "We purposed to transmit 
to the kings the messages of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised.  
Though We have transmitted to them, in several Tablets, that which 
We were commanded, yet We do it once again, as a token of God's 
grace."  
     To the kings of the earth, both in the East and in the West, both 
Christian and Muslim, who had already been collectively admonished 
and warned in the &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk revealed in Adrianople, and 
had been so vehemently summoned by the &amp;Bab, in the opening chapter 
of the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', on the very night of the Declaration of His 
Mission, &amp;Baha'u'llah, during the darkest days of His confinement in 
&amp;Akka, addressed some of the noblest passages of His Most Holy Book.  
In these passages He called upon them to take fast hold of the "Most 
Great Law"; proclaimed Himself to be "the King of Kings" and "the 
Desire of all Nations"; declared them to be His "vassals" and "emblems 
of His sovereignty"; disclaimed any intention of laying hands on 
their kingdoms; bade them forsake their palaces, and hasten to gain 
admittance into His Kingdom; extolled the king who would arise 
to aid His Cause as "the very eye of mankind"; and finally arraigned 
them for the things which had befallen Him at their hands.  
     In His Tablet to Queen Victoria He, moreover, invites these kings 
to hold fast to "the Lesser Peace," since they had refused "the Most 
Great Peace"; exhorts them to be reconciled among themselves, to 
unite and to reduce their armaments; bids them refrain from laying 
excessive burdens on their subjects, who, He informs them, are their 
"wards" and "treasures"; enunciates the principle that should any one 
among them take up arms against another, all should rise against him; 
 
+P207 
and warns them not to deal with Him as the "King of &amp;Islam" and 
his ministers had dealt.  
     To the Emperor of the French, Napoleon III, the most prominent 
and influential monarch of his day in the West, designated by Him 
as the "Chief of Sovereigns," and who, to quote His words, had "cast 
behind his back" the Tablet revealed for him in Adrianople, He, 
while a prisoner in the army barracks, addressed a second Tablet and 
transmitted it through the French agent in &amp;Akka.  In this He announces 
the coming of "Him Who is the Unconstrained," whose 
purpose is to "quicken the world" and unite its peoples; unequivocally 
asserts that Jesus Christ was the Herald of His Mission; proclaims 
the fall of "the stars of the firmament of knowledge," who have 
turned aside from Him; exposes that monarch's insincerity; and 
clearly prophesies that his kingdom shall be "thrown into confusion," 
that his "empire shall pass" from his hands, and that "commotions 
shall seize all the people in that land," unless he arises to help the 
Cause of God and follow Him Who is His Spirit.  
     In memorable passages addressed to "the Rulers of America and 
the Presidents of the Republics therein" He, in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
calls upon them to "adorn the temple of dominion with the ornament 
of justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of 
remembrance" of their Lord; declares that "the Promised One" has 
been made manifest; counsels them to avail themselves of the "Day of 
God"; and bids them "bind with the hands of justice the broken" and 
"crush" the "oppressor" with "the rod of the commandments of their 
Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise."  
     To Nicolaevitch Alexander II, the all-powerful Czar of Russia, 
He addressed, as He lay a prisoner in the barracks, an Epistle wherein 
He announces the advent of the promised Father, Whom "the tongue 
of Isaiah hath extolled," and "with Whose name both the Torah and 
the Evangel were adorned"; commands him to "arise ... and summon 
the nations unto God"; warns him to beware lest his sovereignty 
withhold him from "Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign"; acknowledges 
the aid extended by his Ambassador in &amp;Tihran; and cautions him 
not to forfeit the station ordained for him by God.  
     To Queen Victoria He, during that same period, addressed an 
Epistle in which He calls upon her to incline her ear to the voice of 
her Lord, the Lord of all mankind; bids her "cast away all that is on 
earth," and set her heart towards her Lord, the Ancient of Days; 
asserts that "all that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been 
fulfilled"; assures her that God would reward her for having "forbidden 
 
+P208 
the trading in slaves," were she to follow what has been sent 
unto her by Him; commends her for having "entrusted the reins of 
counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people"; and 
exhorts them to "regard themselves as the representatives of all that 
dwell on earth," and to judge between men with "pure justice."  
     In a celebrated passage addressed to William I, King of Prussia 
and newly-acclaimed emperor of a unified Germany, He, in His 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, bids the sovereign hearken to His Voice, the Voice 
of God Himself; warns him to take heed lest his pride debar him from 
recognizing "the Day-Spring of Divine Revelation," and admonishes 
him to "remember the one (Napoleon III) whose power transcended" 
his power, and who "went down to dust in great loss."  Furthermore, 
in that same Book, apostrophizing the "banks of the Rhine," He predicts 
that "the swords of retribution" would be drawn against them, 
and that "the lamentations of Berlin" would be raised, though at that 
time she was "in conspicuous glory."  
     In another notable passage of that same Book, addressed to Francis-Joseph, 
the Austrian Emperor and heir of the Holy Roman Empire, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah reproves the sovereign for having neglected to inquire 
about Him in the course of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; takes God to 
witness that He had found him "clinging unto the Branch and heedless 
of the Root"; grieves to observe his waywardness; and bids him 
open his eyes and gaze on "the Light that shineth above this luminous 
Horizon."  
     To &amp;Ali &amp;Pasha, the Grand Vizir of the &amp;Sultan of Turkey He 
addressed, shortly after His arrival in &amp;Akka, a second Tablet, in 
which He reprimands him for his cruelty "that hath made hell to 
blaze and the Spirit to lament"; recounts his acts of oppression; condemns 
him as one of those who, from time immemorial, have denounced 
the Prophets as stirrers of mischief; prophesies his downfall; 
expatiates on His own sufferings and those of His fellow-exiles; 
extolls their fortitude and detachment; predicts that God's "wrathful 
anger" will seize him and his government, that "sedition will be 
stirred up" in their midst, and that their "dominions will be disrupted"; 
and affirms that were he to awake, he would abandon all his 
possessions, and would "choose to abide in one of the dilapidated 
rooms of this Most Great Prison."  In the &amp;Lawh-i-Fu'ad, in the course 
of His reference to the premature death of the &amp;Sultan's Foreign Minister, 
&amp;Fu'ad &amp;Pasha, He thus confirms His above-mentioned prediction:  
"Soon will We dismiss the one (&amp;Ali &amp;Pasha) who was like unto him 
 
+P209 
and will lay hold on their Chief (&amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz) who ruleth 
the land, and I, verily, am the Almighty, the All-Compelling."  
     No less outspoken and emphatic are the messages, some embodied 
in specific Tablets, others interspersed through His writings, which 
&amp;Baha'u'llah addressed to the world's ecclesiastical leaders of all 
denominations--messages in which He discloses, clearly and unreservedly, 
the claims of His Revelation, summons them to heed His call, and 
denounces, in certain specific cases, their perversity, their extreme 
arrogance and tyranny.  
     In immortal passages of His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas and other Tablets He 
bids the entire company of these ecclesiastical leaders to "fear God," 
to "rein in" their pens, "fling away idle fancies and imaginings, and 
turn then towards the Horizon of Certitude"; warns them to "weigh 
not the Book of God (&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas) with such standards and sciences 
as are current" amongst them; designates that same Book as the 
"Unerring Balance established amongst men"; laments over their 
blindness and waywardness; asserts His superiority in vision, insight, 
utterance and wisdom; proclaims His innate and God-given knowledge; 
cautions them not to "shut out the people by yet another veil," 
after He Himself had "rent the veils asunder"; accuses them of having 
been "the cause of the repudiation of the Faith in its early days"; and 
adjures them to "peruse with fairness and justice that which hath been 
sent down" by Him, and to "nullify not the Truth" with the things 
they possess.  
     To Pope Pius IX, the undisputed head of the most powerful 
Church in Christendom, possessor of both temporal and spiritual 
authority, He, a Prisoner in the army barracks of the penal-colony of 
&amp;Akka, addressed a most weighty Epistle, in which He announces that 
"He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with clouds," 
and that "the Word which the Son concealed is made manifest."  He, 
moreover, warns him not to dispute with Him even as the Pharisees 
of old disputed with Jesus Christ; bids him leave his palaces unto such 
as desire them, "sell all the embellished ornaments" in his possession, 
"expend them in the path of God," abandon his kingdom unto the 
kings, "arise ... amidst the peoples of the earth," and summon them 
to His Faith.  Regarding him as one of the suns of the heaven of God's 
names, He cautions him to guard himself lest "darkness spread its veils" 
over him; calls upon him to "exhort the kings" to "deal equitably with 
men"; and counsels him to walk in the footsteps of his Lord, and 
follow His example.  
     To the patriarchs of the Christian Church He issued a specific 
 
+P210 
summons in which He proclaims the coming of the Promised One; 
exhorts them to "fear God" and not to follow "the vain imaginings of 
the superstitious"; and directs them to lay aside the things they possess 
and "take fast hold of the Tablet of God by His sovereign power."  To 
the archbishops of that Church He similarly declares that "He Who 
is the Lord of all men hath appeared," that they are "numbered with 
the dead," and that great is the blessedness of him who is "stirred by 
the breeze of God, and hath arisen from amongst the dead in this 
perspicuous Name."  In passages addressed to its bishops He proclaims 
that "the Everlasting Father calleth aloud between earth and heaven," 
pronounces them to be the fallen stars of the heaven of His knowledge, 
and affirms that His body "yearneth for the cross" and His head is 
"eager for the spear in the path of the All-Merciful."  The concourse 
of Christian priests He bids "leave the bells," and come forth from 
their churches; exhorts them to "proclaim aloud the Most Great Name 
among the nations"; assures them that whoever will summon men in 
His Name will "show forth that which is beyond the power of all that 
are on earth"; warns them that the "Day of Reckoning hath appeared"; 
and counsels them to turn with their hearts to their "Lord, 
the Forgiving, the Generous."  In numerous passages addressed to the 
"concourse of monks" He bids them not to seclude themselves in 
churches and cloisters, but to occupy themselves with that which will 
profit their souls and the souls of men; enjoins them to enter into 
wedlock; and affirms that if they choose to follow Him He will make 
them heirs of His Kingdom, and that if they transgress against Him, 
He will, in His long-suffering, endure it patiently.  
     And finally, in several passages addressed to the entire body of 
the followers of Jesus Christ He identifies Himself with the "Father" 
spoken of by Isaiah, with the "Comforter" Whose Covenant He Who 
is the Spirit (Jesus) had Himself established, and with the "Spirit of 
Truth" Who will guide them "into all truth"; proclaims His Day to be 
the Day of God; announces the conjunction of the river Jordan with 
the "Most Great Ocean"; asserts their heedlessness as well as His own 
claim to have opened unto them "the gates of the kingdom"; affirms 
that the promised "Temple" has been built "with the hands of the 
will" of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bounteous; bids them "rend the 
veils asunder," and enter in His name His Kingdom; recalls the saying 
of Jesus to Peter; and assures them that, if they choose to follow Him, 
He will make them to become "quickeners of mankind."  
     To the entire body of Muslim ecclesiastics &amp;Baha'u'llah specifically 
devoted innumerable passages in His Books and Tablets, wherein He, 
 
+P211 
in vehement language, denounces their cruelty; condemns their pride 
and arrogance; calls upon them to lay aside the things they possess, 
to hold their peace, and give ear to the words He has spoken; and 
asserts that, by reason of their deeds, "the exalted station of the people 
hath been abased, the standard of &amp;Islam hath been reversed, and its 
mighty throne hath fallen."  To the "concourse of Persian divines" 
He more particularly addressed His condemnatory words in which 
He stigmatizes their deeds, and prophesies that their "glory will be 
turned into the most wretched abasement," and that they shall behold 
the punishment which will be inflicted upon them, "as decreed by 
God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise."  
     To the Jewish people, He, moreover, announced that the Most 
Great Law has come, that "the Ancient Beauty ruleth upon the throne 
of David," Who cries aloud and invokes His Name, that "from Zion 
hath appeared that which was hidden," and that "from Jerusalem is 
heard the Voice of God, the One, the Incomparable, the Omniscient."  
     To the "high priests" of the Zoroastrian Faith He, furthermore, 
proclaimed that "the Incomparable Friend" is manifest, that He "speaketh 
that wherein lieth salvation," that "the Hand of Omnipotence is 
stretched forth from behind the clouds," that the tokens of His 
majesty and greatness are unveiled; and declared that "no man's acts 
shall be acceptable in this day unless he forsaketh mankind and all 
that men possess, and setteth his face towards the Omnipotent One."  
     Some of the weightiest passages of His Epistle to Queen Victoria 
are addressed to the members of the British Legislature, the Mother of 
Parliaments, as well as to the elected representatives of the peoples in 
other lands.  In these He asserts that His purpose is to quicken the 
world and unite its peoples; refers to the treatment meted out to Him 
by His enemies; exhorts the legislators to "take counsel together," and 
to concern themselves only "with that which profiteth mankind"; and 
affirms that the "sovereign remedy" for the "healing of all the world" 
is the "union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common 
Faith," which can "in no wise be achieved except through the power 
of a skilled and all-powerful and inspired Physician."  He, moreover, 
in His Most Holy Book, has enjoined the selection of a single language 
and the adoption of a common script for all on earth to use, an injunction 
which, when carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that 
Book, be one of the signs of the "coming of age of the human race."  
     No less significant are the words addressed separately by Him to 
the "people of the &amp;Bayan," to the wise men of the world, to its poets, 
to its men of letters, to its mystics and even to its tradesmen, in which 
 
+P212 
He exhorts them to be attentive to His voice, to recognize His Day, 
and to follow His bidding.  
     Such in sum are the salient features of the concluding utterances 
of that historic Proclamation, the opening notes of which were sounded 
during the latter part of &amp;Baha'u'llah's banishment to Adrianople, and 
which closed during the early years of His incarceration in the prison-fortress 
of &amp;Akka.  Kings and emperors, severally and collectively; the 
chief magistrates of the Republics of the American continent; ministers 
and ambassadors; the Sovereign Pontiff himself; the Vicar of the 
Prophet of &amp;Islam; the royal Trustee of the Kingdom of the Hidden 
&amp;Imam; the monarchs of Christendom, its patriarchs, archbishops, 
bishops, priests and monks; the recognized leaders of both the &amp;Sunni 
and &amp;Shi'ah sacerdotal orders; the high priests of the Zoroastrian religion; 
the philosophers, the ecclesiastical leaders, the wise men and the inhabitants 
of Constantinople--that proud seat of both the Sultanate 
and the Caliphate; the entire company of the professed adherents of 
the Zoroastrian, the Jewish, the Christian and Muslim Faiths; the 
people of the &amp;Bayan; the wise men of the world, its men of letters, 
its poets, its mystics, its tradesmen, the elected representatives of its 
peoples; His own countrymen--all have, at one time or another, in 
books, Epistles, and Tablets, been brought directly within the purview 
of the exhortations, the warnings, the appeals, the declarations and 
the prophecies which constitute the theme of His momentous summons 
to the leaders of mankind--a summons which stands unparalleled 
in the annals of any previous religion, and to which the messages 
directed by the Prophet of &amp;Islam to some of the rulers among His 
contemporaries alone offer a faint resemblance.  
     "Never since the beginning of the world," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself 
affirms, "hath the Message been so openly proclaimed."  "Each one of 
them," He, specifically referring to the Tablets addressed by Him to 
the sovereigns of the earth--Tablets acclaimed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as a 
"miracle"--has written, "hath been designated by a special name.  The 
first hath been named `The Rumbling,' the second `The Blow,' the 
third `The Inevitable,' the fourth `The Plain,' the fifth `The Catastrophe,' 
and the others `The Stunning Trumpet-Blast,' `The Near 
Event,' `The Great Terror,' `The Trumpet,' `The Bugle,' and the like, 
so that all the peoples of the earth may know, of a certainty, and may 
witness, with outward and inner eyes, that He Who is the Lord of 
Names hath prevailed, and will continue to prevail, under all conditions, 
over all men."  The most important of these Tablets, together 
with the celebrated &amp;Suriy-i-Haykal (the &amp;Surih of the Temple), He, 
 
+P213 
moreover, ordered to be written in the shape of a pentacle, symbolizing 
the temple of man, and which He identified, when addressing the 
followers of the Gospel in one of His Tablets, with the "Temple" mentioned 
by the Prophet Zechariah, and designated as "the resplendent 
dawning-place of the All-Merciful," and which "the hands of the 
power of Him Who is the Causer of Causes" had built.  
     Unique and stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to 
be but a prelude to a still mightier revelation of the creative power 
of its Author, and to what may well rank as the most signal act of 
His ministry--the promulgation of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas.  Alluded to in 
the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan; the principal repository of that Law which the 
Prophet Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse 
had described as the "new heaven" and the "new earth," as 
"the Tabernacle of God," as the "Holy City," as the "Bride," the 
"New Jerusalem coming down from God," this "Most Holy Book," 
whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than a thousand 
years, and whose system will embrace the entire planet, may well be 
regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind of &amp;Baha'u'llah, as the 
Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter of His New 
World Order.  
     Revealed soon after &amp;Baha'u'llah had been transferred to the house 
of &amp;Udi &amp;Khammar (circa 1873), at a time when He was still encompassed 
by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through the acts 
committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His Faith, 
this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His Revelation, 
stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative 
institutions it ordains and the function with which it 
invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and incomparable 
among the world's sacred Scriptures.  For, unlike the Old 
Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the 
actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are non-existent; 
unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus 
Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration 
of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the &amp;Qur'an which, though 
explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of 
God, is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of the 
Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws 
and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must 
rest, but ordains, in addition to the function of interpretation which 
it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions through 
 
+P214 
which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be safeguarded.  
     In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author--at 
once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of mankind
--announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the "Most 
Great Law"; pronounces them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself 
the "King of Kings"; disclaims any intention of laying hands on their 
kingdoms; reserves for Himself the right to "seize and possess the 
hearts of men"; warns the world's ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh 
the "Book of God" with such standards as are current amongst them; 
and affirms that the Book itself is the "Unerring Balance" established 
amongst men.  In it He formally ordains the institution of the "House 
of Justice," defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and designates its 
members as the "Men of Justice," the "Deputies of God," the "Trustees 
of the All-Merciful," alludes to the future Center of His Covenant, 
and invests Him with the right of interpreting His holy Writ; 
anticipates by implication the institution of Guardianship; bears witness 
to the revolutionizing effect of His World Order; enunciates the 
doctrine of the "Most Great Infallibility" of the Manifestation of 
God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent and exclusive right of 
the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of the appearance of another 
Manifestation ere the lapse of at least one thousand years.  
     In this Book He, moreover, prescribes the obligatory prayers; 
designates the time and period of fasting; prohibits congregational 
prayer except for the dead; fixes the Qiblih; institutes the &amp;Huququ'llah 
(Right of God); formulates the law of inheritance; ordains the 
institution of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar; establishes the Nineteen Day 
Feasts, the &amp;Baha'i festivals and the Intercalary Days; abolishes the 
institution of priesthood; prohibits slavery, asceticism, mendicancy, 
monasticism, penance, the use of pulpits and the kissing of hands; 
prescribes monogamy; condemns cruelty to animals, idleness and 
sloth, backbiting and calumny; censures divorce; interdicts gambling, 
the use of opium, wine and other intoxicating drinks; specifies the 
punishments for murder, arson, adultery and theft; stresses the importance 
of marriage and lays down its essential conditions; imposes 
the obligation of engaging in some trade or profession, exalting such 
occupation to the rank of worship; emphasizes the necessity of providing 
the means for the education of children; and lays upon every 
person the duty of writing a testament and of strict obedience to 
one's government.  
     Apart from these provisions &amp;Baha'u'llah exhorts His followers to 
consort, with amity and concord and without discrimination, with 
 
+P215 
the adherents of all religions; warns them to guard against fanaticism, 
sedition, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates upon them immaculate 
cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity, trustworthiness; 
hospitality, fidelity, courtesy, forbearance, justice and fairness; counsels 
them to be "even as the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one 
body"; calls upon them to arise and serve His Cause; and assures 
them of His undoubted aid.  He, furthermore, dwells upon the instability 
of human affairs; declares that true liberty consists in man's 
submission to His commandments; cautions them not to be indulgent 
in carrying out His statutes; prescribes the twin inseparable duties of 
recognizing the "Dayspring of God's Revelation" and of observing 
all the ordinances revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms, is 
acceptable without the other.  
     The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics 
of the American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of 
God and to champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the 
members of parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of 
a universal script and language; His warnings to William I, the conqueror 
of Napoleon III; the reproof He administers to Francis Joseph, 
the Emperor of Austria; His reference to "the lamentations of Berlin" 
in His apostrophe to "the banks of the Rhine"; His condemnation of 
"the throne of tyranny" established in Constantinople, and His prediction 
of the extinction of its "outward splendor" and of the tribulations 
destined to overtake its inhabitants; the words of cheer and 
comfort He addresses to His native city, assuring her that God had 
chosen her to be "the source of the joy of all mankind"; His prophecy 
that "the voice of the heroes of &amp;Khurasan" will be raised in glorification 
of their Lord; His assertion that men "endued with mighty 
valor" will be raised up in &amp;Kirman who will make mention of Him; 
and finally, His magnanimous assurance to a perfidious brother who 
had afflicted Him with such anguish, that an "ever-forgiving, all-bounteous" 
God would forgive him his iniquities were he only to 
repent--all these further enrich the contents of a Book designated by 
its Author as "the source of true felicity," as the "Unerring Balance," 
as the "Straight Path" and as the "quickener of mankind."  
     The laws and ordinances that constitute the major theme of this 
Book, &amp;Baha'u'llah, moreover, has specifically characterized as "the 
breath of life unto all created things," as "the mightiest stronghold," 
as the "fruits" of His "Tree," as "the highest means for the maintenance 
of order in the world and the security of its peoples," as "the lamps of 
His wisdom and loving-providence," as "the sweet smelling savor of 
 
+P216 
His garment," as the "keys" of His "mercy" to His creatures.  "This 
Book," He Himself testifies, "is a heaven which We have adorned 
with the stars of Our commandments and prohibitions."  "Blessed 
the man," He, moreover, has stated, "who will read it, and ponder the 
verses sent down in it by God, the Lord of Power, the Almighty.  
Say, O men!  Take hold of it with the hand of resignation...  By 
My life!  It hath been sent down in a manner that amazeth the minds 
of men.  Verily, it is My weightiest testimony unto all people, and 
the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who 
are on earth."  And again:  "Blessed the palate that savoreth its sweetness, 
and the perceiving eye that recognizeth that which is treasured 
therein, and the understanding heart that comprehendeth its allusions 
and mysteries.  By God!  Such is the majesty of what hath been revealed 
therein, and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions 
that the loins of utterance shake when attempting their description."  
And finally:  "In such a manner hath the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas been revealed 
that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed Dispensations.  
Blessed those who peruse it!  Blessed those who apprehend it!  
Blessed those who meditate upon it!  Blessed those who ponder its 
meaning!  So vast is its range that it hath encompassed all men ere 
their recognition of it.  Erelong will its sovereign power, its pervasive 
influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth."  
     The formulation by &amp;Baha'u'llah, in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, of the 
fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission 
drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and principles 
which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the reaffirmation of truths 
He had previously proclaimed, by the elaboration and elucidation of 
some of the laws He had already laid down, by the revelation of 
further prophecies and warnings, and by the establishment of subsidiary 
ordinances designed to supplement the provisions of His Most 
Holy Book.  These were recorded in unnumbered Tablets, which He 
continued to reveal until the last days of His earthly life, among 
which the "&amp;Ishraqat" (Splendors), the "&amp;Bisharat" (Glad Tidings), 
the "&amp;Tarazat" (Ornaments), the "&amp;Tajalliyat" (Effulgences), the 
"&amp;Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih" (Words of Paradise), the "&amp;Lawh-i-Aqdas" 
(Most Holy Tablet), the "&amp;Lawh-i-Dunya" (Tablet of the World), 
the "&amp;Lawh-i-Maqsud" (Tablet of &amp;Maqsud), are the most noteworthy.  
These Tablets--mighty and final effusions of His indefatigable pen--
must rank among the choicest fruits which His mind has yielded, 
and mark the consummation of His forty-year-long ministry.  
     Of the principles enshrined in these Tablets the most vital of 
 
+P217 
them all is the principle of the oneness and wholeness of the human 
race, which may well be regarded as the hall-mark of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Revelation and the pivot of His teachings.  Of such cardinal importance 
is this principle of unity that it is expressly referred to in 
the Book of His Covenant, and He unreservedly proclaims it as the 
central purpose of His Faith.  "We, verily," He declares, "have come 
to unite and weld together all that dwell on earth."  "So potent is the 
light of unity," He further states, "that it can illuminate the whole 
earth."  "At one time," He has written with reference to this central 
theme of His Revelation, "We spoke in the language of the lawgiver; 
at another in that of the truth seeker and the mystic, and yet Our 
supreme purpose and highest wish hath always been to disclose the 
glory and sublimity of this station."  Unity, He states, is the goal 
that "excelleth every goal" and an aspiration which is "the monarch 
of all aspirations."  "The world," He proclaims, "is but one country, 
and mankind its citizens."  He further affirms that the unification of 
mankind, the last stage in the evolution of humanity towards maturity 
is inevitable, that "soon will the present day order be rolled up, and a 
new one spread out in its stead," that "the whole earth is now in a 
state of pregnancy," that "the day is approaching when it will have 
yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the 
loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly blessings."  
He deplores the defectiveness of the prevailing order, exposes 
the inadequacy of patriotism as a directing and controlling force in 
human society, and regards the "love of mankind" and service to its 
interests as the worthiest and most laudable objects of human endeavor.  
He, moreover, laments that "the vitality of men's belief in 
God is dying out in every land," that the "face of the world" is 
turned towards "waywardness and unbelief"; proclaims religion to be 
"a radiant light and an impregnable stronghold for the protection 
and welfare of the peoples of the world" and "the chief instrument 
for the establishment of order in the world"; affirms its fundamental 
purpose to be the promotion of union and concord amongst men; 
warns lest it be made "a source of dissension, of discord and hatred"; 
commands that its principles be taught to children in the schools of 
the world, in a manner that would not be productive of either 
prejudice or fanaticism; attributes "the waywardness of the ungodly" 
to the "decline of religion"; and predicts "convulsions" of such severity 
as to "cause the limbs of mankind to quake."  
     The principle of collective security He unreservedly urges; recommends 
the reduction in national armaments; and proclaims as necessary 
 
+P218 
and inevitable the convening of a world gathering at which the 
kings and rulers of the world will deliberate for the establishment of 
peace among the nations.  
     Justice He extols as "the light of men" and their "guardian," as 
"the revealer of the secrets of the world of being, and the standard-bearer 
of love and bounty"; declares its radiance to be incomparable; 
affirms that upon it must depend "the organization of the world and 
the tranquillity of mankind."  He characterizes its "two pillars"--
"reward and punishment"--as "the sources of life" to the human race; 
warns the peoples of the world to bestir themselves in anticipation of 
its advent; and prophesies that, after an interval of great turmoil and 
grievous injustice, its day-star will shine in its full splendor and glory.  
     He, furthermore, inculcates the principle of "moderation in all 
things"; declares that whatsoever, be it "Liberty, civilization and the 
like," "passeth beyond the limits of moderation" must "exercise a 
pernicious influence upon men"; observes that western civilization has 
gravely perturbed and alarmed the peoples of the world; and predicts 
that the day is approaching when the "flame" of a civilization "carried 
to excess" "will devour the cities."  
     Consultation He establishes as one of the fundamental principles 
of His Faith; describes it as "the lamp of guidance," as "the bestower 
of understanding," and as one of the two "luminaries" of the "heaven 
of Divine wisdom."  Knowledge, He states, is "as wings to man's life 
and a ladder for his ascent"; its acquisition He regards as "incumbent 
upon every one"; considers "arts, crafts and sciences" to be conducive 
to the exaltation of the world of being; commends the wealth acquired 
through crafts and professions; acknowledges the indebtedness of the 
peoples of the world to scientists and craftsmen; and discourages the 
study of such sciences as are unprofitable to men, and "begin with 
words and end with words."  
     The injunction to "consort with all men in a spirit of friendliness 
and fellowship" He further emphasizes, and recognizes such association 
to be conducive to "union and concord," which, He affirms, are 
the establishers of order in the world and the quickeners of nations.  
The necessity of adopting a universal tongue and script He repeatedly 
stresses; deplores the waste of time involved in the study of divers 
languages; affirms that with the adoption of such a language and 
script the whole earth will be considered as "one city and one land"; 
and claims to be possessed of the knowledge of both, and ready to 
impart it to any one who might seek it from Him.  
     To the trustees of the House of Justice He assigns the duty of 
 
+P219 
legislating on matters not expressly provided in His writings, and 
promises that God will "inspire them with whatsoever He willeth."  
The establishment of a constitutional form of government, in which 
the ideals of republicanism and the majesty of kingship, characterized 
by Him as "one of the signs of God," are combined, He recommends 
as a meritorious achievement; urges that special regard be paid to the 
interests of agriculture; and makes specific reference to "the swiftly 
appearing newspapers," describes them as "the mirror of the world" 
and as "an amazing and potent phenomenon," and prescribes to all 
who are responsible for their production the duty to be sanctified from 
malice, passion and prejudice, to be just and fair-minded, to be painstaking 
in their inquiries, and ascertain all the facts in every situation.  
     The doctrine of the Most Great Infallibility He further elaborates; 
the obligation laid on His followers to "behave towards the government 
of the country in which they reside with loyalty, honesty and 
truthfulness," He reaffirms; the ban imposed upon the waging of holy 
war and the destruction of books He reemphasizes; and He singles 
out for special praise men of learning and wisdom, whom He extols 
as "eyes" to the body of mankind, and as the "greatest gifts" conferred 
upon the world.  
     Nor should a review of the outstanding features of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
writings during the latter part of His banishment to &amp;Akka fail to 
include a reference to the &amp;Lawh-i-Hikmat (Tablet of Wisdom), in 
which He sets forth the fundamentals of true philosophy, or to the 
Tablet of Visitation revealed in honor of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, whose 
praises He celebrates in glowing language; or to the "Questions and 
Answers" which elucidates the laws and ordinances of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas; 
or to the "&amp;Lawh-i-Burhan" (Tablet of the Proof) in which 
the acts perpetrated by &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Baqir, surnamed "&amp;Dhi'b" 
(Wolf), and &amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad-Husayn, the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih of &amp;Isfahan, 
surnamed "&amp;Raqsha" (She-Serpent), are severely condemned; or to the 
&amp;Lawh-i-Karmil (Tablet of Carmel) in which the Author significantly 
makes mention of "the City of God that hath descended from heaven," 
and prophesies that "erelong will God sail His Ark" upon that mountain, 
and "will manifest the people of &amp;Baha."  Finally, mention must 
be made of His Epistle to &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Taqi, surnamed "&amp;Ibn-i-Dhi'b" 
(Son of the Wolf), the last outstanding Tablet revealed by 
the pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah, in which He calls upon that rapacious priest 
to repent of his acts, quotes some of the most characteristic and 
celebrated passages of His own writings, and adduces proofs establishing 
the validity of His Cause.  
 
+P220 
     With this book, revealed about one year prior to His ascension, 
the prodigious achievement as author of a hundred volumes, repositories 
of the priceless pearls of His Revelation, may be said to have 
practically terminated--volumes replete with unnumbered exhortations, 
revolutionizing principles, world-shaping laws and ordinances, 
dire warnings and portentous prophecies, with soul-uplifting prayers 
and meditations, illuminating commentaries and interpretations, impassioned 
discourses and homilies, all interspersed with either addresses 
or references to kings, to emperors and to ministers, of both the East 
and the West, to ecclesiastics of divers denominations, and to leaders 
in the intellectual, political, literary, mystical, commercial and humanitarian 
spheres of human activity.  
     "We, verily," wrote &amp;Baha'u'llah, surveying, in the evening of His 
life, from His Most Great Prison, the entire range of this vast and 
weighty Revelation, "have not fallen short of Our duty to exhort 
men, and to deliver that whereunto I was bidden by God, the Almighty, 
the All-Praised."  "Is there any excuse," He further has 
stated, "left for any one in this Revelation?  No, by God, the Lord 
of the Mighty Throne!  My signs have encompassed the earth, and 
my power enveloped all mankind."  
 
+P221 
                         CHAPTER XIII 
                  Ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
 
     Well nigh half a century had passed since the inception of the 
Faith.  Cradled in adversity, deprived in its infancy of its Herald 
and Leader, it had been raised from the dust, in which a hostile 
despot had thrown it, by its second and greatest Luminary Who, 
despite successive banishments, had, in less than half a century, succeeded 
in rehabilitating its fortunes, in proclaiming its Message, in 
enacting its laws and ordinances, in formulating its principles and 
in ordaining its institutions, and it had just begun to enjoy the 
sunshine of a prosperity never previously experienced, when suddenly 
it was robbed of its Author by the Hand of Destiny, its followers 
were plunged into sorrow and consternation, its repudiators 
found their declining hopes revive, and its adversaries, political as 
well as ecclesiastical, began to take heart again.  
     Already nine months before His ascension &amp;Baha'u'llah, as attested 
by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, had voiced His desire to depart from this world.  
From that time onward it became increasingly evident, from the 
tone of His remarks to those who attained His presence, that the 
close of His earthly life was approaching, though He refrained from 
mentioning it openly to any one.  On the night preceding the eleventh 
of &amp;Shavval 1309 A.H. (May 8, 1892) He contracted a slight fever 
which, though it mounted the following day, soon after subsided.  
He continued to grant interviews to certain of the friends and pilgrims, 
but it soon became evident that He was not well.  His fever 
returned in a more acute form than before, His general condition 
grew steadily worse, complications ensued which at last culminated 
in His ascension, at the hour of dawn, on the 2nd of &amp;Dhi'l-Qa'dih 
1309 A.H. (May 29, 1892), eight hours after sunset, in the 75th 
year of His age.  His spirit, at long last released from the toils of a 
life crowded with tribulations, had winged its flight to His "other 
dominions," dominions "whereon the eyes of the people of names have 
never fallen," and to which the "Luminous Maid," "clad in white," had 
bidden Him hasten, as described by Himself in the &amp;Lawh-i-Ru'ya 
(Tablet of the Vision), revealed nineteen years previously, on the 
anniversary of the birth of His Forerunner.  
 
+P222 
     Six days before He passed away He summoned to His presence, 
as He lay in bed leaning against one of His sons, the entire company 
of believers, including several pilgrims, who had assembled in the 
Mansion, for what proved to be their last audience with Him.  "I am 
well pleased with you all," He gently and affectionately addressed 
the weeping crowd that gathered about Him.  "Ye have rendered 
many services, and been very assiduous in your labors.  Ye have come 
here every morning and every evening.  May God assist you to remain 
united.  May He aid you to exalt the Cause of the Lord of being."  
To the women, including members of His own family, gathered at 
His bedside, He addressed similar words of encouragement, definitely 
assuring them that in a document entrusted by Him to the Most 
Great Branch He had commended them all to His care.  
     The news of His ascension was instantly communicated to &amp;Sultan 
&amp;Abdu'l-Hamid in a telegram which began with the words "the Sun 
of &amp;Baha has set" and in which the monarch was advised of the intention 
of interring the sacred remains within the precincts of the 
Mansion, an arrangement to which he readily assented.  &amp;Baha'u'llah 
was accordingly laid to rest in the northernmost room of the house 
which served as a dwelling-place for His son-in-law, the most 
northerly of the three houses lying to the west of, and adjacent to, 
the Mansion.  His interment took place shortly after sunset, on the 
very day of His ascension.  
     The inconsolable &amp;Nabil, who had had the privilege of a private 
audience with &amp;Baha'u'llah during the days of His illness; whom 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha had chosen to select those passages which constitute the 
text of the Tablet of Visitation now recited in the Most Holy Tomb; 
and who, in his uncontrollable grief, drowned himself in the sea 
shortly after the passing of his Beloved, thus describes the agony of 
those days:  "Methinks, the spiritual commotion set up in the world 
of dust had caused all the worlds of God to tremble....  My inner 
and outer tongue are powerless to portray the condition we were 
in....  In the midst of the prevailing confusion a multitude of the 
inhabitants of &amp;Akka and of the neighboring villages, that had 
thronged the fields surrounding the Mansion, could be seen weeping, 
beating upon their heads, and crying aloud their grief."  
     For a full week a vast number of mourners, rich and poor alike, 
tarried to grieve with the bereaved family, partaking day and night 
of the food that was lavishly dispensed by its members.  Notables, 
among whom were numbered &amp;Shi'ahs, &amp;Sunnis, Christians, Jews and 
Druzes, as well as poets, &amp;ulamas and government officials, all joined 
 
+P223 
in lamenting the loss, and in magnifying the virtues and greatness of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, many of them paying to Him their written tributes, in 
verse and in prose, in both Arabic and Turkish.  From cities as far 
afield as Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut and Cairo similar tributes were 
received.  These glowing testimonials were, without exception, submitted 
to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Who now represented the Cause of the 
departed Leader, and Whose praises were often mingled in these 
eulogies with the homage paid to His Father.  
     And yet these effusive manifestations of sorrow and expressions 
of praise and of admiration, which the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
spontaneously evoked among the unbelievers in the Holy Land and 
the adjoining countries, were but a drop when compared with the 
ocean of grief and the innumerable evidences of unbounded devotion 
which, at the hour of the setting of the Sun of Truth, poured forth 
from the hearts of the countless thousands who had espoused His 
Cause, and were determined to carry aloft its banner in Persia, India, 
Russia, &amp;Iraq, Turkey, Palestine, Egypt and Syria.  
     With the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah draws to a close a period which, 
in many ways, is unparalleled in the world's religious history.  The 
first century of the &amp;Baha'i Era had by now run half its course.  An 
epoch, unsurpassed in its sublimity, its fecundity and duration by 
any previous Dispensation, and characterized, except for a short 
interval of three years, by half a century of continuous and progressive 
Revelation, had terminated.  The Message proclaimed by the &amp;Bab 
had yielded its golden fruit.  The most momentous, though not the 
most spectacular phase of the Heroic Age had ended.  The Sun of 
Truth, the world's greatest Luminary, had risen in the &amp;Siyah-Chal 
of &amp;Tihran, had broken through the clouds which enveloped it in 
&amp;Baghdad, had suffered a momentary eclipse whilst mounting to its 
zenith in Adrianople and had set finally in &amp;Akka, never to reappear 
ere the lapse of a full millenium.  God's newborn Faith, the cynosure 
of all past Dispensations, had been fully and unreservedly proclaimed.  
The prophecies announcing its advent had been remarkably fulfilled.  
Its fundamental laws and cardinal principles, the warp and woof of 
the fabric of its future World Order, had been clearly enunciated.  
Its organic relation to, and its attitude towards, the religious systems 
which preceded it had been unmistakably defined.  The primary institutions, 
within which an embryonic World Order was destined to 
mature, had been unassailably established.  The Covenant designed 
to safeguard the unity and integrity of its world-embracing system 
had been irrevocably bequeathed to posterity.  The promise of the 
 
+P224 
unification of the whole human race, of the inauguration of the Most 
Great Peace, of the unfoldment of a world civilization, had been 
incontestably given.  The dire warnings, foreshadowing catastrophes 
destined to befall kings, ecclesiastics, governments and peoples, as a 
prelude to so glorious a consummation, had been repeatedly uttered.  
The significant summons to the Chief Magistrates of the New World, 
forerunner of the Mission with which the North American continent 
was to be later invested, had been issued.  The initial contact with 
a nation, a descendant of whose royal house was to espouse its Cause 
ere the expiry of the first &amp;Baha'i century, had been established.  The 
original impulse which, in the course of successive decades, has conferred, 
and will continue to confer, in the years to come, inestimable 
benefits of both spiritual and institutional significance upon God's 
holy mountain, overlooking the Most Great Prison, had been imparted.  
And finally, the first banners of a spiritual conquest which, 
ere the termination of that century, was to embrace no less than sixty 
countries in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres had been 
triumphantly planted.  
     In the vastness and diversity of its Holy Writ; in the number of 
its martyrs; in the valor of its champions; in the example set by its 
followers; in the condign punishment suffered by its adversaries; in 
the pervasiveness of its influence; in the incomparable heroism of 
its Herald; in the dazzling greatness of its Author; in the mysterious 
operation of its irresistible spirit; the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, now standing 
at the threshold of the sixth decade of its existence, had amply 
demonstrated its capacity to forge ahead, indivisible and incorruptible, 
along the course traced for it by its Founder, and to display, 
before the gaze of successive generations, the signs and tokens of that 
celestial potency with which He Himself had so richly endowed it.  
     To the fate that has overtaken those kings, ministers and ecclesiastics, 
in the East as well as in the West, who have, at various stages 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's ministry, either deliberately persecuted His Cause, 
or have neglected to heed the warnings He had uttered, or have failed 
in their manifest duty to respond to His summons or to accord Him 
and His message the treatment they deserved, particular attention, 
I feel, should at this juncture be directed.  &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, referring 
to those who had actively arisen to destroy or harm His 
Faith, had declared that "God hath not blinked, nor will He ever 
blink His eyes at the tyranny of the oppressor.  More particularly 
in this Revelation hath He visited each and every tyrant with His 
vengeance."  Vast and awful is, indeed, the spectacle which meets our 
 
+P225 
eyes, as we survey the field over which the retributory winds of God 
have, since the inception of the ministry of &amp;Baha'u'llah, furiously 
swept, dethroning monarchs, extinguishing dynasties, uprooting 
ecclesiastical hierarchies, precipitating wars and revolutions, driving 
from office princes and ministers, dispossessing the usurper, casting 
down the tyrant, and chastising the wicked and the rebellious.  
     &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz, who with &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah was the 
author of the calamities heaped upon &amp;Baha'u'llah, and was himself 
responsible for three decrees of banishment against the Prophet; who 
had been stigmatized, in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, as occupying the "throne 
of tyranny," and whose fall had been prophesied in the &amp;Lawh-i-Fu'ad, 
was deposed in consequence of a palace revolution, was condemned 
by a &amp;fatva (sentence) of the &amp;Mufti in his own capital, was four days 
later assassinated (1876), and was succeeded by a nephew who was 
declared to be an imbecile.  The war of 1877-78 emancipated eleven million 
people from the Turkish yoke; Adrianople was occupied by the 
Russian forces; the empire itself was dissolved as a result of the war 
of 1914-18; the Sultanate was abolished; a republic was proclaimed; 
and a rulership that had endured above six centuries was ended.  
     The vain and despotic &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, denounced by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
as the "Prince of Oppressors"; of whom He had written that 
he would soon be made "an object-lesson for the world"; whose reign 
was stained by the execution of the &amp;Bab and the imprisonment of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah; who had persistently instigated his subsequent banishments 
to Constantinople, Adrianople and &amp;Akka; who, in collusion 
with a vicious sacerdotal order, had vowed to strangle the Faith in 
its cradle, was dramatically assassinated, in the shrine of &amp;Shah 
&amp;Abdu'l-'Azim, on the very eve of his jubilee, which, as ushering in a new 
era, was to have been celebrated with the most elaborate magnificence, 
and was to go down in history as the greatest day in the annals of 
the Persian nation.  The fortunes of his house thereafter steadily 
declined, and finally through the scandalous misconduct of the dissipated 
and irresponsible &amp;Ahmad &amp;Shah, led to the eclipse and disappearance 
of the &amp;Qajar dynasty.  
     Napoleon III, the foremost monarch of his day in the West, excessively 
ambitious, inordinately proud, tricky and superficial, who is 
reported to have contemptuously flung down the Tablet sent to him 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah, who was tested by Him and found wanting, and 
whose downfall was explicitly predicted in a subsequent Tablet, was 
ignominiously defeated in the Battle of Sedan (1870), marking the 
greatest military capitulation recorded in modern history; lost his 
 
+P226 
kingdom and spent the remaining years of his life in exile.  His hopes 
were utterly blasted, his only son, the Prince Imperial, was killed in 
the Zulu War, his much vaunted empire collapsed, a civil war ensued 
more ferocious than the Franco-German war itself, and William I, 
the Prussian king, was hailed emperor of a unified Germany in the 
Palace of Versailles.  
     William I, the pride-intoxicated newly-acclaimed conqueror of 
Napoleon III, admonished in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas and bidden to ponder 
the fate that had overtaken "one whose power transcended" his own, 
warned in that same Book, that the "lamentations of Berlin" would 
be raised and that the banks of the Rhine would be "covered with 
gore," sustained two attempts on his life, and was succeeded by a 
son who died of a mortal disease, three months after his accession to 
the throne, bequeathing the throne to the arrogant, the headstrong 
and short-sighted William II.  The pride of the new monarch precipitated 
his downfall.  Revolution, swiftly and suddenly, broke out in 
his capital, communism reared its head in a number of cities; the 
princes of the German states abdicated, and he himself, fleeing ignominiously 
to Holland, was compelled to relinquish his right to the 
throne.  The constitution of Weimar sealed the fate of the empire, 
whose birth had been so loudly proclaimed by his grandfather, and 
the terms of an oppressively severe treaty provoked "the lamentations" 
which, half a century before, had been ominously prophesied.  
     The arbitrary and unyielding Francis Joseph, emperor of Austria 
and king of Hungary, who had been reproved in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
for having neglected his manifest duty to inquire about &amp;Baha'u'llah 
during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was so engulfed by misfortunes 
and tragedies that his reign came to be regarded as one unsurpassed 
by any other reign in the calamities it inflicted upon the nation.  
His brother, Maximilian, was put to death in Mexico; the Crown 
Prince Rudolph perished in ignominious circumstances; the Empress 
was assassinated; Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife were 
murdered in Serajevo; the "ramshackle empire" itself disintegrated, 
was carved up, and a shrunken republic was set up on the ruins of 
a vanished Holy Roman Empire--a republic which, after a brief and 
precarious existence, was blotted out from the political map of 
Europe.  
     Nicolaevitch Alexander II, the all-powerful Czar of Russia, who, 
in a Tablet addressed to him by name had been thrice warned by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, had been bidden to "summon the nations unto God," 
and had been cautioned not to allow his sovereignty to prevent him 
 
+P227 
from recognizing "the Supreme Sovereign," suffered several attempts 
on his life, and at last died at the hand of an assassin.  A harsh policy 
of repression, initiated by himself and followed by his successor, Alexander 
III, paved the way for a revolution which, in the reign of 
Nicholas II, swept away on a bloody tide the empire of the Czars, 
brought in its wake war, disease and famine, and established a militant 
proletariat which massacred the nobility, persecuted the clergy, drove 
away the intellectuals, disendowed the state religion, executed the 
Czar with his consort and his family, and extinguished the dynasty 
of the Romanoffs.  
     Pope Pius IX, the undisputed head of the most powerful Church 
in Christendom, who had been commanded, in an Epistle addressed 
to him by &amp;Baha'u'llah, to leave his "palaces unto such as desire them," 
to "sell all the embellished ornaments" in his possession, to "expend 
them in the path of God," and hasten towards "the Kingdom," 
was compelled to surrender, in distressing circumstances, to the besieging 
forces of King Victor Emmanuel, and to submit himself to be 
depossessed of the Papal States and of Rome itself.  The loss of "the 
Eternal City," over which the Papal flag had flown for one thousand 
years, and the humiliation of the religious orders under his jurisdiction, 
added mental anguish to his physical infirmities and embittered 
the last years of his life.  The formal recognition of the Kingdom of 
Italy subsequently exacted from one of his successors in the Vatican, 
confirmed the virtual extinction of the Pope's temporal sovereignty.  
     But the rapid dissolution of the Ottoman, the Napoleonic, the 
German, the Austrian and the Russian empires, the demise of the 
&amp;Qajar dynasty and the virtual extinction of the temporal sovereignty 
of the Roman Pontiff do not exhaust the story of the catastrophes 
that befell the monarchies of the world through the neglect of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's warnings conveyed in the opening passages of His &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk. 
The conversion of the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies, 
as well as the Chinese empire, into republics; the strange fate that 
has, more recently, been pursuing the sovereigns of Holland, of 
Norway, of Greece, of Yugoslavia and of Albania now living in exile; 
the virtual abdication of the authority exercised by the kings of 
Denmark, of Belgium, of Bulgaria, of Rumania and of Italy; the 
apprehension with which their fellow sovereigns must be viewing the 
convulsions that have seized so many thrones; the shame and acts of 
violence which, in some instances, have darkened the annals of the 
reigns of certain monarchs in both the East and the West, and still 
more recently the sudden downfall of the Founder of the newly 
 
+P228 
established dynasty in Persia--these are yet further instances of the 
infliction of the "Divine Chastisement" foreshadowed by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in that immortal &amp;Surih, and show forth the divine reality of the 
arraignment pronounced by Him against the rulers of the earth in 
His Most Holy Book.  
     No less arresting has been the extinction of the all-pervasive 
influence exerted by the Muslim ecclesiastical leaders, both &amp;Sunni and 
&amp;Shi'ah, in the two countries in which the mightiest institutions of 
&amp;Islam had been reared, and which have been directly associated with 
the tribulations heaped upon the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     The Caliph, the self-styled vicar of the Prophet of &amp;Islam, known 
also as the "Commander of the Faithful," the protector of the holy 
cities of Mecca and Medina, whose spiritual jurisdiction extended over 
more than two hundred million &amp;Muhammadans, was by the abolition 
of the Sultanate in Turkey, divested of his temporal authority, 
hitherto regarded as inseparable from his high office.  The Caliph 
himself, after having occupied for a brief period, an anomalous and 
precarious position, fled to Europe; the Caliphate, the most august and 
powerful institution of &amp;Islam, was, without consultation with any 
community in the &amp;Sunni world, summarily abolished; the unity of 
the most powerful branch of the Islamic Faith was thereby shattered; 
a formal, a complete and permanent separation of the Turkish state 
from the &amp;Sunni faith was proclaimed; the &amp;Shari'ah canonical Law was 
annulled; ecclesiastical institutions were disendowed; a civil code was 
promulgated; religious orders were suppressed; the &amp;Sunni hierarchy 
was dissolved; the Arabic tongue, the language of the Prophet of 
&amp;Islam, fell into disuse, and its script was superseded by the Latin 
alphabet; the &amp;Qur'an itself was translated into Turkish; Constantinople, 
the "Dome of &amp;Islam," sank to the level of a provincial city, 
and its peerless jewel, the Mosque of St. Sophia, was converted into a 
museum--a series of degradations recalling the fate which, in the 
first century of the Christian Era, befell the Jewish people, the city of 
Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, the Holy of Holies, and an 
ecclesiastical hierarchy, whose members were the avowed persecutors 
of the religion of Jesus Christ.  
     A similar convulsion shook the foundations of the entire sacerdotal 
order in Persia, though its formal divorce from the Persian 
state is as yet unproclaimed.  A "church-state," that had been firmly 
rooted in the life of the nation and had extended its ramifications to 
every sphere of life in that country, was virtually disrupted.  A 
sacerdotal order, the rock wall of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam in that land, was 
 
+P229 
paralyzed and discredited; its mujtahids, the favorite ministers of the 
hidden &amp;Imam, were reduced to an insignificant number; all its beturbaned 
officers, except for a handful, were ruthlessly forced to 
exchange their traditional head-dress and robes for the European 
clothes they themselves anathematized; the pomp and pageantry that 
marked their ceremonials vanished; their &amp;fatvas (sentences) were 
nullified; their endowments were handed over to a civil administration; 
their mosques and seminaries were deserted; the right of sanctuary 
accorded to their shrines ceased to be recognized; their religious 
plays were banned; their takyihs were closed and even their pilgrimages 
to Najaf and &amp;Karbila were discouraged and curtailed.  The 
disuse of the veil; the recognition of the equality of sexes; the establishment 
of civil tribunals; the abolition of concubinage; the disparagement 
of the use of the Arabic tongue, the language of &amp;Islam 
and of the &amp;Qur'an, and the efforts exerted to divorce it from Persian
--all these further proclaim the degradation, and foreshadow the 
final extinction, of that infamous crew, whose leaders had dared style 
themselves "servants of the Lord of Saintship" (&amp;Imam &amp;Ali), who 
had so often received the homage of the pious kings of the &amp;Safavi 
dynasty, and whose anathemas, ever since the birth of the Faith of the 
&amp;Bab, had been chiefly responsible for the torrents of blood which had 
been shed, and whose acts have blackened the annals of both their 
religion and nation.  
     A crisis, not indeed as severe as that which shook the Islamic 
sacerdotal orders--the inveterate adversaries of the Faith--has, moreover, 
afflicted the ecclesiastical institutions of Christendom, whose 
influence, ever since &amp;Baha'u'llah's summons was issued and His warning 
was sounded, has visibly deteriorated, whose prestige has been 
gravely damaged, whose authority has steadily declined, and whose 
power, rights and prerogatives have been increasingly circumscribed.  
The virtual extinction of the temporal sovereignty of the Roman 
Pontiff, to which reference has already been made; the wave of anti-clericalism 
that brought in its wake the separation of the Catholic 
Church from the French Republic; the organized assault launched 
by a triumphant Communist state upon the Greek Orthodox Church 
in Russia, and the consequent disestablishment, disendowment and 
persecution of the state religion; the dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian 
monarchy which owed its allegiance to the Church of 
Rome and powerfully supported its institutions; the ordeal to which 
that same Church has been subjected in Spain and in Mexico; the 
wave of secularization which, at present, is engulfing the Catholic, the 
 
+P230 
Anglican and the Presbyterian Missions in non-Christian lands; the 
forces of an aggressive paganism which are assailing the ancient 
citadels of the Catholic, the Greek Orthodox and the Lutheran 
Churches in Western, in Central and Eastern Europe, in the Balkans 
and in the Baltic and Scandinavian states--these stand out as the 
most conspicuous manifestations of the decline in the fortunes of the 
ecclesiastical leaders of Christendom, leaders who, heedless of the 
voice of &amp;Baha'u'llah, have interposed themselves between the 
Christ returned in the glory of the Father and their respective 
congregations.  
     Nor can we fail to note the progressive deterioration in the 
authority, wielded by the ecclesiastical leaders of the Jewish and 
Zoroastrian Faiths, ever since the voice of &amp;Baha'u'llah was raised, 
announcing, in no uncertain terms, that the "Most Great Law is 
come," that the Ancient Beauty "ruleth upon the throne of David," 
and that "whatsoever hath been announced in the Books (Zoroastrian 
Holy Writ) hath been revealed and made clear."  The evidences of 
increasing revolt against clerical authority; the disrespect and indifference 
shown to time-honored observances, rituals and ceremonials; 
the repeated inroads made by the forces of an aggressive and often 
hostile nationalism into the spheres of clerical jurisdiction; and the 
general apathy with which, particularly in the case of the professed 
adherents of the Zoroastrian Faith, these encroachments are regarded
--all provide, beyond the shadow of a doubt, further justification of 
the warnings and predictions uttered by &amp;Baha'u'llah in His historic 
addresses to the world's ecclesiastical leaders.  
     Such in sum are the awful evidences of God's retributive justice 
that have afflicted kings as well as ecclesiastics, in both the East and 
the West, as a direct consequence of either their active opposition to 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, or of their lamentable failure to respond to 
His call, to inquire into His Message, to avert the sufferings He 
endured, or to heed the marvelous signs and prodigies which, during a 
hundred years, have accompanied the birth and rise of His Revelation.  
     "From two ranks amongst men," is His terse and prophetic utterance, 
"power hath been seized:  kings and ecclesiastics."  "If ye pay no 
heed," He thus warned the kings of the earth, "unto the counsels 
which ... We have revealed in this Tablet, Divine chastisement will 
assail you from every direction...  On that day ye shall ... recognize 
your own impotence."  And again:  "Though aware of most of 
Our afflictions, ye, nevertheless, have failed to stay the hand of the 
aggressor."  And, furthermore, this arraignment:  "...We ... will 
 
+P231 
be patient, as We have been patient in that which hath befallen Us at 
your hands, O concourse of kings!"  
     Condemning specifically the world's ecclesiastical leaders, He has 
written:  "The source and origin of tyranny have been the divines...  
God, verily, is clear of them, and We, too, are clear of them."  
"When We observed carefully," He openly affirms, "We discovered 
that Our enemies are, for the most part, the divines."  "O concourse 
of divines!" He thus addresses them, "Ye shall not henceforth behold 
yourselves possessed of any power, inasmuch as We have seized it 
from you..."  "Had ye believed in God when He revealed Himself," 
He explains, "the people would not have turned aside from Him, 
nor would the things ye witness today have befallen Us."  "They," 
referring more specifically to Muslim ecclesiastics, He asserts, "rose up 
against Us with such cruelty as hath sapped the strength of &amp;Islam..."  
"The divines of Persia," He affirms, "committed that which no people 
amongst the peoples of the world hath committed."  And again:  
"...The divines of Persia ... have perpetrated what the Jews have 
not perpetrated during the Revelation of Him Who is the Spirit 
(Jesus)."  And finally, these portentous prophecies:  "Because of you 
the people were abased, and the banner of &amp;Islam was hauled down, 
and its mighty throne subverted."  "Erelong will all that ye possess 
perish, and your glory be turned into the most wretched abasement, 
and ye shall behold the punishment for what ye have wrought..."  
"Erelong," the &amp;Bab Himself, even more openly prophesies, "We will, 
in very truth, torment such as waged war against &amp;Husayn (&amp;Imam 
&amp;Husayn) ... with the most afflictive torment..."  "Erelong will 
God wreak His vengeance upon them, at the time of Our return, and 
He hath, in very truth, prepared for them, in the world to come, a 
severe torment."  
     Nor should, in a review of this nature, reference be omitted to 
those princes, ministers and ecclesiastics who have individually been 
responsible for the afflictive trials which &amp;Baha'u'llah and His followers 
have suffered.  &amp;Fu'ad &amp;Pasha, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
denounced by Him as the "instigator" of His banishment to the Most 
Great Prison, who had so assiduously striven with his colleague &amp;Ali 
&amp;Pasha, to excite the fears and suspicions of a despot already predisposed 
against the Faith and its Leader, was, about a year after he 
had succeeded in executing his design, struck down, while on a trip 
to Paris, by the avenging rod of God, and died at Nice (1869).  
&amp;Ali &amp;Pasha, the &amp;Sadr-i-A'zam (Prime Minister), denounced in such 
forceful language in the &amp;Lawh-i-Ra'is, whose downfall the &amp;Lawh-i-Fu'ad 
 
+P232 
had unmistakably predicted, was, a few years after &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
banishment to &amp;Akka, dismissed from office, was shorn of all power, 
and sank into complete oblivion.  The tyrannical Prince &amp;Mas'ud &amp;Mirza, 
the &amp;Zillu's-Sultan, &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah's eldest son and ruler over more 
than two-fifths of his kingdom, stigmatized by &amp;Baha'u'llah as "the 
Infernal Tree," fell into disgrace, was deprived of all his governorships, 
except that of &amp;Isfahan, and lost all chances of future eminence 
or promotion.  The rapacious Prince &amp;Jalalu'd-Dawlih, branded by 
the Supreme Pen as "the tyrant of Yazd," was, about a year after the 
iniquities he had perpetrated, deprived of his post, recalled to &amp;Tihran, 
and forced to return a part of the property he had stolen from 
his victims.  
     The scheming, the ambitious and profligate &amp;Mirza Buzurg &amp;Khan, 
the Persian Consul General in &amp;Baghdad, was eventually dismissed from 
office, "overwhelmed with disaster, filled with remorse and plunged 
into confusion."  The notorious Mujtahid Siyyid &amp;Sadiq-i-Tabataba'i, 
denounced by &amp;Baha'u'llah as "the Liar of &amp;Tihran," the author of the 
monstrous decree condemning every male member of the &amp;Baha'i community 
in Persia, young or old, high or low, to be put to death, and 
all its women to be deported, was suddenly taken ill, fell a prey to a 
disease that ravaged his heart, his brain and his limbs, and precipitated 
eventually his death.  The high-handed &amp;Subhi &amp;Pasha, who had peremptorily 
summoned &amp;Baha'u'llah to the government house in &amp;Akka, lost 
the position he occupied, and was recalled under circumstances highly 
detrimental to his reputation.  Nor were the other governors of the 
city, who had dealt unjustly with the exalted Prisoner in their charge 
and His fellow-exiles, spared a like fate.  "Every &amp;pasha," testifies 
&amp;Nabil in his narrative, "whose conduct in &amp;Akka was commendable 
enjoyed a long term of office, and was bountifully favored by God, 
whereas every hostile &amp;Mutisarrif (governor) was speedily deposed by 
the Hand of Divine power, even as &amp;Abdu'r-Rahman &amp;Pasha and 
&amp;Muhammad-Yusuf &amp;Pasha who, on the morrow of the very night 
they had resolved to lay hands on the loved ones of &amp;Baha'u'llah, were 
telegraphically advised of their dismissal.  Such was their fate that 
they were never again given a position."  
     &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Baqir, surnamed the "Wolf," who, in the 
strongly condemnatory &amp;Lawh-i-Burhan addressed to him by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
had been compared to "the last trace of sunlight upon the 
mountain-top," witnessed the steady decline of his prestige, and died 
in a miserable state of acute remorse.  His accomplice, &amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad-Husayn, 
surnamed the "She-Serpent," whom &amp;Baha'u'llah described 
 
+P233 
as one "infinitely more wicked than the oppressor of &amp;Karbila," 
was, about that same time, expelled from &amp;Isfahan, wandered from 
village to village, contracted a disease that engendered so foul an odor 
that even his wife and daughter could not bear to approach him, and 
died in such ill-favor with the local authorities that no one dared to 
attend his funeral, his corpse being ignominiously interred by a 
few porters.  
     Mention should, moreover, be made of the devastating famine 
which, about a year after the illustrious &amp;Badi' had been tortured to 
death, ravaged Persia and reduced the population to such extremities 
that even the rich went hungry, and hundreds of mothers ghoulishly 
devoured their own children.  
     Nor can this subject be dismissed without special reference being 
made to the Arch-Breaker of the Covenant of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, 
who lived long enough to witness, while eking out a miserable existence 
in Cyprus, termed by the Turks "the Island of Satan," every 
hope he had so maliciously conceived reduced to naught.  A pensioner 
first of the Turkish and later of the British Government, he was 
subjected to the further humiliation of having his application for 
British citizenship refused.  Eleven of the eighteen "Witnesses" he 
had appointed forsook him and turned in repentance to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
He himself became involved in a scandal which besmirched his reputation 
and that of his eldest son, deprived that son and his descendants 
of the successorship with which he had previously invested him, 
and appointed, in his stead, the perfidious &amp;Mirza &amp;Hadiy-i-Dawlat-Abadi, 
a notorious &amp;Azali, who, on the occasion of the martyrdom of 
the aforementioned &amp;Mirza &amp;Ashraf, was seized with such fear that 
during four consecutive days he proclaimed from the pulpit-top, and 
in a most vituperative language, his complete repudiation of the 
&amp;Babi Faith, as well as of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, his benefactor, who had 
reposed in him such implicit confidence.  It was this same eldest son 
who, through the workings of a strange destiny, sought years after, 
together with his nephew and niece, the presence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
the appointed Successor of &amp;Baha'u'llah and Center of His Covenant, 
expressed repentance, prayed for forgiveness, was graciously accepted 
by Him, and remained, till the hour of his death, a loyal follower 
of the Faith which his father had so foolishly, so shamelessly and 
so pitifully striven to extinguish.

                                 CHAPTER XIV 
                         The Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
 
     I have in the preceding chapters endeavored to trace the rise and 
progress of the Faith associated with the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah during 
the first fifty years of its existence.  If I have dwelt too long on the 
events connected with the life and mission of these twin Luminaries 
of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation, if I have at times indulged in too circumstantial 
a narrative of certain episodes related to their ministries, it 
is solely because these happenings proclaim the birth, and signalize 
the establishment, of an epoch which future historians will acclaim 
as the most heroic, the most tragic and the most momentous period 
in the Apostolic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  Indeed the tale 
which the subsequent decades of the century under review unfold 
to our eyes is but the record of the manifold evidences of the resistless 
operation of those creative forces which the revolution of fifty years 
of almost uninterrupted Revelation had released.  
     A dynamic process, divinely propelled, possessed of undreamt-of 
potentialities, world-embracing in scope, world-transforming in its 
ultimate consequences, had been set in motion on that memorable 
night when the &amp;Bab communicated the purpose of His mission to 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn in an obscure corner of &amp;Shiraz.  It acquired a tremendous 
momentum with the first intimations of &amp;Baha'u'llah's dawning 
Revelation amidst the darkness of the &amp;Siyah-Chal of &amp;Tihran.  It was 
further accelerated by the Declaration of His mission on the eve of 
His banishment from &amp;Baghdad.  It moved to a climax with the proclamation 
of that same mission during the tempestuous years of His 
exile in Adrianople.  Its full significance was disclosed when the 
Author of that Mission issued His historic summonses, appeals and 
warnings to the kings of the earth and the world's ecclesiastical 
leaders.  It was finally consummated by the laws and ordinances which 
He formulated, by the principles which He enunciated and by the 
institutions which He ordained during the concluding years of His 
ministry in the prison-city of &amp;Akka.  
     To direct and canalize these forces let loose by this Heaven-sent 
process, and to insure their harmonious and continuous operation 
after His ascension, an instrument divinely ordained, invested with 
 
+P238 
indisputable authority, organically linked with the Author of the 
Revelation Himself, was clearly indispensable.  That instrument 
&amp;Baha'u'llah had expressly provided through the institution of the 
Covenant, an institution which He had firmly established prior to 
His ascension.  This same Covenant He had anticipated in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
had alluded to it as He bade His last farewell to the members 
of His family, who had been summoned to His bed-side, in the 
days immediately preceding His ascension, and had incorporated it 
in a special document which He designated as "the Book of My 
Covenant," and which He entrusted, during His last illness, to His 
eldest son &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     Written entirely in His own hand; unsealed, on the ninth day 
after His ascension in the presence of nine witnesses chosen from 
amongst His companions and members of His Family; read subsequently, 
on the afternoon of that same day, before a large company 
assembled in His Most Holy Tomb, including His sons, some of the 
&amp;Bab's kinsmen, pilgrims and resident believers, this unique and epoch-making 
Document, designated by &amp;Baha'u'llah as His "Most Great 
Tablet," and alluded to by Him as the "Crimson Book" in His 
"Epistle to the Son of the Wolf," can find no parallel in the Scriptures 
of any previous Dispensation, not excluding that of the &amp;Bab Himself.  
For nowhere in the books pertaining to any of the world's religious 
systems, not even among the writings of the Author of the &amp;Babi 
Revelation, do we find any single document establishing a Covenant 
endowed with an authority comparable to the Covenant which 
&amp;Baha'u'llah had Himself instituted.  
     "So firm and mighty is this Covenant," He Who is its appointed 
Center has affirmed, "that from the beginning of time until the present 
day no religious Dispensation hath produced its like."  "It is indubitably 
clear," He, furthermore, has stated, "that the pivot of the 
oneness of mankind is nothing else but the power of the Covenant."  
"Know thou," He has written, "that the `Sure Handle' mentioned 
from the foundation of the world in the Books, the Tablets and the 
Scriptures of old is naught else but the Covenant and the Testament."  
And again:  "The lamp of the Covenant is the light of the world, and 
the words traced by the Pen of the Most High a limitless ocean."  
"The Lord, the All-Glorified," He has moreover declared, "hath, beneath 
the shade of the Tree of &amp;Anisa (Tree of Life), made a new 
Covenant and established a great Testament...  Hath such a Covenant 
been established in any previous Dispensation, age, period or 
century?  Hath such a Testament, set down by the Pen of the Most 
 
+P239 
High, ever been witnessed?  No, by God!"  And finally:  "The power 
of the Covenant is as the heat of the sun which quickeneth and promoteth 
the development of all created things on earth.  The light of 
the Covenant, in like manner, is the educator of the minds, the 
spirits, the hearts and souls of men."  To this same Covenant He has 
in His writings referred as the "Conclusive Testimony," the "Universal 
Balance," the "Magnet of God's grace," the "Upraised Standard," the 
"Irrefutable Testament," "the all-mighty Covenant, the like of which 
the sacred Dispensations of the past have never witnessed" and "one 
of the distinctive features of this most mighty cycle."  
     Extolled by the writer of the Apocalypse as "the Ark of His 
(God) Testament"; associated with the gathering beneath the "Tree 
of &amp;Anisa" (Tree of Life) mentioned by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the Hidden 
Words; glorified by Him, in other passages of His writings, as the 
"Ark of Salvation" and as "the Cord stretched betwixt the earth and 
the &amp;Abha Kingdom," this Covenant has been bequeathed to posterity 
in a Will and Testament which, together with the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas 
and several Tablets, in which the rank and station of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
are unequivocally disclosed, constitute the chief buttresses designed 
by the Lord of the Covenant Himself to shield and support, after 
His ascension, the appointed Center of His Faith and the Delineator 
of its future institutions.  
     In this weighty and incomparable Document its Author discloses 
the character of that "excellent and priceless heritage" bequeathed by 
Him to His "heirs"; proclaims afresh the fundamental purpose of His 
Revelation; enjoins the "peoples of the world" to hold fast to that 
which will "elevate" their "station"; announces to them that "God 
hath forgiven what is past"; stresses the sublimity of man's station; 
discloses the primary aim of the Faith of God; directs the faithful to 
pray for the welfare of the kings of the earth, "the manifestations of 
the power, and the daysprings of the might and riches, of God"; 
invests them with the rulership of the earth; singles out as His special 
domain the hearts of men; forbids categorically strife and contention; 
commands His followers to aid those rulers who are "adorned with 
the ornament of equity and justice"; and directs, in particular, the 
&amp;Aghsan (His sons) to ponder the "mighty force and the consummate 
power that lieth concealed in the world of being."  He bids them, 
moreover, together with the &amp;Afnan (the &amp;Bab's kindred) and His own 
relatives, to "turn, one and all, unto the Most Great Branch (&amp;Abdu'l-Baha)"; 
identifies Him with "the One Whom God hath purposed," 
"Who hath branched from this pre-existent Root," referred to in the 
 
+P240 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas; ordains the station of the "Greater Branch" (&amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali) to be beneath that of the "Most Great Branch" 
(&amp;Abdu'l-Baha); exhorts the believers to treat the &amp;Aghsan with consideration 
and affection; counsels them to respect His family and 
relatives, as well as the kindred of the &amp;Bab; denies His sons "any 
right to the property of others"; enjoins on them, on His kindred 
and on that of the &amp;Bab to "fear God, to do that which is meet and 
seemly" and to follow the things that will "exalt" their station; warns 
all men not to allow "the means of order to be made the cause of 
confusion, and the instrument of union an occasion for discord"; 
and concludes with an exhortation calling upon the faithful to "serve 
all nations," and to strive for the "betterment of the world."  
     That such a unique and sublime station should have been conferred 
upon &amp;Abdu'l-Baha did not, and indeed could not, surprise 
those exiled companions who had for so long been privileged to 
observe His life and conduct, nor the pilgrims who had been brought, 
however fleetingly, into personal contact with Him, nor indeed the 
vast concourse of the faithful who, in distant lands, had grown to 
revere His name and to appreciate His labors, nor even the wide 
circle of His friends and acquaintances who, in the Holy Land and 
the adjoining countries, were already well familiar with the position 
He had occupied during the lifetime of His Father.  
     He it was Whose auspicious birth occurred on that never-to-be-forgotten 
night when the &amp;Bab laid bare the transcendental character 
of His Mission to His first disciple &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn.  He it was Who, 
as a mere child, seated on the lap of &amp;Tahirih, had registered the 
thrilling significance of the stirring challenge which that indomitable 
heroine had addressed to her fellow-disciple, the erudite and far-famed 
&amp;Vahid.  He it was Whose tender soul had been seared with the 
ineffaceable vision of a Father, haggard, dishevelled, freighted with 
chains, on the occasion of a visit, as a boy of nine, to the &amp;Siyah-Chal 
of &amp;Tihran.  Against Him, in His early childhood, whilst His Father 
lay a prisoner in that dungeon, had been directed the malice of a 
mob of street urchins who pelted Him with stones, vilified Him and 
overwhelmed Him with ridicule.  His had been the lot to share with 
His Father, soon after His release from imprisonment, the rigors and 
miseries of a cruel banishment from His native land, and the trials 
which culminated in His enforced withdrawal to the mountains of 
&amp;Kurdistan.  He it was Who, in His inconsolable grief at His separation 
from an adored Father, had confided to &amp;Nabil, as attested by him in 
his narrative, that He felt Himself to have grown old though still 
 
+P241 
but a child of tender years.  His had been the unique distinction of 
recognizing, while still in His childhood, the full glory of His Father's 
as yet unrevealed station, a recognition which had impelled Him to 
throw Himself at His feet and to spontaneously implore the privilege 
of laying down His life for His sake.  From His pen, while still in 
His adolescence in &amp;Baghdad, had issued that superb commentary on a 
well-known &amp;Muhammadan tradition, written at the suggestion of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, in answer to a request made by &amp;Ali-Shawkat &amp;Pasha, 
which was so illuminating as to excite the unbounded admiration of 
its recipient.  It was His discussions and discourses with the learned 
doctors with whom He came in contact in &amp;Baghdad that first aroused 
that general admiration for Him and for His knowledge which was 
steadily to increase as the circle of His acquaintances was widened, 
at a later date, first in Adrianople and then in &amp;Akka.  It was to Him 
that the highly accomplished &amp;Khurshid &amp;Pasha, the governor of Adrianople, 
had been moved to pay a public and glowing tribute when, 
in the presence of a number of distinguished divines of that city, his 
youthful Guest had, briefly and amazingly, resolved the intricacies 
of a problem that had baffled the minds of the assembled company--
an achievement that affected so deeply the &amp;Pasha that from that time 
onwards he could hardly reconcile himself to that Youth's absence 
from such gatherings.  
     On Him &amp;Baha'u'llah, as the scope and influence of His Mission 
extended, had been led to place an ever greater degree of reliance, by 
appointing Him, on numerous occasions, as His deputy, by enabling 
Him to plead His Cause before the public, by assigning Him the task 
of transcribing His Tablets, by allowing Him to assume the responsibility 
of shielding Him from His enemies, and by investing Him with 
the function of watching over and promoting the interests of His 
fellow-exiles and companions.  He it was Who had been commissioned 
to undertake, as soon as circumstances might permit, the delicate and 
all-important task of purchasing the site that was to serve as the 
permanent resting-place of the &amp;Bab, of insuring the safe transfer of 
His remains to the Holy Land, and of erecting for Him a befitting 
sepulcher on Mt. Carmel.  He it was Who had been chiefly instrumental 
in providing the necessary means for &amp;Baha'u'llah's release from 
His nine-year confinement within the city walls of &amp;Akka, and in 
enabling Him to enjoy, in the evening of His life, a measure of that 
peace and security from which He had so long been debarred.  It was 
through His unremitting efforts that the illustrious &amp;Badi' had been 
granted his memorable interviews with &amp;Baha'u'llah, that the hostility 
 
+P242 
evinced by several governors of &amp;Akka towards the exiled community 
had been transmuted into esteem and admiration, that the purchase of 
properties adjoining the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan had been 
effected, and that the ablest and most valuable presentation of the 
early history of the Faith and of its tenets had been transmitted to 
posterity.  It was through the extraordinarily warm reception accorded 
Him during His visit to Beirut, through His contact with &amp;Midhat 
&amp;Pasha, a former Grand Vizir of Turkey, through His friendship with 
&amp;Aziz &amp;Pasha, whom He had previously known in Adrianople, and 
who had subsequently been promoted to the rank of &amp;Vali, and 
through His constant association with officials, notables and leading 
ecclesiastics who, in increasing number had besought His presence, 
during the final years of His Father's ministry, that He had succeeded 
in raising the prestige of the Cause He had championed to a level it 
had never previously attained.  
     He alone had been accorded the privilege of being called "the 
Master," an honor from which His Father had strictly excluded all 
His other sons.  Upon Him that loving and unerring Father had 
chosen to confer the unique title of "&amp;Sirru'llah" (the Mystery of God), 
a designation so appropriate to One Who, though essentially human 
and holding a station radically and fundamentally different from 
that occupied by &amp;Baha'u'llah and His Forerunner, could still claim 
to be the perfect Exemplar of His Faith, to be endowed with super-human 
knowledge, and to be regarded as the stainless mirror reflecting 
His light.  To Him, whilst in Adrianople, that same Father had, 
in the &amp;Suriy-i-Ghusn (Tablet of the Branch), referred as "this sacred 
and glorious Being, this Branch of Holiness," as "the Limb of the 
Law of God," as His "most great favor" unto men, as His "most 
perfect bounty" conferred upon them, as One through Whom "every 
mouldering bone is quickened," declaring that "whoso turneth towards 
Him hath turned towards God," and that "they who deprive themselves 
of the shadow of the Branch are lost in the wilderness of error."  
To Him He, whilst still in that city, had alluded (in a Tablet addressed 
to &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad &amp;Ibrahim-i-Khalil) as the one amongst His sons 
"from Whose tongue God will cause the signs of His power to stream 
forth," and as the one Whom "God hath specially chosen for His 
Cause."  On Him, at a later period, the Author of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
in a celebrated passage, subsequently elucidated in the "Book of My 
Covenant," had bestowed the function of interpreting His Holy 
Writ, proclaiming Him, at the same time, to be the One "Whom 
God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root."  
 
+P243 
To Him in a Tablet, revealed during that same period and addressed 
to &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad &amp;Quliy-i-Sabzivari, He had referred as "the 
Gulf that hath branched out of this Ocean that hath encompassed 
all created things," and bidden His followers to turn their faces 
towards it.  To Him, on the occasion of His visit to Beirut, His 
Father had, furthermore, in a communication which He dictated to 
His amanuensis, paid a glowing tribute, glorifying Him as the One 
"round Whom all names revolve," as "the Most Mighty Branch of 
God," and as "His ancient and immutable Mystery."  He it was Who, 
in several Tablets which &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself had penned, had been 
personally addressed as "the Apple of Mine eye," and been referred to 
as "a shield unto all who are in heaven and on earth," as "a shelter for 
all mankind" and "a stronghold for whosoever hath believed in God."  
It was on His behalf that His Father, in a prayer revealed in His 
honor, had supplicated God to "render Him victorious," and to "ordain 
... for Him, as well as for them that love Him," the things destined 
by the Almighty for His "Messengers" and the "Trustees" of His 
Revelation.  And finally in yet another Tablet these weighty words 
had been recorded:  "The glory of God rest upon Thee, and upon 
whosoever serveth Thee and circleth around Thee.  Woe, great woe, 
betide him that opposeth and injureth Thee.  Well is it with him that 
sweareth fealty to Thee; the fire of hell torment him who is Thy 
enemy."  
     And now to crown the inestimable honors, privileges and benefits 
showered upon Him, in ever increasing abundance, throughout the 
forty years of His Father's ministry in &amp;Baghdad, in Adrianople and in 
&amp;Akka, He had been elevated to the high office of Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Covenant, and been made the successor of the Manifestation 
of God Himself--a position that was to empower Him to impart an 
extraordinary impetus to the international expansion of His Father's 
Faith, to amplify its doctrine, to beat down every barrier that would 
obstruct its march, and to call into being, and delineate the features 
of, its Administrative Order, the Child of the Covenant, and the 
Harbinger of that World Order whose establishment must needs 
signalize the advent of the Golden Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
 
+P244 
                                  CHAPTER XV 
                     The Rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
 
     The immediate effect of the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah had been, as 
already observed, to spread grief and bewilderment among his followers 
and companions, and to inspire its vigilant and redoubtable 
adversaries with fresh hope and renewed determination.  At a time 
when a grievously traduced Faith had triumphantly emerged from 
the two severest crises it had ever known, one the work of enemies 
without, the other the work of enemies within, when its prestige had 
risen to a height unequalled in any period during its fifty-year 
existence, the unerring Hand which had shaped its destiny ever since 
its inception was suddenly removed, leaving a gap which friend and 
foe alike believed could never again be filled.  
     Yet, as the appointed Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant and the 
authorized Interpreter of His teaching had Himself later explained, 
the dissolution of the tabernacle wherein the soul of the Manifestation 
of God had chosen temporarily to abide signalized its release from 
the restrictions which an earthly life had, of necessity, imposed upon 
it.  Its influence no longer circumscribed by any physical limitations, 
its radiance no longer beclouded by its human temple, that soul could 
henceforth energize the whole world to a degree unapproached at 
any stage in the course of its existence on this planet.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah's stupendous task on this earthly plane had, moreover, 
at the time of His passing, been brought to its final consummation.  
His mission, far from being in any way inconclusive, had, in every 
respect, been carried through to a full end.  The Message with which 
He had been entrusted had been disclosed to the gaze of all mankind.  
The summons He had been commissioned to issue to its leaders and 
rulers had been fearlessly voiced.  The fundamentals of the doctrine 
destined to recreate its life, heal its sicknesses and redeem it from 
bondage and degradation had been impregnably established.  The 
tide of calamity that was to purge and fortify the sinews of His 
Faith had swept on with unstemmed fury.  The blood which was to 
fertilize the soil out of which the institutions of His World Order 
were destined to spring had been profusely shed.  Above all the 
Covenant that was to perpetuate the influence of that Faith, insure 
 
+P245 
its integrity, safeguard it from schism, and stimulate its world-wide 
expansion, had been fixed on an inviolable basis.  
     His Cause, precious beyond the dreams and hopes of men; enshrining 
within its shell that pearl of great price to which the world, 
since its foundation, had been looking forward; confronted with 
colossal tasks of unimaginable complexity and urgency, was beyond 
a peradventure in safe keeping.  His own beloved Son, the apple of 
His eye, His vicegerent on earth, the Executive of His authority, the 
Pivot of His Covenant, the Shepherd of His flock, the Exemplar of 
His faith, the Image of His perfections, the Mystery of His Revelation, 
the Interpreter of His mind, the Architect of His World Order, 
the Ensign of His Most Great Peace, the Focal Point of His unerring 
guidance--in a word, the occupant of an office without peer or equal 
in the entire field of religious history--stood guard over it, alert, 
fearless and determined to enlarge its limits, blazon abroad its fame, 
champion its interests and consummate its purpose.  
     The stirring proclamation &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had penned, addressed to 
the rank and file of the followers of His Father, on the morrow of 
His ascension, as well as the prophecies He Himself had uttered in 
His Tablets, breathed a resolve and a confidence which the fruits 
garnered and the triumphs achieved in the course of a thirty-year 
ministry have abundantly justified.  
     The cloud of despondency that had momentarily settled on the 
disconsolate lovers of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah was lifted.  The continuity 
of that unerring guidance vouchsafed to it since its birth was 
now assured.  The significance of the solemn affirmation that this is 
"the Day which shall not be followed by night" was now clearly 
apprehended.  An orphan community had recognized in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
in its hour of desperate need, its Solace, its Guide, its Mainstay and 
Champion.  The Light that had glowed with such dazzling brightness 
in the heart of Asia, and had, in the lifetime of &amp;Baha'u'llah, spread to 
the Near East, and illuminated the fringes of both the European and 
African continents, was to travel, through the impelling influence 
of the newly proclaimed Covenant, and almost immediately after the 
death of its Author, as far West as the North American continent, 
and from thence diffuse itself to the countries of Europe, and subsequently 
shed its radiance over both the Far East and Australasia.  
     Before the Faith, however, could plant its banner in the midmost 
heart of the North American continent, and from thence establish 
its outposts over so vast a portion of the Western world, the newly 
born Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah had, as had been the case with the 
 
+P246 
Faith that had given it birth, to be baptized with a fire which was to 
demonstrate its solidity and proclaim its indestructibility to an unbelieving 
world.  A crisis, almost as severe as that which had assailed 
the Faith in its earliest infancy in &amp;Baghdad, was to shake that Covenant 
to its foundations at the very moment of its inception, and subject 
afresh the Cause of which it was the noblest fruit to one of the most 
grievous ordeals experienced in the course of an entire century.  
     This crisis, misconceived as a schism, which political as well as 
ecclesiastical adversaries, no less than the fast dwindling remnant of 
the followers of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya hailed as a signal for the immediate 
disruption and final dissolution of the system established by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
was precipitated at the very heart and center of His Faith, 
and was provoked by no one less than a member of His own family, 
a half-brother of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, specifically named in the book of 
the Covenant, and holding a rank second to none except Him Who 
had been appointed as the Center of that Covenant.  For no less than 
four years that emergency fiercely agitated the minds and hearts of a 
vast proportion of the faithful throughout the East, eclipsed, for a 
time, the Orb of the Covenant, created an irreparable breach within 
the ranks of &amp;Baha'u'llah's own kindred, sealed ultimately the fate of 
the great majority of the members of His family, and gravely damaged 
the prestige, though it never succeeded in causing a permanent 
cleavage in the structure, of the Faith itself.  The true ground of this 
crisis was the burning, the uncontrollable, the soul-festering jealousy 
which the admitted preeminence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in rank, power, 
ability, knowledge and virtue, above all the other members of His 
Father's family, had aroused not only in &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, the 
archbreaker of the Covenant, but in some of his closest relatives as 
well.  An envy as blind as that which had possessed the soul of &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Yahya, as deadly as that which the superior excellence of Joseph had 
kindled in the hearts of his brothers, as deep-seated as that which had 
blazed in the bosom of Cain and prompted him to slay his brother 
Abel, had, for several years, prior to &amp;Baha'u'llah's ascension, been 
smouldering in the recesses of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali's heart and 
had been secretly inflamed by those unnumbered marks of distinction, 
of admiration and favor accorded to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha not only by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, His companions and His followers, but by the 
vast number of unbelievers who had come to recognize that innate 
greatness which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had manifested from childhood.  
     Far from being allayed by the provisions of a Will which had 
elevated him to the second-highest position within the ranks of the 
 
+P247 
faithful, the fire of unquenchable animosity that glowed in the breast 
of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali burned even more fiercely as soon as he 
came to realize the full implications of that Document.  All that 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha could do, during a period of four distressful years, His 
incessant exhortations, His earnest pleadings, the favors and kindnesses 
He showered upon him, the admonitions and warnings He 
uttered, even His voluntary withdrawal in the hope of averting the 
threatening storm, proved to be of no avail.  Gradually and with 
unyielding persistence, through lies, half-truths, calumnies and gross 
exaggerations, this "Prime Mover of sedition" succeeded in ranging 
on his side almost the entire family of &amp;Baha'u'llah, as well as a considerable 
number of those who had formed his immediate entourage.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah's two surviving wives, His two sons, the vacillating &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Diya'u'llah and the treacherous &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah, with their sister 
and half-sister and their husbands, one of them the infamous Siyyid 
&amp;Ali, a kinsman of the &amp;Bab, the other the crafty &amp;Mirza &amp;Majdi'd-Din, 
together with his sister and half-brothers--the children of the 
noble, the faithful and now deceased &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim--all united in a 
determined effort to subvert the foundations of the Covenant which 
the newly proclaimed Will had laid.  Even &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, who for 
forty years had labored as &amp;Baha'u'llah's amanuensis, as well as 
&amp;Muhammad-Javad-i-Qasvini, who ever since the days of Adrianople, had 
been engaged in transcribing the innumerable Tablets revealed by 
the Supreme Pen, together with his entire family, threw in their lot 
with the Covenant-breakers, and allowed themselves to be ensnared 
by their machinations.  
     Forsaken, betrayed, assaulted by almost the entire body of His 
relatives, now congregated in the Mansion and the neighboring houses 
clustering around the most Holy Tomb, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, already bereft 
of both His mother and His sons, and without any support at all 
save that of an unmarried sister, His four unmarried daughters, His 
wife and His uncle (a half-brother of &amp;Baha'u'llah), was left alone to 
bear, in the face of a multitude of enemies arrayed against Him from 
within and from without, the full brunt of the terrific responsibilities 
which His exalted office had laid upon Him.  
     Closely-knit by one common wish and purpose; indefatigable in 
their efforts; assured of the backing of the powerful and perfidious 
&amp;Jamal-i-Burujirdi and his henchmen, &amp;Haji &amp;Husayn-i-Kashi, &amp;Khalil-i-Khu'i 
and &amp;Jalil-i-Tabrizi who had espoused their cause; linked 
by a vast system of correspondence with every center and individual 
they could reach; seconded in their labors by emissaries whom they 
 
+P248 
dispatched to Persia, &amp;Iraq, India and Egypt; emboldened in their 
designs by the attitude of officials whom they bribed or seduced, these 
repudiators of a divinely-established Covenant arose, as one man, to 
launch a campaign of abuse and vilification which compared in 
virulence with the infamous accusations which &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and 
Siyyid &amp;Muhammad had jointly levelled at &amp;Baha'u'llah.  To friend 
and stranger, believer and unbeliever alike, to officials both high and 
low, openly and by insinuation, verbally as well as in writing, they 
represented &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as an ambitious, a self-willed, an unprincipled 
and pitiless usurper, Who had deliberately disregarded the 
testamentary instructions of His Father; Who had, in language intentionally 
veiled and ambiguous, assumed a rank co-equal with the 
Manifestation Himself; Who in His communications with the West 
was beginning to claim to be the return of Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, who had come "in the glory of the Father"; Who, in His letters 
to the Indian believers, was proclaiming Himself as the promised 
&amp;Shah &amp;Bahram, and arrogating to Himself the right to interpret the 
writing of His Father, to inaugurate a new Dispensation, and to 
share with Him the Most Great Infallibility, the exclusive prerogative 
of the holders of the prophetic office.  They, furthermore, affirmed 
that He had, for His private ends, fomented discord, fostered enmity 
and brandished the weapon of excommunication; that He had 
perverted the purpose of a Testament which they alleged to be primarily 
concerned with the private interests of &amp;Baha'u'llah's family 
by acclaiming it as a Covenant of world importance, &amp;pre-existent, 
peerless and unique in the history of all religions; that He had 
deprived His brothers and sisters of their lawful allowance, and 
expended it on officials for His personal advancement; that He had 
declined all the repeated invitations made to Him to discuss the issues 
that had arisen and to compose the differences which prevailed; that 
He had actually corrupted the Holy Text, interpolated passages 
written by Himself, and perverted the purpose and meaning of some 
of the weightiest Tablets revealed by the pen of His Father; and 
finally, that the standard of rebellion had, as a result of such conduct, 
been raised by the Oriental believers, that the community of the 
faithful had been rent asunder, was rapidly declining and was doomed 
to extinction.  
     And yet it was this same &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali who, regarding 
himself as the exponent of fidelity, the standard-bearer of the 
"Unitarians," the "Finger who points to his Master," the champion of 
the Holy Family, the spokesman of the &amp;Aghsan, the upholder of the 
 
+P249 
Holy Writ, had, in the lifetime of &amp;Baha'u'llah, so openly and shamelessly 
advanced in a written statement, signed and sealed by him, the 
very claim now falsely imputed by him to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, that his 
Father had, with His own hand, chastised him.  He it was who, when 
sent on a mission to India, had tampered with the text of the holy 
writings entrusted to his care for publication.  He it was who had the 
impudence and temerity to tell &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to His face that just as 
&amp;Umar had succeeded in usurping the successorship of the Prophet 
&amp;Muhammad, he, too, felt himself able to do the same.  He it was who, 
obsessed by the fear that he might not survive &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, had, 
the moment he had been assured by Him that all the honor he coveted 
would, in the course of time, be his, swiftly rejoined that he had no 
guarantee that he would outlive Him.  He it was who, as testified by 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah in his confession, written and published on the occasion 
of his repentance and his short-lived reconciliation with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
had, while &amp;Baha'u'llah's body was still awaiting interment, carried 
off, by a ruse, the two satchels containing his Father's most precious 
documents, entrusted by Him, prior to His ascension, to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
He it was who, by an exceedingly adroit and simple forgery of a 
word recurring in some of the denunciatory passages addressed by the 
Supreme Pen to &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, and by other devices such as mutilation 
and interpolation, had succeeded in making them directly applicable 
to a Brother Whom he hated with such consuming passion.  And 
lastly, it was this same &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali who, as attested by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His Will, had, with circumspection and guile, conspired 
to take His life, an intention indicated by the allusions made 
in a letter written by &amp;Shu'a'u'llah (Son of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali), 
the original of which was enclosed in that same Document by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     The Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah had, by acts such as these, and others 
too numerous to recount, been manifestly violated.  Another blow, 
stunning in its first effects, had been administered to the Faith and had 
caused its structure momentarily to tremble.  The storm foreshadowed 
by the writer of the Apocalypse had broken.  The "lightnings," the 
"thunders," the "earthquake" which must needs accompany the revelation 
of the "Ark of His Testament," had all come to pass.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's grief over so tragic a development, following so 
swiftly upon His Father's ascension, was such that, despite the 
triumphs witnessed in the course of His ministry, it left its traces 
upon Him till the end of His days.  The intensity of the emotions 
which this somber episode aroused within Him were reminiscent of 
 
+P250 
the effect produced upon &amp;Baha'u'llah by the dire happenings precipitated 
by the rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya.  "I swear by the Ancient 
Beauty!," He wrote in one of His Tablets, "So great is My sorrow and 
regret that My pen is paralyzed between My fingers."  "Thou seest 
Me," He, in a prayer recorded in His Will, thus laments, "submerged 
in an ocean of calamities that overwhelm the soul, of afflictions that 
oppress the heart...  Sore trials have compassed Me round, and perils 
have from all sides beset Me.  Thou seest Me immersed in a sea of 
unsurpassed tribulation, sunk into a fathomless abyss, afflicted by 
Mine enemies and consumed with the flame of hatred kindled by My 
kinsmen with whom Thou didst make Thy strong Covenant and 
Thy firm Testament..."  And again in that same Will:  "Lord!  
Thou seest all things weeping over Me, and My kindred rejoicing in 
My woes.  By Thy glory, O my God!  Even amongst Mine enemies 
some have lamented My troubles and My distress, and of the envious 
ones a number have shed tears because of My cares, My exile and My 
afflictions."  "O Thou the Glory of Glories!," He, in one of His last 
Tablets, had cried out, "I have renounced the world and its people, and 
am heart-broken and sorely afflicted because of the unfaithful.  In the 
cage of this world I flutter even as a frightened bird, and yearn every 
day to take My flight unto Thy Kingdom."  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself had significantly revealed in one of His 
Tablets--a Tablet that sheds an illuminating light on the entire 
episode:  "By God, O people!  Mine eye weepeth, and the eye of &amp;Ali 
(the &amp;Bab) weepeth amongst the Concourse on high, and Mine heart 
crieth out, and the heart of &amp;Muhammad crieth out within the Most 
Glorious Tabernacle, and My soul shouteth and the souls of the 
Prophets shout before them that are endued with understanding...  
My sorrow is not for Myself, but for Him Who shall come after Me, 
in the shadow of My Cause, with manifest and undoubted sovereignty, 
inasmuch as they will not welcome His appearance, will repudiate 
His signs, will dispute His sovereignty, will contend with Him, and 
will betray His Cause..."  "Can it be possible," He, in a no less 
significant Tablet, had observed, "that after the dawning of the day-star 
of Thy Testament above the horizon of Thy Most Great Tablet, 
the feet of any one shall slip in Thy Straight Path?  Unto this We 
answered:  `O My most exalted Pen!  It behoveth Thee to occupy 
Thyself with that whereunto Thou hast been bidden by God, the 
Exalted, the Great.  Ask not of that which will consume Thine heart 
and the hearts of the denizens of Paradise, who have circled round My 
wondrous Cause.  It behoveth Thee not to be acquainted with that 
 
+P251 
which We have veiled from Thee.  Thy Lord is, verily, the Concealer, 
the All-Knowing!'"  More specifically &amp;Baha'u'llah had, referring to 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali in clear and unequivocal language, affirmed:  
"He, verily, is but one of My servants...  Should he for a moment pass 
out from under the shadow of the Cause, he surely shall be brought 
to naught."  Furthermore, in a no less emphatic language, He, again 
in connection with &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali had stated:  "By God, the 
True One!  Were We, for a single instant, to withhold from him 
the outpourings of Our Cause, he would wither, and would fall upon 
the dust."  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself had, moreover, testified:  "There is 
no doubt that in a thousand passages in the sacred writings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah the breakers of the Covenant have been execrated."  Some 
of these passages He Himself compiled, ere His departure from this 
world, and incorporated them in one of His last Tablets, as a warning 
and safeguard against those who, throughout His ministry, had 
manifested so implacable a hatred against Him, and had come so near 
to subverting the foundations of a Covenant on which not only His 
own authority but the integrity of the Faith itself depended.  
 
+P252 
                                 CHAPTER XVI 
             The Rise and Establishment of the Faith in the West 
 
     Though the rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali precipitated many 
sombre and distressing events, and though its dire consequences continued 
for several years to obscure the light of the Covenant, to 
endanger the life of its appointed Center, and to distract the thoughts 
and retard the progress of the activities of its supporters in both the 
East and the West, yet the entire episode, viewed in its proper perspective, 
proved to be neither more nor less than one of those periodic 
crises which, since the inception of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
throughout a whole century, have been instrumental in weeding out 
its harmful elements, in fortifying its foundations, in demonstrating 
its resilience, and in releasing a further measure of its latent powers.  
     Now that the provisions of a divinely appointed Covenant had been 
indubitably proclaimed; now that the purpose of the Covenant was 
clearly apprehended and its fundamentals had become immovably 
established in the hearts of the overwhelming majority of the adherents 
of the Faith; and now that the first assaults launched by its would-be 
subverters had been successfully repulsed, the Cause for which that 
Covenant had been designed could forge ahead along the course traced 
for it by the finger of its Author.  Shining exploits and unforgettable 
victories had already signalized the birth of that Cause and accompanied 
its rise in several countries of the Asiatic continent, and 
particularly in the homeland of its Founder.  The mission of its 
newly-appointed Leader, the steward of its glory and the diffuser of 
its light, was, as conceived by Himself, to enrich and extend the 
bounds of the incorruptible patrimony entrusted to His hands by 
shedding the illumination of His Father's Faith upon the West, by 
expounding the fundamental precepts of that Faith and its cardinal 
principles, by consolidating the activities which had already been 
initiated for the promotion of its interests, and, finally, by ushering 
in, through the provisions of His own Will, the Formative Age in 
its evolution.  
     A year after the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had, in a 
verse which He had revealed, and which had evoked the derision of the 
Covenant-breakers, already foreshadowed an auspicious event which 
 
+P253 
posterity would recognize as one of the greatest triumphs of His 
ministry, which in the end would confer an inestimable blessing upon 
the western world, and which erelong was to dispel the grief and the 
apprehensions that had surrounded the community of His fellow-exiles 
in &amp;Akka.  The Great Republic of the West, above all the other 
countries of the Occident, was singled out to be the first recipient 
of God's inestimable blessing, and to become the chief agent in its 
transmission to so many of her sister nations throughout the five 
continents of the earth.  
     The importance of so momentous a development in the evolution 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah--the establishment of His Cause in the 
North American continent--at a time when &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had just 
inaugurated His Mission, and was still in the throes of the most 
grievous crisis with which He was ever confronted, can in no wise 
be overestimated.  As far back as the year which witnessed the birth 
of the Faith in &amp;Shiraz the &amp;Bab had, in the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', after 
having warned in a memorable passage the peoples of both the Orient 
and the Occident, directly addressed the "peoples of the West," and 
significantly bidden them "issue forth" from their "cities" to aid God, 
and "become as brethren" in His "one and indivisible religion."  
"In the East," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself had, in anticipation of this development, 
written, "the light of His Revelation hath broken; in the West 
the signs of His dominion have appeared."  "Should they attempt," 
He, moreover, had predicted, "to conceal its light on the continent, 
it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean, 
and, raising its voice, proclaim:  `I am the lifegiver of the world!'"  
"Had this Cause been revealed in the West," He, shortly before His 
ascension, is reported by &amp;Nabil in his narrative to have stated, "had 
Our verses been sent from the West to Persia and other countries 
of the East, it would have become evident how the people of the 
Occident would have embraced Our Cause.  The people of Persia, 
however, have failed to appreciate it."  "From the beginning of time 
until the present day," is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's own testimony, "the light of 
Divine Revelation hath risen in the East and shed its radiance upon 
the West.  The illumination thus shed hath, however, acquired in the 
West an extraordinary brilliancy.  Consider the Faith proclaimed by 
Jesus.  Though it first appeared in the East, yet not until its light had 
been shed upon the West did the full measure of its potentialities 
become manifest."  "The day is approaching," He has affirmed, "when 
ye shall witness how, through the splendor of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
the West will have replaced the East, radiating the light of Divine 
 
+P254 
guidance."  And again:  "The West hath acquired illumination from 
the East, but, in some respects, the reflection of the light hath been 
greater in the Occident."  Furthermore, "The East hath, verily, been 
illumined with the light of the Kingdom.  Erelong will this same light 
shed a still greater illumination upon the West."  
     More specifically has the Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation Himself 
chosen to confer upon the rulers of the American continent the unique 
honor of addressing them collectively in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, His most 
Holy Book, significantly exhorting them to "adorn the temple of 
dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God, and 
its head with the crown of the remembrance" of their Lord, and 
bidding them "bind with the hands of justice the broken," and "crush 
the oppressor" with the "rod of the commandments" of their "Lord, 
the Ordainer, the All-Wise."  "The continent of America," wrote 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "is, in the eyes of the one true God, the land wherein 
the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries of 
His Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide and the 
free assemble."  "The American continent," He has furthermore predicted, 
"giveth signs and evidences of very great advancement.  Its 
future is even more promising, for its influence and illumination are 
far reaching.  It will lead all nations spiritually."  
     "The American people," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, even more distinctly, singling 
out for His special favor the Great Republic of the West, the 
leading nation of the American continent, has revealed, "are indeed 
worthy of being the first to build the Tabernacle of the Most Great 
Peace, and proclaim the oneness of mankind."  And again:  "This 
American nation is equipped and empowered to accomplish that which 
will adorn the pages of history, to become the envy of the world, and 
be blest in both the East and the West for the triumph of its people."  
Furthermore:  "May this American democracy be the first nation to 
establish the foundation of international agreement.  May it be the 
first nation to proclaim the unity of mankind.  May it be the first 
to unfurl the standard of the Most Great Peace."  "May the inhabitants 
of this country," He, moreover has written, "...rise from their 
present material attainment to such heights that heavenly illumination 
may stream from this center to all the peoples of the world."  
     "O ye apostles of &amp;Baha'u'llah!," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has thus addressed 
the believers of the North American continent, "...consider how 
exalted and lofty is the station you are destined to attain...  The full 
measure of your success is as yet unrevealed, its significance still 
unapprehended."  And again:  "Your mission is unspeakably glorious.  
 
+P255 
Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve 
into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and 
the throne of the Kingdom of God, will in the plenitude of its 
majesty and glory, be firmly established."  And finally, this stirring 
affirmation:  "The moment this Divine Message is carried forward by 
the American believers from the shores of America, and is propagated 
through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia, 
and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself 
securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion...  
Then will the whole earth resound with the praises of its majesty and 
greatness."  
     Little wonder that a community belonging to a nation so abundantly 
blessed, a nation occupying so eminent a position in a continent so 
richly endowed, should have been able to add, during the fifty years 
of its existence, many a page rich with victories to the annals of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  This is the community, it should be remembered, 
which, ever since it was called into being through the creative 
energies released by the proclamation of the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
was nursed in the lap of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's unfailing solicitude, and was 
trained by Him to discharge its unique mission through the revelation 
of innumerable Tablets, through the instructions issued to returning 
pilgrims, through the despatch of special messengers, through His own 
travels at a later date, across the North American continent, through 
the emphasis laid by Him on the institution of the Covenant in the 
course of those travels, and finally through His mandate embodied in 
the Tablets of the Divine Plan.  This is the community which, from 
its earliest infancy until the present day, has unremittingly labored 
and succeeded, through its own unaided efforts, in implanting the 
banner of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the vast majority of the sixty countries which, 
in both the East and the West, can now claim the honor of being 
included within the pale of His Faith.  To this community belongs the 
distinction of having evolved the pattern, and of having been the first 
to erect the framework, of the administrative institutions that herald 
the advent of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Through the efforts of 
its members the Mother Temple of the West, the Harbinger of that 
Order, one of the noblest institutions ordained in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
and the most stately edifice reared in the entire &amp;Baha'i world, has been 
erected in the very heart of the North American continent.  Through 
the assiduous labors of its pioneers, its teachers and its administrators, 
the literature of the Faith has been enormously expanded, its aims 
and purposes fearlessly defended, and its nascent institutions solidly 
 
+P256 
established.  In direct consequence of the unsupported and indefatigable 
endeavors of the most distinguished of its itinerant teachers the 
spontaneous allegiance of Royalty to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah has been 
secured and unmistakably proclaimed in several testimonies transmitted 
to posterity by the pen of the royal convert herself.  And 
finally, to the members of this community, the spiritual descendants 
of the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, 
must be ascribed the eternal honor of having arisen, on numerous 
occasions, with marvelous alacrity, zeal and determination, to champion 
the cause of the oppressed, to relieve the needy, and to defend 
the interests of the edifices and institutions reared by their brethren in 
countries such as Persia, Russia, Egypt, &amp;Iraq and Germany, countries 
where the adherents of the Faith have had to sustain, in varying 
measure, the rigors of racial and religious persecution.  
     Strange, indeed, that in a country, invested with such a unique 
function among its sister-nations throughout the West, the first public 
reference to the Author of so glorious a Faith should have been made 
through the mouth of one of the members of that ecclesiastical order 
with which that Faith has had so long to contend, and from which it 
has frequently suffered.  Stranger still that he who first established it in 
the city of Chicago, fifty years after the &amp;Bab had declared His 
Mission in &amp;Shiraz, should himself have forsaken, a few years later, 
the standard which he, single-handed, had implanted in that city.  
     It was on September 23, 1893, a little over a year after &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
ascension, that, in a paper written by Rev. Henry H. Jessup, D.D., 
Director of Presbyterian Missionary Operations in North Syria, and 
read by Rev. George A. Ford of Syria, at the World Parliament of 
Religions, held in Chicago, in connection with the Columbian Exposition, 
commemorating the four-hundredth anniversary of the discovery 
of America, it was announced that "a famous Persian Sage," "the &amp;Babi 
Saint," had died recently in &amp;Akka, and that two years previous to His 
ascension "a Cambridge scholar" had visited Him, to whom He had 
expressed "sentiments so noble, so Christ-like" that the author of the 
paper, in his "closing words," wished to share them with his audience.  
Less than a year later, in February 1894, a Syrian doctor, named 
&amp;Ibrahim &amp;Khayru'llah, who, while residing in Cairo, had been converted 
by &amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'l-Karim-i-Tihrani to the Faith, had received a Tablet 
from &amp;Baha'u'llah, had communicated with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and 
reached New York in December 1892, established his residence in 
Chicago, and began to teach actively and systematically the Cause 
he had espoused.  Within the space of two years he had communicated 
 
+P257 
his impressions to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and reported on the remarkable 
success that had attended his efforts.  In 1895 an opening was 
vouchsafed to him in Kenosha, which he continued to visit once a 
week, in the course of his teaching activities.  By the following year the 
believers in these two cities, it was reported, were counted by hundreds.  
In 1897 he published his book, entitled the &amp;Babu'd-Din, and visited 
Kansas City, New York City, Ithaca and Philadelphia, where he was 
able to win for the Faith a considerable number of supporters.  The 
stout-hearted Thornton Chase, surnamed &amp;Thabit (Steadfast) by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha and designated by Him "the first American believer," 
who became a convert to the Faith in 1894, the immortal Louisa A. 
Moore, the mother teacher of the West, surnamed &amp;Liva (Banner) by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Dr. Edward Getsinger, to whom she was later married, 
Howard MacNutt, Arthur P. Dodge, Isabella D. Brittingham, Lillian 
F. Kappes, Paul K. Dealy, Chester I. Thacher and Helen S. Goodall, 
whose names will ever remain associated with the first stirrings of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the North American continent, stand out as 
the most prominent among those who, in those early years, awakened 
to the call of the New Day, and consecrated their lives to the service 
of the newly proclaimed Covenant.  
     By 1898 Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the well-known philanthropist (wife 
of Senator George F. Hearst), whom Mrs. Getsinger had, while on a 
visit to California, attracted to the Faith, had expressed her intention 
of visiting &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land, had invited several 
believers, among them Dr. and Mrs. Getsinger, Dr. &amp;Khayru'llah and 
his wife, to join her, and had completed the necessary arrangements 
for their historic pilgrimage to &amp;Akka.  In Paris several resident 
Americans, among whom were May Ellis Bolles, whom Mrs. Getsinger 
had won over to the Faith, Miss Pearson, and Ann Apperson, both 
nieces of Mrs. Hearst, with Mrs. Thornburgh and her daughter, were 
added to the party, the number of which was later swelled in Egypt 
by the addition of Dr. &amp;Khayru'llah's daughters and their grand-mother 
whom he had recently converted.  
     The arrival of fifteen pilgrims, in three successive parties, the first 
of which, including Dr. and Mrs. Getsinger, reached the prison-city of 
&amp;Akka on December 10, 1898; the intimate personal contact established 
between the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant and the newly 
arisen heralds of His Revelation in the West; the moving circumstances 
attending their visit to His Tomb and the great honor bestowed upon 
them of being conducted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself into its innermost 
chamber; the spirit which, through precept and example, despite the 
 
+P258 
briefness of their stay, a loving and bountiful Host so powerfully 
infused into them; and the passionate zeal and unyielding resolve 
which His inspiring exhortations, His illuminating instructions and 
the multiple evidences of His divine love kindled in their hearts--all 
these marked the opening of a new epoch in the development of the 
Faith in the West, an epoch whose significance the acts subsequently 
performed by some of these same pilgrims and their fellow-disciples 
have amply demonstrated.  
     "Of that first meeting," one of these pilgrims, recording her 
impressions, has written, "I can remember neither joy nor pain, nor 
anything that I can name.  I had been carried suddenly to too great a 
height, my soul had come in contact with the Divine Spirit, and 
this force, so pure, so holy, so mighty, had overwhelmed me...  We 
could not remove our eyes from His glorious face; we heard all that 
He said; we drank tea with Him at His bidding; but existence 
seemed suspended; and when He arose and suddenly left us, we came 
back with a start to life; but never again, oh! never again, thank God, 
the same life on this earth."  "In the might and majesty of His 
presence," that same pilgrim, recalling the last interview accorded the 
party of which she was a member, has testified, "our fear was turned 
to perfect faith, our weakness into strength, our sorrow into hope, 
and ourselves forgotten in our love for Him.  As we all sat before 
Him, waiting to hear His words, some of the believers wept bitterly.  
He bade them dry their tears, but they could not for a moment.  So 
again He asked them for His sake not to weep, nor would He talk to 
us and teach us until all tears were banished..."  
     ..."Those three days," Mrs. Hearst herself has, in one of her 
letters, testified, "were the most memorable days of my life...  The 
Master I will not attempt to describe:  I will only state that I believe 
with all my heart that He is the Master, and my greatest blessing in 
this world is that I have been privileged to be in His presence, and 
look upon His sanctified face...  Without a doubt &amp;Abbas Effendi is 
the Messiah of this day and generation, and we need not look for 
another."  "I must say," she, moreover, has in another letter written, 
"He is the most wonderful Being I have ever met or ever expect to 
meet in this world...  The spiritual atmosphere which surrounds Him 
and most powerfully affects all those who are blest by being near 
Him, is indescribable...  I believe in Him with all my heart and soul, 
and I hope all who call themselves believers will concede to Him all 
the greatness, all the glory, and all the praise, for surely He is the Son 
of God--and `the spirit of the Father abideth in Him.'"  
 
+P259 
     Even Mrs. Hearst's butler, a negro named Robert Turner, the 
first member of his race to embrace the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the 
West, had been transported by the influence exerted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
in the course of that epoch-making pilgrimage.  Such was the tenacity 
of his faith that even the subsequent estrangement of his beloved 
mistress from the Cause she had spontaneously embraced failed to 
becloud its radiance, or to lessen the intensity of the emotions which the 
loving-kindness showered by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha upon him had excited 
in his breast.  
     The return of these God-intoxicated pilgrims, some to France, 
others to the United States, was the signal for an outburst of 
systematic and sustained activity, which, as it gathered momentum, 
and spread its ramifications over Western Europe and the states and 
provinces of the North American continent, grew to so great a scale 
that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself resolved that, as soon as He should be 
released from His prolonged confinement in &amp;Akka, He would undertake 
a personal mission to the West.  Undeflected in its course by the 
devastating crisis which the ambition of Dr. &amp;Khayru'llah had, upon his 
return from the Holy Land (December, 1899) precipitated; undismayed 
by the agitation which he, working in collaboration with the 
arch-breaker of the Covenant and his messengers, had provoked; 
disdainful of the attacks launched by him and his fellow-seceders, as 
well as by Christian ecclesiastics increasingly jealous of the rising 
power and extending influence of the Faith; nourished by a continual 
flow of pilgrims who transmitted the verbal messages and 
special instructions of a vigilant Master; invigorated by the effusions 
of His pen recorded in innumerable Tablets; instructed by the successive 
messengers and teachers dispatched at His behest for its guidance, 
edification and consolidation, the community of the American 
believers arose to initiate a series of enterprises which, blessed and 
stimulated a decade later by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself, were to be but 
a prelude to the unparalleled services destined to be rendered by its 
members during the Formative Age of His Father's Dispensation.  
     No sooner had one of these pilgrims, the afore-mentioned May 
Bolles, returned to Paris than she succeeded, in compliance with 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's emphatic instructions, in establishing in that city the 
first &amp;Baha'i center to be formed on the European continent.  This 
center was, shortly after her arrival, reinforced by the conversion of 
the illumined Thomas Breakwell, the first English believer, immortalized 
by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's fervent eulogy revealed in his memory; of 
Hippolyte Dreyfus, the first Frenchman to embrace the Faith, who, 
 
+P260 
through his writings, translations, travels and other pioneer services, 
was able to consolidate, as the years went by, the work which had 
been initiated in his country; and of Laura Barney, whose imperishable 
service was to collect and transmit to posterity in the form of a book, 
entitled "Some Answered Questions," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's priceless explanations, 
covering a wide variety of subjects, given to her in the course 
of an extended pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  Three years later, in 
1902, May Bolles, now married to a Canadian, transferred her residence 
to Montreal, and succeeded in laying the foundations of the Cause 
in that Dominion.  
     In London Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper, as a consequence of the 
creative influences released by that never-to-be-forgotten pilgrimage, 
was able to initiate activities which, stimulated and expanded through 
the efforts of the first English believers, and particularly of Ethel J. 
Rosenberg, converted in 1899, enabled them to erect, in later years, the 
structure of their administrative institutions in the British Isles.  In 
the North American continent, the defection and the denunciatory 
publications of Dr. &amp;Khayru'llah (encouraged as he was by &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali and his son &amp;Shu'a'u'llah, whom he had despatched 
to America) tested to the utmost the loyalty of the newly fledged community; 
but successive messengers despatched by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
(such as &amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'l-Karim-i-Tihrani, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan-i-Khurasani, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Asadu'llah and &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl) succeeded 
in rapidly dispelling the doubts, and in deepening the understanding, 
of the believers, in holding the community together, and in forming 
the nucleus of those administrative institutions which, two decades 
later, were to be formally inaugurated through the explicit provisions 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament.  As far back as the 
year 1899 a council board of seven officers, the forerunner of a 
series of Assemblies which, ere the close of the first &amp;Baha'i Century, 
were to cover the North American Continent from coast to 
coast, was established in the city of Kenosha.  In 1902 a &amp;Baha'i 
Publishing Society, designed to propagate the literature of a gradually 
expanding community, was formed in Chicago.  A &amp;Baha'i 
Bulletin, for the purpose of disseminating the teachings of the Faith 
was inaugurated in New York.  The "&amp;Baha'i News," another 
periodical, subsequently appeared in Chicago, and soon developed 
into a magazine entitled "Star of the West."  The translation of some 
of the most important writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, such as the "Hidden 
Words," the "&amp;Kitab-i-Iqan," the "Tablets to the Kings," and the 
"Seven Valleys," together with the Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, as well 
 
+P261 
as several treatises and pamphlets written by &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl and 
others, was energetically undertaken.  A considerable correspondence 
with various centers throughout the Orient was initiated, and grew 
steadily in scope and importance.  Brief histories of the Faith, books 
and pamphlets written in its defence, articles for the press, accounts 
of travels and pilgrimages, eulogies and poems, were likewise published 
and widely disseminated.  
     Simultaneously, travellers and teachers, emerging triumphantly 
from the storms of tests and trials which had threatened to engulf 
their beloved Cause, arose, of their own accord, to reinforce and 
multiply the strongholds of the Faith already established.  Centers 
were opened in the cities of Washington, Boston, San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, Cleveland, Baltimore, Minneapolis, Buffalo, Rochester, 
Pittsburgh, Seattle, St. Paul and in other places.  Audacious pioneers, 
whether as visitors or settlers, eager to spread the new born Evangel 
beyond the confines of their native country, undertook journeys, 
and embarked on enterprises which carried its light to the heart of 
Europe, to the Far East, and as far as the islands of the Pacific.  
Mason Remey voyaged to Russia and Persia, and later, with Howard 
Struven, circled, for the first time in &amp;Baha'i history, the globe, visiting 
on his way the Hawaiian Islands, Japan, China, India and Burma.  
Hooper Harris and Harlan Ober traveled, during no less than seven 
months, in India and Burma, visiting Bombay, Poona, Lahore, Calcutta, 
Rangoon and Mandalay.  Alma Knobloch, following on the 
heels of Dr. K. E. Fisher, hoisted the standard of the Faith in 
Germany, and carried its light to Austria.  Dr. Susan I. Moody, 
Sydney Sprague, Lillian F. Kappes, Dr. Sarah Clock, and Elizabeth 
Stewart transferred their residence to &amp;Tihran for the purpose of 
furthering the manifold interests of the Faith, in collaboration with 
the &amp;Baha'is of that city.  Sarah Farmer, who had already initiated 
in 1894, at Green Acre, in the State of Maine, summer conferences 
and established a center for the promotion of unity and fellowship 
between races and religions, placed, after her pilgrimage to &amp;Akka in 
1900, the facilities these conferences provided at the disposal of the 
followers of the Faith which she had herself recently embraced.  
     And last but not least, inspired by the example set by their 
fellow-disciples in &amp;Ishqabad, who had already commenced the construction 
of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world, and afire with 
the desire to demonstrate, in a tangible and befitting manner, the 
quality of their faith and devotion, the &amp;Baha'is of Chicago, having 
petitioned &amp;Abdu'l-Baha for permission to erect a House of Worship, 
 
+P262 
and secured, in a Tablet revealed in June 1903, His ready and 
enthusiastic approval, arose, despite the smallness of their numbers 
and their limited resources, to initiate an enterprise which must rank 
as the greatest single contribution which the &amp;Baha'is of America, 
and indeed of the West, have as yet made to the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
The subsequent encouragement given them by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
and the contributions raised by various Assemblies decided the 
members of this Assembly to invite representatives of their fellow-believers 
in various parts of the country to meet in Chicago for the 
initiation of the stupendous undertaking they had conceived.  On 
November 26, 1907, the assembled representatives, convened for that 
purpose, appointed a committee of nine to locate a suitable site for 
the proposed Temple.  By April 9, 1908, the sum of two thousand 
dollars had been paid for the purchase of two building lots, situated 
near the shore of Lake Michigan.  In March 1909, a convention representative 
of various &amp;Baha'i centers was called, in pursuance of 
instructions received from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The thirty-nine delegates, 
representing thirty-six cities, who had assembled in Chicago, on the 
very day the remains of the &amp;Bab were laid to rest by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in 
the specially erected mausoleum on Mt. Carmel, established a permanent 
national organization, known as the &amp;Baha'i Temple Unity, which 
was incorporated as a religious corporation, functioning under the 
laws of the State of Illinois, and invested with full authority to hold 
title to the property of the Temple and to provide ways and means 
for its construction.  At this same convention a constitution was 
framed, the Executive Board of the &amp;Baha'i Temple Unity was elected, 
and was authorized by the delegates to complete the purchase of the 
land recommended by the previous Convention.  Contributions for 
this historic enterprise, from India, Persia, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, 
Russia, Egypt, Germany, France, England, Canada, Mexico, the 
Hawaiian Islands, and even Mauritius, and from no less than sixty 
American cities, amounted by 1910, two years previous to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
arrival in America, to no less than twenty thousand dollars, a 
remarkable testimony alike to the solidarity of the followers of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in both the East and the West, and to the self-sacrificing 
efforts exerted by the American believers who, as the work progressed, 
assumed a preponderating share in providing the sum of over a 
million dollars required for the erection of the structure of the Temple 
and its external ornamentation.

                                 CHAPTER XVII 
                   Renewal of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Incarceration 
 
     The outstanding accomplishments of a valiant and sorely-tested 
community, the first fruits of &amp;Baha'u'llah's newly established Covenant 
in the Western world, had laid a foundation sufficiently imposing 
to invite the presence of the appointed Center of that Covenant, 
Who had called that Community into being and watched, with such 
infinite care and foresight, over its budding destinies.  Not until, 
however, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had emerged from the severe crisis which 
had already for several years been holding Him in its toils could He 
undertake His memorable voyage to the shores of a continent where 
the rise and establishment of His Father's Faith had been signalized 
by such magnificent and enduring achievements.  
     This second major crisis of His ministry, external in nature and 
hardly less severe than the one precipitated by the rebellion of &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali, gravely imperiled His life, deprived Him, for a 
number of years, of the relative freedom He had enjoyed, plunged 
into anguish His family and the followers of the Faith in East and 
West, and exposed as never before, the degradation and infamy of 
His relentless adversaries.  It originated two years after the departure 
of the first American pilgrims from the Holy Land.  It persisted, with 
varying degrees of intensity, during more than seven years, and was 
directly attributable to the incessant intrigues and monstrous 
misrepresentations of the Arch-Breaker of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant and 
his supporters.  
     Embittered by his abject failure to create a schism on which he 
had fondly pinned his hopes; stung by the conspicuous success which 
the standard-bearers of the Covenant had, despite his machinations, 
achieved in the North American continent; encouraged by the existence 
of a &amp;regime that throve in an atmosphere of intrigue and suspicion, 
and which was presided over by a cunning and cruel potentate; 
determined to exploit to the full the opportunities for mischief 
afforded him by the arrival of Western pilgrims at the prison-fortress 
of &amp;Akka, as well as by the commencement of the construction of 
the &amp;Bab's sepulcher on Mt. Carmel, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, seconded 
by his brother, &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah, and aided by his brother-in-law, 
 
+P264 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Majdi'd-Din, succeeded through strenuous and persistent 
endeavors in exciting the suspicion of the Turkish government and 
its officials, and in inducing them to reimpose on &amp;Abdu'l-Baha the 
confinement from which, in the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah, He had so 
grievously suffered.  
     This very brother, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali's chief accomplice, in 
a written confession signed, sealed and published by him, on the 
occasion of his reconciliation with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, has borne testimony 
to the wicked plots that had been devised.  "What I have heard from 
others," wrote &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah, "I will ignore.  I will only recount 
what I have seen with my own eyes, and heard from his (&amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali) lips."  "It was arranged by him (&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali)," 
he, then, proceeds to relate, "to dispatch &amp;Mirza &amp;Majdi'd-Din 
with a gift and a letter written in Persian to &amp;Nazim &amp;Pasha, the &amp;Vali 
(governor) of Damascus, and to seek his assistance....  As he 
(&amp;Mirza &amp;Majdi'd-Din) himself informed me in Haifa he did all he 
could to acquaint him (governor) fully with the construction work 
on Mt. Carmel, with the comings and goings of the American believers, 
and with the gatherings held in &amp;Akka.  The &amp;Pasha, in his 
desire to know all the facts, was extremely kind to him, and assured 
him of his aid.  A few days after &amp;Mirza &amp;Majdi'd-Din's return a cipher 
telegram was received from the Sublime Porte, transmitting the 
&amp;Sultan's orders to incarcerate &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, myself and the others."  
"In those days," he, furthermore, in that same document, testifies, 
"a man who came to &amp;Akka from Damascus stated to outsiders that 
&amp;Nazim &amp;Pasha had been the cause of the incarceration of &amp;Abbas 
Effendi.  The strangest thing of all is this that &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, 
after he had been incarcerated, wrote a letter to &amp;Nazim &amp;Pasha 
for the purpose of achieving his own deliverance....  The &amp;Pasha, 
however, did not write even a word in answer to either the first or 
the second letter."  
     It was in 1901, on the fifth day of the month of &amp;Jamadiyu'l-Avval 
1319 A.H. (August 20) that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, upon His return 
from &amp;Bahji where He had participated in the celebration of the anniversary 
of the &amp;Bab's Declaration, was informed, in the course of an 
interview with the governor of &amp;Akka, of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid's 
instructions ordering that the restrictions which had been gradually 
relaxed should be reimposed, and that He and His brothers should 
be strictly confined within the walls of that city.  The &amp;Sultan's edict 
was at first rigidly enforced, the freedom of the exiled community 
was severely curtailed, while &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had to submit, alone and 
 
+P265 
unaided, to the prolonged interrogation of judges and officials, who 
required His presence for several consecutive days at government 
headquarters for the purpose of their investigations.  One of His 
first acts was to intercede on behalf of His brothers, who had been 
peremptorily summoned and informed by the governor of the orders 
of the sovereign, an act which failed to soften their hostility or lessen 
their malevolent activities.  Subsequently, through His intervention 
with the civil and military authorities, He succeeded in obtaining the 
freedom of His followers who resided in &amp;Akka, and in enabling them 
to continue to earn, without interference, the means of livelihood.  
     The Covenant-breakers were unappeased by the measures taken 
by the authorities against One Who had so magnanimously intervened 
on their behalf.  Aided by the notorious &amp;Yahya Bey, the chief 
of police, and other officials, civil as well as military, who, in consequence 
of their representations, had replaced those who had been 
friendly to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and by secret agents who traveled back and 
forth between &amp;Akka and Constantinople, and who even kept a vigilant 
watch over everything that went on in His household, they arose 
to encompass His ruin.  They lavished on officials gifts which included 
possessions sacred to the memory of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and shamelessly 
proffered to high and low alike bribes drawn, in some instances, from 
the sale of properties associated with Him or bestowed upon some of 
them by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Relaxing nothing of their efforts they pursued 
relentlessly the course of their nefarious activities, determined 
to leave no stone unturned until they had either brought about His 
execution or ensured His deportation to a place remote enough to 
enable them to wrest the Cause from His grasp.  The &amp;Vali of Damascus, 
the &amp;Mufti of Beirut, members of the Protestant missions established 
in Syria and &amp;Akka, even the influential &amp;Shaykh &amp;Abu'l-Huda, 
in Constantinople, whom the &amp;Sultan held in as profound an esteem 
as that in which &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah had held his Grand Vizir, &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, were, on various occasions, approached, appealed to, 
and urged to lend their assistance for the prosecution of their odious 
designs.  
     Through verbal messages, formal communications and by personal 
interviews the Covenant-breakers impressed upon these notables 
the necessity of immediate action, shrewdly adapting their arguments 
to the particular interests and prejudices of those whose aid they 
solicited.  To some they represented &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as a callous usurper 
Who had trampled upon their rights, robbed them of their heritage, 
reduced them to poverty, made their friends in Persia their enemies, 
 
+P266 
accumulated for Himself a vast fortune, and acquired no less than 
two-thirds of the land in Haifa.  To others they declared that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
contemplated making of &amp;Akka and Haifa a new Mecca and 
Medina.  To still others they affirmed that &amp;Baha'u'llah was no more 
than a retired dervish, who professed and promoted the Faith of 
&amp;Islam, Whom &amp;Abbas Effendi, His son, had, for the purpose of 
self-glorification, exalted to the rank of God-head, whilst claiming Himself 
to be the Son of God and the return of Jesus Christ.  They further 
accused Him of harboring designs inimical to the interests of the 
state, of meditating a rebellion against the &amp;Sultan, of having already 
hoisted the banner of &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha, the ensign of revolt, in 
distant villages in Palestine and Syria, of having raised surreptitiously 
an army of thirty thousand men, of being engaged in the construction 
of a fortress and a vast ammunition depot on Mt. Carmel, of 
having secured the moral and material support of a host of English 
and American friends, amongst whom were officers of foreign powers, 
who were arriving, in large numbers and in disguise, to pay Him 
their homage, and of having already, in conjunction with them, 
drawn up His plans for the subjugation of the neighboring provinces, 
for the expulsion of the ruling authorities, and for the ultimate 
seizure of the power wielded by the &amp;Sultan himself.  Through misrepresentation 
and bribery they succeeded in inducing certain people 
to affix their signatures as witnesses to the documents which they had 
drawn up, and which they despatched, through their agents, to the 
Sublime Porte.  
     Such grave accusations, embodied in numerous reports, could 
not fail to perturb profoundly the mind of a despot already obsessed 
by the fear of impending rebellion among his subjects.  A commission 
was accordingly appointed to inquire into the matter, and report 
the result of its investigations.  Each of the charges brought against 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, when summoned to the court, on several occasions, 
He carefully and fearlessly refuted.  He exposed the absurdity of 
these accusations, acquainted the members of the Commission, in 
support of His argument, with the provisions of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Testament, 
expressed His readiness to submit to any sentence the court 
might decide to pass upon Him, and eloquently affirmed that if they 
should chain Him, drag Him through the streets, execrate and ridicule 
Him, stone and spit upon Him, suspend Him in the public 
square, and riddle Him with bullets, He would regard it as a signal 
honor, inasmuch as He would thereby be following in the footsteps, 
and sharing the sufferings, of His beloved Leader, the &amp;Bab.  
 
+P267 
     The gravity of the situation confronting &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; the rumors 
that were being set afloat by a population that anticipated 
the gravest developments; the hints and allusions to the dangers threatening 
Him contained in newspapers published in Egypt and Syria; 
the aggressive attitude which His enemies increasingly assumed; the 
provocative behavior of some of the inhabitants of &amp;Akka and Haifa 
who had been emboldened by the predictions and fabrications of these 
enemies regarding the fate awaiting a suspected community and its 
Leader, led Him to reduce the number of pilgrims, and even to suspend, 
for a time, their visits, and to issue special instructions that His 
mail be handled through an agent in Egypt rather than in Haifa; 
for a time He ordered that it should be held there pending further 
advice from Him.  He, moreover, directed the believers, as well as 
His own secretaries, to collect and remove to a place of safety all the 
&amp;Baha'i writings in their possession, and, urging them to transfer 
their residence to Egypt, went so far as to forbid their gathering, as 
was their wont, in His house.  Even His numerous friends and admirers 
refrained, during the most turbulent days of this period, from 
calling upon Him, for fear of being implicated and of incurring the 
suspicion of the authorities.  On certain days and nights, when the 
outlook was at its darkest, the house in which He was living, and 
which had for many years been a focus of activity, was completely 
deserted.  Spies, secretly and openly, kept watch around it, observing 
His every movement and restricting the freedom of His family.  
     The construction of the &amp;Bab's sepulcher, whose foundation-stone 
had been laid by Him on the site blessed and selected by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
He, however, refused to suspend, or even interrupt, for however brief 
a period.  Nor would He allow any obstacle, however formidable, to 
interfere with the daily flow of Tablets which poured forth, with 
prodigious rapidity and ever increasing volume, from His indefatigable 
pen, in answer to the vast number of letters, reports, inquiries, 
prayers, confessions of faith, apologies and eulogies received from 
countless followers and admirers in both the East and the West.  
Eye-witnesses have testified that, during that agitated and perilous 
period of His life, they had known Him to pen, with His own Hand, 
no less than ninety Tablets in a single day, and to pass many a night, 
from dusk to dawn, alone in His bed-chamber engaged in a correspondence 
which the pressure of His manifold responsibilities had 
prevented Him from attending to in the day-time.  
     It was during these troublous times, the most dramatic period of 
His ministry, when, in the hey-day of His life and in the full tide of 
 
+P268 
His power, He, with inexhaustible energy, marvelous serenity and 
unshakable confidence, initiated and resistlessly prosecuted the varied 
enterprises associated with that ministry.  It was during these times 
that the plan of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world was 
conceived by Him, and its construction undertaken by His followers 
in the city of &amp;Ishqabad in &amp;Turkistan.  It was during these times, 
despite the disturbances that agitated His native country, that instructions 
were issued by Him for the restoration of the holy and 
historic House of the &amp;Bab in &amp;Shiraz.  It was during these times that 
the initial measures, chiefly through His constant encouragement, 
were taken which paved the way for the laying of the dedication 
stone, which He, in later years, placed with His own hands when 
visiting the site of the Mother Temple of the West on the shore of 
Lake Michigan.  It was at this juncture that that celebrated compilation 
of His table talks, published under the title "Some Answered Questions," 
was made, talks given during the brief time He was able to 
spare, in the course of which certain fundamental aspects of His 
Father's Faith were elucidated, traditional and rational proofs of its 
validity adduced, and a great variety of subjects regarding the Christian 
Dispensation, the Prophets of God, Biblical prophecies, the origin 
and condition of man and other kindred themes authoritatively 
explained.  
     It was during the darkest hours of this period that, in a communication 
addressed to the &amp;Bab's cousin, the venerable &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Taqi, 
the chief builder of the Temple of &amp;Ishqabad, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
in stirring terms, proclaimed the immeasurable greatness of the 
Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, sounded the warnings foreshadowing the 
turmoil which its enemies, both far and near, would let loose upon 
the world, and prophesied, in moving language, the ascendancy 
which the torchbearers of the Covenant would ultimately achieve 
over them.  It was at an hour of grave suspense, during that same period, 
that He penned His Will and Testament, that immortal Document 
wherein He delineated the features of the Administrative Order 
which would arise after His passing, and would herald the establishment 
of that World Order, the advent of which the &amp;Bab had announced, 
and the laws and principles of which &amp;Baha'u'llah had already 
formulated.  It was in the course of these tumultuous years that, 
through the instrumentality of the heralds and champions of a firmly 
instituted Covenant, He reared the embryonic institutions, administrative, 
spiritual, and educational, of a steadily expanding Faith in 
Persia, the cradle of that Faith, in the Great Republic of the West, 
 
+P269 
the cradle of its Administrative Order, in the Dominion of Canada, 
in France, in England, in Germany, in Egypt, in &amp;Iraq, in Russia, in 
India, in Burma, in Japan, and even in the remote Pacific Islands.  
It was during these stirring times that a tremendous impetus was lent 
by Him to the translation, the publication and dissemination of 
&amp;Baha'i literature, whose scope now included a variety of books and 
treatises, written in the Persian, the Arabic, the English, the Turkish, 
the French, the German, the Russian and Burmese languages.  At His 
table, in those days, whenever there was a lull in the storm raging 
about Him, there would gather pilgrims, friends and inquirers from 
most of the afore-mentioned countries, representative of the Christian, 
the Muslim, the Jewish, the Zoroastrian, the Hindu and Buddhist 
Faiths.  To the needy thronging His doors and filling the courtyard 
of His house every Friday morning, in spite of the perils that 
environed Him, He would distribute alms with His own hands, with 
a regularity and generosity that won Him the title of "Father of the 
Poor."  Nothing in those tempestuous days could shake His confidence, 
nothing would be allowed to interfere with His ministrations to the 
destitute, the orphan, the sick, and the down-trodden, nothing could 
prevent Him from calling in person upon those who were either incapacitated 
or ashamed to solicit His aid.  Adamant in His determination 
to follow the example of both the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah, nothing 
would induce Him to flee from His enemies, or escape from imprisonment, 
neither the advice tendered Him by the leading members of the 
exiled community in &amp;Akka, nor the insistent pleas of the Spanish 
Consul--a kinsman of the agent of an Italian steamship company--
who, in his love for &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and his anxiety to avert the threatening 
danger, had gone so far as to place at His disposal an Italian 
freighter, ready to provide Him a safe passage to any foreign port He 
might name.  
     So imperturbable was &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's equanimity that, while rumors 
were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, 
or exiled to &amp;Fizan in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to 
the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was 
to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose 
fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful 
gardener, &amp;Isma'il &amp;Aqa, pluck and present to those same friends and 
enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him.  
     In the early part of the winter of 1907 another Commission of 
four officers, headed by &amp;Arif Bey, and invested with plenary powers, 
was suddenly dispatched to &amp;Akka by order of the &amp;Sultan.  A few days 
 
+P270 
before its arrival &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had a dream, which He recounted to 
the believers, in which He saw a ship cast anchor off &amp;Akka, from 
which flew a few birds, resembling sticks of dynamite, and which, 
circling about His head, as He stood in the midst of a multitude of the 
frightened inhabitants of the city, returned without exploding to the 
ship.  
     No sooner had the members of the Commission landed than they 
placed under their direct and exclusive control both the Telegraph 
and Postal services in &amp;Akka; arbitrarily dismissed officials suspected 
of being friendly to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, including the governor of the city; 
established direct and secret contact with the government in Constantinople; 
took up their residence in the home of the neighbors and 
intimate associates of the Covenant-breakers; set guards over the 
house of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to prevent any one from seeing Him; and 
started the strange procedure of calling up as witnesses the very 
people, among whom were Christians and Moslems, orientals and 
westerners, who had previously signed the documents forwarded to 
Constantinople, and which they had brought with them for the purpose 
of their investigations.  
     The activities of the Covenant-breakers, and particularly of 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, now jubilant and full of hope, rose in this 
hour of extreme crisis, to the highest pitch.  Visits, interviews and 
entertainments multiplied, in an atmosphere of fervid expectation, 
now that the victory was seen to be at hand.  Not a few among the 
lower elements of the population were led to believe that their acquisition 
of the property which would be left behind by the deported 
exiles was imminent.  Insults and calumnies markedly increased.  
Even some of the poor, so long and so bountifully succored by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, forsook Him for fear of reprisals.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, while the members of the Commission were carrying 
on their so-called investigations, and throughout their stay of about 
one month in &amp;Akka, consistently refused to meet or have any dealings 
with any of them, in spite of the veiled threats and warnings 
conveyed by them to Him through a messenger, an attitude which 
greatly surprised them and served to inflame their animosity and 
reinforce their determination to execute their evil designs.  Though 
the perils and tribulations which had encompassed Him were now at 
their thickest, though the ship on which He was supposed to embark 
with the members of the Commission was waiting in readiness, at 
times in &amp;Akka, at times in Haifa, and the wildest rumors were being 
spread about Him, the serenity He had invariably maintained, ever 
 
+P271 
since His incarceration had been reimposed, remained unclouded, and 
His confidence unshaken.  "The meaning of the dream I dreamt," 
He, at that time, told the believers who still remained in &amp;Akka, "is 
now clear and evident.  Please God this dynamite will not explode."  
     Meanwhile the members of the Commission had, on a certain 
Friday, gone to Haifa and inspected the &amp;Bab's sepulcher, the construction 
of which had been proceeding without any interruption on Mt. 
Carmel.  Impressed by its solidity and dimensions, they had inquired 
of one of the attendants as to the number of vaults that had been 
built beneath that massive structure.  
     Shortly after the inspection had been made it was suddenly observed, 
one day at about sunset, that the ship, which had been lying 
off Haifa, had weighed anchor, and was heading towards &amp;Akka.  The 
news spread rapidly among an excited population that the members 
of the Commission had embarked upon it.  It was anticipated that it 
would stop long enough at &amp;Akka to take &amp;Abdu'l-Baha on board, and 
then proceed to its destination.  Consternation and anguish seized the 
members of His family when informed of the approach of the ship.  
The few believers who were left wept with grief at their impending 
separation from their Master.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha could be seen, at that 
tragic hour, pacing, alone and silent, the courtyard of His house.  
     As dusk fell, however, it was suddenly noticed that the lights of 
the ship had swung round, and the vessel had changed her course.  It 
now became evident that she was sailing direct for Constantinople.  
The intelligence was instantly communicated to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Who, 
in the gathering darkness, was still pacing His courtyard.  Some of the 
believers who had posted themselves at different points to watch the 
progress of the ship hurried to confirm the joyful tidings.  One of the 
direst perils that had ever threatened &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's precious life was, 
on that historic day, suddenly, providentially and definitely averted.  
     Soon after the precipitate and wholly unexpected sailing of that 
ship news was received that a bomb had exploded in the path of the 
&amp;Sultan while he was returning to his palace from the mosque where he 
had been offering his Friday prayers.  
     A few days after this attempt on his life the Commission submitted 
its report to him; but he and his government were too preoccupied 
to consider the matter.  The case was laid aside, and when, 
some months later, it was again brought forward it was abruptly 
closed forever by an event which, once and for all, placed the Prisoner 
of &amp;Akka beyond the power of His royal enemy.  The "Young 
Turk" Revolution, breaking out swiftly and decisively in 1908, forced 
 
+P272 
a reluctant despot to promulgate the constitution which he had suspended, 
and to release all religious and political prisoners held under 
the old &amp;regime.  Even then a telegram had to be sent to Constantinople 
to inquire specifically whether &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was included in the 
category of these prisoners, to which an affirmative reply was promptly 
received.  
     Within a few months, in 1909, the Young Turks obtained from 
the &amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam the condemnation of the &amp;Sultan himself who, as a 
result of further attempts to overthrow the constitution, was finally 
and ignominiously deposed, deported and made a prisoner of state.  
On one single day of that same year there were executed no less than 
thirty-one leading ministers, &amp;pashas and officials, among whom were 
numbered notorious enemies of the Faith.  Tripolitania itself, the 
scene of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's intended exile was subsequently wrested from 
the Turks by Italy.  Thus ended the reign of the "Great Assassin," 
"the most mean, cunning, untrustworthy and cruel intriguer of the 
long dynasty of &amp;Uthman," a reign "more disastrous in its immediate 
losses of territory and in the certainty of others to follow, and more 
conspicuous for the deterioration of the condition of his subjects, 
than that of any other of his twenty-three degenerate predecessors 
since the death of &amp;Sulayman the Magnificent."  
 
+P273 
                                CHAPTER XVIII 
                Entombment of the &amp;Bab's Remains on Mt. Carmel 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's unexpected and dramatic release from His forty-year 
confinement dealt a blow to the ambitions cherished by the 
Covenant-breakers as devastating as that which, a decade before, had 
shattered their hopes of undermining His authority and of ousting 
Him from His God-given position.  Now, on the very morrow of His 
triumphant liberation a third blow befell them as stunning as those 
which preceded it and hardly less spectacular than they.  Within a 
few months of the historic decree which set Him free, in the very 
year that witnessed the downfall of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, that 
same power from on high which had enabled &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to preserve 
inviolate the rights divinely conferred on Him, to establish His 
Father's Faith in the North American continent, and to triumph over 
His royal oppressor, enabled Him to achieve one of the most signal 
acts of His ministry:  the removal of the &amp;Bab's remains from their 
place of concealment in &amp;Tihran to Mt. Carmel.  He Himself testified, 
on more than one occasion, that the safe transfer of these remains, 
the construction of a befitting mausoleum to receive them, and their 
final interment with His own hands in their permanent resting-place 
constituted one of the three principal objectives which, ever since the 
inception of His mission, He had conceived it His paramount duty 
to achieve.  This act indeed deserves to rank as one of the outstanding 
events in the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
     As observed in a previous chapter the mangled bodies of the 
&amp;Bab and His fellow-martyr, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, were removed, 
in the middle of the second night following their execution, through 
the pious intervention of &amp;Haji &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan, from the edge of the 
moat where they had been cast to a silk factory owned by one of the 
believers of &amp;Milan, and were laid the next day in a wooden casket, 
and thence carried to a place of safety.  Subsequently, according to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's instructions, they were transported to &amp;Tihran and placed 
in the shrine of &amp;Imam-Zadih &amp;Hasan.  They were later removed to the 
residence of &amp;Haji &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan himself in the &amp;Sar-Chashmih 
quarter of the city, and from his house were taken to the shrine of 
&amp;Imam-Zadih &amp;Ma'sum, where they remained concealed until the year 
 
+P274 
1284 A.H. (1867-1868), when a Tablet, revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
Adrianople, directed &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar-i-Shahmirzadi and &amp;Jamal-i-Burujirdi 
to transfer them without delay to some other spot, an 
instruction which, in view of the subsequent reconstruction of that 
shrine, proved to have been providential.  
     Unable to find a suitable place in the suburb of &amp;Shah &amp;Abdu'l-'Azim, 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar and his companion continued their search 
until, on the road leading to &amp;Chashmih-'Ali, they came upon the 
abandoned and dilapidated &amp;Masjid-i-Masha'u'llah, where they deposited, 
within one of its walls, after dark, their precious burden, 
having first re-wrapt the remains in a silken shroud brought by them 
for that purpose.  Finding the next day to their consternation that 
the hiding-place had been discovered, they clandestinely carried the 
casket through the gate of the capital direct to the house of &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Hasan-i-Vazir, a believer and son-in-law of &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza Siyyid 
&amp;Aliy-i-Tafrishi, the &amp;Majdu'l-Ashraf, where it remained for no less than 
fourteen months.  The long-guarded secret of its whereabouts becoming 
known to the believers, they began to visit the house in such 
numbers that a communication had to be addressed by &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar 
to &amp;Baha'u'llah, begging for guidance in the matter.  &amp;Haji &amp;Shah 
&amp;Muhammad-i-Manshadi, surnamed &amp;Aminu'l-Bayan, was accordingly 
commissioned to receive the Trust from him, and bidden to exercise 
the utmost secrecy as to its disposal.  
     Assisted by another believer, &amp;Haji &amp;Shah &amp;Muhammad buried the 
casket beneath the floor of the inner sanctuary of the shrine of &amp;Imam-Zadih 
Zayd, where it lay undetected until &amp;Mirza &amp;Asadu'llah-i-Isfahani 
was informed of its exact location through a chart forwarded 
to him by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Instructed by &amp;Baha'u'llah to conceal it elsewhere, 
he first removed the remains to his own house in &amp;Tihran, after 
which they were deposited in several other localities such as the house 
of &amp;Husayn-'Aliy-i-Isfahani and that of &amp;Muhammad-Karim-i-'Attar, 
where they remained hidden until the year 1316 (1899) A.H., when, 
in pursuance of directions issued by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, this same &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Asadu'llah, together with a number of other believers, transported 
them by way of &amp;Isfahan, &amp;Kirmanshah, &amp;Baghdad and Damascus, to 
Beirut and thence by sea to &amp;Akka, arriving at their destination on 
the 19th of the month of &amp;Ramadan 1316 A.H. (January 31, 1899), 
fifty lunar years after the &amp;Bab's execution in &amp;Tabriz.  
     In the same year that this precious Trust reached the shores of 
the Holy Land and was delivered into the hands of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, He, 
accompanied by Dr. &amp;Ibrahim &amp;Khayru'llah, whom He had already 
 
+P275 
honored with the titles of "&amp;Baha's Peter," "The Second Columbus" 
and "Conqueror of America," drove to the recently purchased site 
which had been blessed and selected by &amp;Baha'u'llah on Mt. Carmel, 
and there laid, with His own hands, the foundation-stone of the 
edifice, the construction of which He, a few months later, was to 
commence.  About that same time, the marble sarcophagus, designed 
to receive the body of the &amp;Bab, an offering of love from the &amp;Baha'is of 
Rangoon, had, at &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's suggestion, been completed and 
shipped to Haifa.  
     No need to dwell on the manifold problems and preoccupations 
which, for almost a decade, continued to beset &amp;Abdu'l-Baha until the 
victorious hour when He was able to bring to a final consummation 
the historic task entrusted to Him by His Father.  The risks and 
perils with which &amp;Baha'u'llah and later His Son had been confronted 
in their efforts to insure, during half a century, the protection of those 
remains were but a prelude to the grave dangers which, at a later 
period, the Center of the Covenant Himself had to face in the course 
of the construction of the edifice designed to receive them, and indeed 
until the hour of His final release from His incarceration.  
     The long-drawn out negotiations with the shrewd and calculating 
owner of the building-site of the holy Edifice, who, under the influence 
of the Covenant-breakers, refused for a long time to sell; the exorbitant 
price at first demanded for the opening of a road leading to that 
site and indispensable to the work of construction; the interminable 
objections raised by officials, high and low, whose easily aroused suspicions 
had to be allayed by repeated explanations and assurances 
given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself; the dangerous situation created by 
the monstrous accusations brought by &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali and his 
associates regarding the character and purpose of that building; the 
delays and complications caused by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's prolonged and 
enforced absence from Haifa, and His consequent inability to supervise 
in person the vast undertaking He had initiated--all these were 
among the principal obstacles which He, at so critical a period in His 
ministry, had to face and surmount ere He could execute in its entirety 
the Plan, the outline of which &amp;Baha'u'llah had communicated to Him 
on the occasion of one of His visits to Mt. Carmel.  
     "Every stone of that building, every stone of the road leading to 
it," He, many a time was heard to remark, "I have with infinite tears 
and at tremendous cost, raised and placed in position."  "One night," 
He, according to an eye-witness, once observed, "I was so hemmed 
in by My anxieties that I had no other recourse than to recite and 
 
+P276 
repeat over and over again a prayer of the &amp;Bab which I had in My 
possession, the recital of which greatly calmed Me.  The next morning 
the owner of the plot himself came to Me, apologized and begged Me 
to purchase his property."  
     Finally, in the very year His royal adversary lost his throne, and 
at the time of the opening of the first American &amp;Baha'i Convention, 
convened in Chicago for the purpose of creating a permanent national 
organization for the construction of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
brought His undertaking to a successful conclusion, in spite of 
the incessant machinations of enemies both within and without.  On 
the 28th of the month of &amp;Safar 1327 A.H., the day of the first &amp;Naw-Ruz 
(1909), which He celebrated after His release from His confinement, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha had the marble sarcophagus transported with 
great labor to the vault prepared for it, and in the evening, by the 
light of a single lamp, He laid within it, with His own hands--in the 
presence of believers from the East and from the West and in circumstances 
at once solemn and moving--the wooden casket containing 
the sacred remains of the &amp;Bab and His companion.  
     When all was finished, and the earthly remains of the Martyr-Prophet 
of &amp;Shiraz were, at long last, safely deposited for their everlasting 
rest in the bosom of God's holy mountain, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Who 
had cast aside His turban, removed His shoes and thrown off His 
cloak, bent low over the still open sarcophagus, His silver hair waving 
about His head and His face transfigured and luminous, rested His 
forehead on the border of the wooden casket, and, sobbing aloud, wept 
with such a weeping that all those who were present wept with Him.  
That night He could not sleep, so overwhelmed was He with emotion.  
     "The most joyful tidings is this," He wrote later in a Tablet 
announcing to His followers the news of this glorious victory, "that 
the holy, the luminous body of the &amp;Bab ... after having for sixty years 
been transferred from place to place, by reason of the ascendancy of 
the enemy, and from fear of the malevolent, and having known neither 
rest nor tranquillity has, through the mercy of the &amp;Abha Beauty, been 
ceremoniously deposited, on the day of &amp;Naw-Ruz, within the sacred 
casket, in the exalted Shrine on Mt. Carmel...  By a strange coincidence, 
on that same day of &amp;Naw-Ruz, a cablegram was received from 
Chicago, announcing that the believers in each of the American centers 
had elected a delegate and sent to that city ... and definitely decided 
on the site and construction of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar."  
     With the transference of the remains of the &amp;Bab--Whose advent 
marks the return of the Prophet Elijah--to Mt. Carmel, and their 
 
+P277 
interment in that holy mountain, not far from the cave of that 
Prophet Himself, the Plan so gloriously envisaged by &amp;Baha'u'llah, in 
the evening of His life, had been at last executed, and the arduous 
labors associated with the early and tumultuous years of the ministry 
of the appointed Center of His Covenant crowned with immortal 
success.  A focal center of Divine illumination and power, the very 
dust of which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha averred had inspired Him, yielding in 
sacredness to no other shrine throughout the &amp;Baha'i world except the 
Sepulcher of the Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation Himself, had been 
permanently established on that mountain, regarded from time immemorial 
as sacred.  A structure, at once massive, simple and imposing; 
nestling in the heart of Carmel, the "Vineyard of God"; flanked by 
the Cave of Elijah on the west, and by the hills of Galilee on the east; 
backed by the plain of Sharon, and facing the silver-city of &amp;Akka, 
and beyond it the Most Holy Tomb, the Heart and Qiblih of the 
&amp;Baha'i world; overshadowing the colony of German Templars who, 
in anticipation of the "coming of the Lord," had forsaken their homes 
and foregathered at the foot of that mountain, in the very year of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Declaration in &amp;Baghdad (1863), the mausoleum of the 
&amp;Bab had now, with heroic effort and in impregnable strength been 
established as "the Spot round which the Concourse on high circle in 
adoration."  Events have already demonstrated through the extension 
of the Edifice itself, through the embellishment of its surroundings, 
through the acquisition of extensive endowments in its neighborhood, 
and through its proximity to the resting-places of the wife, the son 
and daughter of &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, that it was destined to acquire 
with the passing of the years a measure of fame and glory commensurate 
with the high purpose that had prompted its founding.  
Nor will it, as the years go by, and the institutions revolving around 
the World Administrative Center of the future &amp;Baha'i Commonwealth 
are gradually established, cease to manifest the latent potentialities 
with which that same immutable purpose has endowed it.  
Resistlessly will this Divine institution flourish and expand, however 
fierce the animosity which its future enemies may evince, until the 
full measure of its splendor will have been disclosed before the eyes 
of all mankind.  
     "Haste thee, O Carmel!" &amp;Baha'u'llah, significantly addressing that 
holy mountain, has written, "for lo, the light of the Countenance of 
God ... hath been lifted upon thee...  Rejoice, for God hath, in 
this Day, established upon thee His throne, hath made thee the 
dawning-place of His signs and the dayspring of the evidences of His 
 
+P278 
Revelation.  Well is it with him that circleth around thee, that proclaimeth 
the revelation of thy glory, and recounteth that which the 
bounty of the Lord thy God hath showered upon thee."  "Call out to 
Zion, O Carmel!" He, furthermore, has revealed in that same Tablet, 
"and announce the joyful tidings:  He that was hidden from mortal 
eyes is come!  His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing 
splendor is revealed.  Beware lest thou hesitate or halt.  
Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that hath descended 
from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled in 
adoration the favored of God, the pure in heart, and the company of 
the most exalted angels."  
 
+P279 
                                 CHAPTER XIX 
                &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Travels in Europe and America 
 
     The establishment of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the Western 
Hemisphere--the most outstanding achievement that will forever 
be associated with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry--had, as observed in the 
preceding pages, set in motion such tremendous forces, and been 
productive of such far-reaching results, as to warrant the active and 
personal participation of the Center of the Covenant Himself in those 
epoch-making activities which His Western disciples had, through 
the propelling power of that Covenant, boldly initiated and were 
vigorously prosecuting.  
     The crisis which the blindness and perversity of the Covenant-breakers 
had precipitated, and which, for several years, had so 
tragically interfered with the execution of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's purpose, 
was now providentially resolved.  An unsurmountable barrier had 
been suddenly lifted from His path, His fetters were unlocked, and 
God's avenging wrath had taken the chains from His neck and 
placed them upon that of &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, His royal adversary and 
the dupe of His most implacable enemy.  The sacred remains of the 
&amp;Bab, entrusted to His hands by His departed Father, had, moreover, 
with immense difficulty been transferred from their hiding-place in 
far-off &amp;Tihran to the Holy Land, and deposited ceremoniously and 
reverently by Him in the bosom of Mt. Carmel.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was at this time broken in health.  He suffered from 
several maladies brought on by the strains and stresses of a tragic 
life spent almost wholly in exile and imprisonment.  He was on the 
threshold of three-score years and ten.  Yet as soon as He was released 
from His forty-year long captivity, as soon as He had laid the &amp;Bab's 
body in a safe and permanent resting-place, and His mind was free 
of grievous anxieties connected with the execution of that priceless 
Trust, He arose with sublime courage, confidence and resolution to 
consecrate what little strength remained to Him, in the evening of 
His life, to a service of such heroic proportions that no parallel to it 
is to be found in the annals of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
     Indeed His three years of travel, first to Egypt, then to Europe 
and later to America, mark, if we would correctly appraise their 
historic importance, a turning point of the utmost significance in 
 
+P280 
the history of the century.  For the first time since the inception of 
the Faith, sixty-six years previously, its Head and supreme Representative 
burst asunder the shackles which had throughout the ministries 
of both the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah so grievously fettered its 
freedom.  Though repressive measures still continued to circumscribe 
the activities of the vast majority of its adherents in the land of its 
birth, its recognized Leader was now vouchsafed a freedom of action 
which, with the exception of a brief interval in the course of the War 
of 1914-18, He was to continue to enjoy to the end of His life, 
and which has never since been withdrawn from its institutions at 
its world center.  
     So momentous a change in the fortunes of the Faith was the 
signal for such an outburst of activity on His part as to dumbfound 
His followers in East and West with admiration and wonder, and 
exercise an imperishable influence on the course of its future history.  
He Who, in His own words, had entered prison as a youth and left it 
an old man, Who never in His life had faced a public audience, had 
attended no school, had never moved in Western circles, and was 
unfamiliar with Western customs and language, had arisen not only 
to proclaim from pulpit and platform, in some of the chief capitals 
of Europe and in the leading cities of the North American continent, 
the distinctive verities enshrined in His Father's Faith, but to demonstrate 
as well the Divine origin of the Prophets gone before Him, and 
to disclose the nature of the tie binding them to that Faith.  
     Inflexibly resolved to undertake this arduous voyage, at whatever 
cost to His strength, at whatever risk to His life, He, quietly and 
without any previous warning, on a September afternoon, of the 
year 1910, the year following that which witnessed the downfall of 
&amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid and the formal entombment of the &amp;Bab's 
remains on Mt. Carmel, sailed for Egypt, sojourned for about a 
month in Port Said, and from thence embarked with the intention 
of proceeding to Europe, only to discover that the condition of His 
health necessitated His landing again at Alexandria and postponing 
His voyage.  Fixing His residence in Ramleh, a suburb of Alexandria, 
and later visiting &amp;Zaytun and Cairo, He, on August 11 of the ensuing 
year, sailed with a party of four, on the S.S. Corsica, for Marseilles, 
and proceeded, after a brief stop at Thonon-les-Bains, to London, 
where He arrived on September 4, 1911.  After a visit of about a 
month, He went to Paris, where He stayed for a period of nine weeks, 
returning to Egypt in December, 1911.  Again taking up His residence 
in Ramleh, where He passed the winter, He embarked, on 
 
+P281 
His second journey to the West, on the steamship Cedric, on 
March 25, 1912, sailing via Naples direct to New York where He 
arrived on April 11.  After a prolonged tour of eight months' duration, 
which carried Him from coast to coast, and in the course of 
which He visited Washington, Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, 
Montclair, Boston, Worcester, Brooklyn, Fanwood, Milford, Philadelphia, 
West Englewood, Jersey City, Cambridge, Medford, Morristown, 
Dublin, Green Acre, Montreal, Malden, Buffalo, Kenosha, 
Minneapolis, St. Paul, Omaha, Lincoln, Denver, Glenwood Springs, 
Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Oakland, Palo Alto, Berkeley, Pasadena, 
Los Angeles, Sacramento, Cincinnati, and Baltimore, He sailed, 
on the S.S. Celtic, on December 5, from New York for Liverpool; 
and landing there He proceeded by train to London.  Later He 
visited Oxford, Edinburgh and Bristol, and thence returning to 
London, left for Paris on January 21, 1913.  On March 30 He 
traveled to Stuttgart, and from there proceeded, on April 9, to Budapest, 
visited Vienna nine days later, returned to Stuttgart on April 25, 
and to Paris on May first, where He remained until June 12, sailing 
the following day, on the S.S. Himalaya from Marseilles bound for 
Egypt, arriving in Port Said four days later, where after short visits 
to &amp;Isma'iliyyih and &amp;Abuqir, and a prolonged stay in Ramleh, He 
returned to Haifa, concluding His historic journeys on December 
5, 1913.  
     It was in the course of these epoch-making journeys and before 
large and representative audiences, at times exceeding a thousand 
people, that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha expounded, with brilliant simplicity, with 
persuasiveness and force, and for the first time in His ministry, those 
basic and distinguishing principles of His Father's Faith, which together 
with the laws and ordinances revealed in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas 
constitute the bed-rock of God's latest Revelation to mankind.  The 
independent search after truth, unfettered by superstition or tradition; 
the oneness of the entire human race, the pivotal principle and 
fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; 
the condemnation of all forms of prejudice, whether religious, racial, 
class or national; the harmony which must exist between religion and 
science; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which 
the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory 
education; the adoption of a universal auxiliary language; 
the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution 
of a world tribunal for the adjudication of disputes between nations; 
the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank 
 
+P282 
of worship; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in 
human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all 
peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and universal 
peace as the supreme goal of all mankind--these stand out as 
the essential elements of that Divine polity which He proclaimed to 
leaders of public thought as well as to the masses at large in the course 
of these missionary journeys.  The exposition of these vitalizing truths 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, which He characterized as the "spirit of 
the age," He supplemented with grave and reiterated warnings of an 
impending conflagration which, if the statesmen of the world should 
fail to avert, would set ablaze the entire continent of Europe.  He, 
moreover, predicted, in the course of these travels, the radical changes 
which would take place in that continent, foreshadowed the movement 
of the decentralization of political power which would inevitably 
be set in motion, alluded to the troubles that would overtake 
Turkey, anticipated the persecution of the Jews on the European 
continent, and categorically asserted that the "banner of the unity of 
mankind would be hoisted, that the tabernacle of universal peace 
would be raised and the world become another world."  
     During these travels &amp;Abdu'l-Baha displayed a vitality, a courage, 
a single-mindedness, a consecration to the task He had set Himself to 
achieve that excited the wonder and admiration of those who had the 
privilege of observing at close hand His daily acts.  Indifferent to the 
sights and curiosities which habitually invite the attention of travelers 
and which the members of His entourage often wished Him to visit; 
careless alike of His comfort and His health; expending every ounce 
of His energy day after day from dawn till late at night; consistently 
refusing any gifts or contributions towards the expenses of His 
travels; unfailing in His solicitude for the sick, the sorrowful and 
the down-trodden; uncompromising in His championship of the 
underprivileged races and classes; bountiful as the rain in His generosity 
to the poor; contemptuous of the attacks launched against 
Him by vigilant and fanatical exponents of orthodoxy and sectarianism; 
marvelous in His frankness while demonstrating, from 
platform and pulpit, the prophetic Mission of Jesus Christ to the 
Jews, of the Divine origin of &amp;Islam in churches and synagogues, or 
the truth of Divine Revelation and the necessity of religion to 
materialists, atheists or agnostics; unequivocal in His glorification of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah at all times and within the sanctuaries of divers sects and 
denominations; adamant in His refusal, on several occasions, to curry 
the favor of people of title and wealth both in England and in the 
 
+P283 
United States; and last but not least incomparable in the spontaneity, 
the genuineness and warmth of His sympathy and loving-kindness 
shown to friend and stranger alike, believer and unbeliever, rich 
and poor, high and low, whom He met, either intimately or casually, 
whether on board ship, or whilst pacing the streets, in parks or public 
squares, at receptions or banquets, in slums or mansions, in the 
gatherings of His followers or the assemblage of the learned, He, 
the incarnation of every &amp;Baha'i virtue and the embodiment of every 
&amp;Baha'i ideal, continued for three crowded years to trumpet to a world 
sunk in materialism and already in the shadow of war, the healing, the 
God-given truths enshrined in His Father's Revelation.  
     In the course of His several visits to Egypt He had more than 
one interview with the Khedive, &amp;Abbas &amp;Hilmi &amp;Pasha II, was introduced 
to Lord Kitchener, met the &amp;Mufti, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad &amp;Bakhit, 
as well as the Khedive's &amp;Imam, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad &amp;Rashid, and associated 
with several &amp;ulamas, &amp;pashas, Persian notables, members of the 
Turkish Parliament, editors of leading newspapers in Cairo and 
Alexandria, and other leaders and representatives of well-known 
institutions, both religious and secular.  
     Whilst He sojourned in England the house placed at His disposal 
in Cadogan Gardens became a veritable mecca to all sorts and conditions 
of men, thronging to visit the Prisoner of &amp;Akka Who had 
chosen their great city as the first scene of His labors in the West.  
"O, these pilgrims, these guests, these visitors!" thus bears witness 
His devoted hostess during the time He spent in London, "Remembering 
those days, our ears are filled with the sound of their footsteps
--as they came from every country in the world.  Every day, all day 
long, a constant stream, an interminable procession!  Ministers and 
missionaries, oriental scholars and occult students, practical men of 
affairs and mystics, Anglicans, Catholics, and Non-conformists, 
Theosophists and Hindus, Christian Scientists and doctors of medicine, 
Muslims, Buddhists and Zoroastrians.  There also called:  politicians, 
Salvation Army soldiers, and other workers for human good, 
women suffragists, journalists, writers, poets and healers, dressmakers 
and great ladies, artists and artisans, poor workless people and 
prosperous merchants, members of the dramatic and musical world, 
these all came; and none were too lowly, nor too great, to receive the 
sympathetic consideration of this holy Messenger, Who was ever 
giving His life for others' good."  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's first public appearance before a western audience 
significantly enough took place in a Christian house of worship, when, 
 
+P284 
on September 10, 1911, He addressed an overflowing congregation 
from the pulpit of the City Temple.  Introduced by the Pastor, the 
Reverend R. J. Campbell, He, in simple and moving language, and 
with vibrant voice, proclaimed the unity of God, affirmed the fundamental 
oneness of religion, and announced that the hour of the unity 
of the sons of men, of all races, religions and classes had struck.  On 
another occasion, on September 17, at the request of the Venerable 
Archdeacon Wilberforce, He addressed the congregation of St. John 
the Divine, at Westminster, after evening service, choosing as His 
theme the transcendental greatness of the Godhead, as affirmed and 
elucidated by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan.  "The Archdeacon," 
wrote a contemporary of that event, "had the Bishop's chair placed 
for his Guest on the chancel steps, and, standing beside Him, read 
the translation of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's address himself.  The congregation 
was profoundly moved, and, following the Archdeacon's example, 
knelt to receive the blessing of the Servant of God--Who stood with 
extended arms--His wonderful voice rising and falling in the silence 
with the power of His invocation."  
     At the invitation of the Lord Mayor of London He breakfasted 
with him at the Mansion House; addressed the Theosophical Society 
at their headquarters, at the express request of their President, and 
also a Meeting of the Higher Thought center in London; was invited 
by a deputation from the Bramo-Somaj Society to deliver a lecture 
under their auspices; visited and delivered an address on world unity 
at the Mosque at Woking, at the invitation of the Muslim Community 
of Great Britain, and was entertained by Persian princes, 
noblemen, ex-ministers and members of the Persian Legation in London.  
He stayed as a guest in Dr. T. K. Cheyne's home in Oxford, and 
He delivered an address to "a large and deeply interested audience," 
highly academic in character, gathered at Manchester College in that 
city, and presided over by Dr. Estlin Carpenter.  He also spoke from 
the pulpit of a Congregational Church in the East End of London, 
in response to the request of its Pastor; addressed gatherings in Caxton 
Hall and Westminster Hall, the latter under the chairmanship of Sir 
Thomas Berkeley, and witnessed a performance of "Eager Heart," 
a Christmas mystery play at the Church House, Westminster, the first 
dramatic performance He had ever beheld, and which in its graphic 
depiction of the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ moved Him to 
tears.  In the Hall of the Passmore Edwards' Settlement, in Tavistock 
Place, he spoke to an audience of about four hundred and sixty 
representative people, presided over by Prof. Michael Sadler, called on 
 
+P285 
a number of working women of that Settlement, who were on holiday 
at Vanners', in Byfleet, some twenty miles out of London, and paid 
a second visit there, meeting on that occasion people of every condition 
who had specially gathered to see Him, among whom were "the 
clergy of several denominations, a headmaster of a boys' public school, 
a member of Parliament, a doctor, a famous political writer, the 
vice-chancellor of a university, several journalists, a well-known poet, 
and a magistrate from London."  "He will long be remembered," 
wrote a chronicler of His visit to England, describing that occasion, 
"as He sat in the bow window in the afternoon sunshine, His arm 
round a very ragged but very happy little boy who had come to ask 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha for sixpence for his money box and for his invalid 
mother, whilst round Him in the room were gathered men and 
women discussing Education, Socialism, the first Reform Bill, and the 
relation of submarines and wireless telegraphy to the new era on 
which man is entering."  
     Among those who called on Him during the memorable days He 
spent in England and Scotland were the Reverend Archdeacon Wilberforce, 
the Reverend R. J. Campbell, the Reverend Rhonddha 
Williams, the Reverend Roland Corbet, Lord Lamington, Sir Richard 
and Lady Stapley, Sir Michael Sadler, the &amp;Jalalu'd-Dawlih, son of the 
&amp;Zillu's-Sultan, Sir Ameer Ali, the late Maharaja of Jalawar, who paid 
Him many visits and gave an elaborate dinner and reception in His 
honor, the Maharaja of Rajputana, the Ranee of Sarawak, Princess 
Karadja, Baroness Barnekov, Lady Wemyss and her sister, Lady Glencomer, 
Lady Agnew, Miss Constance Maud, Prof. E. G. Browne, 
Prof. Patrick Geddes, Mr. Albert Dawson, editor of the Christian 
Commonwealth, Mr. David Graham Pole, Mrs. Annie Besant, Mrs. 
Pankhurst, and Mr. Stead, who had long and earnest conversations 
with Him.  "Very numerous," His hostess, describing the impression 
produced on those who were accorded by Him the privilege of a 
private audience, has written, "were these applicants for so unique an 
experience, how unique only those knew when in the presence of the 
Master, and we could partly divine, as we saw the look on their faces 
as they emerged--a look as though blended of awe, of marveling, 
and of a certain calm joy.  Sometimes we were conscious of reluctance 
in them to come forth into the outer world, as though they would 
hold fast to their beatitude, lest the return of things of earth should 
wrest it from them."  "A profound impression," the aforementioned 
chronicler has recorded, summing up the results produced by that 
memorable visit, "remained in the minds and memories of all sorts 
 
+P286 
and conditions of men and women....  Very greatly was &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
sojourn in London appreciated; very greatly His departure 
regretted.  He left behind Him many, many friends.  His love had 
kindled love.  His heart had opened to the West, and the Western 
heart had closed around this patriarchal presence from the East.  His 
words had in them something that appealed not only to their immediate 
hearers, but to men and women generally."  
     His visits to Paris, where for a time He occupied an apartment 
in the Avenue de Camoens, were marked by a warmth of welcome 
no less remarkable than the reception accorded Him by His friends 
and followers in London.  "During the Paris visit," that same devoted 
English hostess, Lady Blomfield, who had followed Him to that city, 
has testified, "as it had been in London, daily happenings took on 
the atmosphere of spiritual events....  Every morning, according to 
His custom, the Master expounded the principles of the teaching of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to those who gathered round Him, the learned and the 
unlearned, eager and respectful.  They were of all nationalities and 
creeds, from the East and from the West, including Theosophists, 
agnostics, materialists, spiritualists, Christian Scientists, social reformers, 
Hindus, Sufis, Muslims, Buddhists, Zoroastrians and many 
others."  And again:  "Interview followed interview.  Church dignitaries 
of various branches of the Christian Tree came, some earnestly 
desirous of finding new aspects of the Truth....  Others there were 
who stopped their ears, lest they should hear and understand."  
     Persian princes, noblemen and ex-ministers, among them the 
&amp;Zillu's-Sultan, the Persian Minister, the Turkish Ambassador in Paris, 
&amp;Rashid &amp;Pasha, an &amp;ex-vali of Beirut, Turkish &amp;pashas and ex-ministers, 
and Viscount Arawaka, Japanese Ambassador to the Court of Spain, 
were among those who had the privilege of attaining His presence.  
Gatherings of Esperantists and Theosophists, students of the Faculty 
of Theology and large audiences at l'Alliance Spiritualiste were addressed 
by Him; at a Mission Hall, in a very poor quarter of the city, 
He addressed a congregation at the invitation of the Pastor, whilst 
in numerous meetings of His followers those already familiar with 
His teachings were privileged to hear from His lips detailed and 
frequent expositions of certain aspects of His Father's Faith.  
     In Stuttgart, where He made a brief but never-to-be-forgotten 
stay, and to which He traveled in spite of ill-health in order to establish 
personal contact with the members of the community of His 
enthusiastic and dearly beloved German friends, He, apart from 
attending the gatherings of His devoted followers, bestowed His 
 
+P287 
abundant blessings on the members of the Youth group, gathered at 
Esslingen, and addressed, at the invitation of Professor Christale, 
President of the Esperantists of Europe, a large meeting of Esperantists 
at their club.  He, moreover, visited Bad Mergentheim, in 
&amp;Wurttemberg, where a few years later (1915) a monument was 
erected in memory of His visit by one of His grateful disciples.  "The 
humility, love and devotion of the German believers," wrote an eyewitness, 
"rejoiced the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and they received His 
blessings and His words of encouraging counsel in complete submissiveness.  
...Friends came from far and near to see the Master.  There 
was a constant flow of visitors at the Hotel Marquart.  There &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
received them with such love and graciousness that they became 
radiant with joy and happiness."  
     In Vienna, where He stayed a few days, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha addressed 
a gathering of Theosophists in that city, whilst in Budapest He 
granted an interview to the President of the University, met on a 
number of occasions the famous Orientalist Prof. Arminius Vambery, 
addressed the Theosophical Society, and was visited by the 
President of the Turanian, and representatives of the Turkish Societies, 
army officers, several members of Parliament, and a deputation 
of Young Turks, led by Prof. Julius Germanus, who accorded Him 
a hearty welcome to the city.  "During this time," is the written 
testimony of Dr. Rusztem Vambery, "His (&amp;Abdu'l-Baha) room in 
the Dunapalota Hotel became a veritable mecca for all those whom 
the mysticism of the East and the wisdom of its Master attracted into 
its magic circle.  Among His visitors were Count Albert Apponyi, 
Prelate Alexander Giesswein, Professor Ignatius Goldziher, the Orientalist 
of world-wide renown, Professor Robert A. Nadler, the famous 
Budapest painter, and leader of the Hungarian Theosophical Society."  
     It was reserved, however, for the North American continent to 
witness the most astonishing manifestation of the boundless vitality 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha exhibited in the course of these journeys.  The remarkable 
progress achieved by the organized community of His followers 
in the United States and Canada, the marked receptivity of the American 
public to His Message, as well as His consciousness of the high 
destiny awaiting the people of that continent, fully warranted the 
expenditure of time and energy which he devoted to this most important 
phase of His travels.  A visit which entailed a journey of 
over five thousand miles, which lasted from April to December, which 
carried Him from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast and back, which 
elicited discourses of such number as to fill no less than three volumes, 
 
+P288 
was to mark the climax of those journeys, and was fully justified 
by the far-reaching results which He well knew such labors on His 
part would produce.  "This long voyage," He told His assembled followers 
on the occasion of His first meeting with them in New York, 
"will prove how great is My love for you.  There were many troubles 
and vicissitudes, but in the thought of meeting you, all these things 
vanished and were forgotten."  
     The character of the acts He performed fully demonstrated the 
importance He attached to that visit.  The laying, with His own 
hands, of the dedication stone of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, by the 
shore of Lake Michigan, in the vicinity of Chicago, on the recently 
purchased property, and in the presence of a representative gathering 
of &amp;Baha'is from East and West; the dynamic affirmation by Him 
of the implications of the Covenant instituted by &amp;Baha'u'llah, following 
the reading of the newly translated Tablet of the Branch, in 
a general assembly of His followers in New York, designated henceforth 
as the "City of the Covenant"; the moving ceremony in Inglewood, 
California, marking His special pilgrimage to the grave of 
Thornton Chase, the "first American believer," and indeed the first 
to embrace the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the Western world; the 
symbolic Feast He Himself offered to a large gathering of His disciples 
assembled in the open air, and in the green setting of a June day at 
West Englewood, in New Jersey; the blessing He bestowed on the 
Open Forum at Green Acre, in Maine, on the banks of the Piscataqua 
River, where many of His followers had gathered, and which was to 
evolve into one of the first &amp;Baha'i summer schools of the Western 
Hemisphere and be recognized as one of the earliest endowments 
established in the American continent; His address to an audience 
of several hundred attending the last session of the newly-founded 
&amp;Baha'i Temple Unity held in Chicago; and, last but not least, the 
exemplary act He performed by uniting in wedlock two of His followers 
of different nationalities, one of the white, the other of the 
Negro race--these must rank among the outstanding functions associated 
with His visit to the community of the American believers, 
functions designed to pave the way for the erection of their central 
House of Worship, to fortify them against the tests they were soon 
to endure, to cement their unity, and to bless the beginnings of that 
Administrative Order which they were soon to initiate and champion.  
     No less remarkable were &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's public activities in the 
course of His association with the multitude of people with whom 
He came in contact during His tour across a continent.  A full account 
 
+P289 
of these diversified activities which crowded His days during 
no less than eight months, would be beyond the scope of this survey.  
Suffice it to say that in the city of New York alone He delivered 
public addresses in, and made formal visits to, no less than fifty-five 
different places.  Peace societies, Christian and Jewish congregations, 
colleges and universities, welfare and charitable organizations, members 
of ethical cults, New Thought centers, metaphysical groups, 
Women's clubs, scientific associations, gatherings of Esperantists, 
Theosophists, Mormons, and agnostics, institutions for the advancement 
of the colored people, representatives of the Syrian, the Armenian, 
the Greek, the Chinese, and Japanese communities--all were 
brought into contact with His dynamic presence, and were privileged 
to hear from His lips His Father's Message.  Nor was the press either 
in its editorial comment or in the publication of reports of His lectures, 
slow to appreciate the breadth of His vision or the character 
of His summons.  
     His discourse at the Peace Conferences at Lake Mohonk; His addresses 
to large gatherings at Columbia, Howard and New York 
Universities; His participation in the fourth annual conference of 
the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored 
People; His fearless assertion of the truth of the prophetic Missions 
of both Jesus Christ and &amp;Muhammad in Temple Emmanu-El, a 
Jewish synagogue in San Francisco, where no less than two thousand 
people were gathered; His illuminating discourse before an audience 
of eighteen hundred students and one hundred and eighty teachers 
and professors at Leland Stanford University; His memorable visit 
to the Bowery Mission in the slums of New York; the brilliant reception 
given in His honor in Washington, at which many outstanding 
figures in the social life of the capital were presented to Him--these 
stand out as the highlights of the unforgettable Mission He undertook 
in the service of His Father's Cause.  Secretaries of State, Ambassadors, 
Congressmen, distinguished rabbis and churchmen, and 
other people of eminence attained His presence, among whom were 
such figures as Dr. D. S. Jordan, President of Leland Stanford University, 
Prof. Jackson of Columbia University, Prof. Jack of Oxford 
University, Rabbi Stephen Wise of New York, Dr. Martin A. Meyer, 
Rabbi Joseph L. Levy, Rabbi Abram Simon, Alexander Graham Bell, 
Rabindranath Tagore, Hon. Franklin K. Lane, Mrs. William Jennings 
Bryan, Andrew Carnegie, Hon. Franklin MacVeagh, Secretary 
of the United States Treasury, Lee McClung, Mr. Roosevelt, Admiral 
Wain Wright, Admiral Peary, the British, Dutch and Swiss Ministers 
 
+P290 
in Washington, &amp;Yusuf &amp;Diya &amp;Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador in that 
city, Thomas Seaton, Hon. William Sulzer and Prince &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
of Egypt, the Khedive's brother.  
     "When &amp;Abdu'l-Baha visited this country for the first time in 
1912," a commentator on His American travels has written, "He 
found a large and sympathetic audience waiting to greet Him personally 
and to receive from His own lips His loving and spiritual message.  
...Beyond the words spoken there was something indescribable 
in His personality that impressed profoundly all who came into His 
presence.  The dome-like head, the patriarchal beard, the eyes that 
seemed to have looked beyond the reach of time and sense, the soft 
yet clearly penetrating voice, the translucent humility, the never 
failing love,--but above all, the sense of power mingled with gentleness 
that invested His whole being with a rare majesty of spiritual 
exaltation that both set Him apart, and yet that brought Him near 
to the lowliest soul,--it was all this, and much more that can never 
be defined, that have left with His many ... friends, memories that 
are ineffaceable and unspeakably precious."  
     A survey, however inadequate of the varied and immense activities 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His tour of Europe and America cannot leave 
without mention some of the strange incidents that would often 
accompany personal contact with Him.  The bold determination of 
a certain indomitable youth who, fearing &amp;Abdu'l-Baha would not be 
able to visit the Western states, and unable himself to pay for a train 
journey to New England, had traveled all the way from Minneapolis 
to Maine lying on the rods between the wheels of a train; the transformation 
effected in the life of the son of a country rector in England, 
who, in his misery and poverty, had resolved, whilst walking 
along the banks of the Thames, to put an end to his existence, and 
who, at the sight of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's photograph displayed in a shop 
window, had inquired about Him, hurried to His residence, and been 
so revived by His words of cheer and comfort as to abandon all 
thought of self-destruction; the extraordinary experience of a woman 
whose little girl, as the result of a dream she had had, insisted that 
Jesus Christ was in the world, and who, at the sight of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
picture exposed in the window of a magazine store, had instantly 
identified it as that of the Jesus Christ of her dream--an act which 
impelled her mother, after reading that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was in Paris, 
to take the next boat for Europe and hasten to attain His presence; 
the decision of the editor of a journal printed in Japan to break his 
journey to Tokyo at Constantinople, and travel to London for "the 
 
+P291 
joy of spending one evening in His presence"; the touching scene 
when &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, receiving from the hands of a Persian friend, 
recently arrived in London from &amp;Ishqabad, a cotton handkerchief 
containing a piece of dry black bread and a shrivelled apple--the 
offering of a poor &amp;Baha'i workman in that city--opened it before His 
assembled guests, and, leaving His luncheon untouched, broke pieces 
off that bread, and partaking Himself of it shared it with those who 
were present--these are but a few of a host of incidents that shed 
a revealing light on some personal aspects of His memorable journeys.  
     Nor can certain scenes revolving around that majestic and patriarchal 
Figure, as He moved through the cities of Europe and America, 
be ever effaced from memory.  The remarkable interview at which 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, while placing lovingly His hand on the head of Archdeacon 
Wilberforce, answered his many questions, whilst that distinguished 
churchman sat on a low chair by His side; the still more 
remarkable scene when that same Archdeacon, after having knelt 
with his entire congregation to receive His benediction at St. John's 
the Divine, passed down the aisle to the vestry hand in hand with 
his Guest, whilst a hymn was being sung by the entire assembly 
standing; the sight of &amp;Jalalu'd-Dawlih, fallen prostrate at His feet, 
profuse in his apologies and imploring His forgiveness for his past 
iniquities; the enthusiastic reception accorded Him at Leland Stanford 
University when, before the gaze of well nigh two thousand 
professors and students, He discoursed on some of the noblest truths 
underlying His message to the West; the touching spectacle at Bowery 
Mission when four hundred of the poor of New York filed past Him, 
each receiving a piece of silver from His blessed hands; the acclamation 
of a Syrian woman in Boston who, pushing aside the crowd that 
had gathered around Him, flung herself at His feet, exclaiming, 
"I confess that in Thee I have recognized the Spirit of God and Jesus 
Christ Himself"; the no less fervent tribute paid Him by two admiring 
Arabs who, as He was leaving that city for Dublin, N. H., cast 
themselves before Him, and, sobbing aloud, avowed that He was 
God's own Messenger to mankind; the vast congregation of two 
thousand Jews assembled in a synagogue in San Francisco, intently 
listening to His discourse as He demonstrated the validity of the 
claims advanced by both Jesus Christ and &amp;Muhammad; the gathering 
He addressed one night in Montreal, at which, in the course of His 
speech, His turban fell from His head, so carried away was He by 
the theme He was expounding; the boisterous crowd in a very poor 
quarter of Paris, who, awed by His presence, reverently and silently 
 
+P292 
made way for Him as He passed through their midst, while returning 
from a Mission Hall whose congregation He had been addressing; 
the characteristic gesture of a Zoroastrian physician who, arriving in 
breathless haste on the morning of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's departure from 
London to bid Him farewell, anointed with fragrant oil first His 
head and His breast, and then, touching the hands of all present, 
placed round His neck and shoulders a garland of rosebuds and lilies; 
the crowd of visitors arriving soon after dawn, patiently waiting on 
the doorsteps of His house in Cadogan Gardens until the door would 
be opened for their admittance; His majestic figure as He paced with 
a vigorous step the platform, or stood with hands upraised to pronounce 
the benediction, in church and synagogue alike, and before 
vast audiences of reverent listeners; the unsolicited mark of respect 
shown Him by distinguished society women in London, who would 
spontaneously curtsy when ushered into His presence; the poignant 
sight when He stooped low to the grave of His beloved disciple, 
Thornton Chase, in Inglewood Cemetery, and kissed his tombstone, 
an example which all those present hastened to follow; the distinguished 
gathering of Christians, Jews and Muslims, men and women 
and representative of both the East and the West, assembled to hear 
His discourse on world unity in the mosque at Woking--such scenes 
as these, even in the cold record of the printed page, must still have 
much of their original impressiveness and power.  
     Who knows what thoughts flooded the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as 
He found Himself the central figure of such memorable scenes as 
these?  Who knows what thoughts were uppermost in His mind as 
He sat at breakfast beside the Lord Mayor of London, or was received 
with extraordinary deference by the Khedive himself in his palace, 
or as He listened to the cries of "&amp;Allah-u-Abha" and to the hymns of 
thanksgiving and praise that would herald His approach to the 
numerous and brilliant assemblages of His enthusiastic followers and 
friends organized in so many cities of the American continent?  Who 
knows what memories stirred within Him as He stood before the 
thundering waters of Niagara, breathing the free air of a far distant 
land, or gazed, in the course of a brief and much-needed rest, upon 
the green woods and countryside in Glenwood Springs, or moved 
with a retinue of Oriental believers along the paths of the Trocadero 
gardens in Paris, or walked alone in the evening beside the majestic 
Hudson on Riverside Drive in New York, or as He paced the terrace 
of the Hotel du Parc at Thonon-les-Bains, overlooking the Lake of 
Geneva, or as He watched from Serpentine Bridge in London the 
 
+P293 
pearly chain of lights beneath the trees stretching as far as the eye 
could see?  Memories of the sorrows, the poverty, the overhanging 
doom of His earlier years; memories of His mother who sold her gold 
buttons to provide Him, His brother and His sister with sustenance, 
and who was forced, in her darkest hours, to place a handful of dry 
flour in the palm of His hand to appease His hunger; of His own 
childhood when pursued and derided by a mob of ruffians in the 
streets of &amp;Tihran; of the damp and gloomy room, formerly a morgue, 
which He occupied in the barracks of &amp;Akka and of His imprisonment 
in the dungeon of that city--memories such as these must surely 
have thronged His mind.  Thoughts, too, must have visited Him of 
the &amp;Bab's captivity in the mountain fastnesses of &amp;Adhirbayjan, when 
at night time He was refused even a lamp, and of His cruel and 
tragic execution when hundreds of bullets riddled His youthful 
breast.  Above all His thoughts must have centered on &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
Whom He loved so passionately and Whose trials He had witnessed 
and had shared from His boyhood.  The vermin-infested &amp;Siyah-Chal 
of &amp;Tihran; the bastinado inflicted upon Him in &amp;Amul; the humble 
fare which filled His &amp;kashkul while He lived for two years the life 
of a dervish in the mountains of &amp;Kurdistan; the days in &amp;Baghdad 
when He did not even possess a change of linen, and when His followers 
subsisted on a handful of dates; His confinement behind the 
prison-walls of &amp;Akka, when for nine years even the sight of verdure 
was denied Him; and the public humiliation to which He was subjected 
at government headquarters in that city--pictures from the 
tragic past such as these must have many a time overpowered Him 
with feelings of mingled gratitude and sorrow, as He witnessed the 
many marks of respect, of esteem, and honor now shown Him and 
the Faith which He represented.  "O &amp;Baha'u'llah!  What hast Thou 
done?"  He, as reported by the chronicler of His travels, was heard 
to exclaim one evening as He was being swiftly driven to fulfil His 
third engagement of the day in Washington, "O &amp;Baha'u'llah!  May 
my life be sacrificed for Thee!  O &amp;Baha'u'llah!  May my soul be 
offered up for Thy sake!  How full were Thy days with trials and 
tribulations!  How severe the ordeals Thou didst endure!  How solid 
the foundation Thou hast finally laid, and how glorious the banner 
Thou didst hoist!"  "One day, as He was strolling," that same chronicler 
has testified, "He called to remembrance the days of the Blessed 
Beauty, referring with sadness to His sojourn in &amp;Sulaymaniyyih, to 
His loneliness and to the wrongs inflicted upon Him.  Though He 
had often recounted that episode, that day He was so overcome with 
 
+P294 
emotion that He sobbed aloud in His grief....  All His attendants 
wept with Him, and were plunged into sorrow as they heard the tale 
of the woeful trials endured by the Ancient Beauty, and witnessed 
the tenderness of heart manifested by His Son."  
     A most significant scene in a century-old drama had been enacted.  
A glorious chapter in the history of the first &amp;Baha'i century had been 
written.  Seeds of undreamt-of potentialities had, with the hand of 
the Center of the Covenant Himself, been sown in some of the 
fertile fields of the Western world.  Never in the entire range of 
religious history had any Figure of comparable stature arisen to perform 
a labor of such magnitude and imperishable worth.  Forces were 
unleashed through those fateful journeys which even now, at a distance 
of well nigh thirty-five years, we are unable to measure or 
comprehend.  Already a Queen, inspired by the powerful arguments 
adduced by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the course of His addresses in support 
of the Divinity of &amp;Muhammad, has proclaimed her faith, and borne 
public testimony to the Divine origin of the Prophet of &amp;Islam.  
Already a President of the United States, imbibing some of the principles 
so clearly enunciated by Him in His discourses, has incorporated 
them in a Peace Program which stands out as the boldest and noblest 
proposal yet made for the well-being and security of mankind.  And 
already, alas! a world which proved deaf to His warnings and refused 
to heed His summons has plunged itself into two global wars of 
unprecedented severity, the repercussions of which none as yet can 
even dimly visualize.  
 
+P295 
                                  CHAPTER XX 
               Growth and Expansion of the Faith in East and West 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's historic journeys to the West, and in particular 
His eight-month tour of the United States of America, may be said 
to have marked the culmination of His ministry, a ministry whose 
untold blessings and stupendous achievements only future generations 
can adequately estimate.  As the day-star of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Revelation 
had shone forth in its meridian splendor at the hour of the proclamation 
of His Message to the rulers of the earth in the city of Adrianople, 
so did the Orb of His Covenant mount its zenith and shed its brightest 
rays when He Who was its appointed Center arose to blazon 
the glory and greatness of His Father's Faith among the peoples of 
the West.  
     That divinely instituted Covenant had, shortly after its inception, 
demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt its invincible 
strength through its decisive triumph over the dark forces which its 
Arch-Breaker had with such determination arrayed against it.  Its 
energizing power had soon after been proclaimed through the signal 
victories which its torch-bearers had so rapidly and courageously won 
in the far-off cities of Western Europe and the United States of 
America.  Its high claims had, moreover, been fully vindicated 
through its ability to safeguard the unity and integrity of the Faith 
in both the East and the West.  It had subsequently given further 
proof of its indomitable strength by the memorable victory it registered 
through the downfall of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, and the consequent 
release of its appointed Center from a forty-year captivity.  
It had provided for those still inclined to doubt its Divine origin 
yet another indisputable testimony to its solidity by enabling &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
in the face of formidable obstacles, to effect the transfer and 
the final entombment of the &amp;Bab's remains in a mausoleum on Mt. 
Carmel.  It had manifested also before all mankind, with a force and 
in a measure hitherto unapproached, its vast potentialities when it 
empowered Him in Whom its spirit and its purpose were enshrined 
to embark on a three-year-long mission to the Western world--a 
mission so momentous that it deserves to rank as the greatest exploit 
ever to be associated with His ministry.  
 
+P296 
     Nor were these, preeminent though they were, the sole fruits 
garnered through the indefatigable efforts exerted so heroically by the 
Center of that Covenant.  The progress and extension of His Father's 
Faith in the East; the initiation of activities and enterprises which 
may be said to signalize the beginnings of a future Administrative 
Order; the erection of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i 
world in the city of &amp;Ishqabad in Russian &amp;Turkistan; the expansion 
of &amp;Baha'i literature; the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan; 
and the introduction of the Faith in the Australian continent--these 
may be regarded as the outstanding achievements that have embellished 
the brilliant record of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's unique ministry.  
     In Persia, the cradle of the Faith, despite the persecutions which, 
throughout the years of that ministry, persisted with unabated violence, 
a noticeable change, marking the gradual emergence of a proscribed 
community from its hitherto underground existence, could 
be clearly discerned.  &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, four years after &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
ascension, had, on the eve of his jubilee, designed to mark a turning-point 
in the history of his country, met his death at the hands of an 
assassin, named &amp;Mirza &amp;Rida, a follower of the notorious Siyyid 
&amp;Jamalu'd-Din-i-Afghani, an enemy of the Faith and one of the originators 
of the constitutional movement which, as it gathered momentum, 
during the reign of the &amp;Shah's son and successor, &amp;Muzaffari'd-Din, 
was destined to involve in further difficulties an already hounded 
and persecuted community.  Even the &amp;Shah's assassination had at first 
been laid at the door of that community, as evidenced by the cruel 
death suffered, immediately after the murder of the sovereign, by 
the renowned teacher and poet, &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Muhammad, surnamed 
"&amp;Varqa" (Dove) by &amp;Baha'u'llah, who, together with his twelve-year-old 
son, &amp;Ruhu'llah, was inhumanly put to death in the prison of 
&amp;Tihran, by the brutal &amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih, who, after thrusting his 
dagger into the belly of the father and cutting him into pieces, before 
the eyes of his son, adjured the boy to recant, and, meeting with a 
blunt refusal, strangled him with a rope.  
     Three years previously a youth, named &amp;Muhammad-Riday-i-Yazdi, 
was shot in Yazd, on the night of his wedding while proceeding 
from the public bath to his home, the first to suffer martyrdom 
during &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry.  In &amp;Turbat-i-Haydariyyih, in consequence 
of the &amp;Shah's assassination, five persons, known as the &amp;Shuhaday-i-Khamsih 
(Five Martyrs), were put to death.  In &amp;Mashhad a 
well-known merchant, &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-i-Tabrizi, was murdered 
and his corpse set on fire.  An interview was granted by the new 
 
+P297 
sovereign and his Grand Vizir, the unprincipled and reactionary 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Asghar &amp;Khan, the &amp;Atabik-i-A'zam, to two representative 
followers of the Faith in Paris (1902), but it produced no real results 
whatever.  On the contrary, a fresh storm of persecutions broke out 
a few years later, persecutions which, as the constitutional movement 
developed in that country, grew ever fiercer as reactionaries brought 
groundless accusations against the &amp;Baha'is, and publicly denounced 
them as supporters and inspirers of the nationalist cause.  
     A certain &amp;Muhammad-Javad was stripped naked in &amp;Isfahan, and 
was severely beaten with a whip of braided wires, while in &amp;Kashan 
the adherents of the Faith of Jewish extraction were fined, beaten 
and chained at the instigation of both the &amp;Muhammadan clergy and 
the Jewish doctors.  It was, however, in Yazd and its environs that 
the most bloody outrages committed during &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry 
occurred.  In that city &amp;Haji &amp;Mirzay-i-Halabi-Saz was so mercilessly 
flogged that his wife flung herself upon his body, and was in her turn 
severely beaten, after which his skull was lacerated by the cleaver 
of a butcher.  His eleven-year-old son was pitilessly thrashed, stabbed 
with penknives and tortured to death.  Within the space of half a 
day nine people met their death.  A crowd of about six thousand 
people, of both sexes, vented their fury upon the helpless victims, a 
few going so far as to drink their blood.  In some instances, as was 
the case with a man named &amp;Mirza &amp;Asadu'llah-i-Sabbagh, they plundered 
their property and fought over its possession.  They evinced 
such cruelty that some of the government officials were moved to 
tears at the sight of the harrowing scenes in which the women of that 
city played a conspicuously shameful part.  
     In Taft several people were put to death, some of whom were 
shot and their bodies dragged through the streets.  A newly converted 
eighteen-year-old youth, named &amp;Husayn, was denounced by 
his own father, and torn to pieces before the eyes of his mother, 
whilst &amp;Muhammad-Kamal was hacked into bits with knife, spade 
and pickaxe.  In &amp;Manshad, where the persecutions lasted nineteen 
days, similar atrocities were perpetrated.  An eighty-year-old man, 
named Siyyid &amp;Mirza, was instantly killed in his sleep by two huge 
stones which were thrown on him; a &amp;Mirza &amp;Sadiq, who asked for 
water, had a knife plunged into his breast, his executioner afterwards 
licking the blood from the blade, while &amp;Shatir-Hasan, one of the 
victims, was seen before his death distributing some candy in his 
possession among the executioners and dividing among them his 
clothing.  A sixty-five year old woman, &amp;Khadijih-Sultan, was hurled 
 
+P298 
from the roof of a house; a believer named &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad was 
tied to a tree, made a target for hundreds of bullets and his body set 
on fire, whilst another, named &amp;Ustad &amp;Riday-i-Saffar, was seen to kiss 
the hand of his murderer, after which he was shot and his corpse 
heaped with insults.  
     In &amp;Banaduk, in &amp;Dih-Bala, in &amp;Farashah, in &amp;Abbas-Abad, in 
&amp;Hanza, in &amp;Ardikan, in &amp;Dawlat-Abad and in &amp;Hamadan crimes of similar 
nature were committed, an outstanding case being that of a 
highly respected and courageous woman, named &amp;Fatimih-Bagum, 
who was ignominiously dragged from her house, her veil was torn 
from her head, her throat cut across, her belly ripped open; and 
having been beaten by the savage crowd with every weapon they 
could lay hands on, she was finally suspended from a tree and delivered 
to the flames.  
     In &amp;Sari, in the days when the agitation for the constitution was 
moving towards a climax, five believers of recognized standing, 
known later as the &amp;Shuhaday-i-Khamsih (Five Martyrs), were done 
to death, whilst in &amp;Nayriz a ferocious assault, recalling that of Yazd, 
was launched by the enemy, in which nineteen lost their lives, among 
them the sixty-five year old &amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, a blind man who 
was shot and his body foully abused, and in the course of which a 
considerable amount of property was plundered, and numerous 
women and children had to flee for their lives, or seek refuge in 
mosques, or live in the ruins of their houses, or remain shelterless by 
the wayside.  
     In &amp;Sirjan, in &amp;Dugh-Abad, in &amp;Tabriz, in &amp;Avih, in Qum, in &amp;Najaf-Abad, 
in Sangsar, in &amp;Shahmirzad, in &amp;Isfahan, and in Jahrum redoubtable 
and remorseless enemies, both religious and political, continued, 
under various pretexts, and even after the signing of the Constitution 
by the &amp;Shah in 1906, and during the reign of his successors, 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali &amp;Shah and &amp;Ahmad &amp;Shah, to slay, torture, plunder 
and abuse the members of a community who resolutely refused to 
either recant or deviate a hair's breadth from the path laid down for 
them by their Leaders.  Even during &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's journeys to the 
West, and after His return to the Holy Land, and indeed till the 
end of His life, He continued to receive distressing news of the 
martyrdom of His followers, and of the outrages perpetrated against 
them by an insatiable enemy.  In &amp;Dawlat-Abad, a prince of the 
royal blood, &amp;Habibu'llah &amp;Mirza by name, a convert to the Faith who 
had consecrated his life to its service, was slain with a hatchet and 
his corpse set on fire.  In &amp;Mashhad the learned and pious &amp;Shaykh 
 
+P299 
&amp;Ali-Akbar-i-Quchani was shot to death.  In &amp;Sultan-Abad, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Ali-Akbar and seven members of his family including a forty day 
old infant were barbarously massacred.  Persecutions of varying 
degrees of severity broke out in &amp;Na'in, in &amp;Shahmirzad, in Bandar-i-Jaz 
and in Qamsar.  In &amp;Kirmanshah, the martyr &amp;Mirza &amp;Ya'qub-i-Muttahidih, 
the ardent twenty-five year old Jewish convert to the 
Faith, was the last to lay down his life during &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry; 
and his mother, according to his own instructions, celebrated 
his martyrdom in &amp;Hamadan with exemplary fortitude.  In every 
instance the conduct of the believers testified to the indomitable 
spirit and unyielding tenacity that continued to distinguish the lives 
and services of the Persian followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Despite these intermittent severe persecutions the Faith that had 
evoked in its heroes so rare a spirit of self-sacrifice was steadily and 
silently growing.  Engulfed for a time and almost extinguished in 
the sombre days following the martyrdom of the &amp;Bab, driven underground 
throughout the period of &amp;Baha'u'llah's ministry, it began, 
after His ascension, under the unerring guidance, and as a result of 
the unfailing solicitude, of a wise, a vigilant and loving Master, to 
gather its forces, and gradually to erect the embryonic institutions 
which were to pave the way for the establishment, at a later period, 
of its Administrative Order.  It was during this period that the number 
of its adherents rapidly multiplied, that its range, now embracing 
every province of that kingdom, steadily widened, and the rudimentary 
forms of its future Assemblies were inaugurated.  It was 
during this period, at a time when state schools and colleges were 
practically non-existent in that country, and when the education 
given in existing religious institutions was lamentably defective, that 
its earliest schools were established, beginning with the &amp;Tarbiyat, 
schools in &amp;Tihran for both boys and girls, and followed by the &amp;Ta'yid 
and Mawhibat schools in &amp;Hamadan, the &amp;Vahdat-i-Bashar school in 
&amp;Kashan and other similar educational institutions in &amp;Barfurush and 
&amp;Qazvin.  It was during these years that concrete and effectual assistance, 
both spiritual and material, in the form of visiting teachers 
from both Europe and America, of nurses, instructors, and physicians, 
was first extended to the &amp;Baha'i community in that land, these 
workers constituting the vanguard of that host of helpers which 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha promised would arise in time to further the interests of 
the Faith as well as those of the country in which it was born.  It 
was in the course of these years that the term &amp;Babi, as an appellation, 
designating the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in that country, was universally 
 
+P300 
discarded by the masses in favor of the word &amp;Baha'i, the 
former henceforth being exclusively applied to the fast dwindling 
number of the followers of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya.  During this period, moreover, 
the first systematic attempts were made to organize and stimulate 
the teaching work undertaken by the Persian believers, attempts 
which, apart from reinforcing the foundations of the community, 
were instrumental in attracting to its cause several outstanding figures 
in the public life of that country, not excluding certain prominent 
members of the &amp;Shi'ah sacerdotal order, and even descendants of some 
of the worst persecutors of the Faith.  It was during the years of that 
ministry that the House of the &amp;Bab in &amp;Shiraz, ordained by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
as a center of pilgrimage for His followers, and now so recognized, 
was by order of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and through His assistance, restored, 
and that it became increasingly a focus of &amp;Baha'i life and activity for 
those who were deprived by circumstances of visiting either the Most 
Great House in &amp;Baghdad or the Most Holy Tomb in &amp;Akka.  
     More conspicuous than any of these undertakings, however, was 
the erection of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world in the 
city of &amp;Ishqabad, a center founded in the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah, where 
the initial steps preparatory to its construction, had been already 
undertaken during His lifetime.  Initiated at about the close of the 
first decade of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry (1902); fostered by Him at 
every stage in its development; personally supervised by the venerable 
&amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Taqi, the &amp;Vakilu'd-Dawlih, a cousin of the 
&amp;Bab, who dedicated his entire resources to its establishment, and 
whose dust now reposes at the foot of Mt. Carmel under the shadow 
of the Tomb of his beloved Kinsman; carried out according to the 
directions laid down by the Center of the Covenant Himself; a lasting 
witness to the fervor and the self-sacrifice of the Oriental believers 
who were resolved to execute the bidding of &amp;Baha'u'llah as revealed 
in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, this enterprise must rank not only as the first 
major undertaking launched through the concerted efforts of His 
followers in the Heroic Age of His Faith, but as one of the most 
brilliant and enduring achievements in the history of the first 
&amp;Baha'i century.  
     The edifice itself, the foundation stone of which was laid in the 
presence of General Krupatkin, the governor-general of &amp;Turkistan, 
who had been delegated by the Czar to represent him at the ceremony, 
has thus been minutely described by a &amp;Baha'i visitor from the West: 
"The &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar stands in the heart of the city; its high 
dome standing out above the trees and house tops being visible for 
 
+P301 
miles to the travelers as they approach the town.  It is in the center 
of a garden bounded by four streets.  In the four corners of this 
enclosure are four buildings:  one is the &amp;Baha'i school; one is the 
traveler's house, where pilgrims and wayfarers are lodged; one is for 
the keepers, while the fourth one is to be used as a hospital.  Nine 
radial avenues approach the Temple from the several parts of the 
grounds, one of which, the principal approach to the building, leads 
from the main gateway of the grounds to the principal portal of the 
Temple."  "In plan," he further adds, "the building is composed of 
three sections; namely, the central rotunda, the aisle or ambulatory 
which surrounds it, and the loggia which surrounds the entire building.  
It is built on the plan of a regular polygon of nine sides.  One 
side is occupied by the monumental main entrance, flanked by 
minarets--a high arched portico extending two stories in height 
recalling in arrangement the architecture of the world famous Taj 
Mahal at Agra in India, the delight of the world to travelers, many 
of whom pronounce it to be the most beautiful temple in the world.  
Thus the principal doorway opens toward the direction of the Holy 
land.  The entire building is surrounded by two series of loggias--
one upper and one lower--which opens out upon the garden giving a 
very beautiful architectural effect in harmony with the luxuriant 
semi-tropical vegetation which fills the garden...  The interior 
walls of the rotunda are treated in five distinct stories.  First, a series 
of nine arches and piers which separate the rotunda from the ambulatory.  
Second, a similar treatment with balustrades which separate 
the triforium gallery (which is above the ambulatory and is reached 
by two staircases in the loggias placed one on either side of the main 
entrance) from the well of the rotunda.  Third, a series of nine blank 
arches filled with fretwork, between which are escutcheons bearing 
the Greatest Name.  Fourth, a series of nine large arched windows.  
Fifth, a series of eighteen bull's eye windows.  Above and resting on a 
cornice surmounting this last story rises the inner hemispherical shell 
of the dome.  The interior is elaborately decorated in plaster relief 
work...  The whole structure impresses one by its mass and strength."  
     Nor should mention be omitted of the two schools for boys and 
girls which were established in that city, of the pilgrim house instituted 
in the close vicinity of the Temple, of the Spiritual Assembly 
and its auxiliary bodies formed to administer the affairs of a growing 
community, and of the new centers of activity inaugurated in various 
towns and cities in the province of &amp;Turkistan--all testifying to the 
 
+P302 
vitality which the Faith had displayed ever since its inception in 
that land.  
     A parallel if less spectacular development could be observed in 
the Caucasus.  After the establishment of the first center and the 
formation of an Assembly in &amp;Baku, a city which &amp;Baha'i pilgrims, 
traveling in increasing numbers from Persia to the Holy Land via 
Turkey, invariably visited, new groups began to be organized, and, 
evolving later into well-established communities, cooperated in increasing 
measure with their brethren both in &amp;Turkistan and Persia.  
     In Egypt a steady increase in the number of the adherents of the 
Faith was accompanied by a general expansion in its activities.  The 
establishments of new centers; the consolidation of the chief center 
established in Cairo; the conversion, largely through the indefatigable 
efforts of the learned &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl, of several prominent students 
and teachers of the Azhar University--premonitory symptoms foreshadowing 
the advent of the promised day on which, according to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the standard and emblem of the Faith would be implanted 
in the heart of that time-honored Islamic seat of learning; the 
translation into Arabic and the dissemination of some of the most 
important writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah revealed in Persian, together with 
other &amp;Baha'i literature; the printing of books, treatises and pamphlets 
by &amp;Baha'i authors and scholars; the publication of articles in the Press 
written in defense of the Faith and for the purpose of broadcasting 
its message; the formation of rudimentary administrative institutions 
in the capital as well as in nearby centers; the enrichment of the life 
of the community through the addition of converts of Kurdish, 
Coptic, and Armenian origin--these may be regarded as the first 
fruits garnered in a country which, blessed by the footsteps of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
was, in later years, to play a historic part in the emancipation of 
the Faith, and which, by virtue of its unique position as the intellectual 
center of both the Arab and Islamic worlds, must inevitably 
assume a notable and decisive share of responsibility in the final 
establishment of that Faith throughout the East.  
     Even more remarkable was the expansion of &amp;Baha'i activity in 
India and Burma, where a steadily growing community, now including 
among its members representatives of the Zoroastrian, the Islamic, 
the Hindu and the Buddhist Faiths, as well as members of the Sikh 
community, succeeded in establishing its outposts, as far as Mandalay 
and the village of Daidanaw Kalazoo, in the Hanthawaddy district of 
Burma, at which latter place no less than eight hundred &amp;Baha'is 
resided, possessing a school, a court, and a hospital of their own, as 
 
+P303 
well as land for community cultivation, the proceeds of which they 
devoted to the furtherance of the interests of their Faith.  
     In &amp;Iraq, where the House occupied by &amp;Baha'u'llah was entirely 
restored and renovated, and where a small yet intrepid community 
struggled in the face of constant opposition to regulate and administer 
its affairs; in Constantinople, where a &amp;Baha'i center was established; 
in Tunis where the foundations of a local community were 
firmly laid; in Japan, in China, and in Honolulu to which &amp;Baha'i 
teachers traveled, and where they settled and taught--in all of these 
places the manifold evidences of the guiding hand of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and the tangible effects of His sleepless vigilance and unfailing care 
could be clearly perceived.  
     Nor did the nascent communities established in France, England, 
Germany and the United States cease to receive, after His memorable 
visits to those countries, further tokens of His special interest in, and 
solicitude for, their welfare and spiritual advancement.  It was in 
consequence of His directions and the unceasing flow of His Tablets, 
addressed to the members of these communities, as well as His constant 
encouragement of the efforts they were exerting, that &amp;Baha'i 
centers steadily multiplied, that public meetings were organized, that 
new periodicals were published, that translations of some of the best 
known works of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of the Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha were 
printed and circulated in the English, the French, and German languages, 
and that the initial attempts to organize the affairs, and consolidate 
the foundations, of these newly established communities 
were undertaken.  
     In the North American continent, more particularly, the members 
of a flourishing community, inspired by the blessings bestowed by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, as well as by His example and the acts He performed in 
the course of His prolonged visit to their country, gave an earnest 
of the magnificent enterprise they were to carry through in later 
years.  They purchased the twelve remaining lots forming part of the 
site of their projected Temple, selected, during the sessions of their 
1920 Convention, the design of the French Canadian &amp;Baha'i architect, 
Louis Bourgeois, placed the contract for the excavation and the laying 
of its foundations, and succeeded soon after in completing the necessary 
arrangements for the construction of its basement:  measures 
which heralded the stupendous efforts which, after &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
ascension, culminated in the erection of its superstructure and the 
completion of its exterior ornamentation.  
     The war of 1914-18, repeatedly foreshadowed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in 
 
+P304 
the dark warnings He uttered in the course of His western travels, 
and which broke out eight months after His return to the Holy Land, 
once more cast a shadow of danger over His life, the last that was to 
darken the years of His agitated yet glorious ministry.  
     The late entry of the United States of America in that world-convulsing 
conflict, the neutrality of Persia, the remoteness of India 
and of the Far East from the theater of operations, insured the protection 
of the overwhelming majority of His followers, who, though 
for the most part entirely cut off for a number of years from the 
spiritual center of their Faith, were still able to conduct their affairs 
and safeguard the fruits of their recent achievements in comparative 
safety and freedom.  
     In the Holy Land, however, though the outcome of that tremendous 
struggle was to liberate once and for all the Heart and 
Center of the Faith from the Turkish yoke, a yoke which had imposed 
for so long upon its Founder and His Successor such oppressive and 
humiliating restrictions, yet severe privations and grave dangers continued 
to surround its inhabitants during the major part of that 
conflict, and renewed, for a time, the perils which had confronted 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha during the years of His incarceration in &amp;Akka.  The 
privations inflicted on the inhabitants by the gross incompetence, the 
shameful neglect, the cruelty and callous indifference of both the 
civil and military authorities, though greatly alleviated through the 
bountiful generosity, the foresight and the tender care of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
were aggravated by the rigors of a strict blockade.  A bombardment 
of Haifa by the Allies was a constant threat, at one time so real 
that it necessitated the temporary removal of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, His 
family and members of the local community to the village of &amp;Abu-Sinan 
at the foot of the hills east of &amp;Akka.  The Turkish Commander-in-Chief, 
the brutal, the all-powerful and unscrupulous &amp;Jamal &amp;Pasha, 
an inveterate enemy of the Faith, through his own ill-founded suspicions 
and the instigation of its enemies, had already grievously 
afflicted &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and even expressed his intention of crucifying 
Him and of razing to the ground the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
Himself still suffered from the ill-health and exhaustion brought 
on by the fatigues of His three-year journeys.  He felt acutely the 
virtual stoppage of all communication with most of the &amp;Baha'i 
centers throughout the world.  Agony filled His soul at the spectacle 
of human slaughter precipitated through humanity's failure to respond 
to the summons He had issued, or to heed the warnings He had given.  
Surely sorrow upon sorrow was added to the burden of trials and 
 
+P305 
vicissitudes which He, since His boyhood, had borne so heroically for 
the sake, and in the service, of His Father's Cause.  
     And yet during these somber days, the darkness of which was 
reminiscent of the tribulations endured during the most dangerous 
period of His incarceration in the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
whilst in the precincts of His Father's Shrine, or when dwelling 
in the House He occupied in &amp;Akka, or under the shadow of the 
&amp;Bab's sepulcher on Mt. Carmel, was moved to confer once again, and 
for the last time in His life, on the community of His American 
followers a signal mark of His special favor by investing them, on 
the eve of the termination of His earthly ministry, through the 
revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, with a world mission, 
whose full implications even now, after the lapse of a quarter 
of a century, still remain undisclosed, and whose unfoldment thus 
far, though as yet in its initial stages, has so greatly enriched the 
spiritual as well as the administrative annals of the first &amp;Baha'i 
century.  
     The conclusion of this terrible conflict, the first stage in a titanic 
convulsion long predicted by &amp;Baha'u'llah, not only marked the 
extinction of Turkish rule in the Holy Land and sealed the doom of 
that military despot who had vowed to destroy &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, but 
also shattered once and for all the last hopes still entertained by the 
remnant of Covenant-breakers who, untaught by the severe retribution 
that had already overtaken them, still aspired to witness the 
extinction of the light of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant.  Furthermore, it 
produced those revolutionary changes which, on the one hand, 
fulfilled the ominous predictions made by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
and enabled, according to Scriptural prophecy, so large an 
element of the "outcasts of Israel," the "remnant" of the "flock," to 
"assemble" in the Holy Land, and to be brought back to "their folds" 
and "their own border," beneath the shadow of the "Incomparable 
Branch," referred to by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His "Some Answered 
Questions," and which, on the other hand, gave birth to the institution 
of the League of Nations, the precursor of that World Tribunal 
which, as prophesied by that same "Incomparable Branch," the 
peoples and nations of the earth must needs unitedly establish.  
     No need to dwell on the energetic steps which the English 
believers as soon as they had been apprized of the dire peril threatening 
the life of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha undertook to insure His security; on the 
measures independently taken whereby Lord Curzon and others in 
the British Cabinet were advised as to the critical situation at Haifa; 
 
+P306 
on the prompt intervention of Lord Lamington, who immediately 
wrote to the Foreign Office to "explain the importance of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
position;" on the despatch which the Foreign Secretary, Lord 
Balfour, on the day of the receipt of this letter, sent to General 
Allenby, instructing him to "extend every protection and consideration 
to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, His family and His friends;" on the cablegram 
subsequently sent by the General, after the capture of Haifa, to 
London, requesting the authorities to "notify the world that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
is safe;" on the orders which that same General issued to the 
General Commanding Officer in command of the Haifa operations to 
insure &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's safety, thus frustrating the express intention of 
the Turkish Commander-in-Chief (according to information which 
had reached the British Intelligence Service) to "crucify &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and His family on Mt. Carmel" in the event of the Turkish 
army being compelled to evacuate Haifa and retreat northwards.  
     The three years which elapsed between the liberation of Palestine 
by the British forces and the passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha were marked by 
a further enhancement of the prestige which the Faith, despite the 
persecutions to which it had been subjected, had acquired at its world 
center, and by a still greater extension in the range of its teaching 
activities in various parts of the world.  The danger which, for no 
less than three score years and five, had threatened the lives of the 
Founders of the Faith and of the Center of His Covenant, was 
now at long last through the instrumentality of that war completely 
and definitely lifted.  The Head of the Faith, and its twin holy 
Shrines, in the plain of &amp;Akka and on the slopes of Mt. Carmel, were 
henceforth to enjoy for the first time, through the substitution of a 
new and liberal &amp;regime for the corrupt administration of the past, a 
freedom from restrictions which was later expanded into a clearer 
recognition of the institutions of the Cause.  Nor were the British 
authorities slow to express their appreciation of the &amp;role which 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha had played in allaying the burden of suffering that had 
oppressed the inhabitants of the Holy Land during the dark days of 
that distressing conflict.  The conferment of a knighthood upon Him 
at a ceremony specially held for His sake in Haifa, at the residence 
of the British Governor, at which notables of various communities 
had assembled; the visit paid Him by General and Lady Allenby, 
who were His guests at luncheon in &amp;Bahji, and whom He conducted 
to the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah; the interview at His Haifa residence 
between Him and King Feisal who shortly after became the ruler of 
&amp;Iraq; the several calls paid Him by Sir Herbert Samuel (later 
 
+P307 
Viscount Samuel of Carmel) both before and after his appointment 
as High Commissioner for Palestine; His meeting with Lord Lamington 
who, likewise, called upon Him in Haifa, as well as with the then 
Governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs; the multiplying evidences 
of the recognition of His high and unique position by all religious 
communities, whether Muslim, Christian or Jewish; the influx of 
pilgrims who, from East and West, flocked to the Holy Land in 
comparative ease and safety to visit the Holy Tombs in &amp;Akka 
and Haifa, to pay their share of homage to Him, to celebrate the 
signal protection vouchsafed by Providence to the Faith and its 
followers, and to give thanks for the final emancipation of its Head 
and world Center from Turkish yoke--these contributed, each in its 
own way, to heighten the prestige which the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
been steadily and gradually acquiring through the inspired leadership 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     As the ministry of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha drew to a close signs multiplied 
of the resistless and manifold unfoldment of the Faith both in the 
East and in the West, both in the shaping and consolidation of its 
institutions and in the widening range of its activities and its 
influence.  In the city of &amp;Ishqabad the construction of the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, which He Himself had initiated, was successfully 
consummated.  In Wilmette the excavations for the Mother Temple of the 
West were carried out and the contract placed for the construction 
of the basement of the building.  In &amp;Baghdad the initial steps were 
taken, according to His special instructions, to reinforce the foundations 
and restore the Most Great House associated with the memory 
of His Father.  In the Holy Land an extensive property east of the 
&amp;Bab's Sepulcher was purchased through the initiative of the Holy 
Mother with the support of contributions from &amp;Baha'is in both the 
East and the West to serve as a site for the future erection of the first 
&amp;Baha'i school at the world Administrative Center of the Faith.  The 
site for a Western Pilgrim House was acquired in the neighborhood 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's residence, and the building was erected soon after 
His passing by American believers.  The Oriental Pilgrim House, 
erected on Mt. Carmel by a believer from &amp;Ishqabad, soon after the 
entombment of the &amp;Bab's remains, for the convenience of visiting 
pilgrims, was granted tax exemption by the civil authorities (the 
first time such a privilege had been conceded since the establishment 
of the Faith in the Holy Land).  The famous scientist and entomologist, 
Dr. Auguste Forel, was converted to the Faith through the 
influence of a Tablet sent him by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha--one of the most 
 
+P308 
weighty the Master ever wrote.  Another Tablet of far-reaching 
importance was His reply to a communication addressed to Him by 
the Executive Committee of the "Central Organization for a Durable 
Peace," which He dispatched to them at The Hague by the hands of 
a special delegation.  A new continent was opened to the Cause when, 
in response to the Tablets of the Divine Plan unveiled at the first 
Convention after the war, the great-hearted and heroic Hyde Dunn, 
at the advanced age of sixty-two, promptly forsook his home in 
California, and, seconded and accompanied by his wife, settled as a 
pioneer in Australia, where he was able to carry the Message to no 
less than seven hundred towns throughout that Commonwealth.  A 
new episode began when, in quick response to those same Tablets and 
their summons, that star-servant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the indomitable 
and immortal Martha Root, designated by her Master "herald of the 
Kingdom" and "harbinger of the Covenant," embarked on the first 
of her historic journeys which were to extend over a period of twenty 
years, and to carry her several times around the globe, and which 
ended only with her death far from home and in the active service 
of the Cause she loved so greatly.  These events mark the closing stage 
of a ministry which sealed the triumph of the Heroic Age of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation, and which will go down in history as one of the 
most glorious and fruitful periods of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
 
+P309 
                                 CHAPTER XXI 
                         The Passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's great work was now ended.  The historic Mission 
with which His Father had, twenty-nine years previously, invested 
Him had been gloriously consummated.  A memorable chapter in the 
history of the first &amp;Baha'i century had been written.  The Heroic Age 
of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, in which He had participated since its 
inception, and played so unique a &amp;role, had drawn to a close.  He had 
suffered as no disciple of the Faith, who had drained the cup of 
martyrdom, had suffered, He had labored as none of its greatest 
heroes had labored.  He had witnessed triumphs such as neither the 
Herald of the Faith nor its Author had ever witnessed.  
     At the close of His strenuous Western tours, which had called 
forth the last ounce of His ebbing strength, He had written:  "Friends, 
the time is coming when I shall be no longer with you.  I have done 
all that could be done.  I have served the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah to the 
utmost of My ability.  I have labored night and day all the years of 
My life.  O how I long to see the believers shouldering the responsibilities 
of the Cause!...  My days are numbered, and save this 
there remains none other joy for me."  Several years before He had thus 
alluded to His passing:  "O ye My faithful loved ones!  Should at any 
time afflicting events come to pass in the Holy Land, never feel disturbed 
or agitated.  Fear not, neither grieve.  For whatsoever thing happeneth 
will cause the Word of God to be exalted, and His Divine fragrances 
to be diffused."  And again:  "Remember, whether or not I be on earth, 
My presence will be with you always."  "Regard not the person of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha," He thus counselled His friends in one of His last 
Tablets, "for He will eventually take His leave of you all; nay, fix 
your gaze upon the Word of God...  The loved ones of God must 
arise with such steadfastness that should, in one moment, hundreds 
of souls even as &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself be made a target for the darts 
of woe, nothing whatsoever shall affect or lessen their ... service to 
the Cause of God."  
     In a Tablet addressed to the American believers, a few days before 
He passed away, He thus vented His pent-up longing to depart from 
this world:  "I have renounced the world and the people thereof...  
In the cage of this world I flutter even as a frightened bird, and 
 
+P310 
yearn every day to take My flight unto Thy Kingdom.  &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha! 
Make Me drink of the cup of sacrifice, and set Me free."  
He revealed a prayer less than six months before His ascension in 
honor of a kinsman of the &amp;Bab, and in it wrote:  "`O Lord!  My bones 
are weakened, and the hoar hairs glisten on My head ... and I have 
now reached old age, failing in My powers.'...  No strength is there 
left in Me wherewith to arise and serve Thy loved ones...  O Lord, 
My Lord!  Hasten My ascension unto Thy sublime Threshold ... 
and My arrival at the Door of Thy grace beneath the shadow of Thy 
most great mercy..."  
     Through the dreams He dreamed, through the conversations He 
held, through the Tablets He revealed, it became increasingly evident 
that His end was fast approaching.  Two months before His passing 
He told His family of a dream He had had.  "I seemed," He said, 
"to be standing within a great mosque, in the inmost shrine, facing 
the Qiblih, in the place of the &amp;Imam himself.  I became aware that a 
large number of people were flocking into the mosque.  More and 
yet more crowded in, taking their places in rows behind Me, until 
there was a vast multitude.  As I stood I raised loudly the call to 
prayer.  Suddenly the thought came to Me to go forth from the 
mosque.  When I found Myself outside I said within Myself:  `For 
what reason came I forth, not having led the prayer?  But it matters 
not; now that I have uttered the Call to prayer, the vast multitude will 
of themselves chant the prayer.'"  A few weeks later, whilst occupying 
a solitary room in the garden of His house, He recounted another 
dream to those around Him.  "I dreamed a dream," He said, "and 
behold, the Blessed Beauty (&amp;Baha'u'llah) came and said to Me: 
`Destroy this room.'"  None of those present comprehended the significance 
of this dream until He Himself had soon after passed away, 
when it became clear to them all that by the "room" was meant the 
temple of His body.  
     A month before His death (which occurred in the 78th year of 
His age, in the early hours of the 28th of November, 1921) He had 
referred expressly to it in some words of cheer and comfort that He 
addressed to a believer who was mourning the loss of his brother.  
And about two weeks before His passing He had spoken to His 
faithful gardener in a manner that clearly indicated He knew His 
end to be nigh.  "I am so fatigued," He observed to him, "the hour is 
come when I must leave everything and take My flight.  I am too 
weary to walk."  He added:  "It was during the closing days of the 
Blessed Beauty, when I was engaged in gathering together His papers 
 
+P311 
which were strewn over the sofa in His writing chamber in &amp;Bahji, 
that He turned to Me and said:  `It is of no use to gather them, I 
must leave them and flee away.'  I also have finished My work.  I can 
do nothing more.  Therefore must I leave it, and take My departure."  
     Till the very last day of His earthly life &amp;Abdu'l-Baha continued 
to shower that same love upon high and low alike, to extend that same 
assistance to the poor and the down-trodden, and to carry out those 
same duties in the service of His Father's Faith, as had been His wont 
from the days of His boyhood.  On the Friday before His passing, 
despite great fatigue, He attended the noonday prayer at the mosque, 
and distributed afterwards alms, as was His custom, among the poor; 
dictated some Tablets--the last ones He revealed--; blessed the marriage 
of a trusted servant, which He had insisted should take place 
that day; attended the usual meeting of the friends in His home; felt 
feverish the next day, and being unable to leave the house on the 
following Sunday, sent all the believers to the Tomb of the &amp;Bab to 
attend a feast which a &amp;Parsi pilgrim was offering on the occasion of 
the anniversary of the Declaration of the Covenant; received with 
His unfailing courtesy and kindness that same afternoon, and despite 
growing weariness, the &amp;Mufti of Haifa, the Mayor and the Head of 
the Police; and inquired that night--the last of His life--before He 
retired after the health of every member of His household, of the 
pilgrims and of the friends in Haifa.  
     At 1:15 A.M. He arose, and, walking to a table in His room, 
drank some water, and returned to bed.  Later on, He asked one of 
His two daughters who had remained awake to care for Him, to 
lift up the net curtains, complaining that He had difficulty in 
breathing.  Some rose-water was brought to Him, of which He drank, 
after which He again lay down, and when offered food, distinctly 
remarked:  "You wish Me to take some food, and I am going?"  A 
minute later His spirit had winged its flight to its eternal abode, to 
be gathered, at long last, to the glory of His beloved Father, and 
taste the joy of everlasting reunion with Him.  
     The news of His passing, so sudden, so unexpected, spread like 
wildfire throughout the town, and was flashed instantly over the 
wires to distant parts of the globe, stunning with grief the community 
of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in East and West.  Messages from far 
and near, from high and low alike, through cablegrams and letters, 
poured in conveying to the members of a sorrow-stricken and disconsolate 
family expressions of praise, of devotion, of anguish and of 
sympathy.  
 
+P312 
     The British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. Winston 
Churchill, telegraphed immediately to the High Commissioner for 
Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, instructing him to "convey to the 
&amp;Baha'i Community, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, their 
sympathy and condolence."  Viscount Allenby, the High Commissioner 
for Egypt, wired the High Commissioner for Palestine asking 
him to "convey to the relatives of the late Sir &amp;Abdu'l-Baha &amp;Abbas 
Effendi and to the &amp;Baha'i Community" his "sincere sympathy in the 
loss of their revered leader."  The Council of Ministers in &amp;Baghdad 
instructed the Prime Minister Siyyid &amp;Abdu'r-Rahman to extend their 
"sympathy to the family of His Holiness &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in their bereavement."  
The Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary 
Force, General Congreve, addressed to the High Commissioner 
for Palestine a message requesting him to "convey his deepest sympathy 
to the family of the late Sir &amp;Abbas &amp;Baha'i."  General Sir Arthur 
Money, former Chief Administrator of Palestine, wrote expressing 
his sadness, his profound respect and his admiration for Him as well 
as his sympathy in the loss which His family had sustained.  One of the 
distinguished figures in the academic life of the University of Oxford, 
a famous professor and scholar, wrote on behalf of himself and his 
wife:  "The passing beyond the veil into fuller life must be specially 
wonderful and blessed for One Who has always fixed His thoughts 
on high, and striven to lead an exalted life here below."  
     Many and divers newspapers, such as the London "Times," the 
"Morning Post," the "Daily Mail," the "New York World," "Le 
Temps," the "Times of India" and others, in different languages and 
countries, paid their tribute to One Who had rendered the Cause of 
human brotherhood and peace such signal and imperishable services.  
     The High Commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel, sent immediately a 
message conveying his desire to attend the funeral in person, in order 
as he himself later wrote, to "express my respect for His creed and 
my regard for His person."  As to the funeral itself, which took place 
on Tuesday morning--a funeral the like of which Palestine had never 
seen--no less than ten thousand people participated representing every 
class, religion and race in that country.  "A great throng," bore witness 
at a later date, the High Commissioner himself, "had gathered 
together, sorrowing for His death, but rejoicing also for His life."  
Sir Ronald Storrs, Governor of Jerusalem at the time, also wrote in 
describing the funeral:  "I have never known a more united expression 
of regret and respect than was called forth by the utter simplicity 
of the ceremony."  
 
+P313 
     The coffin containing the remains of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was borne to 
its last resting-place on the shoulders of His loved ones.  The &amp;cortege 
which preceded it was led by the City Constabulary Force, acting as a 
Guard of Honor, behind which followed in order the Boy Scouts of 
the Muslim and Christian communities holding aloft their banners, a 
company of Muslim choristers chanting their verses from the &amp;Qur'an, 
the chiefs of the Muslim community headed by the &amp;Mufti, and a 
number of Christian priests, Latin, Greek and Anglican.  Behind the 
coffin walked the members of His family, the British High Commissioner, 
Sir Herbert Samuel, the Governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald 
Storrs, the Governor of Phoenicia, Sir Stewart Symes, officials of the 
government, consuls of various countries resident in Haifa, notables 
of Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, Christian and Druze, Egyptians, Greeks, 
Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Europeans and Americans, men, women and 
children.  The long train of mourners, amid the sobs and moans of 
many a grief-stricken heart, wended its slow way up the slopes of 
Mt. Carmel to the Mausoleum of the &amp;Bab.  
     Close to the eastern entrance of the Shrine, the sacred casket was 
placed upon a plain table, and, in the presence of that vast concourse, 
nine speakers, who represented the Muslim, the Jewish and Christian 
Faiths, and who included the &amp;Mufti of Haifa, delivered their several 
funeral orations.  These concluded, the High Commissioner drew 
close to the casket, and, with bowed head fronting the Shrine, paid 
his last homage of farewell to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:  the other officials of the 
Government followed his example.  The coffin was then removed to 
one of the chambers of the Shrine, and there lowered, sadly and 
reverently, to its last resting-place in a vault adjoining that in which 
were laid the remains of the &amp;Bab.  
     During the week following His passing, from fifty to a hundred 
of the poor of Haifa were daily fed at His house, whilst on the 
seventh day corn was distributed in His memory to about a thousand 
of them irrespective of creed or race.  On the fortieth day an impressive 
memorial feast was held in His memory, to which over six 
hundred of the people of Haifa, &amp;Akka and the surrounding parts of 
Palestine and Syria, including officials and notables of various religions 
and races, were invited.  More than one hundred of the poor were 
also fed on that day.  
     One of the assembled guests, the Governor of Phoenicia, paid a 
last tribute to the memory of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the following words: 
"Most of us here have, I think, a clear picture of Sir &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
&amp;Abbas, of His dignified figure walking thoughtfully in our streets, 
 
+P314 
of His courteous and gracious manner, of His kindness, of His love 
for little children and flowers, of His generosity and care for the poor 
and suffering.  So gentle was He, and so simple, that in His presence 
one almost forgot that He was also a great teacher, and that His 
writings and His conversations have been a solace and an inspiration 
to hundreds and thousands of people in the East and in the West."  
     Thus was brought to a close the ministry of One Who was the 
incarnation, by virtue of the rank bestowed upon Him by His Father, 
of an institution that has no parallel in the entire field of religious 
history, a ministry that marks the final stage in the Apostolic, the 
Heroic and most glorious Age of the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Through Him the Covenant, that "excellent and priceless Heritage" 
bequeathed by the Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation, had been 
proclaimed, championed and vindicated.  Through the power which 
that Divine Instrument had conferred upon Him the light of God's 
infant Faith had penetrated the West, had diffused itself as far as the 
Islands of the Pacific, and illumined the fringes of the Australian continent.  
Through His personal intervention the Message, Whose Bearer 
had tasted the bitterness of a life-long captivity, had been noised 
abroad, and its character and purpose disclosed, for the first time in 
its history, before enthusiastic and representative audiences in the 
chief cities of Europe and of the North American continent.  Through 
His unrelaxing vigilance the holy remains of the &amp;Bab, brought forth 
at long last from their fifty-year concealment, had been safely transported 
to the Holy Land and permanently and befittingly enshrined 
in the very spot which &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself had designated for them 
and had blessed with His presence.  Through His bold initiative the 
first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world had been reared in 
Central Asia, in Russian &amp;Turkistan, whilst through His unfailing 
encouragement a similar enterprise, of still vaster proportions, had 
been undertaken, and its land dedicated by Himself in the heart of 
the North American continent.  Through the sustaining grace overshadowing 
Him since the inception of His ministry His royal adversary 
had been humbled to the dust, the arch-breaker of His Father's 
Covenant had been utterly routed, and the danger which, ever since 
&amp;Baha'u'llah had been banished to Turkish soil, had been threatening 
the heart of the Faith, definitely removed.  In pursuance of His instructions, 
and in conformity with the principles enunciated and the 
laws ordained by His Father, the rudimentary institutions, heralding 
the formal inauguration of the Administrative Order to be founded 
after His passing, had taken shape and been established.  Through His 
 
+P315 
unremitting labors, as reflected in the treatises He composed, the 
thousands of Tablets He revealed, the discourses He delivered, the 
prayers, poems and commentaries He left to posterity, mostly in 
Persian, some in Arabic and a few in Turkish, the laws and principles, 
constituting the warp and woof of His Father's Revelation, had been 
elucidated, its fundamentals restated and interpreted, its tenets given 
detailed application and the validity and indispensability of its verities 
fully and publicly demonstrated.  Through the warnings He sounded, 
an unheeding humanity, steeped in materialism and forgetful of its 
God, had been apprized of the perils threatening to disrupt its ordered 
life, and made, in consequence of its persistent perversity, to sustain 
the initial shocks of that world upheaval which continues, until the 
present day, to rock the foundations of human society.  And lastly, 
through the mandate He had issued to a valiant community, the concerted 
achievements of whose members had shed so great a lustre on 
the annals of His own ministry, He had set in motion a Plan which, 
soon after its formal inauguration, achieved the opening of the 
Australian continent, which, in a later period, was to be instrumental 
in winning over the heart of a royal convert to His Father's Cause, 
and which, today, through the irresistible unfoldment of its potentialities, 
is so marvellously quickening the spiritual life of all the 
Republics of Latin America as to constitute a befitting conclusion to 
the records of an entire century.  
     Nor should a survey of the outstanding features of so blessed and 
fruitful a ministry omit mention of the prophecies which the unerring 
pen of the appointed Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant has recorded.  
These foreshadow the fierceness of the onslaught that the resistless 
march of the Faith must provoke in the West, in India and in the Far 
East when it meets the time-honored sacerdotal orders of the Christian, 
the Buddhist and Hindu religions.  They foreshadow the turmoil 
which its emancipation from the fetters of religious orthodoxy will 
cast in the American, the European, the Asiatic and African continents.  
They foreshadow the gathering of the children of Israel in their 
ancient homeland; the erection of the banner of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the 
Egyptian citadel of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam; the extinction of the powerful influence 
wielded by the &amp;Shi'ah ecclesiastics in Persia; the load of misery 
which must needs oppress the pitiful remnants of the breakers of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant at the world center of His Faith; the splendor 
of the institutions which that triumphant Faith must erect on the 
slopes of a mountain, destined to be so linked with the city of &amp;Akka 
that a single grand metropolis will be formed to enshrine the spiritual 
 
+P316 
as well as the administrative seats of the future &amp;Baha'i Commonwealth; 
the conspicuous honor which the inhabitants of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
native land in general, and its government in particular, must enjoy 
in a distant future; the unique and enviable position which the community 
of the Most Great Name in the North American continent 
must occupy, as a direct consequence of the execution of the world 
mission which He entrusted to them:  finally they foreshadow, as the 
sum and summit of all, the "hoisting of the standard of God among all 
nations" and the unification of the entire human race, when "all men 
will adhere to one religion ... will be blended into one race, and 
become a single people."  
     Nor can the revolutionary changes in the great world which that 
ministry has witnessed be allowed to pass unnoticed--most of them 
flowing directly from the warnings which were uttered by the &amp;Bab, in 
the first chapter of His &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', on the very night of the 
Declaration of His Mission in &amp;Shiraz, and which were later reinforced 
by the pregnant passages addressed by &amp;Baha'u'llah to the kings of 
the earth and the world's religious leaders, in both the &amp;Suriy-i-Muluk 
and the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas.  The conversion of the Portuguese 
monarchy and the Chinese empire into republics; the collapse of the 
Russian, the German and Austrian empires, and the ignominious fate 
which befell their rulers; the assassination of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, the 
fall of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid--these may be said to have marked 
further stages in the operation of that catastrophic process the inception 
of which was signalized in the lifetime of &amp;Baha'u'llah by the 
murder of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz, by the dramatic downfall of Napoleon 
III, and the extinction of the Third Empire, and by the self-imposed 
imprisonment and virtual termination of the temporal 
sovereignty of the Pope himself.  Later, after &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing, 
the same process was to be accelerated by the demise of the &amp;Qajar 
dynasty in Persia, by the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy, by the 
collapse of both the Sultanate and the Caliphate in Turkey, by a swift 
decline in the fortunes of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam and of the Christian Missions 
in the East, and by the cruel fate that is now overtaking so many of 
the crowned heads of Europe.  
     Nor can this subject be dismissed without special reference to the 
names of those men of eminence and learning who were moved, at 
various stages of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, to pay tribute not only to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself but also to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Such names 
as Count Leo Tolstoy, Prof. Arminius Vambery, Prof. Auguste Forel, 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, the Venerable Archdeacon Wilberforce, Prof. 
 
+P317 
Jowett of Balliol, Dr. T. K. Cheyne, Dr. Estlin Carpenter of Oxford 
University, Viscount Samuel of Carmel, Lord Lamington, Sir Valentine 
Chirol, Rabbi Stephen Wise, Prince &amp;Muhammad-'Ali of Egypt, 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad &amp;Abdu, &amp;Midhat &amp;Pasha, and &amp;Khurshid &amp;Pasha attest, 
by virtue of the tributes associated with them, the great progress 
made by the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah under the brilliant leadership of 
His exalted Son--tributes whose impressiveness was, in later years, 
to be heightened by the historic, the repeated and written testimonies 
which a famous Queen, a grand-daughter of Queen Victoria, was 
impelled to bequeath to posterity as a witness of her recognition of 
the prophetic mission of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     As for those enemies who have sedulously sought to extinguish 
the light of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, the condign punishment they have 
been made to suffer is no less conspicuous than the doom which overtook 
those who, in an earlier period, had so basely endeavored to crush 
the hopes of a rising Faith and destroy its foundations.  
     To the assassination of the tyrannical &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah and the 
subsequent extinction of the &amp;Qajar dynasty reference has already 
been made.  &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, after his deposition, was made a 
prisoner of state and condemned to a life of complete obscurity and 
humiliation, scorned by his fellow-rulers and vilified by his subjects.  
The bloodthirsty &amp;Jamal &amp;Pasha, who had resolved to crucify &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and raze to the ground &amp;Baha'u'llah's holy Tomb, had to flee for 
his life and was slain, while a refugee in the Caucasus, by the hand of 
an Armenian whose fellow-compatriots he had so pitilessly persecuted.  
The scheming &amp;Jamalu'd-Din &amp;Afghani, whose relentless hostility and 
powerful influence had been so gravely detrimental to the progress 
of the Faith in Near Eastern countries, was, after a checkered career 
filled with vicissitudes, stricken with cancer, and having had a major 
part of his tongue cut away in an unsuccessful operation perished in 
misery.  The four members of the ill-fated Commission of Inquiry, 
despatched from Constantinople to seal the fate of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
suffered, each in his turn, a humiliation hardly less drastic than that 
which they had planned for Him.  &amp;Arif Bey, the head of the Commission, 
seeking stealthily at midnight to flee from the wrath of the 
Young Turks, was shot dead by a sentry.  Adham Bey succeeded in 
escaping to Egypt, but was robbed of his possessions by his servant on 
the way, and was in the end compelled to seek financial assistance 
from the &amp;Baha'is of Cairo, a request which was not refused.  Later he 
sought help from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Who immediately directed the 
believers to present him with a sum on His behalf, an instruction 
 
+P318 
which they were unable to carry out owing to his sudden disappearance.  
Of the other two members, one was exiled to a remote place, 
and the other died soon after in abject poverty.  The notorious &amp;Yahya 
Bey, the Chief of the Police in &amp;Akka, a willing and powerful tool in 
the hand of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, the arch-breaker of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Covenant, witnessed the frustration of all the hopes he had cherished, 
lost his position, and had eventually to beg for pecuniary assistance 
from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  In Constantinople, in the year which witnessed 
the downfall of &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, no less than thirty-one dignitaries 
of the state, including ministers and other high officers of the government, 
among whom numbered redoubtable enemies of the Faith, 
were, in a single day, arrested and condemned to the gallows, a spectacular 
retribution for the part they had played in upholding a 
tyrannical &amp;regime and in endeavoring to extirpate the Faith and its 
institutions.  
     In Persia, apart from the sovereign who had, in the full tide of 
his hopes and the plenitude of his power, been removed from the scene 
in so startling a manner, a number of princes, ministers and mujtahids, 
who had actively participated in the suppression of a persecuted community, 
including &amp;Kamran &amp;Mirza, the &amp;Na'ibu's-Saltanih, the &amp;Jalalu'd-Dawlih 
and &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Asghar &amp;Khan, the &amp;Atabik-i-A'zam, and 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Taqiy-i-Najafi, the "Son of the Wolf," lost, 
one by one, their prestige and authority, sank into obscurity, abandoned 
all hope of achieving their malevolent purpose, and lived, some 
of them, long enough to behold the initial evidences of the ascendancy 
of a Cause they had so greatly feared and so vehemently hated.  
     When we note that in the Holy Land, in Persia, and in the United 
States of America certain exponents of Christian ecclesiasticism such as 
Vatralsky, Wilson, Richardson or Easton, observing, and in some 
cases fearing, the vigorous advances made by the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in Christian lands, arose to stem its progress; and when we watch the 
recent and steady deterioration of their influence, the decline of their 
power, the confusion in their ranks and the dissolution of some 
of their old standing missions and institutions, in Europe, in the 
Middle East and in Eastern Asia--may we not attribute this weakening 
to the opposition which members of various Christian sacerdotal 
orders began, in the course of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, to evince 
towards the followers and institutions of a Faith which claims to 
be no less than the fulfilment of the Promise given by Jesus Christ, 
and the establisher of the Kingdom He Himself had prayed for 
and foretold?  
 
+P319 
     And finally, he who, from the moment the Divine Covenant was 
born until the end of his life, showed a hatred more unrelenting than 
that which animated the afore-mentioned adversaries of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
who plotted more energetically than any one of them against Him, 
and afflicted his Father's Faith with a shame more grievous than any 
which its external enemies had inflicted upon it--such a man, together 
with the infamous crew of Covenant-breakers whom he had misled 
and instigated, was condemned to witness, in a growing measure, as 
had been the case with &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and his henchmen, the frustration 
of his evil designs, the evaporation of all his hopes, the exposition 
of his true motives and the complete extinction of his erstwhile honor 
and glory.  His brother, &amp;Mirza &amp;Diya'u'llah, died prematurely; 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan, his dupe, followed that same brother, three years 
later, to the grave; and &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah, his chief accomplice, betrayed 
his cause, published a signed denunciation of his evil acts, but 
rejoined him again, only to be alienated from him in consequence of 
the scandalous behavior of his own daughter.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali's 
half-sister, &amp;Furughiyyih, died of cancer, whilst her husband, Siyyid 
&amp;Ali, passed away from a heart attack before his sons could reach him, 
the eldest being subsequently stricken in the prime of life, by the same 
malady.  &amp;Muhammad-Javad-i-Qazvini, a notorious Covenant-breaker, 
perished miserably.  &amp;Shu'a'u'llah who, as witnessed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
in His Will, had counted on the murder of the Center of the Covenant, 
and who had been despatched to the United States by his 
father to join forces with &amp;Ibrahim &amp;Khayru'llah, returned crestfallen 
and empty-handed from his inglorious mission.  &amp;Jamal-i-Burujirdi, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali's ablest lieutenant in Persia, fell a prey to a 
fatal and loathsome disease; Siyyid &amp;Mihdiy-i-Dahaji, who, betraying 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, joined the Covenant-breakers, died in obscurity and 
poverty, followed by his wife and his two sons; &amp;Mirza &amp;Husayn-'Aliy-i-Jahrumi, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Husayn-i-Shiraziy-i-Khurtumi and &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Husayn-i-Kashani, 
who represented the arch-breaker of the 
Covenant in Persia, India and Egypt, failed utterly in their missions; 
whilst the greedy and conceited &amp;Ibrahim-i-Khayru'llah, who had 
chosen to uphold the banner of his rebellion in America for no less 
than twenty years, and who had the temerity to denounce, in writing, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, His "false teachings, His misrepresentations of Bahaism, 
His dissimulation," and to stigmatize His visit to America as "a death-blow" 
to the "Cause of God," met his death soon after he had uttered 
these denunciations, utterly abandoned and despised by the entire 
body of the members of a community, whose founders he himself 
 
+P320 
had converted to the Faith, and in the very land that bore witness to 
the multiplying evidences of the established ascendancy of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
Whose authority he had, in his later years, vowed to uproot.  
     As to those who had openly espoused the cause of this arch-breaker 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, or who had secretly sympathized with him, 
whilst outwardly supporting &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, some eventually repented 
and were forgiven; others became disillusioned and lost their faith 
entirely; a few apostatized, whilst the rest dwindled away, leaving him 
in the end, except for a handful of his relatives, alone and unsupported.  
Surviving &amp;Abdu'l-Baha by almost twenty years, he who had 
so audaciously affirmed to His face that he had no assurance he might 
outlive Him, lived long enough to witness the utter bankruptcy of 
his cause, leading meanwhile a wretched existence within the walls 
of a Mansion that had once housed a crowd of his supporters; was 
denied by the civil authorities, as a result of the crisis he had after 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing foolishly precipitated, the official custody of 
his Father's Tomb; was compelled, a few years later, to vacate that 
same Mansion, which, through his flagrant neglect, had fallen into a 
dilapidated condition; was stricken with paralysis which crippled half 
his body; lay bedridden in pain for months before he died; and was 
buried according to Muslim rites, in the immediate vicinity of a local 
Muslim shrine, his grave remaining until the present day devoid of 
even a tombstone--a pitiful reminder of the hollowness of the claims 
he had advanced, of the depths of infamy to which he had sunk, and 
of the severity of the retribution his acts had so richly merited.

                                 CHAPTER XXII 
                      The Rise and Establishment of the 
                             Administrative Order 
 
     With the passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha the first century of the &amp;Baha'i 
era, whose inception had synchronized with His birth, had run more 
than three quarters of its course.  Seventy-seven years previously the 
light of the Faith proclaimed by the &amp;Bab had risen above the horizon 
of &amp;Shiraz and flashed across the firmament of Persia, dispelling the age-long 
gloom which had enveloped its people.  A blood bath of unusual 
ferocity, in which government, clergy and people, heedless of the significance 
of that light and blind to its splendor, had jointly participated, 
had all but extinguished the radiance of its glory in the land of 
its birth.  &amp;Baha'u'llah had at the darkest hour in the fortunes of that 
Faith been summoned, while Himself a prisoner in &amp;Tihran, to reinvigorate 
its life, and been commissioned to fulfil its ultimate purpose.  
In &amp;Baghdad, upon the termination of the ten-year delay interposed 
between the first intimation of that Mission and its Declaration, He 
had revealed the Mystery enshrined in the &amp;Bab's embryonic Faith, and 
disclosed the fruit which it had yielded.  In Adrianople &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Message, the promise of the &amp;Babi as well as of all previous Dispensations, 
had been proclaimed to mankind, and its challenge voiced to 
the rulers of the earth in both the East and the West.  Behind the walls 
of the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka the Bearer of God's newborn Revelation 
had ordained the laws and formulated the principles that were to 
constitute the warp and woof of His World Order.  He had, moreover, 
prior to His ascension, instituted the Covenant that was to guide and 
assist in the laying of its foundations and to safeguard the unity of 
its builders.  Armed with that peerless and potent Instrument, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
His eldest Son and Center of His Covenant, had erected the 
standard of His Father's Faith in the North American continent, and 
established an impregnable basis for its institutions in Western Europe, 
in the Far East and in Australia.  He had, in His works, Tablets and 
addresses, elucidated its principles, interpreted its laws, amplified its 
doctrine, and erected the rudimentary institutions of its future Administrative 
Order.  In Russia He had raised its first House of Worship, 
whilst on the slopes of Mt. Carmel He had reared a befitting mausoleum 
 
+P324 
for its Herald, and deposited His remains therein with His Own hands.  
Through His visits to several cities in Europe and the North American 
continent He had broadcast &amp;Baha'u'llah's Message to the peoples 
of the West, and heightened the prestige of the Cause of God to a 
degree it had never previously experienced.  And lastly, in the evening 
of His life, He had through the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine 
Plan issued His mandate to the community which He Himself had 
raised up, trained and nurtured, a Plan that must in the years to come 
enable its members to diffuse the light, and erect the administrative 
fabric, of the Faith throughout the five continents of the globe.  
     The moment had now arrived for that undying, that world-vitalizing 
Spirit that was born in &amp;Shiraz, that had been rekindled in 
&amp;Tihran, that had been fanned into flame in &amp;Baghdad and Adrianople, 
that had been carried to the West, and was now illuminating the 
fringes of five continents, to incarnate itself in institutions designed to 
canalize its outspreading energies and stimulate its growth.  The Age 
that had witnessed the birth and rise of the Faith had now closed.  The 
Heroic, the Apostolic Age of the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, that 
primitive period in which its Founders had lived, in which its life had 
been generated, in which its greatest heroes had struggled and quaffed 
the cup of martyrdom, and its pristine foundations been established--
a period whose splendors no victories in this or any future age, however 
brilliant, can rival--had now terminated with the passing of One 
Whose mission may be regarded as the link binding the Age in which 
the seed of the newborn Message had been incubating and those which 
are destined to witness its efflorescence and ultimate fruition.  
     The Formative Period, the Iron Age, of that Dispensation was now 
beginning, the Age in which the institutions, local, national and 
international, of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah were to take shape, develop 
and become fully consolidated, in anticipation of the third, the last, 
the Golden Age destined to witness the emergence of a world-embracing 
Order enshrining the ultimate fruit of God's latest Revelation to 
mankind, a fruit whose maturity must signalize the establishment of a 
world civilization and the formal inauguration of the Kingdom of the 
Father upon earth as promised by Jesus Christ Himself.  
     To this World Order the &amp;Bab Himself had, whilst a prisoner in the 
mountain fastnesses of &amp;Adhirbayjan, explicitly referred in His Persian 
&amp;Bayan, the Mother-Book of the &amp;Babi Dispensation, had announced its 
advent, and associated it with the name of &amp;Baha'u'llah, Whose Mission 
He Himself had heralded.  "Well is it with Him," is His remarkable 
statement in the sixteenth chapter of the third &amp;Vahid, "who fixeth his 
 
+P325 
gaze upon the Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and rendereth thanks unto his 
Lord!  For He will assuredly be made manifest..."  To this same 
Order &amp;Baha'u'llah Who, in a later period, revealed the laws and principles 
that must govern the operation of that Order, had thus referred 
in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of His Dispensation:  "The 
world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of 
this Most Great Order.  Mankind's ordered life hath been revolutionized 
through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System, the 
like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed."  Its features &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
its great Architect, delineated in His Will and Testament, whilst 
the foundations of its rudimentary institutions are now being laid after 
Him by His followers in the East and in the West in this, the Formative 
Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
     The last twenty-three years of the first &amp;Baha'i century may thus 
be regarded as the initial stage of the Formative Period of the Faith, an 
Age of Transition to be identified with the rise and establishment of 
the Administrative Order, upon which the institutions of the future 
&amp;Baha'i World Commonwealth must needs be ultimately erected in the 
Golden Age that must witness the consummation of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
The Charter which called into being, outlined the features 
and set in motion the processes of, this Administrative Order is none 
other than the Will and Testament of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, His greatest 
legacy to posterity, the brightest emanation of His mind and the mightiest 
instrument forged to insure the continuity of the three ages which 
constitute the component parts of His Father's Dispensation.  
     The Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah had been instituted solely through the 
direct operation of His Will and purpose.  The Will and Testament of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, on the other hand, may be regarded as the offspring 
resulting from that mystic intercourse between Him Who had generated 
the forces of a God-given Faith and the One Who had been 
made its sole Interpreter and was recognized as its perfect Exemplar.  
The creative energies unleashed by the Originator of the Law of God 
in this age gave birth, through their impact upon the mind of Him 
Who had been chosen as its unerring Expounder, to that Instrument, 
the vast implications of which the present generation, even after the 
lapse of twenty-three years, is still incapable of fully apprehending.  
This Instrument can, if we would correctly appraise it, no more be divorced 
from the One Who provided the motivating impulse for its 
creation than from Him Who directly conceived it.  The purpose of 
the Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation had, as already observed, been so 
thoroughly infused into the mind of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and His Spirit had 
 
+P326 
so profoundly impregnated His being, and their aims and motives been 
so completely blended, that to dissociate the doctrine laid down by 
the former from the supreme act associated with the mission of the 
latter would be tantamount to a repudiation of one of the most fundamental 
verities of the Faith.  
     The Administrative Order which this historic Document has established, 
it should be noted, is, by virtue of its origin and character, unique 
in the annals of the world's religious systems.  No Prophet before 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, it can be confidently asserted, not even &amp;Muhammad Whose 
Book clearly lays down the laws and ordinances of the Islamic Dispensation, 
has established, authoritatively and in writing, anything comparable 
to the Administrative Order which the authorized Interpreter 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's teachings has instituted, an Order which, by virtue of 
the administrative principles which its Author has formulated, the 
institutions He has established, and the right of interpretation with 
which He has invested its Guardian, must and will, in a manner unparalleled 
in any previous religion, safeguard from schism the Faith from 
which it has sprung.  Nor is the principle governing its operation 
similar to that which underlies any system, whether theocratic or 
otherwise, which the minds of men have devised for the government 
of human institutions.  Neither in theory nor in practice can the 
Administrative Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah be said to conform 
to any type of democratic government, to any system of autocracy, to 
any purely aristocratic order, or to any of the various theocracies, 
whether Jewish, Christian or Islamic which mankind has witnessed in 
the past.  It incorporates within its structure certain elements which are 
to be found in each of the three recognized forms of secular government, 
is devoid of the defects which each of them inherently possesses, 
and blends the salutary truths which each undoubtedly contains without 
vitiating in any way the integrity of the Divine verities on which 
it is essentially founded.  The hereditary authority which the Guardian 
of the Administrative Order is called upon to exercise, and the right 
of the interpretation of the Holy Writ solely conferred upon him; 
the powers and prerogatives of the Universal House of Justice, possessing 
the exclusive right to legislate on matters not explicitly revealed 
in the Most Holy Book; the ordinance exempting its members from 
any responsibility to those whom they represent, and from the obligation 
to conform to their views, convictions or sentiments; the specific 
provisions requiring the free and democratic election by the mass of the 
faithful of the Body that constitutes the sole legislative organ in the 
world-wide &amp;Baha'i community--these are among the features which 
 
+P327 
combine to set apart the Order identified with the Revelation of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah from any of the existing systems of human government.  
     Nor have the enemies who, at the hour of the inception of this 
Administrative Order, and in the course of its twenty-three year 
existence, both in the East and in the West, from within and from 
without, misrepresented its character, or derided and vilified it, or 
striven to arrest its march, or contrived to create a breach in the ranks 
of its supporters, succeeded in achieving their malevolent purpose.  
The strenuous exertions of an ambitious Armenian, who, in the course 
of the first years of its establishment in Egypt, endeavored to supplant 
it by the "Scientific Society" which in his short-sightedness he had conceived 
and was sponsoring, failed utterly in its purpose.  The agitation 
provoked by a deluded woman who strove diligently both in the 
United States and in England to demonstrate the unauthenticity of 
the Charter responsible for its creation, and even to induce the civil 
authorities of Palestine to take legal action in the matter--a request 
which to her great chagrin was curtly refused--as well as the defection 
of one of the earliest pioneers and founders of the Faith in Germany, 
whom that same woman had so tragically misled, produced no effect 
whatsoever.  The volumes which a shameless apostate composed and 
disseminated, during that same period in Persia, in his brazen efforts 
not only to disrupt that Order but to undermine the very Faith which 
had conceived it, proved similarly abortive.  The schemes devised by 
the remnants of the Covenant-breakers, who immediately the aims 
and purposes of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Will became known arose, headed by 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah, to wrest the custodianship of the holiest shrine in 
the &amp;Baha'i world from its appointed Guardian, likewise came to naught 
and brought further discredit upon them.  The subsequent attacks 
launched by certain exponents of Christian orthodoxy, in both 
Christian and non-Christian lands, with the object of subverting the 
foundations, and distorting the features, of this same Order were 
powerless to sap the loyalty of its upholders or to deflect them from 
their high purpose.  Not even the infamous and insidious machinations 
of a former secretary of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, who, untaught by the 
retribution that befell &amp;Baha'u'llah's amanuensis, as well as by the fate 
that overtook several other secretaries and interpreters of His Master, 
in both the East and the West, has arisen, and is still exerting himself, 
to pervert the purpose and nullify the essential provisions of the immortal 
Document from which that Order derives its authority, have 
been able to stay even momentarily the march of its institutions along 
the course set for it by its Author, or to create anything that might, 
 
+P328 
however remotely, resemble a breach in the ranks of its assured, its 
wide-awake and stalwart supporters.  
     The Document establishing that Order, the Charter of a future 
world civilization, which may be regarded in some of its features as 
supplementary to no less weighty a Book than the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas; 
signed and sealed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; entirely written with His own 
hand; its first section composed during one of the darkest periods of 
His incarceration in the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka, proclaims, categorically 
and unequivocally, the fundamental beliefs of the followers 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah; reveals, in unmistakable language, the twofold 
character of the Mission of the &amp;Bab; discloses the full station of the 
Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation; asserts that "all others are servants 
unto Him and do His bidding"; stresses the importance of the 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas; establishes the institution of the Guardianship as a 
hereditary office and outlines its essential functions; provides the 
measures for the election of the International House of Justice, defines 
its scope and sets forth its relationship to that Institution; prescribes 
the obligations, and emphasizes the responsibilities, of the Hands of the 
Cause of God; and extolls the virtues of the indestructible Covenant 
established by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  That Document, furthermore, lauds the 
courage and constancy of the supporters of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant; 
expatiates on the sufferings endured by its appointed Center; recalls 
the infamous conduct of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and his failure to heed the 
warnings of the &amp;Bab; exposes, in a series of indictments, the perfidy 
and rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, and the complicity of his 
son &amp;Shu'a'u'llah and of his brother &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah; reaffirms their 
excommunication, and predicts the frustration of all their hopes; 
summons the &amp;Afnan (the &amp;Bab's kindred), the Hands of the Cause 
and the entire company of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah to arise 
unitedly to propagate His Faith, to disperse far and wide, to labor 
tirelessly and to follow the heroic example of the Apostles of Jesus 
Christ; warns them against the dangers of association with the 
Covenant-breakers, and bids them shield the Cause from the assaults 
of the insincere and the hypocrite; and counsels them to demonstrate 
by their conduct the universality of the Faith they have espoused, and 
vindicate its high principles.  In that same Document its Author 
reveals the significance and purpose of the &amp;Huququ'llah (Right of 
God), already instituted in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas; enjoins submission and 
fidelity towards all monarchs who are just; expresses His longing for 
martyrdom, and voices His prayers for the repentance as well as the 
forgiveness of His enemies.  
 
+P329 
     Obedient to the summons issued by the Author of so momentous 
a Document; conscious of their high calling; galvanized into action by 
the shock sustained through the unexpected and sudden removal of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha; guided by the Plan which He, the Architect of the 
Administrative Order, had entrusted to their hands; undeterred by the 
attacks directed against it by betrayers and enemies, jealous of its 
gathering strength and blind to its unique significance, the members 
of the widely-scattered &amp;Baha'i communities, in both the East and the 
West, arose with clear vision and inflexible determination to inaugurate 
the Formative Period of their Faith by laying the foundations 
of that world-embracing Administrative system designed to evolve 
into a World Order which posterity must acclaim as the promise and 
crowning glory of all the Dispensations of the past.  Not content with 
the erection and consolidation of the administrative machinery provided 
for the preservation of the unity and the efficient conduct of the 
affairs of a steadily expanding community, the followers of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah resolved, in the course of the two decades following 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing, to assert and demonstrate by their acts the 
independent character of that Faith, to enlarge still further its limits 
and swell the number of its avowed supporters.  
     In this triple world-wide effort, it should be noted, the &amp;role played 
by the American &amp;Baha'i community, since the passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
until the termination of the first &amp;Baha'i century, has been 
such as to lend a tremendous impetus to the development of the Faith 
throughout the world, to vindicate the confidence placed in its members 
by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself, and to justify the high praise He 
bestowed upon them and the fond hopes He entertained for their 
future.  Indeed so preponderating has been the influence of its members 
in both the initiation and the consolidation of &amp;Baha'i administrative 
institutions that their country may well deserve to be recognized 
as the cradle of the Administrative Order which &amp;Baha'u'llah 
Himself had envisaged and which the Will of the Center of His 
Covenant had called into being.  
     It should be borne in mind in this connection that the preliminary 
steps aiming at the disclosure of the scope and working of this Administrative 
Order, which was now to be formally established after 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing, had already been taken by Him, and even by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in the years preceding His ascension.  The appointment by 
Him of certain outstanding believers in Persia as "Hands of the Cause"; 
the initiation of local Assemblies and boards of consultation by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in leading &amp;Baha'i centers in both the East and the West; 
 
+P330 
the formation of the &amp;Baha'i Temple Unity in the United States of 
America; the establishment of local funds for the promotion of &amp;Baha'i 
activities; the purchase of property dedicated to the Faith and its 
future institutions; the founding of publishing societies for the dissemination 
of &amp;Baha'i literature; the erection of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
of the &amp;Baha'i world; the construction of the &amp;Bab's mausoleum 
on Mt. Carmel; the institution of hostels for the accommodation of 
itinerant teachers and pilgrims--these may be regarded as the precursors 
of the institutions which, immediately after the closing of the 
Heroic Age of the Faith, were to be permanently and systematically 
established throughout the &amp;Baha'i world.  
     No sooner had the provisions of that Divine Charter, delineating 
the features of the Administrative Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
been disclosed to His followers than they set about erecting, upon the 
foundations which the lives of the heroes, the saints and martyrs of 
that Faith had laid, the first stage of the framework of its administrative 
institutions.  Conscious of the necessity of constructing, as a 
first step, a broad and solid base upon which the pillars of that mighty 
structure could subsequently be raised; fully aware that upon these 
pillars, when firmly established, the dome, the final unit crowning the 
entire edifice, must eventually rest; undeflected in their course by the 
crisis which the Covenant-breakers had precipitated in the Holy Land, 
or the agitation which the stirrers of mischief had provoked in Egypt, 
or the disturbances resulting from the seizure by the &amp;Shi'ah community 
of the House of &amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Baghdad, or the growing dangers 
confronting the Faith in Russia, or the scorn and ridicule which 
had greeted the initial activities of the American &amp;Baha'i community 
from certain quarters that had completely misapprehended their purpose, 
the pioneer builders of a divinely-conceived Order undertook, in 
complete unison, and despite the great diversity in their outlook, customs 
and languages, the double task of establishing and of consolidating 
their local councils, elected by the rank and file of the believers, 
and designed to direct, coordinate and extend the activities of the followers 
of a far-flung Faith.  In Persia, in the United States of America, 
in the Dominion of Canada, in the British Isles, in France, in Germany, 
in Austria, in India, in Burma, in Egypt, in &amp;Iraq, in Russian &amp;Turkistan, 
in the Caucasus, in Australia, in New Zealand, in South Africa, in 
Turkey, in Syria, in Palestine, in Bulgaria, in Mexico, in the Philippine 
Islands, in Jamaica, in Costa Rica, in Guatemala, in Honduras, in San 
Salvador, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in Chile, in Brazil, in Ecuador, in 
Colombia, in Paraguay, in Peru, in Alaska, in Cuba, in Haiti, in 
 
+P331 
Japan, in the Hawaiian Islands, in Tunisia, in Puerto Rico, in 
&amp;Baluchistan, in Russia, in Transjordan, in Lebanon, and in 
Abyssinia such councils, constituting the basis of the rising 
Order of a long-persecuted Faith, were gradually established.  Designated 
as "Spiritual Assemblies"--an appellation that must in the 
course of time be replaced by their permanent and more descriptive title 
of "Houses of Justice," bestowed upon them by the Author of the &amp;Baha'i 
Revelation; instituted, without any exception, in every city, town and 
village where nine or more adult believers are resident; annually and 
directly elected, on the first day of the greatest &amp;Baha'i Festival by all 
adult believers, men and women alike; invested with an authority 
rendering them unanswerable for their acts and decisions to those 
who elect them; solemnly pledged to follow, under all conditions, the 
dictates of the "Most Great Justice" that can alone usher in the reign 
of the "Most Great Peace" which &amp;Baha'u'llah has proclaimed and must 
ultimately establish; charged with the responsibility of promoting at all 
times the best interests of the communities within their jurisdiction, of 
familiarizing them with their plans and activities and of inviting them 
to offer any recommendations they might wish to make; cognizant of 
their no less vital task of demonstrating, through association with all 
liberal and humanitarian movements, the universality and comprehensiveness 
of their Faith; dissociated entirely from all sectarian organizations, 
whether religious or secular; assisted by committees annually 
appointed by, and directly responsible to, them, to each of which a 
particular branch of &amp;Baha'i activity is assigned for study and action; 
supported by local funds to which all believers voluntarily contribute; 
these Assemblies, the representatives and custodians of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, numbering, at the present time, several hundred, and 
whose membership is drawn from the diversified races, creeds and 
classes constituting the world-wide &amp;Baha'i community, have, in the 
course of the last two decades, abundantly demonstrated, by virtue 
of their achievements, their right to be regarded as the chief sinews of 
&amp;Baha'i society, as well as the ultimate foundation of its administrative 
structure.  
     "The Lord hath ordained," is &amp;Baha'u'llah's injunction in His 
&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, "that in every city a House of Justice be established, 
wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of &amp;Baha (9), and 
should it exceed this number, it doth not matter.  It behoveth them 
to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men, and to regard themselves 
as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth.  It 
is incumbent upon them to take counsel together, and to have regard 
 
+P332 
for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they 
regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and 
seemly."  "These Spiritual Assemblies," is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's testimony, in 
a Tablet addressed to an American believer, "are aided by the Spirit of 
God.  Their defender is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Over them He spreadeth His 
Wings.  What bounty is there greater than this?"  "These Spiritual 
Assemblies," He, in that same Tablet has declared, "are shining lamps 
and heavenly gardens, from which the fragrances of holiness are diffused 
over all regions, and the lights of knowledge are shed abroad 
over all created things.  From them the spirit of life streameth in every 
direction.  They, indeed, are the potent sources of the progress of man, 
at all times and under all conditions."  Establishing beyond any doubt 
their God-given authority, He has written:  "It is incumbent upon 
every one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual Assembly, 
and all must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding, and 
be submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well 
arranged."  "If after discussion," He, furthermore has written, "a decision 
be carried unanimously, well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, 
differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must prevail."  
     Having established the structure of their local Assemblies--the base 
of the edifice which the Architect of the Administrative Order of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah had directed them to erect--His disciples, in both 
the East and the West, unhesitatingly embarked on the next and more 
difficult stage, of their high enterprise.  In countries where the local 
&amp;Baha'i communities had sufficiently advanced in number and in 
influence measures were taken for the initiation of National Assemblies, 
the pivots round which all national undertakings must revolve.  
Designated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His Will as the "Secondary Houses of 
Justice," they constitute the electoral bodies in the formation of the 
International House of Justice, and are empowered to direct, unify, 
coordinate and stimulate the activities of individuals as well as local 
Assemblies within their jurisdiction.  Resting on the broad base of 
organized local communities, themselves pillars sustaining the institution 
which must be regarded as the apex of the &amp;Baha'i Administrative 
Order, these Assemblies are elected, according to the principle of proportional 
representation, by delegates representative of &amp;Baha'i local 
communities assembled at Convention during the period of the &amp;Ridvan 
Festival; are possessed of the necessary authority to enable them to 
insure the harmonious and efficient development of &amp;Baha'i activity 
within their respective spheres; are freed from all direct responsibility 
for their policies and decisions to their electorates; are charged with the 
 
+P333 
sacred duty of consulting the views, of inviting the recommendations 
and of securing the confidence and cooperation of the delegates and of 
acquainting them with their plans, problems and actions; and are supported 
by the resources of national funds to which all ranks of the 
faithful are urged to contribute.  Instituted in the United States of 
America (1925) (the National Assembly superseding in that country 
the institution of &amp;Baha'i Temple Unity formed during &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
ministry), in the British Isles (1923), in Germany (1923), in Egypt 
(1924), in &amp;Iraq (1931), in India (1923), in Persia (1934) and in 
Australia (1934); their election renewed annually by delegates whose 
number has been fixed, according to national requirements, at 9, 19, 
95, or 171 (9 times 19), these national bodies have through their 
emergence signalized the birth of a new epoch in the Formative Age 
of the Faith, and marked a further stage in the evolution, the unification 
and consolidation of a continually expanding community.  Aided 
by national committees responsible to and chosen by them, without 
discrimination, from among the entire body of the believers within their 
jurisdiction, and to each of which a particular sphere of &amp;Baha'i service 
is allocated, these &amp;Baha'i National Assemblies have, as the scope of their 
activities steadily enlarged, proved themselves, through the spirit of 
discipline which they have inculcated and through their uncompromising 
adherence to principles which have enabled them to rise above 
all prejudices of race, nation, class and color, capable of administering, 
in a remarkable fashion, the multiplying activities of a newly-consolidated 
Faith.  
     Nor have the national committees themselves been less energetic 
and devoted in the discharge of their respective functions.  In the 
defense of the Faith's vital interests, in the exposition of its doctrine; 
in the dissemination of its literature; in the consolidation of its 
finances; in the organization of its teaching force; in the furtherance 
of the solidarity of its component parts; in the purchase of its historic 
sites; in the preservation of its sacred records, treasures and relics; in 
its contacts with the various institutions of the society of which it 
forms a part; in the education of its youth; in the training of its 
children; in the improvement of the status of its women adherents 
in the East; the members of these diversified agencies, operating under 
the aegis of the elected national representatives of the &amp;Baha'i community, 
have amply demonstrated their capacity to promote effectively 
its vital and manifold interests.  The mere enumeration of the 
national committees which, originating mostly in the West and functioning 
with exemplary efficiency in the United States and Canada, 
 
+P334 
now carry on their activities with a vigor and a unity of purpose 
which sharply contrast with the effete institutions of a moribund 
civilization, would suffice to reveal the scope of these auxiliary institutions 
which an evolving Administrative Order, still in the secondary 
stage of its development, has set in motion:  The Teaching Committee, 
the Regional Teaching Committees; the Inter-America Committee; 
the Publishing Committee; the Race Unity Committee; the 
Youth Committee; the Reviewing Committee; The Temple Maintenance 
Committee; the Temple Program Committee; the Temple 
Guides Committee; the Temple Librarian and Sales Committee; the 
Boys' and Girls' Service Committees; the Child Education Committee; 
the Women's Progress, Teaching, and Program Committees; the 
Legal Committee; the Archives and History Committee; the Census 
Committee; the &amp;Baha'i Exhibits Committee; the &amp;Baha'i News Committee; 
the &amp;Baha'i News Service Committee; the Braille Transcriptions 
Committee; the Contacts Committee; the Service Committee; the Editorial 
Committee; the Index Committee; the Library Committee; the 
Radio Committee; the Accountant Committee; the Annual Souvenir 
Committee; the &amp;Baha'i World Editorial Committee; the Study Outline 
Committee; the International Auxiliary Language Committee; 
the Institute of &amp;Baha'i Education Committee; the World Order Magazine 
Committee; the &amp;Baha'i Public Relations Committee; the &amp;Baha'i 
Schools Committee; the Summer Schools Committee; the International 
School Committee; the Pamphlet Literature Committee; the 
&amp;Baha'i Cemetery Committee; the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds Committee; the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar Committee; the Assembly Development Committee; 
the National History Committee; the Miscellaneous Materials 
Committee; the Free Literature Committee; the Translation Committee; 
the Cataloguing Tablets Committee; the Editing Tablets 
Committee; the Properties Committee; the Adjustments Committee; 
the Publicity Committee; the East and West Committee; the Welfare 
Committee; the Transcription of Tablets Committee; the Traveling 
Teachers Committee; the &amp;Baha'i Education Committee; the Holy 
Sites Committee; the Children's Savings Bank Committee.  
     The establishment of local and national Assemblies and the subsequent 
formation of local and national committees, acting as necessary 
adjuncts to the elected representatives of &amp;Baha'i communities in both 
the East and the West, however remarkable in themselves, were but a 
prelude to a series of undertakings on the part of the newly formed 
National Assemblies, which have contributed in no small measure to 
the unification of the &amp;Baha'i world community and the consolidation 
 
+P335 
of its Administrative Order.  The initial step taken in that direction 
was the drafting and adoption of a &amp;Baha'i National constitution, first 
framed and promulgated by the elected representatives of the American 
&amp;Baha'i Community in 1927, the text of which has since, with 
slight variations suited to national requirements, been translated into 
Arabic, German and Persian, and constitutes, at the present time, the 
charter of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the &amp;Baha'is of the 
United States and Canada, of the British Isles, of Germany, of Persia, 
of &amp;Iraq, of India and Burma, of Egypt and the Sudan and of Australia 
and New Zealand.  Heralding the formulation of the constitution of 
the future &amp;Baha'i World Community; submitted for the consideration 
of all local Assemblies and ratified by the entire body of the recognized 
believers in countries possessing national Assemblies, this national 
constitution has been supplemented by a similar document, containing the 
by-laws of &amp;Baha'i local assemblies, first drafted by the New York 
&amp;Baha'i community in November, 1931, and accepted as a pattern for 
all local &amp;Baha'i constitutions.  The text of this national constitution 
comprises a Declaration of Trust, whose articles set forth the character 
and objects of the national &amp;Baha'i community, establish the functions, 
designate the central office, and describe the official seal, of the body of 
its elected representatives, as well as a set of by-laws which define the 
status, the mode of election, the powers and duties of both local and 
national Assemblies, describe the relation of the National Assembly 
to the International House of Justice as well as to local Assemblies and 
individual believers, outline the rights and obligations of the National 
Convention and its relation to the National Assembly, disclose the 
character of &amp;Baha'i elections, and lay down the requirements of voting 
membership in all &amp;Baha'i communities.  
     The framing of these constitutions, both local and national, identical 
to all intents and purposes in their provisions, provided the necessary 
foundation for the legal incorporation of these administrative 
institutions in accordance with civil statutes controlling religious or 
commercial bodies.  Giving these Assemblies a legal standing, this 
incorporation greatly consolidated their power and enlarged their capacity, 
and in this regard the achievement of the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of the United States and Canada and the Spiritual 
Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of New York again set an example worthy 
of emulation by their sister Assemblies in both the East and the 
West.  The incorporation of the American National Spiritual Assembly 
as a voluntary Trust, a species of corporation recognized under 
the common law, enabling it to enter into contract, hold property and 
 
+P336 
receive bequests by virtue of a certificate issued in May, 1929, under 
the seal of the Department of State in Washington and bearing the 
signature of the Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, was followed 
by the adoption of similar legal measures resulting in the successive 
incorporation of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of 
India and Burma, in January, 1933, in Lahore, in the state of Punjab, 
according to the provisions of the Societies Registration Act of 1860; 
of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Egypt and the 
Sudan, in December, 1934, as certified by the Mixed Court in Cairo; 
of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia and 
New Zealand, in January, 1938, as witnessed by the Deputy Registrar 
at the General Registry Office for the state of South Australia; and 
more recently of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of the 
British Isles, in August, 1939, as an unlimited non-profit company, 
under the Companies Act, 1929, and certified by the Assistant Registrar 
of Companies in the City of London.  
     Parallel with the legal incorporation of these National Assemblies 
a far larger number of &amp;Baha'i local Assemblies were similarly incorporated, 
following the example set by the Chicago &amp;Baha'i Assembly in 
February, 1932, in countries as far apart as the United States of 
America, India, Mexico, Germany, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, 
Burma, Costa Rica, &amp;Baluchistan and the Hawaiian Islands.  The 
Spiritual Assemblies of the &amp;Baha'is of Esslingen in Germany, of 
Mexico City in Mexico, of San &amp;Jose in Costa Rica, of Sydney and 
Adelaide in Australia, of Auckland in New Zealand, of Delhi, 
Bombay, Karachi, Poona, Calcutta, Secunderabad, Bangalore, Vellore, 
Ahmedabad, Serampore, Andheri and Baroda in India, of Tuetta 
in &amp;Baluchistan, of Rangoon, Mandalay and Daidanow-Kalazoo in 
Burma, of Montreal and Vancouver in Canada, of Honolulu in the 
Hawaiian Islands, and of Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., 
Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Kenosha, Teaneck, Racine, 
Detroit, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, 
Winnetka, Phoenix, Columbus, Lima, Portland, Jersey City, 
Wilmette, Peoria, Seattle, Binghamton, Helena, Richmond Highlands, 
Miami, Pasadena, Oakland, Indianapolis, St. Paul, Berkeley, 
Urbana, Springfield and Flint in the United States of America--
all these succeeded, gradually and after submitting the text of almost 
identical &amp;Baha'i local constitutions to the civil authorities in their 
respective states or provinces, in constituting themselves into societies 
and corporations recognized by law, and protected by the civil 
statutes operating in their respective countries.  
 
+P337 
     Just as the formulation of &amp;Baha'i constitutions had provided the 
foundation for the incorporation of &amp;Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies, so 
did the recognition accorded by local and national authorities to the 
elected representatives of &amp;Baha'i communities pave the way for the 
establishment of national and local &amp;Baha'i endowments--a historic 
undertaking which, as had been the case with previous achievements 
of far-reaching importance, the American &amp;Baha'i Community was 
the first to initiate.  In most cases these endowments, owing to their 
religious character, have been exempted from both government and 
municipal taxes, as a result of representations made by the incorporated 
&amp;Baha'i bodies to the civil authorities, though the value of the 
properties thus exempted has, in more than one country, amounted 
to a considerable sum.  
     In the United States of America the national endowments of the 
Faith, already representing one and three-quarter million dollars of 
assets, and established through a series of Indentures of Trust, created 
in 1928, 1929, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1941 and 1942 by the National 
Spiritual Assembly in that country, acting as Trustees of the American 
&amp;Baha'i Community, now include the land and structure of the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and the caretaker's cottage in Wilmette, Ill.; the 
adjoining &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds (&amp;Baha'i National Headquarters) and its 
supplementary administrative office; the Inn, the Fellowship House, 
the &amp;Baha'i Hall, the Arts and Crafts Studio, a farm, a number of 
cottages, several parcels of land, including the holding on Monsalvat, 
blessed by the footsteps of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, in Green Acre, in the state 
of Maine; Bosch House, the &amp;Baha'i Hall, a fruit orchard, the Redwood 
Grove, a dormitory and Ranch Buildings in Geyserville, Calif.; Wilhelm 
House, Evergreen Cabin, a pine grove and seven lots with buildings 
at West Englewood, N.J., the scene of the memorable Unity 
Feast given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, in June, 1912, to the &amp;Baha'is of the 
New York Metropolitan district; Wilson House, blessed by His presence, 
and land in Malden, Mass.; Mathews House and Ranch Buildings 
in Pine Valley, Colo.; land in Muskegon, Mich., and a cemetery lot 
in Portsmouth, N.H.  
     Of even greater importance, and in their aggregate far surpassing 
in value the national endowments of the American &amp;Baha'i community, 
though their title-deeds are, owing to the inability of the Persian &amp;Baha'i 
community to incorporate its national and local assemblies, held in 
trust by individuals, are the assets which the Faith now possesses in 
the land of its origin.  To the House of the &amp;Bab in &amp;Shiraz and the 
ancestral Home of &amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Takur, &amp;Mazindaran, already in the 
 
+P338 
possession of the community in the days of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, 
have, since His ascension, been added extensive properties, in the outskirts 
of the capital, situated on the slopes of Mt. Alburz, overlooking 
the native city of &amp;Baha'u'llah, including a farm, a garden and vineyard, 
comprising an area of over three million and a half square 
meters, preserved as the future site of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in 
Persia.  Other acquisitions that have greatly extended the range of 
&amp;Baha'i endowments in that country include the House in which 
&amp;Baha'u'llah was born in &amp;Tihran; several buildings adjoining the House 
of the &amp;Bab in &amp;Shiraz, including the house owned by His maternal 
uncle; the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds in &amp;Tihran; the shop occupied by the &amp;Bab 
during the years He was a merchant in &amp;Bushihr; a quarter of the village 
of &amp;Chihriq, where He was confined; the house of &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Jani, where He tarried on His way to &amp;Tabriz; the public bath used by 
Him in &amp;Shiraz and some adjacent houses; half of the house owned by 
&amp;Vahid in &amp;Nayriz and part of the house owned by &amp;Hujjat in &amp;Zanjan; 
the three gardens rented by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the hamlet of &amp;Badasht; 
the burial-place of &amp;Quddus in &amp;Barfurush; the house of Kalantar in 
&amp;Tihran, the scene of &amp;Tahirih's confinement; the public bath visited by 
the &amp;Bab when in &amp;Urumiyyih, &amp;Adhirbayjan; the house owned by 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Husayn-'Aliy-i-Nur, where the &amp;Bab's remains had been concealed; 
the &amp;Babiyyih and the house owned by &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn in &amp;Mashhad; 
the residence of the &amp;Sultanu'sh-Shuhada (King of Martyrs) and 
of the &amp;Mahbubu'sh-Shuhada (Beloved of Martyrs) in &amp;Isfahan, as well 
as a considerable number of sites and houses, including burial-places, 
associated with the heroes and martyrs of the Faith.  These holdings 
which, with very few exceptions, have been recently acquired in 
Persia, are now being preserved and yearly augmented, and, whenever 
necessary, carefully restored, through the assiduous efforts of a specially 
appointed national committee, acting under the constant and 
general supervision of the elected representatives of the Persian 
believers.  
     Nor should mention be omitted of the varied and multiplying 
national assets which, ever since the inception of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, have been steadily acquired in other 
countries such as India, Burma, the British Isles, Germany, &amp;Iraq, 
Egypt, Australia, Transjordan and Syria.  Among these may be specially 
mentioned the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds of the &amp;Baha'is of &amp;Iraq, the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds of the &amp;Baha'is of Egypt, the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds of the 
&amp;Baha'is of India, the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds of the &amp;Baha'is of Australia, the 
&amp;Baha'i Home in Esslingen, the Publishing Trust of the &amp;Baha'is of the 
 
+P339 
British Isles, the &amp;Baha'i Pilgrim House in &amp;Baghdad, and the &amp;Baha'i 
Cemeteries established in the capitals of Persia, Egypt and &amp;Turkistan.  
Whether in the form of land, schools, administrative headquarters, 
secretariats, libraries, cemeteries, hostels or publishing companies, these 
widely scattered assets, partly registered in the name of incorporated 
National Assemblies, and partly held in trust by individual recognized 
believers, have contributed their share to the uninterrupted expansion 
of national &amp;Baha'i endowments in recent years as well as to the consolidation 
of their foundations.  Of vital importance, though less 
notable in significance, have been, moreover, the local endowments 
which have supplemented the national assets of the Faith and which, 
in consequence of the incorporation of &amp;Baha'i local Assemblies, have 
been legally established and safeguarded in various countries in both 
the East and the West.  Particularly in Persia these holdings, whether 
in the form of land, administrative buildings, schools or other institutions, 
have greatly enriched and widened the scope of the local 
endowments of the world-wide &amp;Baha'i community.  
     Simultaneous with the establishment and incorporation of local 
and national &amp;Baha'i Assemblies, with the formation of their respective 
committees, the formulation of national and local &amp;Baha'i constitutions 
and the founding of &amp;Baha'i endowments, undertakings of great institutional 
significance were initiated by these newly founded Assemblies, 
among which the institution of the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds--the seat of the 
&amp;Baha'i National Assembly and pivot of all &amp;Baha'i administrative 
activity in future--must rank as one of the most important.  Originating 
first in Persia, now universally known by its official and distinctive 
title signifying "the Sacred Fold," marking a notable advance 
in the evolution of a process whose beginnings may be traced to the 
clandestine gatherings held at times underground and in the dead of 
night, by the persecuted followers of the Faith in that country, this 
institution, still in the early stages of its development, has already lent 
its share to the consolidation of the internal functions of the organic 
&amp;Baha'i community, and provided a further visible evidence of its 
steady growth and rising power.  Complementary in its functions to 
those of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar--an edifice exclusively reserved for 
&amp;Baha'i worship--this institution, whether local or national, will, as its 
component parts, such as the Secretariat, the Treasury, the Archives, 
the Library, the Publishing Office, the Assembly Hall, the Council 
Chamber, the Pilgrims' Hostel, are brought together and made jointly 
to operate in one spot, be increasingly regarded as the focus of all 
&amp;Baha'i administrative activity, and symbolize, in a befitting manner, 
 
+P340 
the ideal of service animating the &amp;Baha'i community in its relation alike 
to the Faith and to mankind in general.  
     From the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, ordained as a house of worship by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, the representatives of &amp;Baha'i communities, 
both local and national, together with the members of their 
respective committees, will, as they gather daily within its walls at the 
hour of dawn, derive the necessary inspiration that will enable them 
to discharge, in the course of their day-to-day exertions in the 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds--the scene of their administrative activities--their 
duties and responsibilities as befits the chosen stewards of His Faith.  
     Already on the shores of Lake Michigan, in the outskirts of the 
first &amp;Baha'i center established in the American continent and under 
the shadow of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West; in the capital 
city of Persia, the cradle of the Faith; in the vicinity of the Most Great 
House in &amp;Baghdad; in the city of &amp;Ishqabad, adjoining the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world; in the capital of Egypt, the foremost 
center of both the Arab and Islamic worlds; in Delhi, the capital city 
of India and even in Sydney in far-off Australia, initial steps have been 
taken which must eventually culminate in the establishment, in all 
their splendor and power, of the national administrative seats of the 
&amp;Baha'i communities established in these countries.  
     Locally, moreover, in the above-mentioned countries, as well as in 
several others, the preliminary measures for the establishment of this 
institution, in the form of a house, either owned or rented by the 
local &amp;Baha'i community, have been taken, foremost among them 
being the numerous administrative buildings which, in various provinces 
of Persia, the believers have, despite the disabilities from which 
they suffer, succeeded in either purchasing or constructing.  
     Equally important as a factor in the evolution of the Administrative 
Order has been the remarkable progress achieved, particularly in 
the United States of America, by the institution of the summer schools 
designed to foster the spirit of fellowship in a distinctly &amp;Baha'i atmosphere, 
to afford the necessary training for &amp;Baha'i teachers, and to provide 
facilities for the study of the history and teachings of the Faith, 
and for a better understanding of its relation to other religions and to 
human society in general.  
     Established in three regional centers, for the three major divisions 
of the North American continent, in Geyserville, in the Californian 
hills (1927), at Green Acre, situated on the banks of the Piscataqua in 
the state of Maine (1929), and at Louhelen Ranch near Davison, 
Michigan (1931), and recently supplemented by the International 
 
+P341 
School founded at Pine Valley, Colorado Springs, dedicated to the 
training of &amp;Baha'i teachers wishing to serve in other lands and especially 
in Latin America, these three embryonic &amp;Baha'i educational 
institutions have, through a steady expansion of their programs, set an 
example worthy of emulation by other &amp;Baha'i communities in both 
the East and the West.  Through the intensive study of &amp;Baha'i Scriptures 
and of the early history of the Faith; through the organization of 
courses on the teachings and history of &amp;Islam; through conferences for 
the promotion of inter-racial amity; through laboratory courses designed 
to familiarize the participants with the processes of the &amp;Baha'i 
Administrative Order; through special sessions devoted to Youth and 
child training; through classes in public speaking; through lectures on 
Comparative Religion; through group discussion on the manifold 
aspects of the Faith; through the establishment of libraries; through 
teaching classes; through courses on &amp;Baha'i ethics and on Latin 
America; through the introduction of winter school sessions; through 
forums and devotional gatherings; through plays and pageants; 
through picnics and other recreational activities, these schools, open 
to &amp;Baha'is and &amp;non-Baha'is alike, have set so noble an example as to 
inspire other &amp;Baha'i communities in Persia, in the British Isles, in Germany, 
in Australia, in New Zealand, in India, in &amp;Iraq and in Egypt 
to undertake the initial measures designed to enable them to build 
along the same lines institutions that bid fair to evolve into the &amp;Baha'i 
universities of the future.  
     Among other factors contributing to the expansion and establishment 
of the Administrative Order may be mentioned the organized 
activities of the &amp;Baha'i Youth, already much advanced in Persia and in 
the United States of America, and launched more recently in India, 
in the British Isles, in Germany, in &amp;Iraq, in Egypt, in Australia, in 
Bulgaria, in the Hawaiian Islands, in Hungary and in Havana.  These 
activities comprise annual world-wide &amp;Baha'i Youth Symposiums, 
Youth sessions at &amp;Baha'i summer schools, youth bulletins and magazines, 
an international correspondence Bureau, facilities for the registration 
of young people desiring to join the Faith, the publication of 
outlines and references for the study of the teachings and the organization 
of a &amp;Baha'i study group as an official university activity in a 
leading American university.  They include, moreover, "study days" 
held in &amp;Baha'i homes and centers, classes for the study of Esperanto and 
other languages, the organization of &amp;Baha'i libraries, the opening of 
reading rooms, the production of &amp;Baha'i plays and pageants, the holding 
of oratorical contests, the education of orphans, the organization of 
 
+P342 
classes in public speaking, the holding of gatherings to perpetuate the 
memory of historical &amp;Baha'i personalities, inter-group regional conferences 
and youth sessions held in connection with &amp;Baha'i annual conventions.  
     Still other factors promoting the development of that Order and 
contributing to its consolidation have been the systematic institution 
of the Nineteen Day Feast, functioning in most &amp;Baha'i communities 
in East and West, with its threefold emphasis on the devotional, the 
administrative and the social aspects of &amp;Baha'i community life; the 
initiation of activities designed to prepare a census of &amp;Baha'i children, 
and provide for them laboratory courses, prayer books and elementary 
literature, and the formulation and publication of a body of authoritative 
statements on the non-political character of the Faith, on membership 
in &amp;non-Baha'i religious organizations, on methods of teaching, 
on the &amp;Baha'i attitude towards war, on the institutions of the Annual 
Convention, of the &amp;Baha'i Spiritual Assembly, of the Nineteen Day 
Feast and of the National Fund.  Reference should, moreover, be made 
to the establishment of National Archives for the authentication, the 
collection, the translation, the cataloguing and the preservation of the 
Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and for the preservation 
of sacred relics and historical documents; to the verification and 
transcription of the original Tablets of the &amp;Bab, of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the possession of Oriental believers; to the compilation 
of a detailed history of the Faith since its inception until the 
present day; to the opening of a &amp;Baha'i International Bureau in 
Geneva; to the holding of &amp;Baha'i district conventions; to the purchase 
of historic sites; to the establishment of &amp;Baha'i memorial libraries, and 
to the initiation of a flourishing children's Savings Bank in Persia.  
     Nor should mention be omitted of the participation, whether 
official or non-official, of representatives of these newly founded 
national &amp;Baha'i communities in the activities and proceedings of a 
great variety of congresses, associations, conventions and conferences, 
held in various countries of Europe, Asia and America for the promotion 
of religious unity, peace, education, international cooperation, 
inter-racial amity and other humanitarian purposes.  With organizations 
such as the Conference of some Living Religions within the 
British Empire, held in London in 1924 and the World Fellowship of 
Faiths held in that same city in 1936; with the Universal Esperanto 
Congresses held annually in various capitals of Europe; with the Institute 
of Intellectual Cooperation; with the Century of Progress Exhibition 
held in Chicago in 1933; with the World's Fair held in New 
 
+P343 
York in 1938 and 1939; with the Golden Gate International Exposition 
held in San Francisco in 1939; with the First Convention of the 
Religious Congress held in Calcutta; with the Second All-India Cultural 
Conference convened in that same city; with the All-Faiths' 
League Convention in Indore; with the Arya Samaj and the Brahmo 
Samaj Conferences as well as those of the Theosophical Society and the 
All-Asian Women's Conference, held in various cities of India; with 
the World Council of Youth; with the Eastern Women's Congress in 
&amp;Tihran; with the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference in Honolulu; with 
the Women's International League for Peace and with the Peoples Conference 
at Buenos Aires in Argentina--with these and others, relationships 
have, in one form or another, been cultivated which have 
served the twofold purpose of demonstrating the universality and 
comprehensiveness of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of forging vital and 
enduring links between them and the far-flung agencies of its 
Administrative Order.  
     Nor should we ignore or underestimate the contacts established 
between these same agencies and some of the highest governmental 
authorities, in both the East and the West, as well as with the heads 
of &amp;Islam in Persia, and with the League of Nations, and with even 
royalty itself for the purpose of defending the rights, or of presenting 
the literature, or of setting forth the aims and purposes of the followers 
of the Faith in their unremitting efforts to champion the cause 
of an infant Administrative Order.  The communications addressed 
by the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of 
the United States and Canada--the champion builders of that Order--
to the Palestine High Commissioner for the restitution of the keys of 
the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah to its custodian; to the &amp;Shah of Persia, on four 
occasions, pleading for justice on behalf of their persecuted brethren 
within his domains; to the Persian Prime Minister on that same subject; 
to Queen Marie of Rumania, expressing gratitude for her historic 
tributes to the &amp;Baha'i Faith; to the Heads of &amp;Islam in Persia, appealing 
for harmony and peace among religions; to King Feisal of &amp;Iraq for the 
purpose of insuring the security of the Most Great House in &amp;Baghdad; 
to the Soviet Authorities on behalf of the &amp;Baha'i communities in 
Russia; to the German authorities regarding the disabilities suffered by 
their German brethren; to the Egyptian Government concerning the 
emancipation of their co-religionists from the yoke of Islamic orthodoxy; 
to the Persian Cabinet in connection with the closing of Persian 
&amp;Baha'i educational institutions; to the State Department of the United 
States Government and the Turkish Ambassador in Washington and 
 
+P344 
the Turkish Cabinet in Ankara, in defense of the interests of the 
Faith in Turkey; to that same State Department in order to facilitate 
the transfer of the remains of Lua Getsinger from the Protestant 
Cemetery in Cairo to the first &amp;Baha'i burial-ground established in 
Egypt; to the Persian Minister in Washington regarding the mission 
of Keith Ransom-Kehler; to the King of Egypt with accompanying 
&amp;Baha'i literature; to the Government of the United States and the 
Canadian Government, setting forth the &amp;Baha'i teachings on Universal 
Peace; to the Rumanian Minister in Washington on behalf of the 
American &amp;Baha'is, on the occasion of the death of Queen Marie of 
Rumania; and to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, acquainting him 
with &amp;Baha'u'llah's summons issued in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas to the Presidents 
of the American Republics and with certain prayers revealed by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha--such communications constitute in themselves a notable 
and illuminating chapter in the history of the unfoldment of the 
&amp;Baha'i Administrative Order.  
     To these must be added the communications addressed from the 
world center of the Faith as well as by &amp;Baha'i national and local assemblies, 
whether telegraphically or in writing, to the Palestine High Commissioner, 
pleading for the delivery of the keys of the Tomb of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to its original keeper; the appeals made by &amp;Baha'i centers 
in East and West to the &amp;Iraqi authorities for the restoration of the 
House of &amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Baghdad; the subsequent appeal made to the 
British Secretary of State for the Colonies, following the verdict of the 
&amp;Baghdad Court of Appeals in that connection; the messages despatched 
to the League of Nations on behalf of &amp;Baha'i communities in the East 
and in the West, in appreciation of the official pronouncement of the 
Council of the League in favor of the claims presented by the &amp;Baha'i 
petitioners, as well as several letters exchanged between the International 
Center of the Faith, on the one hand, and that archetype of 
&amp;Baha'i teachers, Martha Root, on the other, with Queen Marie of Rumania, 
following the publication of her historic appreciations of the 
Faith, and the messages of sympathy addressed to Queen Marie of 
Yugoslavia, on behalf of the world-wide &amp;Baha'i Community, on the 
occasion of the passing of her mother, and to the Duchess of Kent following 
the tragic death of her husband.  
     Nor should we fail to make special mention of the petition forwarded 
by the National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of &amp;Iraq to 
the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, as a result of the 
seizure of &amp;Baha'u'llah's house in &amp;Baghdad, or of the written messages 
sent to King &amp;Ghazi I of &amp;Iraq by that same Assembly, after the death 
 
+P345 
of his father and on the occasion of his marriage, or of its condolences 
conveyed in writing to the present Regent of &amp;Iraq at the time of the 
sudden death of that King, or of the communications of the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Egypt submitted to the Egyptian 
Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior, and the Minister of 
Justice, following the verdict of the Muslim ecclesiastical court in 
Egypt, or of the letters addressed by the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of Persia to the &amp;Shah and to the Persian Cabinet in connection 
with the closing of &amp;Baha'i schools and the ban imposed on 
&amp;Baha'i literature in that country.  Mention should, moreover, be made 
of the written messages despatched by the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &amp;Baha'is of Persia to the King of Rumania and the Royal Family 
on the occasion of the death of his mother, Queen Marie, as well as to 
the Turkish Ambassador in &amp;Tihran enclosing the contribution of the 
Persian believers for the sufferers of the earthquake in Turkey; of 
Martha Root's letters to the late President Von Hindenburg and to 
Dr. Streseman, the German Foreign Minister, accompanying the presentation 
to them of &amp;Baha'i literature; of Keith Ransom-Kehler's seven 
successive petitions addressed to the &amp;Shah of Persia, and of her numerous 
communications to various ministers and high dignitaries of the 
realm, during her memorable visit to that land.  
     Collateral with these first stirrings of the &amp;Baha'i Administrative 
Order, and synchronizing with the emergence of National &amp;Baha'i 
communities and with the institution of their administrative, educational, 
and teaching agencies, the mighty process set in motion in the 
Holy Land, the heart and nerve-center of that Administrative Order, 
on the memorable occasions when &amp;Baha'u'llah revealed the Tablet of 
Carmel and visited the future site of the &amp;Bab's sepulcher, was irresistibly 
unfolding.  That process had received a tremendous impetus 
through the purchase of that site, shortly after &amp;Baha'u'llah's ascension, 
through the subsequent transfer of the &amp;Bab's remains from &amp;Tihran to 
&amp;Akka, through the construction of that sepulcher during the most 
distressful years of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's incarceration, and lastly through 
the permanent interment of those remains in the heart of Mt. Carmel, 
through the establishment of a pilgrim house in the immediate vicinity 
of that sepulcher, and the selection of the future site of the first &amp;Baha'i 
educational institution on that mountain.  
     Profiting from the freedom accorded the world center of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, ever since the ignominious defeat of the decrepit Ottoman 
empire during the war of 1914-18, the forces released through 
the inception of the stupendous Plan conceived by Him could now flow 
 
+P346 
unchecked, under the beneficent influence of a sympathetic &amp;regime, 
into channels designed to disclose to the world at large the potencies 
with which that Plan had been endowed.  The interment of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
Himself within a vault of the &amp;Bab's mausoleum, enhancing still 
further the sacredness of that mountain; the installment of an electric 
plant, the first of its kind established in the city of Haifa, flooding 
with illumination the Grave of One Who, in His own words, had 
been denied even "a lighted lamp" in His fortress-prison in &amp;Adhirbayjan; 
the construction of three additional chambers adjoining His sepulcher, 
thereby completing &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's plan for the first unit of that 
Edifice; the vast extension, despite the machinations of the Covenant-breakers, 
of the properties surrounding that resting-place, sweeping 
from the ridge of Carmel down to the Templar colony nestling at its 
foot, and representing assets estimated at no less than four hundred 
thousand pounds, together with the acquisition of four tracts of land, 
dedicated to the &amp;Baha'i Shrines, and situated in the plain of &amp;Akka to 
the north, in the district of Beersheba to the south, and in the valley of 
the Jordan to the east, amounting to approximately six hundred 
acres; the opening of a series of terraces which, as designed by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, are to provide a direct approach to the &amp;Bab's Tomb 
from the city lying under its shadow; the beautification of its precincts 
through the laying out of parks and gardens, open daily to the public, 
and attracting tourists and residents alike to its gates--these may be 
regarded as the initial evidences of the marvelous expansion of the 
international institutions and endowments of the Faith at its world 
center.  Of particular significance, moreover, has been the exemption 
granted by the Palestine High Commissioner to the entire area of 
land surrounding and dedicated to the Shrine of the &amp;Bab, to the school 
property and the archives in its vicinity, to the Western pilgrim-house 
situated in its neighborhood, and to such historic sites as the Mansion 
in &amp;Bahji, the House of &amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Akka, and the garden of &amp;Ridvan 
to the east of that city; the establishment, as a result of two formal 
applications submitted to the civil authorities, of the Palestine Branches 
of the American and Indian National Spiritual Assemblies, as recognized 
religious societies in Palestine (to be followed, for purposes of 
internal consolidation, by a similar incorporation of the branches of 
other National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the &amp;Baha'i world); 
and the transfer to the Branch of the American National Spiritual 
Assembly, through a series of no less than thirty transactions, of properties 
dedicated to the Tomb of the &amp;Bab, and approximating in their 
aggregate fifty thousand square meters, the majority of the title-deeds 
 
+P347 
of which bear the signature of the son of the Arch-breaker of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant in his capacity as Registrar of lands in Haifa.  
     Equally significant has been the founding on Mt. Carmel of two 
international Archives, the one adjoining the shrine of the &amp;Bab, the 
other in the immediate vicinity of the resting-place of the Greatest 
Holy Leaf, where, for the first time in &amp;Baha'i history, priceless 
treasures, hitherto scattered and often hidden for safekeeping, have 
been collected and are now displayed to visiting pilgrims.  These 
treasures include portraits of both the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah; personal 
relics such as the hair, the dust and garments of the &amp;Bab; the locks and 
blood of &amp;Baha'u'llah and such articles as His pen-case, His garments, 
His brocaded &amp;tajes (head dresses), the &amp;kashkul of His &amp;Sulaymaniyyih 
days, His watch and His &amp;Qur'an; manuscripts and Tablets of 
inestimable value, some of them illuminated, such as part of the Hidden 
Words written in &amp;Baha'u'llah's own hand, the Persian &amp;Bayan, in the 
handwriting of Siyyid &amp;Husayn, the &amp;Bab's amanuensis, the original 
Tablets to the Letters of the Living penned by the &amp;Bab, and the manuscript 
of "Some Answered Questions."  This precious collection, moreover, 
includes objects and effects associated with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; the 
blood-stained garment of the Purest Branch, the ring of &amp;Quddus, the 
sword of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the seals of the &amp;Vazir, the father of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
the brooch presented by the Queen of Rumania to Martha Root, 
the originals of the Queen's letters to her and to others, and of her 
tributes to the Faith, as well as no less than twenty volumes of prayers 
and Tablets revealed by the Founders of the Faith, authenticated and 
transcribed by &amp;Baha'i Assemblies throughout the Orient, and supplementing 
the vast collection of their published writings.  
     Moreover, as a further testimony to the majestic unfoldment and 
progressive consolidation of the stupendous undertaking launched by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah on that holy mountain, may be mentioned the selection of 
a portion of the school property situated in the precincts of the Shrine 
of the &amp;Bab as a permanent resting-place for the Greatest Holy Leaf, 
the "well-beloved" sister of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the "Leaf that hath sprung" 
from the "Pre-existent Root," the "fragrance" of &amp;Baha'u'llah's "shining 
robe," elevated by Him to a "station such as none other woman hath 
surpassed," and comparable in rank to those immortal heroines such as 
Sarah, &amp;Asiyih, the Virgin Mary, &amp;Fatimih and &amp;Tahirih, each of whom 
has outshone every member of her sex in previous Dispensations.  And 
lastly, there should be mentioned, as a further evidence of the blessings 
flowing from the Divine Plan, the transfer, a few years later, to 
that same hallowed spot, after a separation in death of above half a 
 
+P348 
century, and notwithstanding the protests voiced by the brother and 
lieutenant of the arch-breaker of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, of the remains 
of the Purest Branch, the martyred son of &amp;Baha'u'llah, "created 
of the light of &amp;Baha," the "Trust of God" and His "Treasure" in the 
Holy Land, and offered up by his Father as a "ransom" for the regeneration 
of the world and the unification of its peoples.  To this same 
burial-ground, and on the same day the remains of the Purest Branch 
were interred, was transferred the body of his mother, the saintly 
&amp;Navvab, she to whose dire afflictions, as attested by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in a 
Tablet, the 54th chapter of the Book of Isaiah has, in its entirety, borne 
witness, whose "Husband," in the words of that Prophet, is "the Lord 
of Hosts," whose "seed shall inherit the Gentiles," and whom &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in His Tablet, has destined to be "His consort in every one of 
His worlds."  
     The conjunction of these three resting-places, under the shadow 
of the &amp;Bab's own Tomb, embosomed in the heart of Carmel, facing 
the snow-white city across the bay of &amp;Akka, the Qiblih of the &amp;Baha'i 
world, set in a garden of exquisite beauty, reinforces, if we would correctly 
estimate its significance, the spiritual potencies of a spot, designated 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself the seat of God's throne.  It marks, too, 
a further milestone in the road leading eventually to the establishment 
of that permanent world Administrative Center of the future &amp;Baha'i 
Commonwealth, destined never to be separated from, and to function 
in the proximity of, the Spiritual Center of that Faith, in a land already 
revered and held sacred alike by the adherents of three of the world's 
outstanding religious systems.  
     Scarcely less significant has been the erection of the superstructure 
and the completion of the exterior ornamentation of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West, the noblest of the exploits which have 
immortalized the services of the American &amp;Baha'i community to the 
Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Consummated through the agency of an efficiently 
functioning and newly established Administrative Order, this 
enterprise has itself immensely enhanced the prestige, consolidated the 
strength and expanded the subsidiary institutions of the community 
that made its building possible.  
     Conceived forty-one years ago; originating with the petition spontaneously 
addressed, in March 1903 to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha by the "House 
of Spirituality" of the &amp;Baha'is of Chicago--the first &amp;Baha'i center 
established in the Western world--the members of which, inspired by 
the example set by the builders of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of &amp;Ishqabad, 
had appealed for permission to construct a similar Temple in 
 
+P349 
America; blessed by His approval and high commendation in a Tablet 
revealed by Him in June of that same year; launched by the delegates 
of various American Assemblies, assembled in Chicago in November, 
1907, for the purpose of choosing the site of the Temple; established 
on a national basis through a religious corporation known as the "&amp;Baha'i 
Temple Unity," which was incorporated shortly after the first American 
&amp;Baha'i Convention held in that same city in March, 1909; honored 
through the dedication ceremony presided over by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself 
when visiting that site in May, 1912, this enterprise--the crowning 
achievement of the Administrative Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in the first &amp;Baha'i century--had, ever since that memorable 
occasion, been progressing intermittently until the time when the 
foundations of that Order having been firmly laid in the North American 
continent the American &amp;Baha'i community was in a position to 
utilize the instruments which it had forged for the efficient prosecution 
of its task.  
     At the 1914 American &amp;Baha'i Convention the purchase of the 
Temple property was completed.  The 1920 Convention, held in New 
York, having been previously directed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to select the 
design of that Temple, chose from among a number of designs competitively 
submitted to it that of Louis J. Bourgeois, a French-Canadian 
architect, a selection that was later confirmed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself.  
The contracts for the sinking of the nine great caissons supporting 
the central portion of the building, extending to rock at a depth 
of 120 feet below the ground level, and for the construction of the 
basement structure, were successively awarded in December, 1920 and 
August, 1921.  In August, 1930, in spite of the prevailing economic 
crisis, and during a period of unemployment unparalleled in American 
history, another contract, with twenty-four additional sub-contracts, 
for the erection of the superstructure was placed, and the work completed 
by May 1, 1931, on which day the first devotional service in the 
new structure was celebrated, coinciding with the 19th anniversary of 
the dedication of the grounds by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The ornamentation of 
the dome was started in June, 1932 and finished in January, 1934.  The 
ornamentation of the clerestory was completed in July, 1935, and that 
of the gallery unit below it in November, 1938.  The mainstory ornamentation 
was, despite the outbreak of the present war, undertaken in 
April, 1940, and completed in July, 1942; whilst the eighteen circular 
steps were placed in position by December, 1942, seventeen months in 
advance of the centenary celebration of the Faith, by which time the 
exterior of the Temple was scheduled to be finished, and forty years 
 
+P350 
after the petition of the Chicago believers had been submitted to and 
granted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     This unique edifice, the first fruit of a slowly maturing Administrative 
Order, the noblest structure reared in the first &amp;Baha'i century, 
and the symbol and precursor of a future world civilization, is situated 
in the heart of the North American continent, on the western shore 
of Lake Michigan, and is surrounded by its own grounds comprising 
a little less than seven acres.  It has been financed, at cost of over a 
million dollars, by the American &amp;Baha'i community, assisted at times 
by voluntary contributions of recognized believers in East and West, of 
Christian, of Muslim, of Jewish, of Zoroastrian, of Hindu and Buddhist 
extraction.  It has been associated, in its initial phase, with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
and in the concluding stages of its construction with the memory of 
the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Purest Branch, and their mother.  The structure 
itself is a pure white nonagonal building, of original and unique 
design, rising from a flight of white stairs encircling its base; and 
surmounted by a majestic and beautifully proportioned dome, bearing 
nine tapering symmetrically placed ribs of decorative as well as structural 
significance, which soar to its apex and finally merge into a common 
unit pointing skyward.  Its framework is constructed of structural 
steel enclosed in concrete, the material of its ornamentation consisting 
of a combination of crystalline quartz, opaque quartz and white 
Portland cement, producing a composition clear in texture, hard and 
enduring as stone, impervious to the elements, and cast into a design 
as delicate as lace.  It soars 191 feet from the floor of its basement to 
the culmination of the ribs, clasping the hemispherical dome which is 
forty-nine feet high, with an external diameter of ninety feet, and one-third 
of the surface of which is perforated to admit light during the 
day and emit light at night.  It is buttressed by pylons forty-five feet 
in height, and bears above its nine entrances, one of which faces 
&amp;Akka, nine selected quotations from the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, as 
well as the Greatest Name in the center of each of the arches over its 
doors.  It is consecrated exclusively to worship, devoid of all ceremony 
and ritual, is provided with an auditorium which can seat 1600 people, 
and is to be supplemented by accessory institutions of social service 
to be established in its vicinity, such as an orphanage, a hospital, a 
dispensary for the poor, a home for the incapacitated, a hostel for 
travelers and a college for the study of arts and sciences.  It had already, 
long before its construction, evoked, and is now increasingly evoking, 
though its interior ornamentation is as yet unbegun, such interest and 
comment, in the public press, in technical journals and in magazines, 
 
+P351 
of both the United States and other countries, as to justify the hopes 
and expectations entertained for it by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Its model exhibited 
at Art centers, galleries, state fairs and national expositions--
among which may be mentioned the Century of Progress Exhibition, 
held in Chicago in 1933, where no less than ten thousand people, passing 
through the Hall of Religions, must have viewed it every day--its 
replica forming a part of the permanent exhibit of the Museum of 
Science and Industry in Chicago; its doors now thronged by visitors 
from far and near, whose number, during the period from June, 1932 
to October, 1941 has exceeded 130,000 people, representing almost 
every country in the world, this great "Silent Teacher" of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, it may be confidently asserted, has contributed to the 
diffusion of the knowledge of His Faith and teachings in a measure 
which no other single agency, operating within the framework of its 
Administrative Order, has ever remotely approached.  
     "When the foundation of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is laid in America," 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself has predicted, "and that Divine Edifice is completed, 
a most wonderful and thrilling motion will appear in the world 
of existence...  From that point of light the spirit of teaching, 
spreading the Cause of God and promoting the teachings of God, will 
permeate to all parts of the world."  "Out of this &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar," 
He has affirmed in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, "without doubt, 
thousands of &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars will be born."  "It marks," He, furthermore, 
has written, "the inception of the Kingdom of God on earth."  
And again:  "It is the manifest Standard waving in the center of that 
great continent."  "Thousands of &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars," He, when 
dedicating the grounds of the Temple, declared, "...will be built 
in the East and in the West, but this, being the first erected in the 
Occident, has great importance."  "This organization of the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar," He, referring to that edifice, has moreover stated, "will 
be a model for the coming centuries, and will hold the station of the 
mother."  
     "Its inception," the architect of the Temple has himself testified, 
"was not from man, for, as musicians, artists, poets receive their inspiration 
from another realm, so the Temple's architect, through all 
his years of labor, was ever conscious that &amp;Baha'u'llah was the creator 
of this building to be erected to His glory."  "Into this new design," 
he, furthermore, has written, "...is woven, in symbolic form, the 
great &amp;Baha'i teaching of unity--the unity of all religions and of all 
mankind.  There are combinations of mathematical lines, symbolizing 
those of the universe, and in their intricate merging of circle into circle, 
 
+P352 
and circle within circle, we visualize the merging of all the religions 
into one."  And again:  "A circle of steps, eighteen in all, will surround 
the structure on the outside, and lead to the auditorium floor.  
These eighteen steps represent the eighteen first disciples of the &amp;Bab, 
and the door to which they lead stands for the &amp;Bab Himself."  "As the 
essence of the pure original teachings of the historic religions was the 
same ... in the &amp;Baha'i Temple is used a composite architecture, expressing 
the essence in the line of each of the great architectural styles, 
harmonizing them into one whole."  
     "It is the first new idea in architecture since the 13th century," 
declared a distinguished architect, H. Van Buren Magonigle, President 
of the Architectural League, after gazing upon a plaster model of the 
Temple on exhibition in the Engineering Societies Building in New 
York, in June 1920.  "The Architect," he, moreover, has stated, "has 
conceived a Temple of Light in which structure, as usually understood, 
is to be concealed, visible support eliminated as far as possible, and the 
whole fabric to take on the airy substance of a dream.  It is a lacy 
envelope enshrining an idea, the idea of light, a shelter of cobweb 
interposed between earth and sky, struck through and through with 
light--light which shall partly consume the forms and make of it 
a thing of faery."  
     "In the geometric forms of the ornamentation," a writer in the 
well-known publication "Architectural Record" has written, "covering 
the columns and surrounding windows and doors of the Temple, 
one deciphers all the religious symbols of the world.  Here are the 
swastika, the circle, the cross, the triangle, the double triangle or six 
pointed star (Solomon's seal)--but more than this--the noble symbol 
of the spiritual orb ... the five pointed star; the Greek Cross, the 
Roman cross, and supreme above all, the wonderful nine pointed star, 
figured in the structure of the Temple itself, and appearing again 
and again in its ornamentation as significant of the spiritual glory 
in the world today."  
     "The greatest creation since the Gothic period," is the testimony of 
George Grey Barnard, one of the most widely-known sculptors in the 
United States of America, "and the most beautiful I have ever seen."  
     "This is a new creation," Prof. Luigi Quaglino, ex-professor of 
Architecture from Turin declared, after viewing the model, "which will 
revolutionize architecture in the world, and it is the most beautiful I 
have ever seen.  Without doubt it will have a lasting page in history.  
It is a revelation from another world."  
     "Americans," wrote Sherwin Cody, in the magazine section of the 
 
+P353 
New York Times, of the model of the Temple, when exhibited in the 
Kevorkian Gallery in New York, "will have to pause long enough to 
find that an artist has wrought into this building the conception of a 
Religious League of Nations."  And lastly, this tribute paid to the 
features of, and the ideals embodied in, this Temple--the most sacred 
House of Worship in the &amp;Baha'i world, whether of the present or of 
the future--by Dr. Rexford Newcomb, Dean of the College of Fine 
and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois:  "This 'Temple of 
Light' opens upon the terrain of human experience nine great doorways 
which beckon men and women of every race and clime, of every 
faith and conviction, of every condition of freedom or servitude to 
enter here into a recognition of that kinship and brotherhood without 
which the modern world will be able to make little further progress 
...The dome, pointed in form, aiming as assuredly as did the aspiring 
lines of the medieval cathedrals toward higher and better things, 
achieves not only through its symbolism but also through its structural 
propriety and sheer loveliness of form, a beauty not matched by any 
domical structure since the construction of Michelangelo's dome on 
the Basilica of St. Peter in Rome."

                                CHAPTER XXIII 
                        Attacks on &amp;Baha'i Institutions 
 
     The institutions signalizing the rise and establishment of the 
Administrative Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah did not (as the 
history of their unfoldment abundantly demonstrates) remain immune 
against the assaults and persecutions to which the Faith itself, 
the progenitor of that Order, had, for over seventy years, been subjected, 
and from which it is still suffering.  The emergence of a firmly 
knit community, advancing the claims of a world religion, with 
ramifications spread over five continents representing a great variety 
of races, languages, classes and religious traditions; provided with a 
literature scattered over the surface of the earth, and expounding in 
several languages its doctrine; clear-visioned, unafraid, alert and 
determined to achieve at whatever sacrifice its goal; organically united 
through the machinery of a divinely appointed Administrative Order; 
non-sectarian, non-political, faithful to its civil obligations yet 
supranational in character; tenacious in its adherence to the laws and 
ordinances regulating its community life--the emergence of such a 
community, in a world steeped in prejudice, worshipping false gods, 
torn by intestine divisions, and blindly clinging to obsolescent 
doctrines and defective standards, could not but precipitate, sooner 
or later, crises no less grave, though less spectacular, than the persecutions 
which, in an earlier age, had raged around the Founders of that 
community and their early disciples.  Assailed by enemies within, who 
have either rebelled against its God-given authority or wholly renounced 
their faith, or by adversaries from without, whether political 
or ecclesiastical, the infant Order identified with this community has, 
since its inception, and throughout every stage in its evolution, felt 
severely the impact of the forces which have sought in vain to strangle 
its budding life or to obscure its purpose.  
     To these attacks, destined to grow in scope and severity, and to 
arouse a tumult that will reverberate throughout the world, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
Himself had already, at the time the outlines of that Divine 
order were being delineated by Him in His Will, significantly alluded: 
"Erelong shall the clamor of the multitude throughout Africa, 
throughout America, the cry of the European and of the Turk, the 
 
+P355 
groaning of India and China, be heard from far and near.  One and 
all, they shall arise with all their power to resist His Cause.  Then 
shall the knights of the Lord ... reinforced by the legions of the 
Covenant, arise and manifest the truth of the verse:  `Behold the 
confusion that hath befallen the tribes of the defeated!'"  
     Already in more than one country the trustees and elected representatives 
of this indestructible world-embracing Order have been 
summoned by civil authorities or ecclesiastical courts, ignorant of its 
claims, or hostile to its principles or fearful of its rising strength, to 
defend its cause, or to renounce their allegiance to it, or to curtail 
the range of its operation.  Already an aggressive hand, unmindful of 
God's avenging wrath, has been stretched out against its sanctuaries 
and edifices.  Already its defenders and champions have, in some 
countries, been declared heretics, or stigmatized as subverters of law 
and order, or branded as visionaries, unpatriotic and careless of their 
civic duties and responsibilities, or peremptorily ordered to suspend 
their activities and dissolve their institutions.  
     In the Holy Land, the world seat of this System, where its heart 
pulsates, where the dust of its Founders reposes, where the processes 
disclosing its purposes, energizing its life and shaping its destiny all 
originate, there fell, at the very hour of its inception, the first blow 
which served to proclaim to high and low alike the solidity of the 
foundations on which it has been established.  The Covenant-breakers, 
now dwindled to a mere handful, instigated by &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, 
the Arch-rebel, whose dormant hopes had been awakened by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's sudden ascension, and headed by the arrogant &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Badi'u'llah, seized forcibly the keys of the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
expelled its keeper, the brave-souled &amp;Abu'l-Qasim-i-Khurasani, and 
demanded that their chief be recognized by the authorities as the 
legal custodian of that Shrine.  Unadmonished by their abject failure, 
as witnessed by the firm action of the Palestine authorities, who, after 
prolonged investigations, instructed the British officer in &amp;Akka to 
deliver the keys into the hands of that same keeper, they resorted to 
other methods in the hope of creating a cleavage in the ranks of the 
bereaved yet resolute disciples of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and of ultimately 
undermining the foundations of the institutions His followers were 
laboring to erect.  Through their mischievous misrepresentations of 
the ideals animating the builders of the &amp;Baha'i Administrative Order; 
through the maintenance, though not on its original scale, of a 
subversive correspondence with individuals whose loyalty they hoped 
they could sap; through deliberate distortions of the truth in their 
 
+P356 
contact with officials and notables whom they could approach; 
through attempts, made through bribery and intimidation, to purchase 
a part of the Mansion of &amp;Baha'u'llah; through efforts directed 
at preventing the acquisition by the &amp;Baha'i community of certain 
properties situated in the vicinity of the Tomb of the &amp;Bab, and at 
frustrating the design to consolidate the foundation of some of these 
properties by transferring their title-deeds to incorporated &amp;Baha'i 
assemblies, they continued to labor intermittently for several years 
until the extinction of the life of the Arch-breaker of the Covenant 
himself virtually sealed their doom.  
     The evacuation of the Mansion of &amp;Baha'u'llah by these Covenant-breakers, 
after their unchallenged occupancy of it since His ascension, 
a Mansion which, through their gross neglect, had fallen into a 
sad state of disrepair; its subsequent complete restoration, fulfilling a 
long cherished desire of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; its illumination through an 
electric plant installed by an American believer for that purpose; 
the refurnishing of all its rooms after it had been completely denuded 
by its former occupants of all the precious relics it contained, with 
the exception of a single candlestick in the room where &amp;Baha'u'llah 
had ascended; the collection within its walls of &amp;Baha'i historic documents, 
of relics and of over five thousand volumes of &amp;Baha'i literature, 
in no less than forty languages; the extension to it of the exemption 
from government taxes, already granted to other &amp;Baha'i institutions 
and properties in &amp;Akka and on Mt. Carmel; and finally, its conversion 
from a private residence to a center of pilgrimage visited by 
&amp;Baha'is and &amp;non-Baha'is alike--these served to further dash the hopes 
of those who were still desperately striving to extinguish the light of 
the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Furthermore, the success later achieved 
in purchasing and safeguarding the area forming the precincts of 
the resting-place of the &amp;Bab on Mt. Carmel, and the transfer of the 
title-deeds of some of these properties to the legally constituted 
Palestine Branch of the American &amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly, 
no less than the circumstances attending the death of the one who 
had been the prime mover of mischief throughout &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, 
demonstrated to these enemies the futility of their efforts and 
the hopelessness of their cause.  
     Of a more serious nature, and productive of still greater repercussions, 
was the unlawful seizure by the &amp;Shi'ahs of &amp;Iraq, at about the 
same time that the keys of the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah were wrested by 
the Covenant-breakers from its keeper, of yet another &amp;Baha'i Shrine, 
the House occupied by &amp;Baha'u'llah for well nigh the whole period of 
 
+P357 
His exile in &amp;Iraq, which had been acquired by Him, and later had been 
ordained as a center of pilgrimage, and had continued in the unbroken 
and undisputed possession of His followers ever since His departure 
from &amp;Baghdad.  This crisis, originating about a year prior to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
ascension, and precipitated by the measures which, after the 
change of &amp;regime in &amp;Iraq, had, according to His instructions, been 
taken for the reconstruction of that House, acquired as it developed 
a steadily widening measure of publicity.  It became the object of the 
consideration of successive tribunals, first of the local &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Ja'fariyyih 
court in &amp;Baghdad, second of the Peace court, then the court of 
First Instance, then of the court of Appeal in &amp;Iraq, and finally of 
the League of Nations, the greatest international body yet come into 
existence, and empowered to exercise supervision and control over all 
Mandated Territories.  Though as yet unresolved through a combination 
of causes, religious as well as political, it has already remarkably 
fulfilled &amp;Baha'u'llah's own prediction, and will, in its own appointed 
time, as the means for its solution are providentially created, fulfill the 
high destiny ordained for it by Him in His Tablets.  Long before its 
seizure by fanatical enemies, who had no conceivable claim to it 
whatever, He had prophesied that "it shall be so abased in the days 
to come as to cause tears to flow from every discerning eye."  
     The Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of &amp;Baghdad, deprived of the 
use of that sacred property through an adverse decision by a majority 
of the court of Appeal, which had reversed the verdict of the lower 
court and awarded the property to the &amp;Shi'ahs, and aroused by subsequent 
action of the &amp;Shi'ahs, soon after the execution of the judgment 
of that court, in converting the building into waqf property 
(pious foundation), designating it "&amp;Husayniyyih," with the purpose 
of consolidating their gain, realized the futility of the three 
years of negotiations they had been conducting with the civil authorities 
in &amp;Baghdad for the righting of the wrong inflicted upon them.  
In their capacity as the national representatives of the &amp;Baha'is of 
&amp;Iraq, they, therefore, on September 11, 1928, through the High 
Commissioner for &amp;Iraq and in conformity with the provisions of 
Art. 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, approached the 
League's Permanent Mandates Commission, charged with the supervision 
of the administration of all Mandated Territories, and presented 
a petition that was accepted and approved by that body in 
November, 1928.  A memorandum submitted, in connection with 
that petition, to that same Commission, by the Mandatory Power 
unequivocally stated that the &amp;Shi'ahs had "no conceivable claim 
 
+P358 
whatever" to the House, that the decision of the judge of the &amp;Ja'fariyyih 
court was "obviously wrong," "unjust" and "undoubtedly actuated 
by religious prejudice," that the subsequent ejectment of the &amp;Baha'is 
was "illegal," that the action of the authorities had been "highly 
irregular," and that the verdict of the Court of Appeal was suspected 
of not being "uninfluenced by political consideration."  
     "The Commission," states the Report submitted by it to the Council 
of the League, and published in the Minutes of the 14th session of 
the Permanent Mandates Commission, held in Geneva in the fall of 
1928, and subsequently translated into Arabic and published in &amp;Iraq, 
"draws the Council's attention to the considerations and conclusions 
suggested to it by an examination of the petition...  It recommends 
that the Council should ask the British Government to make representations 
to the &amp;Iraq Government with a view to the immediate 
redress of the denial of justice from which the petitioners have 
suffered."  
     The British accredited representative present at the sessions of the 
Commission, furthermore, stated that "the Mandatory Power had 
recognized that the &amp;Baha'is had suffered an injustice," whilst allusion 
was made, in the course of that session, to the fact that the action of 
the &amp;Shi'ahs constituted a breach of the constitution and the Organic 
Law of &amp;Iraq.  The Finnish representative, moreover, in his report to 
the Council, declared that this "injustice must be attributed solely to 
religious passion," and asked that "the petitioner's wrongs should 
be redressed."  
     The Council of the League, on its part, having considered this 
report as well as the joint observations and conclusions of the Commission, 
unanimously adopted, on March 4, 1929, a resolution, subsequently 
translated and published in the newspapers of &amp;Baghdad, 
directing the Mandatory Power "to make representations to the 
Government of &amp;Iraq with a view to the immediate redress of the 
injustice suffered by the Petitioners."  It instructed, accordingly, the 
Secretary General to bring to the notice of the Mandatory Power, as 
well as to the petitioners concerned, the conclusions arrived at by the 
Commission, an instruction which was duly transmitted by the British 
Government through its High Commissioner to the &amp;Iraq Government.  
     A letter dated January 12, 1931, written on behalf of the British 
Foreign Minister, Mr. Arthur Henderson, addressed to the League 
Secretariat, stated that the conclusions reached by the Council had 
"received the most careful consideration by the Government of &amp;Iraq," 
who had "finally decided to set up a special committee ... to consider 
 
+P359 
the views expressed by the &amp;Baha'i community in respect of 
certain houses in &amp;Baghdad, and to formulate recommendations for an 
equitable settlement of this question."  That letter, moreover, pointed 
out that the committee had submitted its report in August, 1930, 
that it had been accepted by the government, that the &amp;Baha'i community 
had "accepted in principle" its recommendations, and that 
the authorities in &amp;Baghdad had directed that "detailed plans and estimates 
shall be prepared with a view to carrying these recommendations 
into effect during the coming financial year."  
     No need to dwell on the subsequent history of this momentous 
case, on the long-drawn out negotiations, the delays and complications 
that ensued; on the consultations, "over a hundred" in number, in 
which the king, his ministers and advisers took part; on the expressions 
of "regret," of "surprise" and of "anxiety" placed on record at 
successive sessions of the Mandates Commission held in Geneva in 
1929, 1930, 1931, 1932 and 1933; on the condemnation by its 
members of the "spirit of intolerance" animating the &amp;Shi'ah community, 
of the "partiality" of the &amp;Iraqi courts, of the "weakness" of 
the civil authorities and of the "religious passion at the bottom of this 
injustice"; on their testimony to the "extremely conciliatory disposition" 
of the petitioners, on their "doubt" regarding the adequacy 
of the proposals, and on their recognition of the "serious" character 
of the situation that had been created, of the "flagrant denial of 
justice" which the &amp;Baha'is had suffered, and of the "moral debt" 
which the &amp;Iraq Government had contracted, a debt which, whatever 
the changes in her status as a nation, it was her bounden duty to 
discharge.  
     Nor does it seem necessary to expatiate on the unfortunate consequences 
of the untimely death of both the British High Commissioner 
and the &amp;Iraqi Prime Minister; on the admission of &amp;Iraq as a member 
of the League, and the consequent termination of the mandate held 
by Great Britain; on the tragic and unexpected death of the King 
himself; on the difficulties raised owing to the existence of a town 
planning scheme; on the written assurance conveyed to the High 
Commissioner by the acting Premier in his letter of January, 1932; 
on the pledge given by the King, prior to his death, in the presence of 
the foreign minister, in February, 1933, that the House would be 
expropriated, and the necessary sum would be appropriated in the 
spring of the ensuing year; on the categorical statement made by 
that same foreign minister that the Prime Minister had given the 
necessary assurances that the promise already made by the acting 
 
+P360 
Premier would be redeemed; or on the positive statements made by 
that same Foreign Minister and his colleague, the Minister of Finance, 
when representing their country during the sessions of the League 
Assembly held in Geneva, that the promise given by their late King 
would be fully honored.  
     Suffice it to say that, despite these interminable delays, protests 
and evasions, and the manifest failure of the Authorities concerned 
to implement the recommendations made by both the Council of the 
League and the Permanent Mandates Commission, the publicity 
achieved for the Faith by this memorable litigation, and the defense 
of its cause--the cause of truth and justice--by the world's highest 
tribunal, have been such as to excite the wonder of its friends and to 
fill with consternation its enemies.  Few episodes, if any, since the 
birth of the Formative Age of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, have given 
rise to repercussions in high places comparable to the effect produced 
on governments and chancelleries by this violent and unprovoked 
assault directed by its inveterate enemies against one of its holiest 
sanctuaries.  
     "Grieve not, O House of God," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself has significantly 
written, "if the veil of thy sanctity be rent asunder by the 
infidels.  God hath, in the world of creation, adorned thee with the 
jewel of His remembrance.  Such an ornament no man can, at any 
time, profane.  Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall, under all 
conditions, remain directed."  "In the fullness of time," He, in another 
passage, referring to that same House, has prophesied, "the Lord shall, 
by the power of truth, exalt it in the eyes of all men.  He shall cause 
it to become the Standard of His Kingdom, the Shrine round which 
will circle the concourse of the faithful."  
     To the bold onslaught made by the breakers of the Covenant of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in their concerted efforts to secure the custodianship of 
His holy Tomb, to the arbitrary seizure of His holy House in &amp;Baghdad 
by the &amp;Shi'ah community of &amp;Iraq, was to be added, a few years later, 
yet another grievous assault launched by a still more powerful 
adversary, directed against the very fabric of the Administrative 
Order as established by two long-flourishing &amp;Baha'i communities of 
the East, culminating in the virtual disruption of these communities 
and the seizure of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world 
and of the few accessory institutions already reared about it.  
     The courage, the fervor and the spiritual vitality evinced by these 
communities; the highly organized state of their administrative institutions; 
the facilities provided for the religious education and training 
 
+P361 
of their youth; the conversion of a number of broad-minded 
Russian citizens, imbued with ideas closely related to the tenets of the 
Faith; the growing realization of the implications of its principles, 
with their emphasis on religion, on the sanctity of family life, on the 
institution of private property, and their repudiation of all discrimination 
between classes and of the doctrine of the absolute equality of 
men--these combined to excite the suspicion, and later to arouse the 
fierce antagonism, of the ruling authorities, and to precipitate one of 
the gravest crises in the history of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
     As the crisis developed and spread to even the outlying centers of 
both &amp;Turkistan and the Caucasus it resulted gradually in the imposition 
of restrictions limiting the freedom of these communities, in the 
interrogation and arrest of their elected representatives, in the dissolution 
of their local Assemblies and their respective committees in 
Moscow, in &amp;Ishqabad, in &amp;Baku and in other localities in the above-mentioned 
provinces and in the suspension of all &amp;Baha'i youth activities.  
It even led to the closing of &amp;Baha'i schools, kindergartens, 
libraries and public reading-rooms, to the interception of all communication 
with foreign &amp;Baha'i centers, to the confiscation of 
&amp;Baha'i printing presses, books and documents, to the prohibition of 
all teaching activities, to the abrogation of the &amp;Baha'i constitution, to 
the abolition of all national and local funds and to the ban placed 
on the attendance of non-believers at &amp;Baha'i meetings.  
     In the middle of 1928 the law expropriating religious edifices was 
applied to the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of &amp;Ishqabad.  The use of this edifice 
as a house of worship, however, was continued, under a five-year 
lease, which was renewed by the local authorities in 1933, for a 
similar period.  In 1938 the situation in both &amp;Turkistan and the 
Caucasus rapidly deteriorated, leading to the imprisonment of over 
five hundred believers--many of whom died--as well as a number of 
women, and the confiscation of their property, followed by the exile 
of several prominent members of these communities to Siberia, the 
polar forests and other places in the vicinity of the Arctic Ocean, the 
subsequent deportation of most of the remnants of these communities 
to Persia, on account of their Persian nationality, and lastly, the 
complete expropriation of the Temple itself and its conversion into 
an art gallery.  
     In Germany, likewise, the rise and establishment of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith, to whose expansion and consolidation the 
German believers were distinctively and increasingly contributing, 
was soon followed by repressive measures, which, though less grievous 
 
+P362 
than the afflictions suffered by the &amp;Baha'is of &amp;Turkistan and the 
Caucasus, amounted to the virtual cessation, in the years immediately 
preceding the present conflict, of all organized &amp;Baha'i activity throughout 
the length and breadth of that land.  The public teaching of the 
Faith, with its unconcealed emphasis on peace and universality, and 
its repudiation of racialism, was officially forbidden; &amp;Baha'i Assemblies 
and their committees were dissolved; the holding of &amp;Baha'i 
conventions was interdicted; the Archives of the National Spiritual 
Assembly were seized; the summer school was abolished and the 
publication of all &amp;Baha'i literature was suspended.  
     In Persia, moreover, apart from sporadic outbreaks of persecution 
in such places as &amp;Shiraz, &amp;Abadih, &amp;Ardibil, &amp;Isfahan, and in certain 
districts of &amp;Adhirbayjan and &amp;Khurasan--outbreaks greatly reduced 
in number and violence, owing to the marked decline in the fortunes 
of the erstwhile powerful &amp;Shi'ah ecclesiastics--the institutions of a 
newly-established and as yet unconsolidated Administrative Order 
were subjected by the civil authorities, in both the capital and the 
provinces, to restrictions designed to circumscribe their scope, to 
fetter their freedom and undermine their foundations.  
     The gradual and wholly unexpected emergence from obscurity of 
a firmly-welded national community, schooled in adversity and unbroken 
in spirit, with centers established in every province of that 
country, in spite of the successive waves of inhuman persecution 
which had, for three quarters of a century, swept over and had all 
but engulfed it; the determination of its members to diffuse the spirit 
and principles of their Faith, broadcast its literature, enforce its laws 
and ordinances, penalize those who would transgress them, maintain 
a steady intercourse with their fellow-believers in foreign lands, and 
erect the edifices and institutions of its Administrative Order, could 
not but arouse the apprehensions and the hostility of those placed in 
authority, who either misunderstood the aims of that community, 
or were bent upon stifling its life.  The insistence of its members, 
while obedient in all matters of a purely administrative character to 
the civil statutes of their country, on adhering to the fundamental 
spiritual principles, precepts and laws revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah, requiring 
them, among other things, to hold fast to truthfulness, not to 
dissimulate their faith, observe the ordinances prescribed for marriage 
and divorce, and suspend all manner of work on the Holy Days 
ordained by Him, brought them, sooner or later, into conflict with a 
&amp;regime which, owing to its formal recognition of &amp;Islam as the state 
religion of Persia, refused to extend any recognition to those whom 
 
+P363 
the official exponents of that religion had already condemned as 
heretics.  
     The closing of all schools belonging to the &amp;Baha'i community in 
that country, as a direct consequence of the refusal of the representatives 
of that community to permit official &amp;Baha'i institutions, owned 
and entirely controlled by them, to transgress the clearly revealed law 
requiring the suspension of work on &amp;Baha'i Holy Days; the rejection 
of all &amp;Baha'i marriage certificates and the refusal to register them at 
government License Bureaus; the ban placed on the printing and 
circulation of all &amp;Baha'i literature, as well as on its entry into the 
country; the seizure in various centers of &amp;Baha'i documents, books 
and relics; the closing, in some of the provinces of the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, 
and the confiscation in some localities of their furniture; the 
prohibition of all &amp;Baha'i demonstrations, conferences and conventions; 
the strict censorship imposed on, and often the non-delivery of, communications 
between &amp;Baha'i centers in Persia and between these 
centers and &amp;Baha'i communities in foreign lands; the withholding of 
good-record certificates from loyal and law-abiding citizens on the 
ground of their avowed adherence to the &amp;Baha'i Faith; the dismissal 
of Government employees, the demotion or discharge of army officers, 
the arrest, the interrogation, the imprisonment of, and the imposition 
of fines and other punishments upon, a number of believers who 
refused either to cast aside the moral obligation of adhering to the 
spiritual principles of their Faith, or to act in any manner that would 
conflict with its universal and non-political character--all these may 
be regarded as the initial attempts made in the country whose soil 
had already been imbued with the blood of countless &amp;Baha'i martyrs, 
to resist the rise, and frustrate the struggle for the emancipation, of a 
nascent Administrative Order, whose very roots have sucked their 
strength from such heroic sacrifice.  
 
+P364 
                                 CHAPTER XXIV 
                  Emancipation and Recognition of the Faith 
                             and Its Institutions 
 
     While the initial steps aiming at the erection of the framework of 
the Administrative Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah were being simultaneously 
undertaken by His followers in the East and in the West, a 
fierce attack was launched in an obscure village in Egypt on a handful 
of believers, who were trying to establish there one of the primary 
institutions of that Order--an attack which, viewed in the perspective 
of history, will be acclaimed by future generations as a landmark not 
only in the Formative Period of the Faith but in the history of the 
first &amp;Baha'i century.  Indeed, the sequel to this assault may be said to 
have opened a new chapter in the evolution of the Faith itself, an 
evolution which, carrying it through the successive stages of repression, 
of emancipation, of recognition as an independent Revelation, and as a 
state religion, must lead to the establishment of the &amp;Baha'i state and 
culminate in the emergence of the &amp;Baha'i World Commonwealth.  
     Originating in a country which can rightly boast of being the 
acknowledged center of both the Arab and Muslim worlds; precipitated 
by the action, taken on their own initiative, by the ecclesiastical 
representatives of the largest communion in &amp;Islam; the direct outcome 
of a series of disturbances instigated by some of the members of that 
communion designed to suppress the activities of certain followers of 
the Faith who had held a clerical rank among them, this momentous 
development in the fortunes of a struggling community has directly 
contributed, to a considerable degree, to the consolidation and the 
enhancement of the prestige of the Administrative Order which that 
community had begun to erect.  It will, moreover, as its repercussions 
are more widely spread to other Islamic countries, and its vast significance 
is more clearly apprehended by the adherents of both Christianity 
and &amp;Islam, hasten the termination of the period of transition 
through which the Faith, now in the formative stage of its growth, 
is passing.  
     It was in the village of &amp;Kawmu's-Sa'ayidih, in the district of Beba, 
of the province of Beni Suef in Upper Egypt, that, as a result of the 
religious fanaticism which the formation of a &amp;Baha'i assembly had 
 
+P365 
kindled in the breast of the headman of that village, and of the grave 
accusations made by him to both the District Police Officer and the 
Governor of the province--accusations which aroused the &amp;Muhammadans 
to such a pitch of excitement as to cause them to perpetrate 
shameful acts against their victims--that action was initiated by the 
notary of the village, in his capacity as a religious plaintiff authorized 
by the Ministry of Justice, against three &amp;Baha'i residents of that village, 
demanding that their Muslim wives be divorced from them on the 
grounds that their husbands had abandoned &amp;Islam after their legal 
marriage as Muslims.  
     The Opinion and Judgment of the Appellate religious court of 
Beba, delivered on May 10, 1925, subsequently sanctioned by the 
highest ecclesiastical authorities in Cairo and upheld by them as final, 
printed and circulated by the Muslim authorities themselves, annulled 
the marriages contracted by the three &amp;Baha'i defendants and condemned 
the mass heretics for having violated the laws and ordinances 
of &amp;Islam.  It even went so far as to make the positive, the startling and 
indeed the historic assertion that the Faith embraced by these heretics 
is to be regarded as a distinct religion, wholly independent of the religious 
systems that have preceded it--an assertion which hitherto the 
enemies of the Faith, whether in the East or in the West, had either 
disputed or deliberately ignored.  
     Having expounded the fundamental tenets and ordinances of 
&amp;Islam, and given a detailed exposition of the &amp;Baha'i teachings, supported 
by various quotations from the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, from the writings 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and of &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl, with special reference 
to certain &amp;Baha'i laws, and demonstrated that the defendants had, in 
the light of these statements, actually abjured the Faith of &amp;Muhammad, 
his formal verdict declares in the most unequivocal terms:  "The &amp;Baha'i 
Faith is a new religion, entirely independent, with beliefs, principles 
and laws of its own, which differ from, and are utterly in conflict with, 
the beliefs, principles and laws of &amp;Islam.  No &amp;Baha'i, therefore, can be 
regarded a Muslim or vice-versa, even as no Buddhist, Brahmin, or 
Christian can be regarded a Muslim or vice-versa."  Ordering the dissolution 
of the contracts of marriage of the parties on trial, and the 
"separation" of the husbands from their wives, this official and memorable 
pronouncement concludes with the following words:  "If any 
one of them (husbands) repents, believes in, and acknowledges whatsoever 
... &amp;Muhammad, the Apostle of God ... has brought from 
God ... and returns to the august Faith of &amp;Islam ... and testifies 
that ... &amp;Muhammad ... is the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, 
 
+P366 
that no religion will succeed His religion, that no law will 
abrogate His law, that the &amp;Qur'an is the last of the Books of God and 
His last Revelation to His Prophets and His Messengers ... he shall 
be accepted and shall be entitled to renew his marriage contract..."  
     This declaration of portentous significance, which was supported 
by incontrovertible proofs adduced by the avowed enemies of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah themselves, which was made in a country that 
aspires to the headship of &amp;Islam through the restoration of the 
Caliphate, and which has received the sanction of the highest ecclesiastical 
authorities in that country, this official testimony which the 
leaders of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, in both Persia and &amp;Iraq, have, through a 
century, sedulously avoided voicing, and which, once and for all, 
silences those detractors, including Christian ecclesiastics in the West, 
who have in the past stigmatized that Faith as a cult, as a &amp;Babi sect and 
as an offshoot of &amp;Islam or represented it as a synthesis of religions--
such a declaration was acclaimed by all &amp;Baha'i communities in the East 
and in the West as the first Charter of the emancipation of the Cause 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah from the fetters of Islamic orthodoxy, the first historic 
step taken, not by its adherents as might have been expected, but by its 
adversaries on the road leading to its ultimate and world-wide 
recognition.  
     Such a verdict, fraught with incalculable possibilities, was immediately 
recognized as a powerful challenge which the builders of the 
Administrative Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah were not slow to 
face and accept.  It imposed upon them a sacred obligation which 
they felt ready to discharge.  Designed by its authors to deprive their 
adversaries of access to Muslim courts, and thereby place them in a 
perplexing and embarrassing situation, it became a lever which the 
Egyptian &amp;Baha'i community, followed later by its sister-communities, 
readily utilized for the purpose of asserting the independence of its 
Faith and of seeking for it the recognition of its government.  Translated 
into several languages, circulated among &amp;Baha'i communities in 
East and West, it gradually paved the way for the initiation of negotiations 
between the elected representatives of these communities and the 
civil authorities in Egypt, in the Holy Land, in Persia and even in the 
United States of America, for the purpose of securing the official recognition 
by these authorities of the Faith as an independent religion.  
     In Egypt it was the signal for the adoption of a series of measures 
which have in their cumulative effect greatly facilitated the extension 
of such a recognition by a government which is still formally associated 
with the religion of &amp;Islam, and which suffers its laws and regulations 
 
+P367 
to be shaped in a great measure by the views and pronouncements 
of its ecclesiastical leaders.  The inflexible determination of the 
Egyptian believers not to deviate a hair's breadth from the tenets of 
their Faith, by avoiding all dealings with any Muslim ecclesiastical 
court in that country and by refusing any ecclesiastical post which 
might be offered them; the codification and publication of the fundamental 
laws of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas regarding matters of personal status, 
such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and burial, and the presentation 
of these laws to the Egyptian Cabinet; the issuance of marriage 
and divorce certificates by the Egyptian National Spiritual Assembly; 
the assumption by that Assembly of all the duties and responsibilities 
connected with the conduct of &amp;Baha'i marriages and divorces, as well 
as with the burial of the dead; the observance by all members of that 
community of the nine Holy Days on which work, as prescribed in the 
&amp;Baha'i teachings, must be completely suspended; the presentation of 
a petition addressed by the national elected representatives of that community 
to the Egyptian Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior 
and the Minister of Justice (supported by a similar communication 
addressed by the American National Spiritual Assembly to the 
Egyptian Government), enclosing a copy of the judgment of the 
Court, and of their national &amp;Baha'i constitution and by-laws, requesting 
them to recognize their Assembly as a body qualified to exercise 
the functions of an independent court and empowered to apply, in all 
matters affecting their personal status, the laws and ordinances revealed 
by the Author of their Faith--these stand out as the initial consequences 
of a historic pronouncement that must eventually lead to the 
establishment of that Faith on a basis of absolute equality with its sister 
religions in that land.  
     A corollary to this epoch-making declaration, and a direct consequence 
of the intermittent disturbances instigated in Port Said and 
&amp;Isma'iliyyih by a fanatical populace in connection with the burial of 
some of the members of the &amp;Baha'i community, was the official and no 
less remarkable &amp;fatva (judgment) issued, at the request of the Ministry 
of Justice, by the Grand &amp;Mufti of Egypt.  This, soon after its 
pronouncement, was published in the Egyptian press and contributed to 
fortify further the independent status of the Faith.  It followed upon the 
riots which broke out with exceptional fury in &amp;Isma'iliyyih, when 
angry crowds surrounded the funeral &amp;cortege of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Sulayman, 
a prominent &amp;Baha'i resident of that town, creating such an 
uproar that the police had to intervene, and having rescued the body 
and brought it back to the home of the deceased, they were forced to 
 
+P368 
carry it without escort, at night, to the edge of the desert and inter 
it in the wilderness.  
     This judgment was passed as a result of the inquiry addressed in 
writing, on January 24, 1939, by the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior 
to the Ministry of Justice, enclosing a copy of the compilation of 
&amp;Baha'i laws related to matters of personal status published by the 
Egyptian &amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly, and asking for a pronouncement 
by the &amp;Mufti regarding the petition addressed by that 
Assembly to the Egyptian Government for the allocation of four plots 
to serve as cemeteries for the &amp;Baha'i communities of Cairo, Alexandria, 
Port Said and &amp;Isma'iliyyih.  "We are," wrote the &amp;Mufti in his reply of 
March 11, 1939, to the communication addressed to him by the Ministry 
of Justice, "in receipt of your letter ... dated February 21, 
1939, with its enclosures ... inquiring whether or not it would be 
lawful to bury the &amp;Baha'i dead in Muslim cemeteries.  We hereby declare 
that this Community is not to be regarded as Muslim, as shown 
by the beliefs which it professes.  The perusal of what they term `The 
&amp;Baha'i Laws affecting Matters of Personal Status,' accompanying the 
papers, is deemed sufficient evidence.  Whoever among its members had 
formerly been a Muslim has, by virtue of his belief in the pretensions 
of this community, renounced &amp;Islam, and is regarded as beyond its 
pale, and is subject to the laws governing apostasy as established in the 
right Faith of &amp;Islam.  This community not being Muslim, it would be 
unlawful to bury its dead in Muslim cemeteries, be they originally 
Muslims or otherwise..."  
     It was in consequence of this final, this clearly-worded and authoritative 
sentence by the highest exponent of Islamic Law in Egypt, and 
after prolonged negotiations, resulting at first in the allocation to the 
Cairo &amp;Baha'i community of a cemetery plot forming a part of that set 
aside for free thinkers, residing in that city, that the Egyptian government 
consented to grant to that community, as well as to the &amp;Baha'is of 
&amp;Isma'iliyyih, two tracts of land to serve as burial grounds for their 
dead--an act of historic significance which was greatly welcomed by 
the members of sore-pressed and long-suffering communities, and 
which has served to demonstrate still further the independent character 
of their Faith and enlarge the sphere of the jurisdiction of its 
representative institutions.  
     It was to the first of these two officially designated &amp;Baha'i cemeteries, 
following the decision of the Egyptian &amp;Baha'i National 
Assembly aided by its sister-Assembly in Persia, that the remains 
of the illustrious &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl were transferred and accorded 
 
+P369 
a sepulture worthy of his high position, thereby inaugurating, 
in a befitting manner, the first official &amp;Baha'i institution of its kind 
established in the East.  This achievement was, soon after, enhanced by 
the exhumation from a Christian cemetery in Cairo of the body of 
that far-famed mother teacher of the West, Mrs. E. Getsinger, and its 
interment, through the assistance extended by the American &amp;Baha'i 
National Assembly and the Department of State in Washington, in a 
spot in the heart of that cemetery and adjoining the resting-place of 
that distinguished author and champion of the Faith.  
     In the Holy Land, where a &amp;Baha'i cemetery had, before these 
pronouncements, been established during &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, the historic 
decision to bury the &amp;Baha'i dead facing the Qiblih in &amp;Akka was 
taken--a measure whose significance was heightened by the resolution 
to cease having recourse, as had been previously the case, to any 
&amp;Muhammadan court in all matters affecting marriage and divorce, and 
to carry out, in their entirety and without any concealment whatever, 
the rites prescribed by &amp;Baha'u'llah for the preparation and burial of 
the dead.  This was soon after followed by the presentation of a formal 
petition addressed by the representatives of the local &amp;Baha'i community 
of Haifa, dated May 4, 1929, to the Palestine Authorities, requesting 
them that, pending the adoption of a uniform civil law of personal 
status applicable to all residents of the country irrespective of their 
religious beliefs, the community be officially recognized by them and 
be granted "full powers to administer its own affairs now enjoyed by 
other religious communities in Palestine."  
     The acceptance of this petition--an act of tremendous significance 
and wholly unprecedented in the history of the Faith in any country--
according official recognition by the civil authorities to marriage 
certificates issued by the representatives of the local community, the 
validity of which the official representative of the Persian Government 
in Palestine has tacitly recognized, was followed by a series of decisions 
exempting from government tax all properties and institutions regarded 
by the &amp;Baha'i community as holy sites, or dedicated to the 
Tombs of its Founders at its world center.  Moreover, through these 
decisions, all articles serving as ornaments or furniture for the &amp;Baha'i 
shrines were exempted from customs duties, and the branches of both 
the American and Indian &amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies were 
enabled to function as "religious societies," in accordance with the laws 
of the country, and to hold and administer property as agents of these 
Assemblies.  
     In Persia, where a far larger community, already numerically 
 
+P370 
superior to the Christian, the Jewish and the Zoroastrian minorities 
living in that country, had, notwithstanding the traditionally hostile 
attitude of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities, succeeded in rearing 
the structure of its administrative institutions, the reaction to so momentous 
a declaration was such as to inspire its members and induce 
them to exploit, in the fullest measure possible, the enormous advantages 
which this wholly unexpected testimonial had conferred upon 
them.  Having survived the fiery ordeals to which the cruel, the arrogant 
and implacable leaders of an all-powerful priesthood, now grievously 
humiliated, had subjected it, a triumphant community, just 
emerging from obscurity, was determined, more than ever before, to 
press, within the limits prescribed for it by its Founders, its claim to 
be regarded as an independent religious entity, and to safeguard, by all 
available means, its integrity, the solidarity of its members and the 
solidity of its elective institutions.  It could no longer, now that its 
declared adversaries had, in such a country, in such a language, and on 
so important an issue, made so emphatic and sweeping a pronouncement, 
and torn asunder the veil that had for so long been drawn over 
some of the distinguishing verities lying at the core of its doctrine, 
keep silent or tolerate without any protest the imposition of restrictions 
calculated to circumscribe its powers, stifle its community life and 
deny it its right to be placed on a footing of unqualified equality with 
other religious communities in that land.  
     Inflexibly resolved to be classified no longer as Muslim, Jew, 
Christian or Zoroastrian, the members of this community determined, 
as a first step, to adopt such measures as would vindicate 
beyond challenge the distinctive position claimed for their religion 
by its avowed enemies.  Mindful of their clear, their sacred and 
inescapable duty to obey unreservedly, in all matters of a purely 
administrative character, the laws of their country, but firmly determined 
to assert and demonstrate, through every legitimate means at 
their disposal, the independent character of their Faith, they formulated 
a policy and embarked in undertakings designed to carry them a 
stage further towards the goal they had set themselves to attain.  
     The steadfast resolution not to dissemble their faith, whatever the 
sacrifices it might entail; the uncompromising position that they would 
not refer any matters affecting their personal status to any Muslim, 
Christian, Rabbinical or Zoroastrian court; the refusal to affiliate with 
any organization, or accept any ecclesiastical post associated with any 
of the recognized religions in their country; the universal observance 
of the laws prescribed in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas relating to obligatory 
 
+P371 
prayers, fasting, marriage, divorce, inheritance, burial of the dead, and 
the use of opium and alcoholic beverages; the issue and circulation of 
certificates of birth, death, marriage and divorce, at the direction and 
under the seal of recognized &amp;Baha'i Assemblies; the translation into 
Persian of "The &amp;Baha'i Laws affecting Matters of Personal Status," 
first published by the Egyptian &amp;Baha'i National Assembly; the cessation 
of work on all &amp;Baha'i Holy Days; the establishment of &amp;Baha'i 
cemeteries in the capital as well as in the provinces, designed to provide 
a common burial ground for all ranks of the faithful, whatever their 
religious extraction; the insistence that they no longer be registered as 
Muslim, Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian on identity cards, marriage certificates, 
passports and other official documents; the emphasis placed 
on the institution of the Nineteen Day Feast, as established by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in His Most Holy Book; the imposition of sanctions by &amp;Baha'i 
elective Assemblies, now assuming the duties and functions of religious 
courts, on recalcitrant members of the community by denying them 
the right to vote and of membership in these Assemblies and their 
committees--all these are to be associated with the first stirrings of a 
community that had erected the fabric of its Administrative Order, 
and was now, under the propelling influence of the historic judicial 
sentence passed in Egypt, intent upon obtaining, not by force but 
through persuasion, the recognition by the civil authorities of the 
status to which its ecclesiastical adversaries had so emphatically borne 
witness.  
     That its initial attempt should have met with partial success, that 
it should have aroused at times the suspicion of the ruling authorities, 
that it should have been grossly misrepresented by its vigilant enemies, 
is not a matter for surprise.  It was successful in certain respects in its 
negotiations with the civil authorities, as in obtaining the government 
decree removing all references to religious affiliation in passports issued 
to Persian subjects, and in the tacit permission granted in certain localities 
that its members should not fill in the religious columns in certain 
state documents, but should register with their own Assemblies their 
marriage, their divorce, their birth and their death certificates, and 
should conduct their funerals according to their religious rites.  In 
other respects, however, it has been subjected to grave disabilities:  its 
schools, founded, owned and controlled exclusively by itself, were 
forcibly closed because they refused to remain open on &amp;Baha'i holy 
days; its members, both men and women, were prosecuted; those who 
held army or civil service appointments were in some cases dismissed; a 
 
+P372 
ban was placed on the import, on the printing and circulation of its 
literature; and all &amp;Baha'i public gatherings were proscribed.  
     To all administrative regulations which the civil authorities have 
issued from time to time, or will issue in the future in that land, as in 
all other countries, the &amp;Baha'i community, faithful to its sacred obligations 
towards its government, and conscious of its civic duties, has 
yielded, and will continue to yield implicit obedience.  Its immediate 
closing of its schools in Persia is a proof of this.  To such orders, however, 
as are tantamount to a recantation of their faith by its members, 
or constitute an act of disloyalty to its spiritual, its basic and God-given 
principles and precepts, it will stubbornly refuse to bow, preferring 
imprisonment, deportation and all manner of persecution, including 
death--as already suffered by the twenty thousand martyrs 
that have laid down their lives in the path of its Founders--rather than 
follow the dictates of a temporal authority requiring it to renounce its 
allegiance to its cause.  
     "If you cut us in pieces, men, women and children alike, in the 
entire district of &amp;Abadih," was the memorable message sent by the fearless 
descendants of some of those martyrs in that turbulent center to 
the Governor of &amp;Fars, who had intended to coerce them into declaring 
themselves as Muslims, "we will never submit to your wishes"--a message 
which, as soon as it was delivered to that defiant governor, induced 
him to desist from pressing the matter any further.  
     In the United States of America, the &amp;Baha'i community, having 
already set an inspiring example, by erecting and perfecting the machinery 
of its Administrative Order, was alive to the far-reaching 
implications of the sentence passed by the Muslim court in Egypt, and 
to the significance of the reaction it had produced in the Holy Land, 
and was stimulated by the courageous persistence demonstrated by its 
sister-community in Persia.  It determined to supplement its notable 
achievements with further acts designed to throw into sharper relief 
the status achieved by the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the North American 
continent.  It was numerically smaller than the community of the 
Persian believers.  Owing to the multiplicity of laws governing the 
states within the Union, it was faced, in matters affecting the personal 
status of its members, with a situation radically different from that 
confronting the believers in the East, and much more complex.  But 
conscious of its responsibility to lend, once again, a powerful impetus 
to the unfoldment of a divinely appointed Order, it boldly undertook 
to initiate such measures as would accentuate the independent character 
of a Revelation it had already so nobly championed.  
 
+P373 
     The recognition of its National Spiritual Assembly by the Federal 
authorities as a religious body entitled to hold as trustees properties 
dedicated to the interests of the Faith; the establishment of &amp;Baha'i 
endowments and the exemption obtained for them from the civil 
authorities as properties owned by, and administered solely for the 
benefit of, a purely religious community, were now to be supplemented 
by decisions and measures designed to give further prominence to the 
nature of the ties uniting its members.  The special stress laid on some 
of the fundamental laws contained in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas regarding 
daily obligatory prayers; the observance of the fast, the consent of the 
parents as a prerequisite of marriage; the one-year separation between 
husband and wife as an indispensable condition of divorce; abstinence 
from all alcoholic drinks; the emphasis placed on the institution of the 
Nineteen Day Feast as ordained by &amp;Baha'u'llah in that same Book; the 
discontinuation of membership in, and affiliation with, all ecclesiastical 
organizations, and the refusal to accept any ecclesiastical post--these 
have served to forcibly underline the distinctive character of the 
&amp;Baha'i Fellowship, and to dissociate it, in the eyes of the public, from 
the rituals, the ceremonials and man-made institutions identified with 
the religious systems of the past.  
     Of particular and historic importance has been the application 
made by the Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Chicago--the first 
center established in the North American continent, the first to be 
incorporated among its sister-Assemblies and the first to take the initiative 
in paving the way for the erection of a &amp;Baha'i Temple in the 
West--to the civil authorities in the state of Illinois for civil recognition 
of the right to conduct legal marriages in accordance with the 
ordinances of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, and to file marriage certificates that 
have previously received the official sanction of that Assembly.  The 
acceptance of this petition by the authorities, necessitating an amendment 
of the by-laws of all local Assemblies to enable them to conduct 
&amp;Baha'i legal marriages, and empowering the Chairman or secretary of 
the Chicago Assembly to represent that body in the conduct of all 
&amp;Baha'i marriages; the issuance, on September 22, 1939, of the first 
&amp;Baha'i Marriage License by the State of Illinois, authorizing the 
aforementioned Assembly to solemnize &amp;Baha'i marriages and issue &amp;Baha'i 
marriage certificates; the successful measures taken subsequently by 
Assemblies in other states of the Union, such as New York, New 
Jersey, Wisconsin and Ohio, to procure for themselves similar privileges, 
have, moreover, contributed their share in giving added prominence 
to the independent religious status of the Faith.  To these must 
 
+P374 
be added a similar and no less significant recognition extended, since 
the outbreak of the present conflict, by the United States War Department
--as evidenced by the communication addressed to the American 
&amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly by the Quartermaster General of 
that Department, on August 14, 1942--approving the use of the 
symbol of the Greatest Name on stones marking the graves of &amp;Baha'is 
killed in the war and buried in military or private cemeteries, distinguishing 
thereby these graves from those bearing the Latin Cross or 
the Star of David assigned to those belonging to the Christian and 
Jewish Faiths respectively.  
     Nor should mention be omitted of the equally successful application 
made by the American &amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly to 
the Office of Price Administration in Washington, D.C., asking that 
the chairmen and secretaries of &amp;Baha'i local Assemblies should, in their 
capacity as officers conducting religious meetings, and authorized, in 
certain states, to perform marriage services, be eligible for preferred 
mileage under the provisions of the Preferred Mileage Section of the 
Gasoline Regulations, for the purpose of meeting the religious needs of 
the localities they serve.  
     Nor have the &amp;Baha'i communities in other countries such as India, 
&amp;Iraq, Great Britain and Australia, been slow to either appreciate the 
advantages derived from the publication of this historic verdict, or to 
exploit, each according to its capacity and within the limits imposed 
upon it by prevailing circumstances, the opportunities afforded by such 
public testimonial for a further demonstration on their part of the 
independent character of the Faith whose administrative structure they 
had already erected.  Through the enforcement, to whatever extent 
deemed practicable, of the laws ordained in their Most Holy Book; 
through the severance of all ties of affiliation with, and membership in, 
ecclesiastical institutions of whatever denomination; through the 
formulation of a policy initiated for the sole purpose of giving further 
publicity to this mighty issue, marking a great turning-point in the 
evolution of the Faith, and of facilitating its ultimate settlement, these 
communities, and indeed all organized &amp;Baha'i bodies, whether in the 
East or in the West, however isolated their position or immature their 
state of development, have, conscious of their solidarity and well aware 
of the glorious prospects opening before them, arisen to proclaim with 
one voice the independent character of the religion of &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
to pave the way for its emancipation from whatever fetters, be they 
ecclesiastical or otherwise, might hinder or delay its ultimate and 
world-wide recognition.  
 
+P375 
     To the status already achieved by their Faith, largely through 
their own unaided efforts and accomplishments, tributes have been 
paid by observers in various walks of life, whose testimony they welcome 
and regard as added incentive to action in their steep and laborious 
ascent towards the heights which they must eventually capture.  
     "Palestine," is the testimony of Prof. Norman Bentwitch, a 
former Attorney-General of the Palestine Government, "may indeed 
be now regarded as the land not of three but of four Faiths, because 
the &amp;Baha'i creed, which has its center of faith and pilgrimage in 
&amp;Akka and Haifa, is attaining to the character of a world religion.  So 
far as its influence goes in the land, it is a factor making for international 
and inter-religious understanding."  "In 1920," is the declaration 
made in his testament by the distinguished Swiss scientist and 
psychiatrist, Dr. Auguste Forel, "I learned at Karlsruhe of the 
supraconfessional world religion of the &amp;Baha'is, founded in the Orient seventy 
years ago by a Persian, &amp;Baha'u'llah.  This is the real religion of 
`Social Welfare' without dogmas or priests, binding together all men of 
this small terrestrial globe of ours.  I have become a &amp;Baha'i.  May this 
religion live and prosper for the good of humanity!  This is my most 
ardent desire."  "There is bound to be a world state, a universal language, 
and a universal religion," he, moreover has stated, "The &amp;Baha'i 
Movement for the oneness of mankind is, in my estimation, the greatest 
movement today working for universal peace and brotherhood."  "A 
religion," is yet another testimony, from the pen of the late Queen 
Marie of Rumania, "which links all creeds ... a religion based upon 
the inner spirit of God...  It teaches that all hatreds, intrigues, suspicions, 
evil words, all aggressive patriotism even, are outside the one 
essential law of God, and that special beliefs are but surface things 
whereas the heart that beats with Divine love knows no tribe nor race."  
 
+P376 
                                 CHAPTER XXV 
                International Expansion of Teaching Activities 
 
     While the fabric of the Administrative Order of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah gradually arose, and while through the influence of unforeseen 
forces the independence of the Faith was more and more definitely 
acknowledged by its enemies and demonstrated by its friends, another 
development, no less pregnant with consequences, was at the same time 
being set in motion.  The purpose of this was to extend the borders of 
the Faith, increasing the number of its declared supporters and of its 
administrative centers, and to give a new and ever growing impetus to 
the enriching, the expanding, the diversifying of its literature, and to 
the task of disseminating it farther and farther afield.  Experience 
indeed proved that the very pattern of the Administrative Order, apart 
from other distinctive features, definitely encouraged efficiency and 
expedition in this work of teaching, and its builders found their zeal 
continually quickened and their missionary ardor heightened as the 
Faith moved forward to an ever fuller emancipation.  
     Nor were they unmindful of the exhortations, the appeals and the 
promises of the Founders of their Faith, Who, for three quarters of a 
century, had, each in His own way and within the limits circumscribing 
His activities, labored so heroically to noise abroad the fame 
of the Cause Whose destiny an almighty Providence had commissioned 
them to shape.  
     The Herald of their Faith had commanded the sovereigns of the 
earth themselves to arise and teach His Cause, writing in the 
&amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma':  "O concourse of kings!  Deliver with truth and in 
all haste the verses sent down by Us to the peoples of Turkey and of 
India, and beyond them ... to lands in both the East and the West."  
"Issue forth from your cities, O peoples of the West," He, in that same 
Book, had moreover written, "to aid God."  "We behold you from Our 
Most Glorious Horizon," &amp;Baha'u'llah had thus addressed His followers 
in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, "and will assist whosoever will arise to aid My 
Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on high, and a cohort of the 
angels, who are nigh unto Me."  "...Teach ye the Cause of God, O 
people of &amp;Baha!"  He, furthermore, had written, "for God hath prescribed 
unto every one the duty of proclaiming His message, and 
 
+P377 
regardeth it as the most meritorious of all deeds."  "Should a man all 
alone," He had clearly affirmed, "arise in the name of &amp;Baha and put on the 
armor of His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious, 
though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against him."  
"Should any one arise for the triumph of Our Cause," He moreover 
had declared, "him will God render victorious though tens of thousands 
of enemies be leagued against him."  And again:  "Center your energies 
in the propagation of the Faith of God.  Whoso is worthy of so high a 
calling, let him arise and promote it.  Whoso is unable, it is his duty to 
appoint him who will, in his stead, proclaim this Revelation..."  
"They that have forsaken their country," is His own promise, "for the 
purpose of teaching Our Cause--these shall the Faithful Spirit 
strengthen through its power...  Such a service is indeed the prince 
of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of every goodly act."  "In these 
days," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had written in His Will, "the most important of 
all things is the guidance of the nations and peoples of the world.  
Teaching the Cause is of the utmost importance, for it is the head 
corner-stone of the foundation itself."  "The disciples of Christ," He 
had declared in that same Document, "forgot themselves and all earthly 
things, forsook all their cares and belongings, purged themselves of self 
and passion, and, with absolute detachment, scattered far and wide, and 
engaged in guiding aright the peoples of the world, till at last they 
made the world another world, illumined the earth, and to their last 
hour proved self-sacrificing in the path of that Beloved One of God.  
Finally, in various lands they suffered martyrdom.  Let men of action 
follow in their footsteps."  "When the hour cometh," He had solemnly 
stated in that same Will, "that this wronged and broken-winged bird 
will have taken its flight unto the celestial concourse ... it is incumbent 
upon ... the friends and loved ones, one and all, to bestir themselves 
and arise, with heart and soul, and in one accord ... to teach 
His Cause and promote His Faith.  It behoveth them not to rest for a 
moment...  They must disperse themselves in every land ... and 
travel throughout all regions.  Bestirred, without rest, and steadfast to 
the end, they must raise in every land the cry of &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha 
(O Thou the Glory of Glories) ... that throughout the East and the 
West a vast concourse may gather under the shadow of the Word of 
God, that the sweet savors of holiness may be wafted, that men's faces 
may be illumined, that their hearts may be filled with the Divine Spirit 
and their souls become heavenly."  
     Obedient to these repeated injunctions, mindful of these glowing 
promises, conscious of the sublimity of their calling, spurred on by the 
 
+P378 
example which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself had set, undismayed by His sudden 
removal from their midst, undaunted by the attacks launched by 
their adversaries from within and from without, His followers in both 
the East and in the West arose, in the full strength of their solidarity, 
to promote, more vigorously than ever before, the international expansion 
of their Faith, an expansion which was now to assume such proportions 
as to deserve to be recognized as one of the most significant 
developments in the history of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
     Launched in every continent of the globe, at first intermittent, 
haphazard, and unorganized, and later, as a result of the emergence of 
a slowly developing Administrative Order, systematically conducted, 
centrally directed and efficiently prosecuted, the teaching enterprises 
which were undertaken by the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in many lands, 
but conspicuously in America, and which were pursued by members 
of all ages and of both sexes, by neophytes and by veterans, by itinerant 
teachers and by settlers, constitute, by virtue of their range and the 
blessings which have flowed from them, a shining episode that yields 
place to none except those associated with the exploits which have immortalized 
the early years of the primitive age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
     The light of the Faith which during the nine years of the &amp;Babi 
Dispensation had irradiated Persia, and been reflected on the adjoining 
territory of &amp;Iraq; which in the course of &amp;Baha'u'llah's thirty-nine-year 
ministry had shed its splendor upon India, Egypt, Turkey, the 
Caucasus, &amp;Turkistan, the &amp;Sudan, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Burma, 
and which had subsequently, through the impulse of a divinely-instituted 
Covenant, traveled to the United States of America, Canada, 
France, Great Britain, Germany, Austria, Russia, Italy, Holland, 
Hungary, Switzerland, Arabia, Tunisia, China, Japan, the Hawaiian 
Islands, South Africa, Brazil and Australia, was now to be carried to, 
and illuminate, ere the termination of the first &amp;Baha'i century, no less 
than thirty-four independent nations, as well as several dependencies 
situated in the American, the Asiatic and African continents, in the 
Persian Gulf, and in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.  In Norway, 
in Sweden, in Denmark, in Belgium, in Finland, in Ireland, in Poland, 
in Czechoslovakia, in Rumania, in Yugoslavia, in Bulgaria, in Albania, 
in Afghanistan, in Abyssinia, in New Zealand and in nineteen Latin 
American Republics ensigns of the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah have been 
raised since &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing, and the structural basis of the 
Administrative Order of His Faith, in many of them, already established.  
In several dependencies, moreover, in both the East and the 
 
+P379 
West, including Alaska, Iceland, Jamaica, Porto Rico, the island of 
Solano in the Philippines, Java, Tasmania, the islands of &amp;Bahrayn and 
of Tahiti, Baluchistan, South Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo, 
the bearers of the new born Gospel have established their residence, 
and are bending every effort to lay an impregnable basis for its 
institutions.  
     Through lectures and conferences, through the press and radio, 
through the organization of study classes and fire-side gatherings, 
through participation in the activities of societies, institutes and clubs 
animated by ideals akin to the principles of the Faith, through the 
dissemination of &amp;Baha'i literature, through various exhibits, through 
the establishment of teacher training classes, through contact with 
statesmen, scholars, publicists, philanthropists and other leaders of public 
thought--most of which have been carried out through the resourcefulness 
of the members of the American &amp;Baha'i community, 
who have assumed direct responsibility for the spiritual conquest of 
the vast majority of these countries and dependencies--above all 
through the inflexible resolution and unswerving fidelity of pioneers 
who, whether as visiting teachers or as residents, have participated in 
these crusades, have these signal victories been achieved during the 
closing decades of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
     Nor should reference be omitted to the international teaching 
activities of the western followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
particularly the members of the stalwart American &amp;Baha'i community, 
who, seizing every opportunity that presented itself to them, have 
either through example, precept or the circulation of literature carried 
the Faith to virgin fields, scattering the seeds which must eventually 
germinate and yield a harvest as notable as those already garnered in 
the aforementioned countries.  Through such efforts as these the 
breezes of God's vitalizing Revelation have been blown upon the uttermost 
corners of the earth, bearing the germ of a new spiritual life to 
such distant climes and inhospitable regions as Lapland; the Island of 
Spitzbergen, the northernmost settlement in the world; Hammerfest, 
in Norway, and Magellanes, in the extremity of Chile--the most 
northerly and southerly cities of the globe respectively; Pago Pago 
and Fiji, in the Pacific Ocean; Chichen Itza, in the province of Yucatan; 
the Bahama Islands, Trinidad and Barbados in the West Indies; 
the Island of Bali and British North Borneo in the East Indies; Patagonia; 
British Guiana; Seychelles Islands; New Guinea and Ceylon.  
     Nor can we fail to notice the special endeavors that have been 
exerted by individuals as well as Assemblies for the purpose of establishing 
 
+P380 
contact with minority groups and races in various parts of the 
world, such as the Jews and Negroes in the United States of America, 
the Eskimos in Alaska, the Patagonian Indians in Argentina, the Mexican 
Indians in Mexico, the Inca Indians in Peru, the Cherokee Indians 
in North Carolina, the Oneida Indians in Wisconsin, the Mayans in 
Yucatan, the Lapps in Northern Scandinavia, and the Maoris in Rotorua, 
New Zealand.  
     Of special and valuable assistance has been the institution of an 
international &amp;Baha'i Bureau in Geneva, a center designed primarily to 
facilitate the expansion of the teaching activities of the Faith in the 
European continent, which, as an auxiliary to the world administrative 
center in the Holy Land, has maintained contact with &amp;Baha'i communities 
in the East and in the West.  Serving as a bureau of information 
on the Faith, as well as a distributing center for its literature, it 
has, through its free reading room and lending library, through the 
hospitality extended to itinerant teachers and visiting believers, and 
through its contact with various societies, contributed, in no small 
measure, to the consolidation of the teaching enterprises undertaken by 
individuals as well as &amp;Baha'i National Assemblies.  
     Through these teaching activities, some initiated by individual 
believers, others conducted through plans launched by organized 
Assemblies, the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah which, in His lifetime, had included 
within its ranks Persians, Arabs, Turks, Russians, Kurds, 
Indians, Burmese and Negroes, and was later, in the days of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
reinforced by the inclusion of American, British, German, 
French, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and Armenian converts, could now 
boast of having enrolled amongst its avowed supporters representatives 
of such widely dispersed ethnic groups and nationalities as Hungarians, 
Netherlanders, Irishmen, Scandinavians, Sudanese, Czechs, Bulgarians, 
Finns, Ethiopians, Albanians, Poles, Eskimos, American Indians, Yugoslavians, 
Latin Americans and Maoris.  
     So notable an enlargement of the limits of the Faith, so striking 
an increase in the diversity of the elements included within its pale, 
was accompanied by an enormous extension in the volume and the 
circulation of its literature, an extension that sharply contrasted with 
those initial measures undertaken for the publication of the few editions 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's writing issued during the concluding years of His 
ministry.  The range of &amp;Baha'i literature, confined during half a 
century, in the days of the &amp;Bab and of &amp;Baha'u'llah, to the two languages 
in which their teachings were originally revealed, and subsequently 
extended, in the lifetime of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, to include editions 
 
+P381 
published in the English, the French, the German, the Turkish, the 
Russian and Burmese languages, was steadily enlarged after His passing, 
through a vast multiplication in the number of books, treatises, 
pamphlets and leaflets, printed and circulated in no less than twenty-nine 
additional languages.  In Spanish and in Portuguese; in the three 
Scandinavian languages, in Finnish and in Icelandic; in Dutch, Italian, 
Czech, Polish, Hungarian, Rumanian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Greek and 
Albanian; in Hebrew and in Esperanto, in Armenian, in Kurdish and 
in Amharic; in Chinese and in Japanese; as well as in five Indian languages, 
namely Urdu, Gujrati, Bengali, Hindi, and Sindhi, books, 
mostly through the initiative of individual &amp;Baha'is, and partly through 
the intermediary of &amp;Baha'i assemblies, were published, widely distributed, 
and placed in private as well as public libraries in both the East 
and the West.  The literature of the Faith, moreover, is being translated 
at present into Latvian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Tamil, Mahratti, 
Pushtoo, Telegu, Kinarese, Singhalese, Malyalan, Oriya, Punjabi and 
Rajasthani.  
     No less remarkable has been the range of the literature produced 
and placed at the disposal of the general public in every continent of 
the globe, and carried by resolute and indefatigable pioneers to the 
furthermost ends of the earth, an enterprise in which the members of 
the American &amp;Baha'i community have again distinguished themselves.  
The publication of an English edition comprising selected passages 
from the more important and hitherto untranslated writings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, as well as of an English version of His "Epistle to the Son 
of the Wolf," and of a compilation, in the same language, of Prayers 
and Meditations revealed by His pen; the translation and publication 
of His "Hidden Words" in eight, of His "&amp;Kitab-i-Iqan" in seven, and 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's "Some Answered Questions" in six, languages; the 
compilation of the third volume of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets translated 
into English; the publication of books and treatises related to the principles 
of &amp;Baha'i belief and to the origin and development of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith; of an English translation of the 
Narrative of the early days of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation, written by the 
chronicler and poet, &amp;Nabil-i-Zarandi, subsequently published in Arabic 
and translated into German and Esperanto; of commentaries and of 
expositions of the &amp;Baha'i teachings, of administrative institutions and 
of kindred subjects, such as world federation, race unity and comparative 
religion by western authors and by former ministers of the Church
--all these attest the diversified character of &amp;Baha'i publications, so 
closely paralleled by their extensive dissemination over the surface of 
 
+P382 
the globe.  Moreover, the printing of documents related to the laws of 
the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, of books and pamphlets dealing with Biblical 
prophecies, of revised editions of some of the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha and of several &amp;Baha'i authors, of guides and study outlines 
for a wide variety of &amp;Baha'i books and subjects, of lessons in 
&amp;Baha'i Administration, of indexes to &amp;Baha'i books and periodicals, of 
anniversary cards and of calendars, of poems, songs, plays and pageants, 
of study outlines and a prayer-book for the training of &amp;Baha'i children, 
and of news letters, bulletins and periodicals issued in English, Persian, 
German, Esperanto, Arabic, French, Urdu, Burmese and Portuguese 
has contributed to swell the output and increase the diversity of &amp;Baha'i 
publications.  
     Of particular value and significance has been the production, over 
a period of many years, of successive volumes of biennial international 
record of &amp;Baha'i activity, profusely illustrated, fully documented, and 
comprising among other things a statement on the aims and purposes 
of the Faith and its Administrative Order, selections from its scriptures, 
a survey of its activities, a list of its centers in five continents, a 
bibliography of its literature, tributes paid to its ideals and achievements 
by prominent men and women in East and West, and articles 
dealing with its relation to present-day problems.  
     Nor would any survey of the &amp;Baha'i literature produced during the 
concluding decades of the first &amp;Baha'i century be complete without 
special reference being made to the publication of, and the far-reaching 
influence exerted by, that splendid, authoritative and comprehensive 
introduction to &amp;Baha'i history and teachings, penned by that pure-hearted 
and immortal promoter of the Faith, J. E. Esslemont, which 
has already been printed in no less than thirty-seven languages, and is 
being translated into thirteen additional languages, whose English 
version has already run into tens of thousands, which has been reprinted 
no less than nine times in the United States of America, whose 
Esperanto, Japanese and English versions have been transcribed into 
Braille, and to which royalty has paid its tribute, characterizing it as 
"a glorious book of love and goodness, strength and beauty," commending 
it to all, and affirming that "no man could fail to be better 
because of this Book."  
     Deserving special mention, moreover, is the establishment by the 
British National Spiritual Assembly of a Publishing Trust, registered 
as "The &amp;Baha'i Publishing Co." and acting as a publisher and wholesale 
distributor of &amp;Baha'i literature throughout the British Isles; the compilation 
by various &amp;Baha'i Assemblies throughout the East of no less 
 
+P383 
than forty volumes in manuscript of the authenticated and unpublished 
writings of the &amp;Bab, of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; the 
translation into English of the Appendix to the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, entitled 
"Questions and Answers," as well as the publication in Arabic and 
Persian by the Egyptian and Indian &amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies 
respectively of the Outline of &amp;Baha'i Laws on Matters of Personal 
Status, and of a brief outline by the latter Assembly of the laws 
relating to the burial of the dead; and the translation of a pamphlet 
into Maori undertaken by a Maori &amp;Baha'i in New Zealand.  Reference 
should also be made to the collection and publication by the Spiritual 
Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of &amp;Tihran of a considerable number of the 
addresses delivered by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the course of His Western tours; 
to the preparation of a detailed history of the Faith in Persian; to the 
printing of &amp;Baha'i certificates of marriage and divorce, in both Persian 
and Arabic, by a number of National Spiritual Assemblies in the East; 
to the issuance of birth and death certificates by the Persian &amp;Baha'i 
National Spiritual Assembly; to the preparation of forms of bequest 
available to believers wishing to make a legacy to the Faith; to the 
compilation of a considerable number of the unpublished Tablets of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha by the American &amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly; to 
the translation into Esperanto, undertaken by the daughter of the 
famous Zamenhof, herself a convert to the Faith, of several &amp;Baha'i 
books, including some of the more important writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; to the translation of a &amp;Baha'i booklet into Serbian 
by Prof. Bogdan Popovitch, one of the most eminent scholars attached 
to the University of Belgrade, and to the offer spontaneously made by 
Princess Ileana of Rumania (now Arch-Duchess Anton of Austria) to 
render into her own native language a &amp;Baha'i pamphlet written in English, 
and subsequently distributed in her native country.  
     The progress made in connection with the transcription of the 
&amp;Baha'i writings into Braille, should also be noted--a transcription 
which already includes such works as the English versions of the 
"&amp;Kitab-i-Iqan," of the "Hidden Words," of the "Seven Valleys," of the 
"&amp;Ishraqat," of the "&amp;Suriy-i-Haykal," of the "Words of Wisdom," of the 
"Prayers and Meditations of &amp;Baha'u'llah," of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's "Some 
Answered Questions," of the "Promulgation of Universal Peace," of 
the "Wisdom of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha," of "The Goal of a New World Order," 
as well as of the English (two editions), the Esperanto and the Japanese 
versions of "&amp;Baha'u'llah and the New Era" and of pamphlets 
written in English, in French and in Esperanto.  
     Nor have those who have been primarily responsible for the enrichment 
 
+P384 
of the literature of the Faith and its translation into so many 
languages, been slow to disseminate it, by every means in their power, 
in their daily intercourse with individuals as well as in their official 
contacts with organizations whom they have been seeking to acquaint 
with the aims and principles of their Faith.  The energy, the vigilance, 
the steadfastness displayed by these heralds of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and their elected representatives, under whose auspices the 
circulation of &amp;Baha'i literature has, of late years, assumed tremendous 
dimensions, merit the highest praise.  From the reports prepared and 
circulated by the chief agencies entrusted with the task of the publication 
and distribution of this literature in the United States and Canada 
the remarkable facts emerge that, within the space of the eleven 
months ending February 28, 1943, over 19,000 books, 100,000 pamphlets, 
3,000 study outlines, 4,000 sets of selected writings, and 1800 
anniversary and Temple cards and folders had been either sold or distributed; 
that, in the course of two years, 376,000 pamphlets, outlining 
the character and purpose of the House of Worship, erected in the 
United States of America, had been printed; that over 300,000 pieces 
of literature had been distributed at the two World Fairs held in San 
Francisco and New York; that, in a period of twelve months, 1089 
books had been donated to various libraries, and that, through the 
National Contacts Committee, during one year, more than 2,300 letters, 
with over 4,500 pamphlets, had reached authors, radio speakers, 
and representatives of the Jewish and Negro minorities, as well as various 
organizations interested in international affairs.  
     In the presentation of this vast literature to men of eminence and 
rank the elected representatives, as well as the traveling teachers, of the 
American &amp;Baha'i community, aided by Assemblies in other lands, have, 
likewise, exhibited an energy and determination as laudable as the 
efforts exerted for its production.  To the King of England, to Queen 
Marie of Rumania, to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to the Emperor 
of Japan, to the late President von Hindenburg, to the King of Denmark, 
to the Queen of Sweden, to King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, to the 
Emperor of Abyssinia, to the King of Egypt, to the late King Feisal of 
&amp;Iraq, to King Zog of Albania, to the late President Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, 
to the Presidents of Mexico, of Honduras, of Panama, of El-Salvador, 
of Guatemala, and of Porto Rico, to General Chiang Kaishek, 
to the Ex-Khedive of Egypt, to the Crown Prince of Sweden, to 
the Duke of Windsor, to the Duchess of Kent, to the Arch-Duchess 
Anton of Austria, to Princess Olga of Yugoslavia, to Princess Kadria of 
Egypt, to Princess Estelle Bernadotte of Wisborg, to Mahatma Gandhi, 
 
+P385 
to several ruling princes of India and to the Prime Ministers of all 
the states of the Australian Commonwealth--to these, as well as to 
other personages of lesser rank, &amp;Baha'i literature, touching various 
aspects of the Faith, has been presented, to some personally, to others 
through suitable intermediaries, either by individual believers or by the 
elected representatives of &amp;Baha'i communities.  
     Nor have these individual teachers and Assemblies been neglectful 
of their duty to place this literature at the disposal of the public in 
state, university and public libraries, thereby extending the opportunity 
to the great mass of the reading public of familiarizing itself 
with the history and precepts of the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  A mere 
enumeration of a number of the more important of these libraries 
would suffice to reveal the scope of these activities extending over five 
continents:  the British Museum in London, the Bodleian Library at 
Oxford, the Library of Congress in Washington, the Peace Palace 
Library at the Hague, the Nobel Peace Foundation and Nansen Foundation 
Libraries at Oslo, the Royal Library in Copenhagen, the League 
of Nations Library in Geneva, the Hoover Peace Library, the Amsterdam 
University Library, the Library of Parliament in Ottawa, the 
Allahabad University Library, the Aligarh University Library, the 
University of Madras Library, the Shantineketan International University 
Library in Bolepur, the &amp;Uthmaniyyih University Library in 
Hyderabad, the Imperial Library in Calcutta, the Jamia Milli Library 
in Delhi, the Mysore University Library, the Bernard Library in Rangoon, 
the Jerabia Wadia Library in Poona, the Lahore Public Library, 
the Lucknow and Delhi University Libraries, the Johannesburg Public 
Library, the Rio de Janeiro Circulating libraries, the Manila National 
Library, the Hong Kong University Library, the Reykjavik public 
libraries, the Carnegie Library in the Seychelles Islands, the Cuban National 
Library, the San Juan Public Library, the Ciudad Trujillo University 
Library, the University and Carnegie Public libraries in Porto 
Rico, the Library of Parliament in Canberra, the Wellington Parliamentary 
Library.  In all these, as well as in all the chief libraries of 
Australia and New Zealand, nine libraries in Mexico, several libraries 
in Mukden, Manchukuo, and more than a thousand public libraries, a 
hundred service libraries and two hundred university and college 
libraries, including Indian colleges, in the United States and Canada, 
authoritative books on the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah have been placed.  
     State prisons and, since the outbreak of the war, army libraries have 
been included in the comprehensive scheme which the American 
&amp;Baha'i community has, through a special committee, devised for the 
 
+P386 
diffusion of the literature of the Faith.  The interests of the blind, too, 
have not been neglected by that alert and enterprising community, 
as is shown by the placing of &amp;Baha'i books, transcribed by its members 
in Braille, in thirty libraries and institutes, in eighteen states of 
the United States of America, in Honolulu (Hawaii), in Regina 
(Saskatchewan), and in the Tokyo and Geneva Libraries for the Blind, 
as well as in a large number of circulating libraries connected with 
public libraries in various large cities of the North American 
continent.  
     Nor can I dismiss this subject without singling out for special 
reference her who, not only through her preponderating share in 
initiating measures for the translation and dissemination of &amp;Baha'i 
literature, but above all through her prodigious and indeed unique exertions 
in the international teaching field, has covered herself with a 
glory that has not only eclipsed the achievements of the teachers of 
the Faith among her contemporaries the globe around, but has outshone 
the feats accomplished by any of its propagators in the course of 
an entire century.  To Martha Root, that archetype of &amp;Baha'i itinerant 
teachers and the foremost Hand raised by &amp;Baha'u'llah since &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
passing, must be awarded, if her manifold services and the 
supreme act of her life are to be correctly appraised, the title of Leading 
Ambassadress of His Faith and Pride of &amp;Baha'i teachers, whether 
men or women, in both the East and the West.  
     The first to arise, in the very year the Tablets of the Divine Plan 
were unveiled in the United States of America, in response to the epoch-making 
summons voiced in them by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; embarking, with 
unswerving resolve and a spirit of sublime detachment, on her world 
journeys, covering an almost uninterrupted period of twenty years 
and carrying her four times round the globe, in the course of which 
she traveled four times to China and Japan and three times to India, 
visited every important city in South America, transmitted the message 
of the New Day to kings, queens, princes and princesses, presidents 
of republics, ministers and statesmen, publicists, professors, 
clergymen and poets, as well as a vast number of people in various 
walks of life, and contacted, both officially and informally, religious 
congresses, peace societies, Esperanto associations, socialist congresses, 
Theosophical societies, women's clubs and other kindred organizations, 
this indomitable soul has, by virtue of the character of her exertions 
and the quality of the victories she has won, established a record that 
constitutes the nearest approach to the example set by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
 
+P387 
Himself to His disciples in the course of His journeys throughout the 
West.  
     Her eight successive audiences with Queen Marie of Rumania, the 
first of which took place in January, 1926 in Controceni Palace in 
Bucharest, the second in 1927 in Pelisor Palace in Sinaia, followed by 
a visit in January of the ensuing year to her Majesty and her daughter 
Princess Ileana, at the royal palace in Belgrade, where they were staying 
as guests of the King and Queen of Yugoslavia, and later, in 
October, 1929, at the Queen's summer palace "Tehna Yuva," at Balcic, 
on the Black Sea, and again, in August, 1932 and February, 1933, at 
the home of Princess Ileana (now Arch-Duchess Anton of Austria) at 
&amp;Modling, near Vienna, followed a year later, in February, by another 
audience at Controceni Palace, and lastly, in February, 1936, in that 
same palace--these audiences stand out, by reason of the profound 
influence exerted by the visitor on her royal hostess, as witnessed by 
the successive encomiums from the Queen's own pen, as the most outstanding 
feature of those memorable journeys.  The three invitations 
which that indefatigable champion of the Faith received to call on 
Prince Paul and Princess Olga of Yugoslavia at the Royal Palace in 
Belgrade; the lectures which she delivered in over four hundred universities 
and colleges in both the East and the West; her twice repeated 
visits to all German universities with the exception of two, as well as 
to nearly a hundred universities, colleges and schools in China; the 
innumerable articles which she published in newspapers and magazines 
in practically every country she visited; the numerous broadcasts 
which she delivered and the unnumbered books she placed in private 
and state libraries; her personal meetings with the statesmen of more 
than fifty countries, during her three-months stay in Geneva, in 1932, 
at the time of the Disarmament Conference; the painstaking efforts she 
exerted, while on her arduous journeys, in supervising the translation 
and production of a large number of versions of Dr. Esslemont's 
"&amp;Baha'u'llah and the New Era"; the correspondence exchanged with, 
and the presentation of &amp;Baha'i books to, men of eminence and learning; 
her pilgrimage to Persia, and the touching homage paid by her to 
the memory of the heroes of the Faith when visiting the &amp;Baha'i historic 
sites in that country; her visit to Adrianople, where, in her overflowing 
love for &amp;Baha'u'llah, she searched out the houses where He had 
dwelt and the people whom He had met during His exile to that city, 
and where she was entertained by its governor and mayor; the ready 
and unfailing assistance extended by her to the administrators of the 
Faith in all countries where its institutions had been erected or were being 
 
+P388 
established--these may be regarded as the highlights of a service 
which, in many of its aspects, is without parallel in the entire history of 
the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
     No less impressive is the list of the names of those whom she interviewed 
in the course of the execution of her mission, including, in 
addition to those already mentioned, such royal personages and distinguished 
figures as King Haakon of Norway; King Feisal of &amp;Iraq; 
King Zog of Albania and members of his family; Princess Marina of 
Greece (now the Duchess of Kent); Princess Elizabeth of Greece; 
President Thomas G. Masaryk and President Eduard Benes of Czechoslovakia; 
the President of Austria; Dr. Sun Yat Sen; Dr. Nicholas Murray 
Butler, President of Columbia University; Prof. Bogdan Popovitch 
of Belgrade University; the Foreign Minister of Turkey, &amp;Tawfiq 
&amp;Rushdi Bey; the Chinese Foreign Minister and Minister of Education; 
the Lithuanian Foreign Minister; Prince &amp;Muhammad-'Ali of Egypt; 
Stephen Raditch; the Maharajas of Patiala, of Benares, and of Travancore; 
the Governor and the Grand &amp;Mufti of Jerusalem; Dr. Erling 
Eidem, Archbishop of Sweden; Sarojini Naidu; Sir Rabindranath 
Tagore; Madame Huda &amp;Sha'ravi, the Egyptian feminist leader; Dr. K. 
Ichiki, minister of the Japanese Imperial Household; Prof. Tetrujiro 
Inouye, Prof. Emeritus of the Imperial University of Tokyo; Baron 
Yoshiro Sakatani, member of the House of Peers of Japan and Mehmed 
Fuad, Doyen of the Faculty of Letters and President of the Institute 
of Turkish history.  
     Neither age nor ill-health, neither the paucity of literature which 
hampered her early efforts, nor the meager resources which imposed 
an added burden on her labors, neither the extremities of the climates 
to which she was exposed, nor the political disturbances which she 
encountered in the course of her journeys, could damp the zeal or 
deflect the purpose of this spiritually dynamic and saintly woman.  
Single-handed and, on more than one occasion, in extremely perilous 
circumstances, she continued to call, in clarion tones, men of diverse 
creeds, color and classes to the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah, until, while in 
spite of a deadly and painful disease, the onslaught of which she endured 
with heroic fortitude, she hastened homeward to help in the 
recently launched Seven Year Plan, she was stricken down on her way, 
in far off Honolulu.  There in that symbolic spot between the Eastern 
and Western Hemispheres, in both of which she had labored so mightily, 
she died, on September 28, 1939, and brought to its close a life which 
may well be regarded as the fairest fruit as yet yielded by the Formative 
Age of the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P389 
     To the injunction of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha bequeathed in His Will to follow 
in the footsteps of the disciples of Jesus Christ, "not to rest for a 
moment," to "travel throughout all regions" and to raise, "without rest 
and steadfast to the end," "in every land, the cry of `&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha,'" 
this immortal heroine yielded an obedience of which the present 
as well as future generations may well be proud, and which they 
may emulate.  
     "Unrestrained as the wind," putting her "whole trust" in God, as 
"the best provision" for her journey, she fulfilled almost to the letter 
the wish so poignantly expressed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets, whose 
summons she had instantly arisen to carry out:  "O that I could travel, 
even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, 
raising the call of `&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha' in cities, villages, mountains, 
deserts and oceans, promote the Divine teachings!  This, alas, I cannot 
do.  How intensely I deplore it!  Please God, ye may achieve it."  
     "I am deeply distressed to hear of the death of good Miss Martha 
Root," is the royal tribute paid to her memory by Princess Olga of 
Yugoslavia, on being informed of her death, "as I had no idea of it.  We 
always enjoyed her visits in the past.  She was so kind and gentle, and 
a real worker for peace.  I am sure she will be sadly missed in her work."  
     "Thou art, in truth, a herald of the Kingdom and a harbinger of 
the Covenant," is the testimony from the unerring pen of the Center 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant Himself, "Thou art truly self-sacrificing.  
Thou showest kindness unto all nations.  Thou art sowing a seed that 
shall, in due time, give rise to thousands of harvests.  Thou art planting 
a tree that shall eternally put forth leaves and blossoms and yield fruits, 
and whose shadow shall day by day grow in magnitude."  
     Of all the services rendered the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah by this star 
servant of His Faith, the most superb and by far the most momentous 
has been the almost instantaneous response evoked in Queen Marie of 
Rumania to the Message which that ardent and audacious pioneer had 
carried to her during one of the darkest moments of her life, an hour 
of bitter need, perplexity and sorrow.  "It came," she herself in a letter 
had testified, "as all great messages come, at an hour of dire grief and 
inner conflict and distress, so the seed sank deeply."  
     Eldest daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was the second 
son of that Queen to whom &amp;Baha'u'llah had, in a significant Tablet, 
addressed words of commendation; granddaughter of Czar Alexander 
II to whom an Epistle had been revealed by that same Pen; related by 
both birth and marriage to Europe's most prominent families; born in 
the Anglican Faith; closely associated through her marriage with the 
 
+P390 
Greek Orthodox Church, the state religion of her adopted country; 
herself an accomplished authoress; possessed of a charming and radiant 
personality; highly talented, clear-visioned, daring and ardent by 
nature; keenly devoted to all enterprises of a humanitarian character, 
she, alone among her sister-queens, alone among all those of royal birth 
or station, was moved to spontaneously acclaim the greatness of the 
Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah, to proclaim His Fatherhood, as well as the 
Prophethood of &amp;Muhammad, to commend the &amp;Baha'i teachings to all 
men and women, and to extol their potency, sublimity and beauty.  
     Through the fearless acknowledgment of her belief to her own kith 
and kin, and particularly to her youngest daughter; through three 
successive encomiums that constitute her greatest and abiding legacy 
to posterity; through three additional appreciations penned by her as 
her contribution to &amp;Baha'i publications; through several letters written 
to friends and associates, as well as those addressed to her guide and 
spiritual mother; through various tokens expressive of faith and gratitude 
for the glad-tidings that had been brought to her through the 
orders for &amp;Baha'i books placed by her and her youngest daughter; and 
lastly through her frustrated pilgrimage to the Holy Land for the express 
purpose of paying homage at the graves of the Founders of the 
Faith--through such acts as these this illustrious queen may well deserve 
to rank as the first of those royal supporters of the Cause of God 
who are to arise in the future, and each of whom, in the words of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, is to be acclaimed as "the very eye of mankind, 
the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead 
of blessings unto the whole world."  
     "Some of those of my caste," she, in a personal letter, has significantly 
testified, "wonder at and disapprove my courage to step forward 
pronouncing words not habitual for crowned heads to pronounce, but 
I advance by an inner urge I cannot resist.  With bowed head I recognize 
that I too am but an instrument in greater Hands, and I rejoice 
in the knowledge."  
     A note which Martha Root, upon her arrival in Bucharest, sent to 
her Majesty and a copy of "&amp;Baha'u'llah and the New Era," which 
accompanied the note, and which so absorbed the Queen's attention 
that she continued reading it into the small hours of the morning, led, 
two days later, to the Queen's granting Martha Root an audience, on 
January 30, 1926, in Controceni Palace in Bucharest, in the course of 
which her Majesty avowed her belief that "these teachings are the solution 
for the world's problems"; and from these followed her publication, 
that same year on her own initiative, of those three epoch-making 
 
+P391 
testimonies which appeared in nearly two hundred newspapers of the 
United States and Canada, and which were subsequently translated 
and published in Europe, China, Japan, Australia, the Near East and 
the Islands of the seas.  
     In the first of these testimonies she affirmed that the writings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha are "a great cry toward peace, reaching 
beyond all limits of frontiers, above all dissensions about rites and 
dogmas...  It is a wondrous message that &amp;Baha'u'llah and His Son 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha have given us!  They have not set it up aggressively, 
knowing that the germ of eternal truth which lies at its core cannot 
but take root and spread...  It is Christ's message taken up anew, 
in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more 
difference that lies between the year one and today."  She added a remarkable 
admonition, reminiscent of the telling words of Dr. Benjamin 
Jowett, who had hailed the Faith, in his conversation with his 
pupil, Prof. Lewis Campbell, as "the greatest light that has come into 
the world since the time of Jesus Christ," and cautioned him to 
"watch it" and never let it out of his sight.  "If ever," wrote the Queen, 
"the name of &amp;Baha'u'llah or &amp;Abdu'l-Baha comes to your attention, do 
not put their writings from you.  Search out their books, and let their 
glorious, peace-bringing, love-creating words and lessons sink into your 
hearts as they have into mine...  Seek them and be the happier."  
     In another of these testimonies, wherein she makes a significant 
comment on the station of the Arabian Prophet, she declared:  "God is 
all.  Everything.  He is the power behind all beings...  His is the 
voice within us that shows us good and evil.  But mostly we ignore or 
misunderstand this voice.  Therefore, did He choose His Elect to come 
down amongst us upon earth to make clear His Word, His real meaning.  
Therefore the Prophets; therefore Christ, &amp;Muhammad, &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
for man needs from time to time a voice upon earth to bring God 
to him, to sharpen the realization of the existence of the true God.  
Those voices sent to us had to become flesh, so that with our earthly 
ears we should be able to hear and understand."  
     In appreciation of these testimonies a communication was addressed 
to her, in the name of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in East and 
West, and in the course of the deeply touching letter which she sent 
in reply she wrote:  "Indeed a great light came to me with the Message of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha...  My youngest daughter finds also 
great strength and comfort in the teachings of the beloved Masters.  
We pass on the Message from mouth to mouth, and all those we give 
it to see a light suddenly lighting before them, and much that was 
 
+P392 
obscure and perplexing becomes simple, luminous and full of hope as 
never before.  That my open letter was a balm to those suffering for 
the Cause, is indeed a great happiness to me, and I take it as a sign 
that God accepted my humble tribute.  The occasion given me to be 
able to express myself publicly was also His work, for indeed it was a 
chain of circumstances of which each link led me unwittingly one step 
further, till suddenly all was clear before my eyes and I understood 
why it had been.  Thus does He lead us finally to our ultimate destiny 
...Little by little the veil is lifting, grief tore it in two.  And grief 
was also a step leading me ever nearer truth; therefore do I not cry 
out against grief!"  
     In a significant and moving letter to an intimate American friend 
of hers, residing in Paris, she wrote:  "Lately a great hope has come to 
me from one &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  I have found in His and His Father, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Message of faith, all my yearning for real religion satisfied 
...What I mean:  these Books have strengthened me beyond 
belief, and I am now ready to die any day full of hope.  But I pray 
God not to take me away yet, for I still have a lot of work to do."  
     And again in one of her later appreciations of the Faith:  "The &amp;Baha'i 
teaching brings peace and understanding.  It is like a wide embrace 
gathering all those who have long searched for words of hope...  
Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions 
and wearied of their intolerance towards each other, I discovered in 
the &amp;Baha'i teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and 
misunderstood."  And again, this wonderful confession:  "The &amp;Baha'i 
teaching brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart.  To those in 
search of assurance the words of the Father are as a fountain in the 
desert after long wandering."  
     "The beautiful truth of &amp;Baha'u'llah," she wrote to Martha Root, 
"is with me always, a help and an inspiration.  What I wrote was because 
my heart overflowed with gratitude for the reflection you 
brought me.  I am happy if you think I helped.  I thought it might 
bring truth nearer because my words are read by so many."  
     In the course of a visit to the Near East she expressed her intention 
of visiting the &amp;Baha'i Shrines, and, accompanied by her youngest 
daughter, actually passed through Haifa, and was within sight of her 
goal, when she was denied the right to make the pilgrimage she had 
planned--to the keen disappointment of the aged Greatest Holy Leaf 
who had eagerly expected her arrival.  A few months later, in June, 
1931, she wrote in the course of a letter to Martha Root:  "Both Ileana 
and I were cruelly disappointed at having been prevented going to the 
 
+P393 
holy Shrines ... but at that time we were going through a cruel 
crisis, and every movement I made was being turned against me and 
being politically exploited in an unkind way.  It caused me a good 
deal of suffering and curtailed my liberty most unkindly...  But 
the beauty of truth remains, and I cling to it through all the vicissitudes 
of a life become rather sad...  I am glad to hear that your 
traveling has been so fruitful, and I wish you continual success 
knowing what a beautiful Message you are carrying from land 
to land."  
     After this sad disappointment she wrote to a friend of her childhood 
who dwelt near &amp;Akka, in a house formerly occupied by &amp;Baha'u'llah:  
"It was indeed nice to hear from you, and to think that you are 
of all things living near Haifa and are, as I am, a follower of the &amp;Baha'i 
teachings.  It interests me that you are living in that special house...  
I was so intensely interested and studied each photo intently.  It must 
be a lovely place ... and the house you live in, so incredibly attractive 
and made precious by its associations with the Man we all 
venerate..."  
     Her last public tribute to the Faith she had dearly loved was made 
two years before her death.  "More than ever today," she wrote, "when 
the world is facing such a crisis of bewilderment and unrest, must we 
stand firm in Faith seeking that which binds together instead of tearing 
asunder.  To those searching for light, the &amp;Baha'i teachings offer a 
star which will lead them to deeper understanding, to assurance, peace 
and goodwill with all men."  
     Martha Root's own illuminating record is given in one of her 
articles as follows:  "For ten years Her Majesty and her daughter, 
H.R.H. Princess Ileana (now Arch-Duchess Anton) have read with 
interest each new book about the &amp;Baha'i Movement, as soon as it came 
from the press...  Received in audience by Her Majesty in Pelisor 
Palace, Sinaia, in 1927, after the passing of His Majesty King Ferdinand, 
her husband, she graciously gave me an interview, speaking of 
the &amp;Baha'i teachings about immortality.  She had on her table and on 
the divan a number of &amp;Baha'i books, for she had just been reading in 
each of them the Teachings about life after death.  She asked the writer 
to give her greeting to ... the friends in &amp;Iran and to the many 
American &amp;Baha'is, who she said had been so remarkably kind to her 
during her trip through the United States the year before...  Meeting 
the Queen again on January 19, 1928, in the Royal Palace in Belgrade, 
where she and H.R.H. Princess Ileana were guests of the Queen 
of Yugoslavia--and they had brought some of their &amp;Baha'i books with 
 
+P394 
them--the words that I shall remember longest of all that her dear 
Majesty said were these:  `The ultimate dream which we shall realize is 
that the &amp;Baha'i channel of thought has such strength, it will serve 
little by little to become a light to all those searching for the real 
expression of Truth'...  Then in the audience in Controceni Palace, on 
February 16, 1934, when her Majesty was told that the Rumanian 
translation of `&amp;Baha'u'llah and the New Era' had just been published 
in Bucharest, she said she was so happy that her people were to have 
the blessing of reading this precious teaching...  And now today, 
February 4, 1936, I have just had another audience with Her Majesty 
in Controceni Palace, in Bucharest...  Again Queen Marie of Rumania 
received me cordially in her softly lighted library, for the hour 
was six o'clock...  What a memorable visit it was!...  She also 
told me that when she was in London she had met a &amp;Baha'i, Lady 
Blomfield, who had shown her the original Message that &amp;Baha'u'llah 
had sent to her grand-mother, Queen Victoria, in London.  She asked 
the writer about the progress of the &amp;Baha'i Movement, especially in the 
Balkan countries...  She spoke too of several &amp;Baha'i books, the 
depths of "&amp;Iqan," and especially of "Gleanings from the Writings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah," which she said was a wonderful book!  To quote her own 
words:  `Even doubters would find a powerful strength in it, if they 
would read it alone, and would give their souls time to expand.'  
...I asked her if I could perhaps speak of the brooch which historically 
is precious to &amp;Baha'is, and she replied, `Yes, you may.'  Once, 
and it was in 1928, Her dear Majesty had given the writer a gift, a 
lovely and rare brooch which had been a gift to the Queen from her 
royal relatives in Russia some years ago.  It was two little wings of 
wrought gold and silver, set with tiny diamond chips, and joined 
together with one large pearl.  `Always you are giving gifts to others, 
and I am going to give you a gift from me,' said the Queen smiling, and 
she herself clasped it onto my dress.  The wings and the pearl made it 
seem `Light-bearing' &amp;Baha'i!  It was sent the same week to Chicago as 
a gift to the &amp;Baha'i Temple ... and at the National &amp;Baha'i Convention 
which was in session that spring, a demur was made--should a 
gift from the Queen be sold?  Should it not be kept as a souvenir of the 
first Queen who arose to promote the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah?  However, 
it was sold immediately and the money given to the Temple, for all 
&amp;Baha'is were giving to the utmost to forward this mighty structure, 
the first of its kind in the United States of America.  Mr. Willard 
Hatch, a &amp;Baha'i of Los Angeles, Calif., who bought the exquisite 
brooch, took it to Haifa, Palestine, in 1931, and placed it in the 
 
+P395 
Archives on Mt. Carmel, where down the ages it will rest with the 
&amp;Baha'i treasures..."  
     In July, 1938, Queen Marie of Rumania passed away.  A message 
of condolence was communicated, in the name of all &amp;Baha'i communities 
in East and West, to her daughter, the Queen of Yugoslavia, to 
which she replied expressing "sincere thanks to all of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
followers."  The National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of Persia 
addressed, on behalf of the followers of the Faith in &amp;Baha'u'llah's native 
land, a letter expressive of grief and sympathy to her son, the King of 
Rumania and the Rumanian Royal Family, the text of which was in 
both Persian and English.  An expression of profound and loving 
sympathy was sent by Martha Root to Princess Ileana, and was gratefully 
acknowledged by her.  Memorial gatherings were held in the 
Queen's memory, at which a meed of honor was paid to her bold and 
epochal confession of faith in the Fatherhood of &amp;Baha'u'llah, to her 
recognition of the station of the Prophet of &amp;Islam and to the several 
encomiums from her pen.  On the first anniversary of her death the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &amp;Baha'is of the United States and 
Canada demonstrated its grateful admiration and affection for the 
deceased Queen by associating itself, through an imposing floral offering, 
with the impressive memorial service, held in her honor, and 
arranged by the Rumanian Minister, in Bethlehem Chapel, at the 
Cathedral of Washington, D.C., at which the American delegation, 
headed by the Secretary of State and including government officials 
and representatives of the Army and Navy, the British, French and 
Italian Ambassadors, and representatives of other European embassies 
and legations joined in a common tribute to one who, apart from the 
imperishable renown achieved by her in the Kingdom of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
had earned, in this earthly life, the esteem and love of many a soul 
living beyond the confines of her own country.  
     Queen Marie's acknowledgment of the Divine Message stands as 
the first fruits of the vision which &amp;Baha'u'llah had seen long before in 
His captivity, and had announced in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas.  "How great," 
He wrote, "the blessedness that awaits the King who will arise to aid 
My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but 
Me!...  All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and 
aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the Omnipotent 
Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms.  
Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the 
brow of creation, the fountain-head of blessings unto the whole world.  
 
+P396 
Offer up, O people of &amp;Baha, your substance, nay your very lives for 
his assistance."  
     The American &amp;Baha'i community, crowned with imperishable 
glory by these signal international services of Martha Root, was destined, 
as the first &amp;Baha'i century drew to a close, to distinguish itself, 
through the concerted efforts of its members, both at home and abroad, 
by further achievements of such scope and quality that no survey of 
the teaching activities of the Faith in the course of that century can 
afford to ignore them.  It would be no exaggeration to say that these 
colossal achievements, with the amazing results which flowed from 
them, could only have been effected through the harnessing of all the 
agencies of a newly established Administrative Order, operating in 
conformity with a carefully conceived Plan, and that they constitute 
a befitting conclusion to the record of a hundred years of sublime 
endeavor in the service of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     That the community of His followers in the United States and 
Canada should have carried off the palm of victory in the concluding 
years of such a glorious century is not a matter for surprise.  Its 
accomplishments during the last two decades of the Heroic, and throughout 
the first fifteen years of the Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, 
had already augured well for its future, and had paved the way for 
its final victory ere the expiration of the first century of the &amp;Baha'i 
Era.  
     The &amp;Bab had in His &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', almost a hundred years 
previously, sounded His specific summons to the "peoples of the West" 
to "issue forth" from their "cities" and aid His Cause.  &amp;Baha'u'llah, in 
His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, had collectively addressed the Presidents of the 
Republics of the entire Americas, bidding them arise and "bind with 
the hands of justice the broken," and "crush the oppressor" with the 
"rod of the commandments" of their Lord, and had, moreover, anticipated 
in His writings the appearance "in the West" of the "signs of His 
Dominion."  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had, on His part, declared that the "illumination" 
shed by His Father's Revelation upon the West would acquire 
an "extraordinary brilliancy," and that the "light of the Kingdom" 
would "shed a still greater illumination upon the West" than upon the 
East.  He had extolled the American continent in particular as "the 
land wherein the splendors of His Light shall be revealed, where the 
mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled," and affirmed that "it will lead 
all nations spiritually."  More specifically still, He had singled out the 
Great Republic of the West, the leading nation of that continent, 
declaring that its people were "indeed worthy of being the first to 
 
+P397 
build the Tabernacle of the Most Great Peace and proclaim the oneness 
of mankind," that it was "equipped and empowered to accomplish 
that which will adorn the pages of history, to become the envy of the 
world, and be blest in both the East and the West."  
     The first act of His ministry had been to unfurl the standard of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in the very heart of that Republic.  This was followed by 
His own prolonged visit to its shores, by His dedication of the first 
House of Worship to be built by the community of His disciples in 
that land, and finally by the revelation, in the evening of His life, 
of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, investing His disciples with a mandate 
to plant the banner of His Father's Faith, as He had planted it in 
their own land, in all the continents, the countries and islands of the 
globe.  He had, furthermore, acclaimed one of their most celebrated 
presidents as one who, through the ideals he had expounded and the 
institutions he had inaugurated, had caused the "dawn" of the Peace 
anticipated by &amp;Baha'u'llah to break; had voiced the hope that from 
their country "heavenly illumination" may "stream to all the peoples 
of the world"; had designated them in those Tablets as "Apostles of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah"; had assured them that, "should success crown" their 
"enterprise," "the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude 
of its majesty and glory, be firmly established"; and had made the 
stirring announcement that "the moment this Divine Message is propagated" 
by them "through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa 
and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community 
will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting 
dominion," and that "the whole earth" would "resound with the 
praises of its majesty and greatness."  
     That Community had already, in the lifetime of Him Who had 
created it, tenderly nursed and repeatedly blessed it, and had at last 
conferred upon it so distinctive a mission, arisen to launch the enterprise 
of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar through the purchase of its land and 
the laying of its foundations.  It had despatched its teachers to the 
East and to the West to propagate the Cause it had espoused, had established 
the basis of its community life, and had, since His passing, 
erected the superstructure and commenced the external ornamentation 
of its Temple.  It had, moreover, assumed a preponderating share 
in the task of erecting the framework of the Administrative Order of 
the Faith, of championing its cause, of demonstrating its independent 
character, of enriching and disseminating its literature, of lending 
moral and material assistance to its persecuted followers, of repelling 
the assaults of its adversaries and of winning the allegiance of royalty 
 
+P398 
to its Founder.  Such a splendid record was to culminate, as the century 
approached its end, in the initiation of a Plan--the first stage in the 
execution of the Mission entrusted to it by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha--which, 
within the space of seven brief years, was to bring to a successful completion 
the exterior ornamentation of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, to 
almost double the number of Spiritual Assemblies functioning in the 
North American continent, to bring the total number of localities in 
which &amp;Baha'is reside to no less than thirteen hundred and twenty-two 
in that same continent, to establish the structural basis of the Administrative 
Order in every state of the United States and every province 
of Canada, and by laying a firm anchorage in each of the twenty 
Republics of Central and South America, to swell to sixty the number 
of the sovereign states included within its orbit.  
     Many and diverse forces combined now to urge the American 
&amp;Baha'i community to strong action:  the glowing exhortations and 
promises of &amp;Baha'u'llah and His behest to erect in His name Houses of 
Worship; the directions issued by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in fourteen Tablets 
addressed to the believers residing in the Western, the Central, the 
North Eastern and Southern States of the North American Republic 
and in the Dominion of Canada; His prophetic utterances regarding 
the future of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in America; the influence of the 
new Administrative Order in fostering and rendering effective an eager 
spirit of cooperation; the example of Martha Root who, though 
equipped with no more than a handful of inadequately translated 
leaflets, had traveled to South America and visited every important city 
in that continent; the tenacity and self-sacrifice of the fearless and 
brilliant Keith Ransom-Kehler, the first American martyr, who, journeying 
to Persia had pleaded in numerous interviews with ministers, 
ecclesiastics and government officials the cause of her down-trodden 
brethren in that land, had addressed no less than seven petitions to the 
&amp;Shah, and, heedless of the warnings of age and ill-health, had at last 
succumbed in &amp;Isfahan.  Other factors which spurred the members of 
that community to fresh sacrifices and adventure were their eagerness 
to reinforce the work intermittently undertaken through the settlement 
and travels of a number of pioneers, who had established the 
first center of the Faith in Brazil, circumnavigated the South American 
continent and visited the West Indies and distributed literature 
in various countries of Central and South America; the consciousness 
of their pressing responsibilities in the face of a rapidly deteriorating 
international situation; the realization that the first &amp;Baha'i century was 
fast speeding to a close and their anxiety to bring to a befitting conclusion 
 
+P399 
an enterprise that had been launched thirty years previously.  
Undeterred by the immensity of the field, the power wielded by firmly 
entrenched ecclesiastical organizations, the political instability of some 
of the countries in which they were to settle, the climatic conditions 
they were to encounter, and the difference in language and custom of 
the people amongst whom they were to reside, and keenly aware of the 
crying needs of the Faith in the North American continent, the members 
of the American &amp;Baha'i community arose, as one man, to inaugurate 
a threefold campaign, carefully planned and systematically conducted, 
designed to establish a Spiritual Assembly in every virgin state 
and province in North America, to form a nucleus of resident believers 
in each of the Republics of Central and South America, and to consummate 
the exterior ornamentation of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  
     A hundred activities, administrative and educational, were devised 
and pursued for the prosecution of this noble Plan.  Through the 
liberal contribution of funds; through the establishment of an Inter-America 
Committee and the formation of auxiliary Regional Teaching 
Committees; through the founding of an International School to 
provide training for &amp;Baha'i teachers; through the settlement of 
pioneers in virgin areas and the visits of itinerant teachers; through 
the dissemination of literature in Spanish and Portuguese; through the 
initiation of teacher training courses and extension work by groups and 
local Assemblies; through newspaper and radio publicity; through the 
exhibition of Temple slides and models; through inter-community 
conferences and lectures delivered in universities and colleges; through 
the intensification of teaching courses and Latin American studies at 
summer schools--through these and other activities the prosecutors of 
this Seven-Year Plan have succeeded in sealing the triumph of what 
must be regarded as the greatest collective enterprise ever launched by 
the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the entire history of the first &amp;Baha'i 
century.  
     Indeed, ere the expiry of that century not only had the work on 
the Temple been completed sixteen months before the appointed time, 
but instead of one tiny nucleus in every Latin Republic, Spiritual Assemblies 
had already been established in Mexico City and Puebla 
(Mexico), in Buenos Aires (Argentina), in Guatemala City (Guatemala), 
in Santiago (Chile), in Montevideo (Uruguay), in Quito 
(Ecuador), in &amp;Bogota (Colombia), in Lima (Peru), in Asuncion 
(Paraguay), in Tegucigalpa (Honduras), in San Salvador (El-Salvador), 
in San &amp;Jose and Puntarenas (Costa Rica), in Havana (Cuba) 
and in Port-au-Prince (Haiti).  Extension work, in which newly 
 
+P400 
fledged Latin American believers were participating, had, moreover, 
been initiated, and was being vigorously carried out, in the Republics 
of Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Panama and Costa Rica; 
believers had established their residence not only in the capital 
cities of all the Latin American Republics, but also in such centers as 
Veracruz, Cananea and Tacubaya (Mexico), in Balboa and Christobal 
(Panama), in Recife (Brazil), in Guayaquil and Ambato (Ecuador), 
and in Temuco and Magellanes (Chile); the Spiritual Assemblies of the 
&amp;Baha'is of Mexico City and of San &amp;Jose had been incorporated; in the 
former city a &amp;Baha'i center, comprising a library, a reading room and a 
lecture room, had been founded; &amp;Baha'i Youth Symposiums had been 
observed in Havana, Buenos Aires and Santiago, whilst a distributing 
center of &amp;Baha'i literature for Latin America had been established in 
Buenos Aires.  
     Nor was this gigantic enterprise destined to be deprived, in its 
initial stage, of a blessing that was to cement the spiritual union of the 
Americas--a blessing flowing from the sacrifice of one who, at the 
very dawn of the Day of the Covenant, had been responsible for the 
establishment of the first &amp;Baha'i centers in both Europe and the 
Dominion of Canada, and who, though seventy years of age and suffering 
from ill-health, undertook a six thousand mile voyage to the 
capital of Argentina, where, while still on the threshold of her pioneer 
service, she suddenly passed away, imparting through such a death to 
the work initiated in that Republic an impetus which has already 
enabled it, through the establishment of a distributing center of 
&amp;Baha'i literature for Latin America and through other activities, to 
assume the foremost position among its sister Republics.  
     To May Maxwell, laid to rest in the soil of Argentina; to Hyde 
Dunn, whose dust reposes in the Antipodes, in the city of Sydney; to 
Keith Ransom-Kehler, entombed in distant &amp;Isfahan; to Susan Moody 
and Lillian Kappes and their valiant associates who lie buried in &amp;Tihran; 
to Lua Getsinger, reposing forever in the capital of Egypt, and last 
but not least to Martha Root, interred in an island in the bosom of the 
Pacific, belong the matchless honor of having conferred, through their 
services and sacrifice, a lustre upon the American &amp;Baha'i community 
for which its representatives, while celebrating at their historic, their 
first All-American Convention, their hard-won victories, may well feel 
eternally grateful.  
     Gathered within the walls of its national Shrine--the most sacred 
Temple ever to be reared to the glory of &amp;Baha'u'llah; commemorating 
at once the centenary of the birth of the &amp;Babi Dispensation, of the 
 
+P401 
inauguration of the &amp;Baha'i era, of the inception of the &amp;Baha'i Cycle 
and of the birth of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of 
the establishment of the Faith in the Western Hemisphere; associated 
in its celebration with the representatives of American Republics, foregathered 
in the close vicinity of a city that may well pride itself on 
being the first &amp;Baha'i center established in the Western world, this 
community may indeed feel, on this solemn occasion, that it has, in its 
turn, through the triumphal conclusion of the first stage of the Plan 
traced for it by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, shed a lasting glory upon its sister communities 
in East and West, and written, in golden letters, the concluding 
pages in the annals of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  
 
+P402 
                           Retrospect and Prospect 
 
     Thus drew to a close the first century of the &amp;Baha'i era--an 
epoch which, in its sublimity and fecundity, is without parallel in the 
entire field of religious history, and indeed in the annals of mankind.  
A process, God-impelled, endowed with measureless potentialities, 
mysterious in its workings, awful in the retribution meted out to 
every one seeking to resist its operation, infinitely rich in its promise 
for the regeneration and redemption of human kind, had been set in 
motion in &amp;Shiraz, had gained momentum successively in &amp;Tihran, 
&amp;Baghdad, Adrianople and &amp;Akka, had projected itself across the seas, 
poured its generative influences into the West, and manifested the 
initial evidences of its marvelous, world-energizing force in the midst 
of the North American continent.  
     It had sprung from the heart of Asia, and pressing westward had 
gathered speed in its resistless course, until it had encircled the earth 
with a girdle of glory.  It had been generated by the son of a mercer 
in the province of &amp;Fars, had been reshaped by a nobleman of &amp;Nur, 
had been reinforced through the exertions of One Who had spent the 
fairest years of His youth and manhood in exile and imprisonment, 
and had achieved its most conspicuous triumphs in a country and 
amidst a people living half the circumference of the globe distant from 
the land of its origin.  It had repulsed every onslaught directed against 
it, torn down every barrier opposing its advance, abased every proud 
antagonist who had sought to sap its strength, and had exalted to 
heights of incredible courage the weakest and humblest among those 
who had arisen and become willing instruments of its revolutionizing 
power.  Heroic struggles and matchless victories, interwoven with 
appalling tragedies and condign punishments, have formed the pattern 
of its hundred year old history.  
     A handful of students, belonging to the &amp;Shaykhi school, sprung 
from the &amp;Ithna-'Ashariyyih sect of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam, had, in consequence 
of the operation of this process, been expanded and transformed into 
a world community, closely knit, clear of vision, alive, consecrated 
by the sacrifice of no less than twenty thousand martyrs; supranational; 
non-sectarian; non-political; claiming the status, and assuming 
the functions, of a world religion; spread over five continents and 
the islands of the seas; with ramifications extending over sixty sovereign 
 
+P403 
states and seventeen dependencies; equipped with a literature 
translated and broadcast in forty languages; exercising control over 
endowments representing several million dollars; recognized by a 
number of governments in both the East and the West; integral in 
aim and outlook; possessing no professional clergy; professing a 
single belief; following a single law; animated by a single purpose; 
organically united through an Administrative Order, divinely ordained 
and unique in its features; including within its orbit representatives 
of all the leading religions of the world, of various classes and 
races; faithful to its civil obligations; conscious of its civic 
responsibilities, as well as of the perils confronting the society of which it 
forms a part; sharing the sufferings of that society and confident of 
its own high destiny.  
     The nucleus of this community had been formed by the &amp;Bab, soon 
after the night of the Declaration of His Mission to &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn in 
&amp;Shiraz.  A clamor in which the &amp;Shah, his government, his people and 
the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy of his country unanimously joined 
had greeted its birth.  Captivity, swift and cruel, in the mountains 
of &amp;Adhirbayjan, had been the lot of its youthful Founder, almost immediately 
after His return from His pilgrimage to Mecca.  Amidst the 
solitude of &amp;Mah-Ku and &amp;Chihriq, He had instituted His Covenant, 
formulated His laws, and transmitted to posterity the overwhelming 
majority of His writings.  A conference of His disciples, headed by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, had, in the hamlet of &amp;Badasht, abrogated in dramatic 
circumstances the laws of the Islamic, and ushered in the new, Dispensation.  
In &amp;Tabriz He had, in the presence of the Heir to the Throne 
and the leading ecclesiastical dignitaries of &amp;Adhirbayjan, publicly and 
unreservedly voiced His claim to be none other than the promised, 
the long-awaited &amp;Qa'im.  Tempests of devastating violence in &amp;Mazindaran, 
&amp;Nayriz, &amp;Zanjan and &amp;Tihran had decimated the ranks of His 
followers and robbed Him of the noblest and most valuable of His 
supporters.  He Himself had to witness the virtual annihilation of 
His Faith and the loss of most of the Letters of the Living, and, after 
experiencing, in His own person, a series of bitter humiliations, He 
had been executed by a firing squad in the barrack-square of &amp;Tabriz.  
A blood bath of unusual ferocity had engulfed the greatest heroine 
of His Faith, had further denuded it of its adherents, had extinguished 
the life of His trusted amanuensis and repository of His last wishes, and 
swept &amp;Baha'u'llah into the depths of the foulest dungeon of &amp;Tihran.  
     In the pestilential atmosphere of the &amp;Siyah-Chal, nine years after 
that historic Declaration, the Message proclaimed by the &amp;Bab had 
 
+P404 
yielded its fruit, His promise had been redeemed, and the most glorious, 
the most momentous period of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i era had 
dawned.  A momentary eclipse of the newly risen Sun of Truth, the 
world's greatest Luminary, had ensued, as a result of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
precipitate banishment to &amp;Iraq by order of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah, of His 
sudden withdrawal to the mountains of &amp;Kurdistan, and of the degradation 
and confusion that afflicted the remnant of the persecuted 
community of His fellow-disciples in &amp;Baghdad.  A reversal in the 
fortunes of a fast declining community, following His return from 
His two-year retirement, had set in, bringing in its wake the recreation 
of that community, the reformation of its morals, the enhancement 
of its prestige, the enrichment of its doctrine, and culminating 
in the Declaration of His Mission in the garden of &amp;Najibiyyih to His 
immediate companions on the eve of His banishment to Constantinople.  
Another crisis--the severest a struggling Faith was destined 
to experience in the course of its history--precipitated by the rebellion 
of the &amp;Bab's nominee and the iniquities perpetrated by him and by 
the evil genius that had seduced him, had, in Adrianople, well nigh 
disrupted the newly consolidated forces of the Faith and all but 
destroyed in a baptism of fire the community of the Most Great Name 
which &amp;Baha'u'llah had called into being.  Cleansed of the pollution of 
this "Most Great Idol," undeterred by the convulsion that had seized 
it, an indestructible Faith had, in the strength of the Covenant instituted 
by the &amp;Bab, now surmounted the most formidable obstacles it 
was ever to meet; and in this very hour it reached its meridian glory 
through the proclamation of the Mission of &amp;Baha'u'llah to the kings, 
the rulers and ecclesiastical leaders of the world in both the East and 
the West.  Close on the heels of this unprecedented victory had followed 
the climax of His sufferings, a banishment to the penal colony 
of &amp;Akka, decreed by &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz.  This had been hailed by 
vigilant enemies as the signal for the final extermination of a much 
feared and hated adversary, and it had heaped upon that Faith in this 
fortress-town, designated by &amp;Baha'u'llah as His "Most Great Prison," 
calamities from both within and without, such as it had never before 
experienced.  The formulation of the laws and ordinances of a new-born 
Dispensation and the enunciation and reaffirmation of its fundamental 
principles--the warp and woof of a future Administrative 
Order--had, however, enabled a slowly maturing Revelation, in spite 
of this tide of tribulations, to advance a stage further and yield its 
fairest fruit.  
     The ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah had plunged into grief and bewilderment 
 
+P405 
His loyal supporters, quickened the hopes of the betrayers of 
His Cause, who had rebelled against His God-given authority, and 
rejoiced and encouraged His political as well as ecclesiastical adversaries.  
The Instrument He had forged, the Covenant He had 
Himself instituted, had canalized, after His passing, the forces released 
by Him in the course of a forty-year ministry, had preserved the unity 
of His Faith and provided the impulse required to propel it forward 
to achieve its destiny.  The proclamation of this new Covenant had 
been followed by yet another crisis, precipitated by one of His own 
sons on whom, according to the provisions of that Instrument, had 
been conferred a rank second to none except the Center of that 
Covenant Himself.  Impelled by the forces engendered by the revelation 
of that immortal and unique Document, an unbreachable Faith 
(having registered its initial victory over the Covenant-breakers), 
had, under the leadership of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, irradiated the West, illuminated 
the Western fringes of Europe, hoisted its banner in the 
heart of the North American continent, and set in motion the processes 
that were to culminate in the transfer of the mortal remains of its 
Herald to the Holy Land and their entombment in a mausoleum on 
Mt. Carmel, as well as in the erection of its first House of Worship in 
Russian &amp;Turkistan.  A major crisis, following swiftly upon the signal 
victories achieved in East and West, attributable to the monstrous 
intrigues of the Arch-breaker of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant and to the 
orders issued by the tyrannical &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, had exposed, during 
more than seven years, the Heart and Center of the Faith to imminent 
peril, filled with anxiety and anguish its followers and postponed the 
execution of the enterprises conceived for its spread and consolidation.  
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's historic journeys in Europe and America, soon after 
the fall of that tyrant and the collapse of his &amp;regime, had dealt a staggering 
blow to the Covenant-breakers, had consolidated the colossal 
enterprise He had undertaken in the opening years of His ministry, 
had raised the prestige of His Father's Faith to heights it had never 
before attained, had been instrumental in proclaiming its verities far 
and wide, and had paved the way for the diffusion of its light over 
the Far East and as far as the Antipodes.  Another major crisis--the 
last the Faith was to undergo at its world center--provoked by the 
cruel &amp;Jamal &amp;Pasha, and accentuated by the anxieties of a devastating 
world war, by the privations it entailed and the rupture of communications 
it brought about, had threatened with still graver peril the 
Head of the Faith Himself, as well as the holiest sanctuaries enshrining 
the remains of its twin Founders.  The revelation of the Tablets of the 
 
+P406 
Divine Plan, during the somber days of that tragic conflict, had, in 
the concluding years of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, invested the members 
of the leading &amp;Baha'i community in the West--the champions of 
a future Administrative Order--with a world mission which, in the 
concluding years of the first &amp;Baha'i century, was to shed deathless 
glory upon the Faith and its administrative institutions.  The conclusion 
of that long and distressing conflict had frustrated the hopes 
of that military despot and inflicted an ignominious defeat on him, 
had removed, once and for all, the danger that had overshadowed for 
sixty-five years the Founder of the Faith and the Center of His Covenant, 
fulfilled the prophecies recorded by Him in His writings, enhanced 
still further the prestige of His Faith and its Leader, and been 
signalized by the spread of His Message to the continent of Australia.  
     The sudden passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, marking the close of the 
Primitive Age of the Faith, had, as had been the case with the ascension 
of His Father, submerged in sorrow and consternation His faithful 
disciples, imparted fresh hopes to the dwindling followers of both 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya and &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, and stirred to feverish 
activity political as well as ecclesiastical adversaries, all of whom 
anticipated the impending dismemberment of the communities which 
the Center of the Covenant had so greatly inspired and ably led.  The 
promulgation of His Will and Testament, inaugurating the Formative 
Age of the &amp;Baha'i era, the Charter delineating the features of an 
Order which the &amp;Bab had announced, which &amp;Baha'u'llah had envisioned, 
and whose laws and principles He had enunciated, had 
galvanized these communities in Europe, Asia, Africa and America 
into concerted action, enabling them to erect and consolidate the 
framework of this Order, by establishing its local and national Assemblies, 
by framing the constitutions of these Assemblies, by securing 
the recognition on the part of the civil authorities in various countries 
of these institutions, by founding administrative headquarters, 
by raising the superstructure of the first House of Worship in the 
West, by establishing and extending the scope of the endowments of 
the Faith and by obtaining the full recognition by the civil authorities 
of the religious character of these endowments at its world center as 
well as in the North American continent.  
     A severe, a historic censure pronounced by a Muslim ecclesiastical 
court in Egypt had, whilst this mighty process--the laying of the 
structural basis of the &amp;Baha'i world Administrative Order--was being 
initiated, officially expelled all adherents of the Faith of Muslim extraction 
from &amp;Islam, had condemned them as heretics and brought 
 
+P407 
the members of a proscribed community face to face with tests and 
perils of a character they had never known before.  The unjust decision 
of a civil court in &amp;Baghdad, instigated by &amp;Shi'ah enemies, in &amp;Iraq, 
and the decree issued by a still more redoubtable adversary in Russia 
had, moreover, robbed the Faith, on the one hand, of one of its holiest 
centers of pilgrimage, and denied it, on the other, the use of its first 
House of Worship, initiated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and erected in the 
course of His ministry.  And finally, inspired by this unexpected 
declaration made by an age-long enemy--marking the first step in 
the march of their Faith towards total emancipation--and undaunted 
by this double blow struck at its institutions, the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
already united and fully equipped through the agencies of a 
firmly established Administrative Order, had arisen to crown the 
immortal records of the first &amp;Baha'i century by vindicating the independent 
character of their Faith, by enforcing the fundamental laws 
ordained in their Most Holy Book, by demanding and in some cases 
obtaining, the recognition by the ruling authorities of their right to be 
classified as followers of an independent religion, by securing from 
the world's highest Tribunal its condemnation of the injustice they 
had suffered at the hands of their persecutors, by establishing their 
residence in no less than thirty-four additional countries, as well as in 
thirteen dependencies, by disseminating their literature in twenty-nine 
additional languages, by enrolling a Queen in the ranks of the supporters 
of their Cause, and lastly by launching an enterprise which, 
as that century approached its end, enabled them to complete the 
exterior ornamentation of their second House of Worship, and to 
bring to a successful conclusion the first stage of the Plan which 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha had conceived for the world-wide and systematic 
propagation of their Faith.  
     Kings, emperors, princes, whether of the East or of the West, 
had, as we look back upon the tumultuous record of an entire century, 
either ignored the summons of its Founders, or derided their Message, 
or decreed their exile and banishment, or barbarously persecuted their 
followers, or sedulously striven to discredit their teachings.  They 
were visited by the wrath of the Almighty, many losing their thrones, 
some witnessing the extinction of their dynasties, a few being assassinated 
or covered with shame, others finding themselves powerless to 
avert the cataclysmic dissolution of their kingdoms, still others being 
degraded to positions of subservience in their own realms.  The 
Caliphate, its arch-enemy, had unsheathed the sword against its 
Author and thrice pronounced His banishment.  It was humbled to 
 
+P408 
dust, and, in its ignominious collapse, suffered the same fate as the 
Jewish hierarchy, the chief persecutor of Jesus Christ, had suffered at 
the hands of its Roman masters, in the first century of the Christian 
Era, almost two thousand years before.  Members of various sacerdotal 
orders, &amp;Shi'ah, &amp;Sunni, Zoroastrian and Christian, had fiercely assailed 
the Faith, branded as heretic its supporters, and labored unremittingly 
to disrupt its fabric and subvert its foundations.  The most redoubtable 
and hostile amongst these orders were either overthrown or virtually 
dismembered, others rapidly declined in prestige and influence, all 
were made to sustain the impact of a secular power, aggressive and 
determined to curtail their privileges and assert its own authority.  
Apostates, rebels, betrayers, heretics, had exerted their utmost endeavors, 
privily or openly, to sap the loyalty of the followers of 
that Faith, to split their ranks or assault their institutions.  These 
enemies were, one by one, some gradually, others with dramatic swiftness, 
confounded, dispersed, swept away and forgotten.  Not a few 
among its leading figures, its earliest disciples, its foremost champions, 
the companions and fellow-exiles of its Founders, trusted amanuenses 
and secretaries of its Author and of the Center of His Covenant, even 
some of those who were numbered among the kindred of the Manifestation 
Himself, not excluding the nominee of the &amp;Bab and the 
son of &amp;Baha'u'llah, named by Him in the Book of His Covenant, had 
allowed themselves to pass out from under its shadow, to bring shame 
upon it, through acts of indelible infamy, and to provoke crises of 
such dimensions as have never been experienced by any previous religion.  
All were precipitated, without exception, from the enviable 
positions they occupied, many of them lived to behold the frustration 
of their designs, others were plunged into degradation and misery, 
utterly impotent to impair the unity, or stay the march, of the Faith 
they had so shamelessly forsaken.  Ministers, ambassadors and other 
state dignitaries had plotted assiduously to pervert its purpose, had 
instigated the successive banishments of its Founders, and maliciously 
striven to undermine its foundations.  They had, through such plottings, 
unwittingly brought about their own downfall, forfeited the 
confidence of their sovereigns, drunk the cup of disgrace to its dregs, 
and irrevocably sealed their own doom.  Humanity itself, perverse 
and utterly heedless, had refused to lend a hearing ear to the insistent 
appeals and warnings sounded by the twin Founders of the 
Faith, and later voiced by the Center of the Covenant in His public 
discourses in the West.  It had plunged into two desolating wars of 
unprecedented magnitude, which have deranged its equilibrium, mown 
 
+P409 
down its youth, and shaken it to its roots.  The weak, the obscure, the 
down-trodden had, on the other hand, through their allegiance to so 
mighty a Cause and their response to its summons, been enabled to 
accomplish such feats of valor and heroism as to equal, and in some 
cases to dwarf, the exploits of those men and women of undying fame 
whose names and deeds adorn the spiritual annals of mankind.  
     Despite the blows leveled at its nascent strength, whether by the 
wielders of temporal and spiritual authority from without, or by 
black-hearted foes from within, the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah had, far from 
breaking or bending, gone from strength to strength, from victory 
to victory.  Indeed its history, if read aright, may be said to resolve 
itself into a series of pulsations, of alternating crises and triumphs, 
leading it ever nearer to its divinely appointed destiny.  The outburst 
of savage fanaticism that greeted the birth of the Revelation proclaimed 
by the &amp;Bab, His subsequent arrest and captivity, had been followed 
by the formulation of the laws of His Dispensation, by the 
institution of His Covenant, by the inauguration of that Dispensation 
in &amp;Badasht, and by the public assertion of His station in &amp;Tabriz.  
Widespread and still more violent uprisings in the provinces, His own 
execution, the blood bath which followed it and &amp;Baha'u'llah's imprisonment 
in the &amp;Siyah-Chal had been succeeded by the breaking of the 
dawn of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation in that dungeon.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's banishment 
to &amp;Iraq, His withdrawal to &amp;Kurdistan and the confusion and 
distress that afflicted His fellow-disciples in &amp;Baghdad had, in turn, 
been followed by the resurgence of the &amp;Babi community, culminating 
in the Declaration of His Mission in the &amp;Najibiyyih Garden.  &amp;Sultan 
&amp;Abdu'l-'Aziz's decree summoning Him to Constantinople and the 
crisis precipitated by &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya had been succeeded by the 
proclamation of that Mission to the crowned heads of the world and 
its ecclesiastical leaders.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's banishment to the penal colony 
of &amp;Akka, with all its attendant troubles and miseries, had, in its turn, 
led to the promulgation of the laws and ordinances of His Revelation 
and to the institution of His Covenant, the last act of His life.  The 
fiery tests engendered by the rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali and 
his associates had been succeeded by the introduction of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in the West and the transfer of the &amp;Bab's remains to the 
Holy Land.  The renewal of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's incarceration and the 
perils and anxieties consequent upon it had resulted in the downfall 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's release from His confinement, in 
the entombment of the &amp;Bab's remains on Mt. Carmel, and in the 
triumphal journeys undertaken by the Center of the Covenant Himself 
 
+P410 
in Europe and America.  The outbreak of a devastating world war 
and the deepening of the dangers to which &amp;Jamal &amp;Pasha and the 
Covenant-breakers had exposed Him had led to the revelation of the 
Tablets of the Divine Plan, to the flight of that overbearing Commander, 
to the liberation of the Holy Land, to the enhancement of 
the prestige of the Faith at its world center, and to a marked expansion 
of its activities in East and West.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing and the 
agitation which His removal had provoked had been followed by the 
promulgation of His Will and Testament, by the inauguration of the 
Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i era and by the laying of the foundations 
of a world-embracing Administrative Order.  And finally, the seizure 
of the keys of the Tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah by the Covenant-breakers, 
the forcible occupation of His House in &amp;Baghdad by the &amp;Shi'ah community, 
the outbreak of persecution in Russia and the expulsion of the 
&amp;Baha'i community from &amp;Islam in Egypt had been succeeded by the 
public assertion of the independent religious status of the Faith by its 
followers in East and West, by the recognition of that status at its 
world center, by the pronouncement of the Council of the League of 
Nations testifying to the justice of its claims, by a remarkable expansion 
of its international teaching activities and its literature, by the 
testimonials of royalty to its Divine origin, and by the completion of 
the exterior ornamentation of its first House of Worship in the 
western world.  
     The tribulations attending the progressive unfoldment of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah have indeed been such as to exceed in gravity 
those from which the religions of the past have suffered.  Unlike 
those religions, however, these tribulations have failed utterly to 
impair its unity, or to create, even temporarily, a breach in the ranks 
of its adherents.  It has not only survived these ordeals, but has 
emerged, purified and inviolate, endowed with greater capacity to face 
and surmount any crisis which its resistless march may engender in 
the future.  
     Mighty indeed have been the tasks accomplished and the victories 
achieved by this sorely-tried yet undefeatable Faith within the space 
of a century!  Its unfinished tasks, its future victories, as it stands on 
the threshold of the second &amp;Baha'i century, are greater still.  In the 
brief space of the first hundred years of its existence it has succeeded 
in diffusing its light over five continents, in erecting its outposts in 
the furthermost corners of the earth, in establishing, on an impregnable 
basis its Covenant with all mankind, in rearing the fabric of its 
world-encompassing Administrative Order, in casting off many of the 
 
+P411 
shackles hindering its total emancipation and world-wide recognition, 
in registering its initial victories over royal, political and ecclesiastical 
adversaries, and in launching the first of its systematic crusades for 
the spiritual conquest of the whole planet.  
     The institution, however, which is to constitute the last stage in 
the erection of the framework of its world Administrative Order, 
functioning in close proximity to its world spiritual center, is as yet 
unestablished.  The full emancipation of the Faith itself from the 
fetters of religious orthodoxy, the essential prerequisite of its universal 
recognition and of the emergence of its World Order, is still unachieved.  
The successive campaigns, designed to extend the beneficent 
influence of its System, according to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Plan, to every 
country and island where the structural basis of its Administrative 
Order has not been erected, still remain to be launched.  The banner 
of &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha which, as foretold by Him, must float from 
the pinnacles of the foremost seat of learning in the Islamic world is 
still unhoisted.  The Most Great House, ordained as a center of pilgrimage 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, is as yet unliberated.  
The third &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to be raised to His glory, the site of 
which has recently been acquired, as well as the Dependencies of the 
two Houses of Worship already erected in East and West, are as yet 
unbuilt.  The dome, the final unit which, as anticipated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
is to crown the Sepulcher of the &amp;Bab is as yet unreared.  The 
codification of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of the &amp;Baha'i 
Revelation, and the systematic promulgation of its laws and ordinances, 
are as yet unbegun.  The preliminary measures for the institution 
of &amp;Baha'i courts, invested with the legal right to apply and 
execute those laws and ordinances, still remain to be undertaken.  
The restitution of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world 
and the recreation of the community that so devotedly reared it, have 
yet to be accomplished.  The sovereign who, as foreshadowed in 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Most Holy Book, must adorn the throne of His native 
land, and cast the shadow of royal protection over His long-persecuted 
followers, is as yet undiscovered.  The contest that must ensue as a 
result of the concerted onslaughts which, as prophesied by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
are to be delivered by the leaders of religions as yet indifferent 
to the advance of the Faith, is as yet unfought.  The Golden Age of the 
Faith itself that must witness the unification of all the peoples and 
nations of the world, the establishment of the Most Great Peace, the 
inauguration of the Kingdom of the Father upon earth, the coming 
of age of the entire human race and the birth of a world civilization, 
 
+P412 
inspired and directed by the creative energies released by &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
World Order, shining in its meridian splendor, is still unborn and 
its glories unsuspected.  
     Whatever may befall this infant Faith of God in future decades 
or in succeeding centuries, whatever the sorrows, dangers and tribulations 
which the next stage in its world-wide development may engender, 
from whatever quarter the assaults to be launched by its 
present or future adversaries may be unleashed against it, however 
great the reverses and setbacks it may suffer, we, who have been 
privileged to apprehend, to the degree our finite minds can fathom, 
the significance of these marvelous phenomena associated with its rise 
and establishment, can harbor no doubt that what it has already 
achieved in the first hundred years of its life provides sufficient guarantee 
that it will continue to forge ahead, capturing loftier heights, 
tearing down every obstacle, opening up new horizons and winning 
still mightier victories until its glorious mission, stretching into the 
dim ranges of time that lie ahead, is totally fulfilled.
