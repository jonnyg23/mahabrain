     The sub-continent of India, favoured by special mention in 
the Qayyumu'l-Asma, on the Day of the Declaration of the Bab, 
is a land of the greatest spiritual potentialities.  During the life 
time of Abdu'l-Baha a steady stream of teachers from East and 
West arrived to establish the Faith, and at the time of His 
passing, there was a sizeable community of Baha'is in India.  
This was the community that grew into spiritual maturity, expanded 
and developed under the unerring guidance of our 
beloved Guardian who fostered its growth, ever beckoning it 
forward.  
     The Guardian summoned the believers to achieve great victories, 
local movements and limited projects would not be commensurate 
with the greatness of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah; he 
led them to self-sacrifice, to big undertakings, and to bold ventures.  
Gradually, he brought to light the vastness of the realm of 
service, pointing out the many races and tribes that inhabited 
this land of ancient civilization and cradle of important world 
religions.  He gave instructions and plans to this Community to 
take the healing Message of God to all these peoples and tribes.  
Step by step, Shoghi Effendi guided the Community on how to 
plan and organize a comprehensive teaching plan.  
     As far back as 1933, the beloved Guardian summoned the 
Baha'is of India to teach among the masses, and to reach persons 
of capacity in every strata of society.  He guided us in every 
accomplishment, pointing out the objectives, counselling and 
urging the completion of goals set for the Community.  
     The reader will find for himself what great victories still 
remain to be won and what great potentialities still remain 
hidden in India--"a vast country and an excellent field of service".  
This book is for those, anywhere in the world, who wish 
to arise individually and collectively to establish the World 
Order of Baha'u'llah and the Kingdom of God on earth.

+P1 
The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the 
Merciful throughout India and Burmah, 
Care of the members of the Spiritual Assembly.  
 
Beloved co-workers in the Vineyard of God!  
 
     It has been my great pleasure and privilege to send you, 
since my return to the Holy Land, first my general message of 
confidence and of love addressed to all believers throughout the 
East, and later another letter wherein I appeal in particular to 
those faithful lovers of His Cause in that vast and distant dominion 
to labour whole-heartedly and to the very end for the 
diffusion of His Light and the spread of His Cause.  Remembering, 
however, the few among my friends in that land who are 
as yet unfamiliar with the Persian Tongue, I have thought of 
sending these few lines to them in particular and through them 
to the rest of my brethren and sisters in those regions who, despite 
the diversity of tongue, of race and custom are all united 
at heart and animated by one common desire to uplift humanity 
and carry out His Divine Purpose for this world.  
     What an alluring field of service India with all its possibilities 
unfolds to our eyes at the present time and how vast are 
the opportunities of sowing the seeds of unity and loving kindness 
in the hearts of its divers peoples!  
     True, that land seems now unhappily to be plunged in the 
darkness of prejudice, hate and mistrust, yet however dark the 
immediate prospect may appear, our confidence remains unshaken 
that ere long these mists shall clear away, the dawn of a 
New Day shall break upon that land and the Rays of this Divine 
Revelation shall make of India a spiritually-quickened, peaceful 
and united country.  
 
 
+P2 
     The universal Teachings of Baha'u'llah if declared and propounded 
with wisdom and judgement, determination, selflessness 
and sincerity, and above all if exemplified in our lives and dealings 
with our fellow-men, cannot fail to inspire and stimulate 
the mind of the enlightened seeker and win the admiration and 
allegiance of all mankind.  Ours then is the duty and privilege to 
bring to the attention of this distressed and war-weary world 
this Message of Eternal Salvation and help to establish the Era 
of Peace and Brotherhood as purposed and foretold by 
Baha'u'llah.  
     The welcome news of the progress of the Third All-India 
Baha'i Convention as well as the favourable comment made 
upon it by the Press of that country have been fully shared with 
the pilgrims and resident friends in the Holy Land and we have 
all admired and rejoiced at the efforts you are exerting for the 
consolidation of the Movement in that ancient land.  
     May your endeavours in every sphere of your spiritual activities 
be crowned with brilliant success, that His glorious Promise 
regarding the future of that land may be speedily fulfilled!  
     It is my earnest hope that "The Baha'i News", the representative 
organ of the Baha'i Community in India, may expand 
and develop, may widen the sphere of its correspondence, add 
to the number and quality of its articles in Persian as well as in 
English, report regularly in its columns the news of the spiritual 
activities of all Baha'i centres in India and elsewhere, and in 
general provide for the full, correct and dignified presentation of 
the Cause to the general public.  
     Assuring every one of you of my constant prayers on your 
behalf and wishing you success in your noble task, 
                                  I am your brother and co-worker, 
                                                      SHOGHI

Excellent Field of Service 
 
     As you mentioned India is a vast country and an excellent 
field of service.  If the younger Baha'i generation, in whom 
Shoghi Effendi has great hopes, take the pain of studying the 
Cause deeply and thoroughly, read its history, find its underlying 
principles and become both well informed and energetic, 
they surely can achieve a great deal.  It is upon their shoulders 
that the Master has laid the tremendous work of teaching.  
They are the ones to raise the call of the Kingdom and arouse 
the people from slumber.  If they fail the Cause is doomed to 
stagnation.  May we all hope and earnestly pray that through 
God's infinite grace, through the Master's spiritual guidance and 
through Shoghi Effendi's tender care we may do justice to this 
tremendous work and not fail to do the Master's bidding.  
     As Shoghi Effendi has not yet taken up the tremendous work 
and responsibility of attending to the correspondence of the individual 
friends, he asked me to write you this note, acknowledge 
the receipt of your letter, and ask you to do the following 
things:  (1) Change the name of your Executive Committee to 
"The National Spiritual Assembly", because the corresponding 
Assembly in England and America bear the same name, and uniformity 
in such matters is most advisable.  (2) He likes to receive 
regular and detailed reports of the position of the Cause as well 
as the activities of the friends in India drafted as well as sent by 
the Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly.  So as to be 
informed of the conditions there and administer to your needs.  
(3) He wishes to have the postal as well as telegraphic address 
of the secretary so as to send his communications to him.  
     Shoghi Effendi earnestly hopes and prays that this National 
Spiritual Assembly will be able to achieve a great deal and herald 
a new era of spiritual awakening in that land.

Position of Baha'i Women 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Regarding the position of the Baha'i women in India and 
     Burma, and their future collaboration with the men in the 
     administrative work of the Cause, I feel that the time is 
 
 
+P4 
     now ripe that those women who have already conformed to 
     the prevailing custom in India and Burma by discarding the 
     veil should not only be given the right to vote for the election 
     of their local and national representatives, but should themselves 
     be eligible to the membership of all Baha'i Assemblies 
     throughout India and Burma, be they local or national. 
          This definite and most important step, however, should be 
     taken with the greatest care and caution, prudence and thoughtfulness.  
     Due regard must be paid to their actual capacity 
     and present attainments, and only those who are best 
     qualified for membership, be they men or women, and irrespective 
     of social standing, should be elected to the extremely 
     responsible position of a member of the Baha'i Assembly.  
          This momentous decision, I trust, will prove to be a great 
     incentive to the women Baha'is throughout India and Burma 
     who, I hope, will now bestir themselves and endeavour to the 
     best of their ability to acquire a better and more profound 
     knowledge of the Cause, to take a more active and systematic 
     part in the general affairs of the Movement, and prove themselves 
     in every way enlightened, responsible and efficient 
     co-workers to their fellow-men in their common task for the 
     advancement of the Cause throughout their country.  
          May they fully realise their high responsibilities in this day, 
     may they do all in their power to justify the high hopes we 
     cherish for their future, and may they prove themselves 
     in every respect worthy of the noble mission which the 
     Baha'i world is now entrusting to their charge.

The Baha'i News 

     [From the Guardian:]  
          Your long-awaited letter, penned by our dear and devoted 
     brother, Mr. N. R. Vakil, has been received and read with 
     profound interest.  I note with deep satisfaction the vigour 
     and earnestness with which you are conducting the affairs of 
     the Movement throughout the length and breadth of 
     that vast and distant land, and ardently pray that you may 
     achieve, individually and collectively, the highest success in 
     all your endeavours. 
 
 
+P5 
          Regarding the Baha'i News, I strongly urge those responsible 
     for its publication, and in particular, our beloved friends, 
     Prof. Pritam Singh, Mr. Vakil, ... Mr. M. U. Abasi, Mirza 
     Niku, Mr. Ardeshir Khodadad, and Haji Ahmad, to do their 
     utmost that this Baha'i organ may increase in volume, widen 
     in scope, broaden in its outlook, improve in style and general 
     presentation, and reflect more extensively the activities of the 
     friends in India, Burma, and elsewhere.  As a magazine that 
     has been established in the days of our departed Master, and 
     been the recipient of His special favours and blessings, it 
     ought, and I have no doubt it will, with your active support 
     and under your constant and general supervision, carry out 
     the great plan it is destined to fulfill in this world.  
          With regard to Burma and its Baha'i activities, I trust you 
     realise that that province falls directly within the sphere of 
     your activities, and although a Central Council for all Burma 
     is in the process of establishment, that Council as well as all 
     local Assemblies throughout Burma will have to be under 
     the protection, care and direction of the All-India Spiritual 
     Assembly.  
          I would indeed welcome regular, frequent and comprehensive 
     reports from the National Assembly on the various 
     branches of its manifold activities, and will spare no effort 
     to contribute my humble share in consolidating and extending 
     the Teaching Campaign throughout that vast Dominion.  
          I would be pleased to receive the permanent postal and telegraphic 
     address of the Secretary of the National Assembly, 
     and am confident that by the grace of Baha'u'llah and under 
     the guiding Hand of our beloved Master, we shall all carry 
     triumphantly the noble task entrusted to our charge to a 
     speedy and successful conclusion.

An Era of Unprecedented Activity 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to renew the bonds 
     of fellowship and affection that have always united our 
     hearts in the service of our beloved Master.  I need not recall 
     to your minds the warm and abiding place which that gifted 
 
 
 
+P6 
     Dominion has always occupied in our Beloved's heart, and 
     the high hopes he cherished for its future contribution 
     towards the triumph of the Movement in those distant 
     regions of the earth.  
          I am sure the hour has struck when those dearly-beloved 
     pioneers of the Master's Cause, scattered throughout the 
     length and breadth of that vast and promising land, should 
     unite, consolidate their forces, and effectively combine for the 
     laying of a firm foundation for the future progress of their noble 
     task.  It is my earnest hope and my most cherished desire 
     that at the forthcoming Convention the vigour and enlightened 
     efforts of the Baha'i youth of India, coupled with the generous 
     support and devotion of the old beloved Parsee friends, 
     and reinforced by the vast numbers of the ardent followers 
     of the Faith in Burma, may, by imparting power and brilliancy 
     to its proceedings, herald an era of unprecedented activity 
     for the ultimate recognition of the Cause by the peoples 
     of that country.  
          I shall welcome with genuine satisfaction every effort which 
     that talented and untiring servant of Baha'u'llah, our highly-esteemed 
     sister Mrs. Stannard, may exert in this connection, 
     and would feel truly gratified to learn of her determination 
     to play a conspicuous part in the presentation of the 
     Cause to the eyes of the enlightened public.  May the sustaining 
     grace of God, the power of Baha'u'llah, and the loving counsels 
     of our beloved &amp;Abdu'l-Baha guide you and aid you in 
     your mighty endeavours for the accomplishment of your 
     task.  
          I shall eagerly await any particulars you might wish to 
     send me regarding your various activities in the service of the 
     Cause, and I trust that during the interval between now and 
     Ridvan a complete and careful arrangement for the successful 
     conduct of the coming Convention will have been drawn 
     by all the friends and assemblies of India and Burma, and 
     to which, I assure you, I shall be most pleased to contribute 
     my humble share of cooperation and advice.  
          Hoping to hear from you, individually and collectively, 
     and assuring you of my constant prayers on your behalf.

Nothing Must Dampen Our Zeal 
 
     Nothing, I dare say, can be more encouraging and gladsome 
to Shoghi Effendi than the news of the activities of the friends 
in such a vast and promising field as India.  In the last few years 
the harvest of the friends' endeavours was not as rich and abundant 
as we all would wish and undoubtedly the political throes 
through which India has been passing and the general unrest 
which such conditions have brought about, account to a large 
measure for this comparative unfruitfulness in the self-sacrificing 
efforts of the Indian Baha'is.  Yet nothing must damp our zeal 
and we cannot for a moment doubt the remarkable change that 
the Master said would take place in that country.  
     We have been all very much interested in the first-hand information 
which Mrs. Stannard has given us and we lament the 
formidable difficulties and obstacles with which the Baha'is 
must cope in their effort to imbue the individual with a new 
spirit and to bring new measures of reform in the social order.  
We shall, however, pray for you all and eagerly await every 
good news you have to share with us.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I always eagerly await detailed and frequent reports from 
     the National Assembly and desire strongly its members to 
     meet as often as possible and actively, efficiently and constantly 
     direct, co-ordinate and reinforce the activities of the 
     individuals and Local Assemblies throughout India and 
     Burma.  I thirst for more specific information and urge its 
     secretary to ensure that every communication from the Holy 
     Land or from any other Baha'i centre is promptly and 
     widely distributed.  I assure you of my loving prayers.  
 
March 5, 1925 
 
 
Unite in Promoting the Work of the Cause 
 
     We were sorry to know of the state of tension that exists 
between India and Burma.  Let us hope that Shoghi Effendi's 
letter will draw both parties nearer together and so ease up the 
matter.  It is very sad to see two sections of such a continent 
 
 
 
+P8 
though closely connected together, unable to work in harmony.  
Let us pray and also try our best that all petty misunderstandings 
should be forgotten and that the work should start on a 
new basis firmer than before.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I do hope and pray that the Indians and Burmese friends 
     will once the new N.S.A. is elected support their representatives 
     and whole-heartedly unite in promoting the work of 
     the Cause.  An earnest, capable, energetic, loyal and experienced 
     soul must discharge the responsible and arduous 
     duties of a National Secretary.  So much depends upon him.  
     You will have my fullest and unqualified support in impressing 
     upon the friends the supreme necessity of establishing 
     forthwith and maintaining to the best of their ability the institution 
     of the National Fund.  I will pray for you all and 
     assure you personally of my great affection.  
 
April 1, 1925 
 
 
Consolidation of the Foundations of the N.S.A. 
 
     By now the election of the new National Spiritual Assembly 
and of its office-bearers will probably be completed.  The office of 
Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly is most important 
and the smooth and efficient working of the Baha'i organisation 
in India and Burmah will depend to a large extent on him.  Shoghi 
Effendi hopes that the new Secretary of the National Assembly 
will send him as soon as possible a full list of the members and 
office-bearers of the Assembly with his own postal address.  He 
would like him also, as soon as possible, to procure from each 
of the local assemblies in India and Burmah a full list of the 
members and office-bearers of the Local Spiritual Assembly with 
the address of the Secretary, and to transmit a copy of that list 
to Shoghi Effendi.  This is to be done every year immediately 
after the election of the National Spiritual Assembly.  
     Further it is desirable that each local Assembly should have 
a register of the names and addresses of all declared Baha'is in 
their district and should be careful to keep the register up-to-date, 
promptly noting any changes in the address or number of the 
 
 
 
+P9 
believers.  It is also desirable that the National Secretary should 
have a list of all believers in India and Burmah who are living in 
districts where there is no Local Spiritual Assembly, with full 
postal address in each case, so that these believers may be kept 
in touch with the body of believers by letters, literature etc., and 
travelling Baha'is visiting these districts may be put in touch 
with the believers there.  Shoghi Effendi would like to have a 
copy of this list also.  
     The National Secretary should keep in as close touch as 
possible with the Local Spiritual Assemblies, should urge the 
secretaries of these Local Assemblies to furnish regular reports 
of the progress of the movement in their respective localities, 
and should, by means of circular letters etc., keep these local 
assemblies and isolated believers informed of all matters of 
importance affecting the Cause, remind them of the importance 
of contributing as regularly and generously as possible to the 
National Fund, and so on.  
     It is obvious that to carry out these manifold duties efficiently, 
thoroughly and tactfully is no easy task and Shoghi Effendi 
greatly hopes that some one may be found who will be able to 
devote the necessary ability, time and energy to carry them out 
satisfactorily.  
     A Baha'i Year Book is now in course of preparation and 
Shoghi Effendi wishes to include in this Year-Book a complete 
list of the local Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world, 
with the address of the Secretary in each case, also a complete 
list of those localities where there are resident Baha'is but 
where no local Spiritual Assembly exists.  It will probably be 
impracticable to include the addresses of all isolated believers, 
but these should be known to the Secretary of the National 
Spiritual Assembly in each country, so that they may be available 
on application to him.  
     It will interest you to know that the Baha'is of Egypt have 
just elected their first National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Your past and present efforts are indeed worthy of the 
     deepest admiration and the highest praise.  Concentrate as 
 
 
 
+P10 
     much as you can at present on the consolidation of the 
     foundations of the N.S.A. of India and Burma.  This is the 
     first and most essential step to further expansion in any 
     direction.  The institution of the National Fund is of vital 
     importance and should be greatly stressed and emphasized 
     in every circular or communication addressed to the friends.  
     I will continue to pray for you from all my heart and assure 
     you of my support and brotherly love.  
 
May 12, 1925 
 
 
The House of Baha'u'llah in Baghdad 
 
     Yesterday he ordered me to write a few words and acknowledge 
the receipt of your letter, conveying to you his love and 
greeting.  He was much pleased to see that you have followed 
his telegraphic instructions concerning the Baghdad House 
promptly.  
     From other centres also telegraphic communications have 
been done to both the High Commissioner and to His Majesty 
King Faisal.  We are hoping for a desirable result.  Up to this 
time no definite information has reached us.  We shall keep you 
informed as soon as we receive any.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          The prompt and effective measures you have taken are 
     worthy of the highest praise.  I will inform you if further 
     action is deemed necessary.  I hope and pray your devoted 
     efforts will yield abundant fruit in the near future.  
 
November 18, 1925 
 
 
Inaugurate a Fresh Campaign of Teaching 
 
     Shoghi Effendi prays for all of you and hopes that through 
your practical devotion, you will all attract divine assistance more 
and more day by day and so this coming year the Cause of God 
will make unprecedented progress in that country.  He sends 
 
 
 
+P11 
you and all the members of the National Spiritual Assembly 
his affectionate greeting and expects your good news regularly.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I pray that your newly constituted National Spiritual Assembly 
     may grow from strength to strength, may co-ordinate 
     and consolidate the ever-expanding activities of the friends in 
     India and Burma and inaugurate a fresh campaign of Teaching 
     that will redound to the glory and power of the Most 
     Great Name.  
          May the projected Congress at Cawnpore attract widespread 
     interest and stimulate the work undertaken by the friends in 
     that promising country.  I assure you of my best wishes for 
     your success.  
 
November 24, 1925 
 
 
Increasing Activities 
 
     It is always a source of immeasurable joy and encouragement 
to our dear Guardian to learn of your increasing activities 
in serving our dear Cause and also of the growing measure of 
success which you are meeting with in all your endeavours.  The 
unity of the friends in India and Burma, the spread of the 
Cause in that vast country and especially among the real natives, 
intelligent connections with the universities and schools and the 
direction of the thoughts of the students to a proper understanding 
of the Cause and its great mission on earth, will not only 
be real accomplishment on the part of our dear fellow-workers 
but will relieve to a very large extent our dear Guardian of the 
stupendous task that he shoulders, and will give him the deepest 
joy and confidence.  We earnestly trust that through the help 
of our dear Master from on high all your efforts will be crowned 
with success.  
     Shoghi Effendi is always interested to hear from you on the 
work in India and to help you in every possible way. 
     You are, I am sure, in touch with Mr. Horace Holley in 
America and you would be interested to know that they are 
 
 
 
+P12 
publishing soon a Baha'i Year Book which will be of widespread 
interest not only to the Baha'is but also to many interested 
men and women in our dear Cause.  
     Mrs. Stannard is very successful in her work in Geneva and 
she has already started a fine center there.  She is able to make 
many connections with influential men and learned people and 
this is in itself a great work.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I am very pleased and gratified to learn of your persistent 
     efforts in advancing and consolidating the Cause.  The 
     establishment of a Central Office in Delhi is a great step 
     forward and I await very eagerly the first issue of the publication 
     of the National Spiritual Assembly of India [&amp;and] Burma.  
     The Burmese friends are very satisfied and pleased with the 
     consideration shown and the activity displayed by your 
     Assembly and my prayer is that the relations of the National 
     Body with the local Assemblies will grow firmer everyday.  
     I will specially remember the friends who are promoting the 
     Cause among the Qadiyani community whenever I visit the 
     Shrines.  I wish them the fullest success.  
 
March 27, 1926 
 
 
Bring Together the Hindus and Mohammedans 
 
     Shoghi Effendi received your letter dated June 11th and 
was very glad to see the result of the election of the National 
Spiritual Assembly.  He sincerely hopes that this year will 
witness a great change and progress for the Cause in India.  As 
the friends are sincere in their love and devotion, the members 
of the Assembly strong in their faith and unfailing in their 
services, there is full assurance of an ultimate victory and final 
settlement of the existing difficulties.  Shoghi Effendi has great 
hopes in you personally and trusts in your wise judgment, 
watchful attentiveness and absolute assurance in the Cause you 
serve.  He wants me to assure you of his prayers.  
     He also hopes that the friends in India will do their very 
best to bring together the Hindus and Mohammedans.  In such 
 
 
 
+P13 
cases the friends can show their good-will, devotion to humanity, 
and disinterestedness in the material result obtained.  He will pray 
that ... Prof. Pritam Singh will be guided in this 
undertaking and ably represent the spirit of the Cause as 
well as its teachings.  Being competent themselves and having 
the necessary divine blessing and guidance it is sure that they 
will achieve much.  May be this will be a good chance for attracting 
the attention of some of the prominent leaders to the 
reality of the Cause.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I have written in person to the Bombay Assembly and 
     urged them most emphatically to support morally and 
     financially the National Assembly and the National Fund.  
     ...We have to repeat and repeat over and over again until 
     the truth, the necessity and the urgency of our Beloved's 
     instructions sink in the hearts and minds of the believers.  I 
     am sure you will continue to remind the friends of their 
     primary obligations.  Assuring you again of my prayers for 
     your success in your high endeavours.  
 
July 10, 1926 
 
 
Cause Will Ultimately Conquer 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha used often to say that the difference between a 
prophet and an ordinary person is that the latter looks only to 
the present.  He does not try to imagine the future victories and 
thereby forget the present trivial obstructions.  The prophet, 
however, having a deep insight in the future condition of things 
sees his ultimate victory and does not get disheartened even 
though he sees a whole-sale massacre of his followers.  
     As Baha'is we should follow the prophet's method.  We know 
that the Cause will ultimately conquer and its ranks be fully 
united.  We know that the Master's promises will ultimately be 
realized, therefore why be discouraged by trivial oppositions we 
see on our way.  We should rather add to our zeal and persist 
in our prayers and endeavours...  It always takes time for a people 
to change from one administration to another.  Up to the 
present they have been accustomed to think of the local assemblies 
 
 
 
+P14 
as next only to the Center of the Cause, and it will take 
some time and training before they can admit another superior.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I have cabled to Bombay and will soon confirm it by letter.  
     I have urged them to support consistently and whole-heartedly 
     the very essential and vital institutions of the National Fund 
     and the National Assembly.  It must be made clear to them 
     all that continuous support to these twin institutions is the 
     corner-stone of all future achievements, the mainspring from 
     which all future blessings will flow.  Persevere in your heroic 
     effort and remember that the end is glorious and bright.  
 
September 7, 1926 
 
 
     I take pleasure in thanking you on behalf of our dear Guardian, 
Shoghi Effendi, for your letter...  
     As it announced the election of a new body to take up the 
responsible but lofty work of supervising and guiding the promulgation 
of the Baha'i Cause throughout India and Burma, 
Shoghi Effendi wishes me to take this opportunity and assure 
each and every member of that distinguished body not only of 
his heartfelt congratulations and prayers but also of the high 
hopes that he cherishes for you all.  It is from you and through 
you that he expects to see emanating that glorious spirit for 
which our departed Master gave his entire life; and with your 
earnest endeavours, your consummate wisdom and your unflinching 
faith he awaits to see you lead the humble workers of that 
great country to an ultimate victory.  
     May I also take this opportunity and express the great desire 
of Shoghi Effendi that the National Assembly should try to 
be in close communication with him.  To him it is a joy beyond 
words to try to do all in his power to help you in the noble work 
you have undertaken.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Now that the N.S.A. has been properly constituted and its 
     officers duly appointed, it is incumbent upon each and all to 
     introduce and promote such measures as will consolidate the 
     work that you have so well begun.  The institution of the 
 
 
 
+P15 
     National Fund, a Baha'i Bulletin similar to the News Letter 
     issued by the American N.S.A., a rigorous and well-conceived 
     campaign of Teaching, a continuous and purposeful 
     endeavour to coordinate the activities of the local Assemblies 
     and groups throughout India and Burma and the sending of 
     detailed and frequent reports to the Holy Land are among 
     the most primary and urgent requirements of the new day 
     that has dawned upon India.  I eagerly await your reports and 
     assure you of my continued prayers for the success of your 
     arduous labours.  
 
October 28, 1926 
 
 
Publication of Kaukab 
 
     The news that the difficulties, which for a time prevailed and 
threatened grave disturbances between the N.S.A. and the Local 
Assemblies, have vanished, was a source of great satisfaction 
and gratification to him.  We were quite sure that it was all due 
to misunderstandings and that they would be easily overcome...  
     In a letter which I have lately written to Seyed Jenabe Ali 
on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, I intimated his desire that a special 
committee of the N.S.A. should be created to undertake the 
management of everything pertaining to the Kaukab.  Furthermore, 
if a certain sum is offered to the National Fund with the 
expressed desire that it should be spent for the Kaukab, i.e., if 
the offer is labelled, then the N.S.A. should take into consideration 
the wish of the giver and spend it only for that purpose.  
Though the friends are advised to give unlabelled contributions 
they cannot in any way be prevented from using their choice in 
the way it should be spent.  
     Though the Local Assemblies should give the N.S.A. all the 
moral and financial support the latter needs, it is the duty of the 
N.S.A. to inspire the necessary confidence in keeping the management 
of its work as efficiently as possible.  
     In a cable recently sent to the N.S.A. Shoghi Effendi recommended 
the publication of the Kaukab.  He desires this paper 
 
 
 
+P16 
to play an important role in drawing the attention of the more 
thoughtful and seeking people to the potency of this divine 
Cause.  I herein enclose a cheque for L19 which Shoghi Effendi 
desires to be spent for this all important organ of the Cause in 
India.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I am enclosing a general message, clearly worded, emphatically 
     expressed, and vitally important in all its bearings, conveyed 
     through Mirza Mahmood to the National Assembly 
     for the information of all Baha'is in India and Burma.  I am 
     sure you will promptly and effectively take all necessary 
     measures for its dissemination throughout India and Burma.  
     The `Kaukab' must, at all costs be continued, and I feel that 
     its two editors ... are the most suitable to form a committee 
     which will conduct its affairs under the direct supervision of 
     the National Assembly.  Whatever is contributed to the 
     National Assembly for a specific purpose should be expended 
     for that purpose only, but I would encourage the friends to 
     send unlabelled contributions in order not to tie the hands of 
     the National Assembly although I do not in the least require 
     them to do so.  I will pray for your success from all my 
     heart.  
 
November 16, 1926 
 
 
The Baha'i News 
 
     It is most gratifying to him to hear that the difficulties that 
darkened the horizon of the Cause in India have vanished and 
the National as well as Local Assemblies are united to further 
the interests of the Cause.  He hopes that Kaukab will become 
a Baha'i organ administered even better than before.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that Aqa Mirza Moneer will cause 
another stir in India and draw many individuals into a full understanding 
of the movement.  His zeal as well as knowledge 
of the Cause stand to his credit and are sure to win him success 
wherever he goes.  Please convey to him Shoghi Effendi's loving 
greetings and assure him of his prayers.  
 
 
 
+P17 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I hope to hear soon of the re-establishment and circulation 
     of the Kaukab.  The matter of the publication of a Baha'i 
     News Letter issued by the National Assembly is also of utmost 
     importance.  May the support to the National Fund be 
     such as to render it a truly worthy and representative Baha'i 
     periodical.  Persevere in your splendid efforts and do not 
     lose heart for I will continue to pray for you from the depth 
     of my heart.

Widen the Scope of Activities 
 
     With the opening of this new Baha'i year our Guardian 
trusts that it will be marked by a new and greater effort, by 
a more intense cooperation among the friends in India and 
Burma and by an unsurpassed record of success.  
     Now that Mrs. Schopflocker has in many places broken the 
ground, it devolves upon the faithful workers in India 
to follow up the work, to seize every opportunity and to 
give to her hasty and in many places insufficient services a more 
permanent and lasting character.  
     I express the hopes of our Guardian without disregard 
to your many problems and difficulties, but the field is so 
vast and the ground so fresh and fertile that it cannot but 
evoke almost unreasonable expectations.  This feeling and 
yearning, I am sure, is much more yours than ours could be.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I urge you to take every means at your disposal 
     ... to follow up the work that 
     has been so splendidly begun by Mrs. Schopflocker.  
     I would also urge you to arrange for the preparation of an 
     annual report by the National Assembly of the activities 
     of the friends in India and Burma, to be forwarded to the 
     American National Spiritual Assembly for insertion in the 
     next issue of the Annual Baha'i Year Book.  A representative 
     group photograph of the Baha'is of divers races and creeds 
 
 
 
+P18 
     in that land would also greatly enhance the Year Book, if 
     such a thing is possible.  
 
April 25, 1927 
 
 
     He is very glad to learn of the good work of Nabilzadeh 
and Mrs. Schopflocker and hopes that the friends will 
follow up their work in order to obtain some definite and 
permanent results.  For a teacher to fly from one end of India 
to another is not sufficient, there must be somebody who can 
stay long enough in one place and start regular gatherings.  
     The latter function naturally falls upon the friends in India 
and he earnestly hopes that the new year may bring fresh and 
lasting achievements.  
     Shoghi Effendi awaits eagerly the results of the election of 
the N.S.A. and he should like to see that body accomplish 
something more than routine work.  They should take new 
steps and carry out a regular campaign in India and Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          It is my hope and prayer that the newly-elected National 
     and Local Assemblies may widen the scope of their activities, 
     initiate new and valuable measures, extend the circle of their 
     correspondence with foreign Baha'i centres, and promote 
     the independence and distinctiveness of the Baha'i Faith.  I 
     would urge you to inform the Year Book Committee 
     through Mr. Holley of the results of all elections in India 
     and to send if possible an annual report to that Committee.  
     Wishing you success and happiness. 
 
May 24, 1927 
 
 
     In the midst of his work and many responsibilities, it is 
a source of comfort for him to feel that the initiative and 
guidance of the Cause in India is in such able hands and he 
trusts to see in the near future greater and fuller results.  
     True, the minds of many are turned away from all that 
sounds religious, but it is only because they are ill-advised as 
 
 
 
+P19 
to the meaning of true religion and it is just that mission that 
devolves upon us--to give a new viewpoint, to revive fresh 
hopes and to guide by the sacred utterances the thoughts and 
actions of mankind.  
     Perhaps India has not yet reached the high mark which our 
hopes have made us expect, but the time still remains and the 
hopes of our Guardian are anxiously turned to the educated, 
sincere and zealous fellow-brothers he so much loves in India 
and Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I have received lately your second letter dated June 10th 
     enclosing the list of the members of the newly-elected Indian 
     Assemblies as well as the report of the receipts and expenditures 
     of the National Fund.  Your loyal and untiring attention 
     to the pressing manifold requirements of our beloved 
     and steadily expanding Cause is a thing never-to-be 
     forgotten and worthy of unqualified praise.  I trust you 
     will continue to keep in touch with the American National 
     Assembly whose Secretary is only too anxious to incorporate 
     in the newsletter and the Year Book every bit of news 
     regarding the progress of the Faith in India [&amp;and] Burma.  
 
July 14, 1927 
 
 
Conduct of the Work of N.S.A. 
 
     He is very glad indeed to hear of the interview of Mr. 
Nabilzadeh with the Governor of Burma.  He will pray that 
the seeds he has sown will germinate in the course of time and 
will prove of great benefit to our beloved Cause.  
     Our Guardian hopes that henceforth the secretaries of all 
local and national Assemblies will immediately upon their 
election inform the American National Assembly of their 
membership and the address, that the results may without 
delay be published in the Baha'i Year Book.  
     Our Guardian will not cease to pray for you all that the 
Beloved may guide you to achieve that which will conduce 
 
 
 
+P20 
to the consolidation and extension of the influence of the Cause.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I trust the newly-elected Assembly will endeavour to follow 
     the example of the American National Assembly in method, 
     action, and procedure.  The American Newsletter will indicate 
     clearly the lines along which Baha'i National Assemblies 
     are to conduct their work in future and I earnestly 
     urge you to encourage the friends to follow and adopt the 
     method outlined in its columns.  
 
August 19, 1927 
 
 
Extend the Scope of Activities 
 
     For a country like India and also Burma where the Baha'i 
communities are so much scattered and are of varied extraction 
a common centre to coordinate the different efforts and to link 
up together both the Assemblies within India and in the various 
parts of the world, is also ... necessary, and our Guardian 
hopes and trusts to see in time great results from this new 
measure.  Of course much depends upon how well this organ 
functions.  
     Shoghi Effendi is in good health having taken a good rest 
during the summer.  He awaits as much as ever the good news 
of the friends in India and above all news of real accomplishment.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I hope that nothing has transpired of late that might 
     have in any manner affected the expansion of the work in 
     those regions.  I fully realize your single-handedness in 
     such a vast and varied field, but I assure you, dearest friend, 
     that your reward is proportionately great, for He that 
     watches over you is aware of the great devotion which 
     animates you in the pursuit of your arduous and noble 
     task.  
 
November 1, 1927 
 

     Your frequent communications keeping him in close touch 
with your activities and the work in India, are deeply appreciated, 
 
 
 
+P21 
and he relies much upon your efforts to coordinate the work 
in India and to have more direct and material results than we 
have been accustomed to lately.  When compared to some 
other countries and remembering the many years since the 
Cause was first known there, India, I am afraid, does not come 
up to expectations.  Are we going to accept this secondary 
position or has the future a surprise in store?  At any rate we 
patiently wait.  
 
November 16, 1927 
 
 
     He was greatly pleased with the news of the work of Prof. 
Pritam Singh in Karachi and Lahore and he read his well-worded 
lectures with interest.  It gives him immense pleasure to keep 
in touch with his activities and he prays for the success of his 
efforts from the bottom of his heart.  He is confident that when 
his plans are carried out and he does travel throughout the 
whole of India in the interests of the Cause, he will show a 
record of constant progress and would have rendered valuable 
services to the Baha'i Faith.  Please assure him of our Guardian's 
unfailing prayers and good wishes and also kindly convey to 
the Amritsar Baha'is the loving greetings of Shoghi Effendi...  
     I am sure it will interest you to know that we have had during 
the Ridwan festivals the first Baha'i pilgrim from Tunis.  
The representative of the Tunis Assembly is a young man full of 
hopes and schemes for the future.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I will specially supplicate, on behalf of my dear brethren 
     in India [&amp;and] Burma, at the Beloved's Shrine, that they may 
     arise with heart and soul and in perfect harmony and understanding 
     to extend the scope of their activities, to consolidate 
     the foundations of their work, to deepen their knowledge 
     and understanding of the fundamentals of the Faith, and to 
     carry out the Beloved's explicit instructions for the establishment 
     of Baha'u'llah's undisputed sovereignty on this earth.  
     May they be richly blessed and guided in their endeavours. 
 
May 6, 1928 
 
 
 
+P22 
     Among the subjects that the Guardian would expect your 
body to take are a coordination of the various efforts and 
endeavours throughout India and Burma, an acceleration and 
increase in the number of Baha'is and fellow-workers, ways and 
means to attract the attention of Indians from every class and 
creed to the message and vital dynamic spirit of the Baha'i 
Faith and as a cumulative and culminating step the final 
recognition of the Baha'i Community as a separate religious 
organization similar to what has been already achieved in 
America.  
 
June 22, 1928 
 
 
     The news that we obtain from the various parts of the world 
are most gratifying, for though there are some great problems 
to solve, yet no one can fail to see the constant realization of 
those ideals we cherish.  May that day soon dawn when the 
source of this spiritual power, which is permeating the whole of 
society, will be appreciated and venerated.  
 
August 21, 1928 
 

Present the Teachings at Various Conventions 
[&amp;and] Gatherings 
 
     This is to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ... reporting 
the events of the Brahmo Samaj Centenary gathering to 
Shoghi Effendi.  Such meetings are wonderful occasions for 
showing the spirit and teachings of the Cause....  Shoghi 
Effendi's hope is that at such Conventions and gatherings the 
friends would present the teachings to persons otherwise inaccessible 
for individual contact.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I heartily approve the project of a Baha'i Convention and 
     would leave the choice of the site and other arrangements to 
     the National Assembly.  The Cause in various countries is 
     making a great headway and the reference of the case of the 
 
 
 
+P23 
     Baghdad House to the Mandates Commission of the League 
     of Nations is a great step forward.  
 
October 10, 1928 
 
 
The Faith Publicized in Turkey 
 
     He was glad to hear from you and he has read with deep 
satisfaction the account of the good work of Syed Ilmi in Burma.  
Shoghi Effendi has always wondered as to the reasons why 
despite so many years of effort and activity, the Cause has 
not spread more rapidly either in India or Burma, perhaps the 
latter can be more proud of its results.  He would in fact 
appreciate your own personal opinion, although God's ways are 
often hard to understand.  We have lately had a remarkable 
illustration in Turkey where the Baha'is were an insignificant 
little group.  Suddenly accused of constituting a secret political 
society the members of the N.S.A. in Constantinople and the 
S.A. in Smyrna were dragged to the police and kept for one 
night pending the formation of the Board of Inquiry.  The next 
day the court sat and the president of the N.S.A. was cross-examined 
for eight consecutive hours.  The result was that they 
were all dismissed, with the members of the Court deeply influenced 
and impressed by the teachings and principles which 
the President boldly and eloquently described.  They asked 
for literature and many of them carried from that session much 
food for thought.  Furthermore every paper in Turkey filled its 
front pages with the incident and a repetition of the teachings 
and good many a Turk heard of the Cause in a way that Baha'is 
could never bring about.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I trust and pray that circumstances will be favourable and 
     the means provided for the holding of a Baha'i convention 
     this year representative of India and Burma.  A closer touch 
     and more frequent interchange of thought among the Baha'i 
     Centres in those lands are absolutely essential.  I am sending 
     you a copy of the recently issued "Baha'i World", and 
     wish you to urge the National and Local Assemblies in India 
     [&amp;and] Burma to order as many copies as they possibly can from 
 
 
 
+P24 
     America for distribution among the enlightened public as 
     well as a means for the assistance and encouragement of the 
     Baha'i Publishing Committee in New York which is doing 
     excellent service at the present time.  
 
November 15, 1928 
 
 
Assemblies Must Endeavour to Inspire 
Confidence 
 
     Although I had never meant that my enquiry from you as 
to the reasons of lack of progress of the Cause in India, should 
be asked from every individual Baha'i, yet I am sure, our Guardian 
will be interested to know the ideas and opinions of various 
sections of the friends both in India and Burma.  
     The expression of our views in written form sometimes helps 
us to think better and deeper and often brings various matters 
into proper perspective, enabling us thereby to disregard what 
is extraneous and unimportant.  The answers to the question 
put forth, would, I feel, be extremely valuable to the N.S.A. in 
India, and with the proper backing, respect and support of the 
entire friends, they should not lose a minute in an endeavour to 
remedy and inspire what ought not and what should be done, 
in an effort to spread the Cause. 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I trust that the forthcoming Convention will remedy most 
     if not all the present deficiencies in the Cause and lend an 
     unprecedented impetus to the progress of the Faith.  The 
     Teaching work should be stressed as it is the Fountain-head 
     from which all future blessings will flow.  We must first and 
     foremost add to our small numbers, and introduce fresh 
     blood into the organic life of the community.  I will specially 
     supplicate this bounty for the representative delegates to be 
     assembled at Convention this year.  
 
December 19, 1928 
 
 
Maintain and Strengthen the Unity of the 
National Assembly 
 
     He was very glad to hear of the success of the Convention.  
He hopes that such gatherings will become yearly and, like in 
 
 
 
+P25 
other countries, lead to a better understanding among the friends.  
It is surely true that as the Cause progresses differences will 
more and more arise.  So unless there be a meeting place where 
the different views are thrashed, true unity of purpose and 
activity will not be obtained.  
     Just as much as the result of the Convention made him 
happy he was sorry to hear of the differences that exist between 
the N.S.A. members.  The real source of the difficulty is, I 
believe, the lack of constant intercourse between the different 
members.  As the country is so very vast meetings cannot be 
very frequent and well attended, and this ultimately leads to 
misunderstandings and lack of faith in each other.  Shoghi 
Effendi knows the different individuals involved, he knows their 
integrity and faith in the Cause and its spirit.  He is sure that 
they, each and all, have no other purpose but to serve the 
progress of the movement and uphold its interests.  And they 
will surely not commit an act that would retard the very Cause 
they are serving.  What the solution is, I do not know.  What 
Shoghi Effendi has been hoping during the last two or three 
years is a spirit of mutual trust that would overcome physical 
handicaps.  But that seems to be impossible.  A lurking dissatisfaction 
is sure to appear at the end.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Your subsequent letter dated Jan. 24 has also reached me.  
     I will specially remember our dear and valued co-worker 
     Prof. Pritam Singh when I visit the sacred Shrine that the 
     spirit of Baha'u'llah may inspire, guide and sustain him in 
     his great task.  Regarding your last convention and the non-participation 
     of the Burma delegates, I feel that the utmost 
     effort must be exerted during the coming elections in April 
     to elect those who are best fitted for this supreme and responsible 
     position, and once elected, resignation is not to be 
     accepted.  The members must meet and consult in person.  
     Persia is preparing for the holding of national elections, and 
     for India and Burma to revert to a system that is being abandoned 
     by the Persian believers would be a decidedly retrograde 
     step.  We must at all costs maintain and strengthen 
     the unity of the National Assembly.  Everything must be 
 
 
 
+P26 
     subordinated to this end.  I will supplicate our Beloved to 
     enable you to achieve His purpose.  
 
February 12, 1929 
 
 
     It is his sincere hope and desire to see the newly-elected 
National Assembly during its term of office, infuse a new and 
fresh spirit into every Baha'i activity both in India and Burma, 
and while establishing perfect unity and harmony within its own 
ranks and the entire body of the believers, should take vigorous 
steps to teach the Cause and to establish a progressive and representative 
Baha'i community in both countries.  
 
June 20, 1929 
 
 
     With regard to your proposal that the N.S.A. should meet 
once in Burma and once in India, the Guardian wishes me to 
record his hearty approval and to even suggest that if it should 
be feasible they should meet even more often than that in both 
places.  
     It is his sincere hope that in this manner and through the 
individual effort of every member the misunderstandings existing 
between India and Burma will be wiped out altogether and that 
a fresh start will be made in a spirit of true and whole-hearted 
accord.  
 
July 8, 1929 
 
 
     He hopes that the new National Assembly will do its utmost 
to bring about unity in its group and among the friends.  For, 
as he has often stated, the work of the Cause will remain 
cramped unless that unity is obtained.  The petty differences 
that do exist are the result of misunderstandings and these can 
surely be eliminated.

"Baha'i World"--Foremost Baha'i Publication 
 
     I write on behalf of the Guardian to remind you that the 
next issue of the `Baha'i World' will soon appear and its editors 
are already busy compiling material.  
     He has been asked by the editors in America to request you 
please to make a special effort to contribute as much material 
as you possibly can in the form of photographs, reports, accounts, 
and individual articles; and to send them as soon as 
possible to America in order that a work which the Guardian 
considers our foremost Baha'i publication in the world, may be 
as representative of the many countries and especially Eastern 
peoples as we would all wish it to be.

"Huquq" 
 
     ...As regards "Huquq", it is really 19 per cent of 
one's income payable to the Guardian.  But it is not obligatory 
now.  
 
December 19, 1929 
 
 
Syed Jenab Ali--Distinguished Baha'i Leader 
 
     He was very sorry to learn of the illness of Syed Jenab Ali 
and since the receipt of your letter, he has been extremely 
grieved to learn of his passing.  His sudden departure throws a 
shadow of gloom upon all of us here and in India and while 
Burma loses a distinguished and truly earnest Baha'i leader, it 
must be especially unfortunate to you that just at a time when 
you were considering and preparing the ground for Government 
Recognition and a temporary consideration of Baha'i laws, 
you were deprived of his valued cooperation.  The Cause in 
India is as yet in such a tender age that we can ill afford the 
loss of those few that keep the torch aflame.  
 
 
 
+P28 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          The news of the passing of our dear and able friend and 
     collaborator Syed Jenab Ali has brought profound sorrow to 
     our hearts.  He leaves a great gap behind him.  I hope that 
     the friends far from feeling disheartened and discouraged at 
     such a great loss will arise and redouble their efforts in order 
     to compensate for the loss which they have sustained.  Kindly 
     assure his relatives of my deep grief, and my prayers for his 
     departed soul.

Martha Root Visits India 
 
     ...Miss Root is at present in Tehran and she does not 
know just how long she will stay, but surely before leaving for 
India she would inform you of her plans in time.  
     It is such a pity that Mr. Vakil is unwell.  He is a man we 
cannot spare just as the passing of Syed Jenab Ali leaves a serious 
gap in Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Miss Root will soon be with you, and I trust her visit may 
     lend a fresh impetus to your work of consolidation and 
     spread of the Cause.  I will continue to pray for your efforts 
     and activities from the depths of my heart.  Be not disheartened.  
     Persevere in your labours and rest assured that 
     the Beloved will richly reward those who stand firm in the 
     Faith, and those who persevere in their endeavours.  
 
March 1, 1930 
 
 
     Miss Root has been delayed by the enthusiastic reception she 
has received in Persia and she is now planning to visit southern 
and eastern Persia where she has not yet been.  We hope her 
visit to India will prove of some value in attracting the attention 
of the intelligent classes among the non-Baha'is, but perhaps the 
 
 
 
+P29 
political agitation will entirely defeat that purpose at the present 
time.  
 
April 26, 1930 
 
 
     He was very glad to hear of the activities of Miss Martha 
Root in India and hopes that they will all bear some wonderful 
fruits for the progress of the Cause in India.  It is sure that 
with the existence of the present political unrest in that country 
few are ready to pay any attention to religious matters, but 
among the very intelligent people there are undoubtedly people 
whose vision extends further than the present difficulties and 
desire a spiritual rebirth for that much divided and troubled nation.  
To these the Baha'i teachings should undoubtedly present a 
much desired reform movement.  Anyhow Shoghi Effendi hopes 
that with the help of Miss Root you have been able to approach 
such eminent persons and have sown in their heart the seed of 
faith.  
 
July 4, 1930 
 
 
     Concerning the trip of Miss Martha Root, we have already 
heard about her activities from many sources.  Shoghi Effendi 
sincerely hopes that the National Assembly will undertake such 
measures as would keep up the work and produce some tangible 
result from her visit.  It is very important to follow up the 
work that she started and keep in touch with the people she has 
been able to interest.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          With the assurance of my deep appreciation of your many 
     and highly successful endeavours in connection with the visit 
     of Miss Root and of my fervent and loving prayers for your 
     own happiness and spiritual advancement.

Baha'i Representation at the All-Asian 
Women's Conference 
 
     Concerning Baha'i representation at the All-Asian Women's 
Conference; this is undoubtedly a most commendable thing to 
do especially as the Cause has so much concerning the position 
of women in society.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that the National 
Assembly will do its best to win the admiration of all the 
assembled delegates for the teachings of the Cause along that 
line.  We should always take such opportunities that present 
themselves.  May be we would succeed to render some service 
to society and alleviate its ills.  
 
November 10, 1930 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that with the combined efforts of the 
friends and the Master's infinite mercy a great success will be 
achieved at both of the conferences.  While visiting the Blessed 
Shrines he will remember the delegates and ask for them divine 
guidance.  If presented properly the position of women in the 
Baha'i teachings will surely attract much attention, for it is not 
only legal but also spiritual and educational.  Our ideals are 
so high and at the same time so practicable that all other views 
will fall short if compared to them.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that many will be able to attend these 
conferences and render all the assistance they possibly can.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I trust that the message sent on behalf of the Greatest Holy 
     Leaf and myself has reached in time and been conveyed to 
     the members of the conference.  May the Almighty Hand of 
     Baha'u'llah guide your steps and sustain your efforts in the 
     manifold services you are rendering to the Cause.  I will 
     continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.

Publication of the "Dawn-Breakers" 
 
     The Guardian has also received the account of the National 
Fund of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India 
[&amp;and] Burma and he read it with careful attention and deep 
interest.  
     He was very pleased to learn with what self-sacrificing 
efforts our Indian brothers are toiling and he fervently prays 
that the Almighty may continually shower His blessings upon 
them that they may be able to spread the Cause in the most 
rapid and in the most efficient way.  
     Shoghi Effendi was particularly rejoiced at the perseverance 
with which our talented Baha'i brother, Dr. Pritam Singh, is 
carrying on his work in connection with the publication of the 
"Baha'i Weekly", copies of which he has received and read with 
deepest interest.  
     You may have heard of the projected publication by the 
Baha'i Publishing Committee of the book entitled "The Dawn-Breakers" 
being Nabil's narrative of the early days of the 
Baha'i revelation, recently translated by the Guardian.  It is 
hoped that the Indian friends will order a few copies of this 
highly valuable book and that they will send a few others to 
some of the leading libraries in India and Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          My prayers will continue to be offered on behalf of the 
     loyal and self-sacrificing friends in India and Burma.  Prof. 
     Pritam Singh's notable and ever-increasing share in the administrative, 
     literary and financial activities of the Faith in 
     that land is a source of genuine and constant satisfaction.  
     I would specially request your Assembly to prepare a comprehensive 
     and detailed report on the activities and progress 
     of the Faith in India and Burma during the last two years, 
     1930-32, for inclusion in the forthcoming issue of the Baha'i 
     World.  Will you kindly forward the report to Mr. Horace 
     Holley as soon as possible, as he has been charged to draw 
     up a survey similar to the one published in the last volume.  
 
 
 
+P32 
     I would also urge the friends in India and Burma to order 
     as many copies of the "Dawn-Breakers" as they possibly 
     can as I regard its circulation of vital importance to the 
     Cause.  
 
August 29, 1931 
 
 
Advertisements in Baha'i Periodicals 
 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to drop you these few lines to 
draw your attention to a general principle he has laid down for 
all the Baha'i periodicals, namely that they should be very careful 
in selecting the advertisements they accept to publish.  It 
should be highly dignified, such as books for example, otherwise 
it would detract from the dignity of the periodical itself.  This 
may cause certain difficulty in financially establishing the paper, 
but we should face the sacrifice and not endanger the prestige 
of our publications.  He wishes you to take note of this general 
recommendation in accepting advertisements for the Baha'i 
Weekly.  
 
January 7, 1932 
 
 
Mrs. Ransom Kehler Visits India 
 
     Mrs. Ransom Kehler has informed us of her trip to India.  
Shoghi Effendi hopes that the friends will give her all the necessary 
facilities to make of her tour a real success.  The report 
of her work in Australia and New Zealand has been brilliant.  
There is no reason why she should not do the same in India and 
Burma if she is given the chance, and be put in touch with 
really open-minded and interested people.  In America she is 
considered among the first class national teachers and is well 
informed as to the progress of modern thought and the teachings 
of the Cause.  May be she will be able to give a new impetus 
to the teaching work....  
 
 
 
+P33 
     He trusts that through the efforts of you and the other 
members of the National Assembly the Cause will take a real 
lead in uniting the different elements existing in India and turn 
the face of its people to the light of God shining through Baha'u'llah.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Your most welcome letter interrupting a prolonged silence 
     on your part, has brought joy and strength to my heart.  I 
     will most assuredly pray for your complete recovery, for in 
     you the Cause in India has an invaluable asset which I, for 
     my part, greatly value and prize.  I trust and pray that 
     Mrs. Kehler's visit will lend a fresh impetus to the work 
     which you are so ably conducting.  I would certainly 
     advise her to prolong her stay in your midst if it is practicable 
     for her to do so.  It is a splendid opportunity which 
     the friends in India should utilize to the utmost possible 
     extent.  May the Beloved bless and reinforce your high 
     endeavours, remove every obstacle from your path, and 
     enable you at once to broaden and reinforce the foundations 
     of the Faith in that troubled land.  
 
February 11, 1932 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear of the arrangements 
you have made for the trip of Mrs. Ransom Kehler to India.  
Being thoroughly familiar with the teachings and a competent 
speaker, she should succeed to render wonderful services to the 
progress of the movement in India.  She could be easily ranked 
as a first class teacher among the Baha'is of America and has 
been the cause of guidance to innumerable souls.  Guided and 
helped by Prof. Pritam Singh she should be able to awaken 
many souls to the spirit and teachings of Baha'u'llah.

Translation of Baha'u'llah [&amp;and] the New Era 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I wish to urge you to take as soon as you possibly can, 
     the necessary and most effective steps to ensure the translation 
 
 
 
+P34 
     of Dr. Esslemont's book into Urdu and Gujrati.  I 
     have already expressed the desirability to have these translations 
     to a number of pilgrims, but so far my hopes have 
     not materialized.  This book has already been translated 
     and printed into eight different languages, the latest being 
     Russian, Hebrew and Chinese.  The Persian, the Albanian, 
     the Bulgarian, the French and the Swedish versions will be 
     printed this year.  I wish you to do all in your power to 
     ensure the speedy and correct translation of this book into 
     these two languages, and if necessary to hire the services of 
     a competent non-Baha'i translator.  I shall be only too 
     pleased to assist financially both with regard to their translation 
     and publication.  May the Beloved guide and assist 
     you in this vital and important task.  
 
March 12, 1932 
 
 
Mrs. Kehler Visits Calcutta 
 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated March 14th 1932 informing him about the arrival 
of Mrs. Ransom Kehler to Calcutta.  He was very glad to 
know that her visit was successful and that it has very much 
stimulated the teaching work in that city.  He sincerely hopes 
that as a consequence a number of souls will enter the Cause 
and be inspired by its divine teachings and ennobling spirit.  
     Such teachers of the Cause who, with all sincerity and determination, 
undertake such long trips, should be very much helped 
by the resident believers if real progress is to be achieved.  
They ought to be assisted to reach important people speak to 
intelligent and receptive audiences, and obtain interviews with 
persons whose heart is open to the light of God.  Otherwise, 
during their short stay they would, like a helpless man in a 
strange country, be impotent to achieve their purpose.  
     Shoghi Effendi is very glad the friends have taken the necessary 
step to assist Mrs. Ransom Kehler by appointing Professor 
 
 
 
+P35 
Pritam Singh to accompany her in her trip through India.  May 
God help her and help you in proclaiming the Word of God 
through the length and breadth of that vast land.  
 
March 28, 1932 
 
 
     He was very glad to learn of the plans you made for Mrs. 
Ransom Kehler.  He sincerely hopes that in these meetings and 
public lectures delivered in so many cities, she has been able to 
attract some new souls to the Cause and confirm people who 
until now have been merely interested.  We should admit, 
however, that the time at her disposal was too short to give her 
the chance of doing her best.  A teacher ought to remain at 
least a few months in the same city if he wants to really confirm 
souls.  Mere passing and giving a lecture or two is not sufficient 
unless there are resident Baha'is to continue the work that was 
merely started.  Anyhow Mrs. Ransom Kehler is expected to 
reach Haifa in about 3 weeks and Shoghi Effendi will hear the 
report of her journey from herself.  
 
 
Translation of Baha'u'llah and the New Era 
 
     The Guardian was very glad to learn of your quick response 
to his expressed desire in having Dr. Esslemont's book translated 
into Urdu and Gujrati.  As he comes to learn from one 
of the Parsee pilgrims here in Haifa, the book has already been 
translated by a competent Baha'i in India into Gujrati.  So 
there remains only Urdu.  So Shoghi Effendi wishes you to 
concentrate upon having the book translated only into Urdu.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I wish you to concentrate your efforts on the completion of 
     the Urdu version of Dr. Esslemont's book, and to take the 
     necessary step for its early publication.  I shall be only too 
     glad to assist financially in its printing as soon as its 
 
 
 
+P36 
     translation is completed.  I also desire to stress the paramount 
     importance of following up the valuable work 
     accomplished by Mrs. Kehler and which I hope other 
     international Baha'i teachers will reinforce.  How vast is the 
     field and how small the number of competent teachers!  
     Baha'u'llah will however bless and crown our efforts with 
     success if we persevere and labour with unabated confidence 
     and vigour.  
 
April 5, 1932 
 
 
Need of Baha'i Teachers all over the World 
 
     He sincerely hopes that as a result of her (Mrs. Kehler's) 
trip the Cause will make a great progress in India and many 
souls will be drawn into the Cause.  It was surely very nice 
and wise on the part of the National Assembly to appoint Mr. 
Pritam Singh to travel with her and help her make openings 
into intellectual circles.  It is unfortunate, however, that she 
cannot stay long in every centre and make really confirmed 
believers such as she did in certain centres in Australia.  But 
perhaps the National Assembly will attend to that task and 
keeping in touch with persons she will interest, and gradually 
make them embrace the Faith and lend a help towards its progress.  
We need teachers in every part of the world, and as 
those who are in active service are few we should create some 
from the material we have.  It is the work of the N.S.A. to 
attend to such matters and develop some of our young Baha'is 
into competent teachers.  
 
 
Baha'u'llah and the New Era to be Translated 
into Urdu [&amp;and] Hindi 
 
     In a previous letter I informed you on behalf of Shoghi 
 
 
 
+P37 
Effendi that as we already have a translation of Dr. Esslemont's 
book into Gujrati, you concentrate your efforts on having it 
rendered only into Urdu, so that the work may soon be completed 
and published.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I trust you have by now taken the necessary steps for a 
     prompt and careful translation of the book into Urdu.  This 
     service will, I am sure, be an added blessing to the masses 
     of India, whom you are striving so devotedly and energetically 
     to arouse and teach.  May it prove a prelude to an 
     intensive and fruitful teaching campaign that shall bring in 
     its wake enlightenment, peace and hope to the distracted 
     multitudes of that agitated country.  
 
April 12, 1932 
 
 
     Even though we can refer to a non-Baha'i when we have no 
one among the friends to undertake a proper work of translation, 
yet it is always preferable to have it accomplished by a 
person who is imbued with the spirit and is already familiar 
with the different expressions of Baha'i conceptions unfamiliar 
to a non-Baha'i.  Shoghi Effendi wishes him success and will 
pray for his guidance.  
     Mrs. Ransom Kehler is now in Haifa taking some rest before 
starting for Persia, where she expects to stay a few months.  
Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear of her great success in 
India.  He hopes that she will after Persia pay another visit to 
that country and resume the work she has started.  She is 
surely a very competent teacher and well versed in the Writings.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I trust and pray that you will be enabled to start promptly 
     the publication of the Hindi translation on one 
     hand, and to ensure, on the other, the early completion of the 
     Urdu version, both of which, I feel are indispensable preliminaries 
     to an intensive teaching campaign among the great 
     masses of the Indian people.  I am confident that the publication 
     of the Gujrati version together with these and the 
     Burmese translations, will reinforce the impetus which the 
 
 
 
+P38 
     projected visit of Mrs. Kehler to India next autumn will lend 
     to the onward march of our beloved Cause in India.  May 
     the Almighty reinforce your labours and bless your high 
     endeavours.  
 
May 31, 1932 
 
 
     He is very glad to know that the different translations of Dr. 
Esslemont's book, that you have undertaken to have made, are 
progressing rapidly.  He sincerely hopes that before long they 
will be passed through the press and be ready for distribution.  
     Even though the book was written by a Christian and was 
meant to be for people of that Faith to read, yet it is a very fine 
presentation of the teachings as a whole and might prove interesting 
to other people as well.  
     Shoghi Effendi surely hopes that before long the Cause may 
produce scholars that would write books which would be far 
deeper and more universal in scope, but for the present this is 
the best we possess to give a general idea as to the history and 
teachings of the Faith to new seekers.  After reading this they 
get the necessary introduction to delve more deeply into the 
fundamental tenets such as are explained in the Iqan.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that these books will greatly stimulate 
the teaching work in India and become the cause of guidance 
to many sincere souls.  
 
 
Passing Away of the Greatest Holy Leaf 
 
     The Guardian wishes me also to thank you for your kind 
words of sympathy in connection with the passing away of the 
Greatest Holy Leaf.  This great loss will be felt by every Baha'i 
but especially the pilgrims to whom she used to be such a source 
of inspiration and joy.  All those who met her left her presence 
with a new spirit and a firm determination to serve the Cause 
for which she suffered so much and whose progress was so near 
to her heart.  
 
 
 
+P39 
     What the Guardian is glad about is that her passing is creating 
a new spirit among the friends and arousing them to greater 
effort.  May her death do for the progress of the Faith as much 
as her life did.  
 
 
Publication of Baha'u'llah [&amp;and] the New Era 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I wish to emphasize afresh the vital necessity of speeding 
     up the work of the translation and publication of the Gujrati, 
     the Urdu and the Hindi versions of the `New Era', a book 
     that has already been published into 14 different languages 
     and is being translated into sixteen additional tongues.  I 
     am deeply appreciative of what you have already achieved, 
     and wish to assure you of my continued prayers for the 
     success of your painstaking efforts and the realization of 
     your dearest wish in the service of our beloved Faith.  
 
October 19, 1932 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to communicate with you to inquire 
regarding the Hindi and Urdu translations of Dr. Esslemont's 
book.  It is sometime that he has had no definite word as to 
the progress of that work which you have so kindly undertaken 
to supervise.  He sincerely hopes that gradually that task will 
be successfully achieved and that they will be ready to be 
submitted to the printers and then to the readers who may be 
anxiously awaiting to study them and benefit from their 
contents.  
     This work once completed will become a great stimulus to 
the teaching activities of the friends, for books can do infinitely 
more work than teachers.  Sitting in a chair in a solitary corner 
one is infinitely more receptive to truth than in a lecture hall or 
in a discussion group.  The public has learned the habit of 
reading.  It is through that channel therefore that we have to 
approach them.  
 
November 19, 1932 
 
 
 
+P40 
     He was very glad to obtain some news regarding the translation 
of Dr. Esslemont's book into Urdu and Hindi, for he 
feels deeply interested in the work.  He feels that it is only when 
such books are accessible to the public that the Cause will begin 
to spread and its followers increase in number.  
     He, therefore, wishes you to exert your effort along that 
line so that the task may be achieved properly and without any 
needless delay.  Also please keep him informed regarding any 
new development or any progress made.  
     We do not now have any pilgrims, but the news we receive 
from different parts of the world show great progress achieved by 
the friends.  Even though material conditions in some instances 
hamper their activities to an appreciable extent, yet their devotion 
and self-sacrifice are daily winning for them the admiration 
and sympathy of the world around them.  Every day a new 
group is formed and new souls attracted to the faith.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I grieve to learn of the delay in the translation and publication 
     of the various translations of Dr. Esslemont's valuable 
     book, and I urge you to do all you possibly can to hasten 
     the realization of our cherished hopes--hopes which when 
     fulfilled will no doubt lend a great and fresh impetus to the 
     advancement of the Faith in that land.  I am enclosing a 
     copy of my recent letter concerning the Greatest Holy Leaf 
     and the measures which, I feel, must be taken by the friends 
     in Persia preliminary to the formation of the House of 
     Justice.  
 
January 10, 1933 
 
 
Baha'i Center in Calcutta 
 
     He sincerely hopes that through God's infinite blessings the 
necessary sum will be forthcoming and that in time a Center 
worthy of the prestige and name of the Cause will be purchased 
or built.  
 
 
 
+P41 
     Such institutions greatly help the spread of the Faith, for 
there will be a permanent place where the interested souls can 
go for information.  It also operates as the center of the different 
activities of the Spiritual Assembly of that locality.  
     In his moments of prayer at the Blessed Shrines, the Guardian 
will think of you as well as of the other friends in that 
locality and ask for you all divine guidance and help.  
     He was also delighted to hear that three new souls have 
accepted the Faith in Calcutta.  He hopes that before long we 
will have large groups, comprising hundreds of earnest and 
seeking souls, enter the Cause and take part in spreading the 
Message.  Please assure the three of them of Shoghi Effendi's 
loving greetings.  
 
February 8, 1933 
 
 
Translation of Baha'u'llah [&amp;and] the New Era into 
Burmese 
 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to write you this short note to enclose 
a check for thirty pounds.  
     This is his contribution towards the publication of the 
translation of Dr. Esslemont's book into Burmese which has 
been made by Sayed Mustafa Rumi.  Please inform the latter 
about its receipt because he has asked the Guardian to send 
this contribution through you and he may be anxious to receive 
this news.  
 
March 1, 1933 
 
 
     He was very glad to learn that the Burmese translation has 
been completed and that it is now in the hands of the printers.  
     Now the translation into Burmese and Gujrati have been 
completed and the latter is even printed and circulated the 
 
 
 
+P42 
Guardian feels we should concentrate upon the Hindi and Urdu 
translations.  We should not permit so much unnecessary delay.  
If one way seems closed or difficult we could try another and 
strive for the speedy completion of those books.  The more we 
see the crying need of the world for the spiritual teachings of 
our Faith the more restless we should feel in giving out the 
Message and improving the means of diffusing the precepts of 
the Cause.  
     In his moments of prayers at the Blessed Shrines the Guardian 
will think of you and ask God to guide and sustain your 
efforts.  He knows fully how difficult it is these days to bring a 
task to a speedy and successful conclusion, but to a person 
who is determined and lays his trust in God nothing is 
impossible.  
 
 
Teaching Among the Masses in India 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I rejoice to hear of the steps that are being taken for the 
     printing of the Burmese edition of the `New Era' but deplore 
     the delay in the translation of the book into Hindi and Urdu.  
     The Gujrati copies have already been placed in the library 
     of the Mansion at Bahji, and I long with all my heart to witness 
     these remaining translations in their final and printed 
     form, side by side with the nineteen printed versions which 
     have already been collected and distributed throughout the 
     world.  I would urge you to concentrate your energy on this 
     important and essential preliminary to an intensive campaign 
     of teaching among the masses in India.  Persevere and rest 
     assured that my prayers will continue to be offered on your 
     behalf.  
 
March 24, 1933 
 
 
     He was very glad to receive the Gujrati translation of Dr. 
Esslemont's book, and he hopes that through your efforts the 
Hindi and Urdu translation of it will soon be ready for publication.  
 
 
 
+P43 
As you may know, this work has already been translated 
into 19 different languages and its rendering into 11 others will 
be soon completed.  This is really encouraging.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I long to hear from you and of the progress of your devoted 
     and incessant activities in the service of our beloved 
     Faith.  I am also eager to receive the good news of the completion 
     of the translation and early publication of the Urdu 
     and Hindi versions of the `New Era'.  The utmost effort 
     should be exerted to ensure the consummation of this work 
     which, I feel, must precede an intensive teaching campaign 
     among the masses in India.  I am arranging for Mrs. Kehler 
     to visit southern Persia this autumn after which she is expecting 
     to visit India, this winter.  
 
June 8, 1933 
 
 
Baha'i Magazine 
 
     He was particularly glad to learn that some of our Indian 
friends have encouraged you to start a fortnightly paper on the 
Cause.  The idea is, undoubtedly, most genuine and meets with 
our Guardian's wholehearted approval.  He wishes you, however, 
not to act hurriedly, to take all the necessary steps which 
can insure its safety and development.  Such projects are not so 
easy to carry out, especially in these days when the economic 
crisis is getting so acute.  At any rate, if you find that your 
financial conditions allow you to undertake such an important 
work, you should persevere in your efforts and try to make your 
paper an indispensable adjunct to the teaching activities of the 
friends.  
     The Guardian hopes that you will be more successful in 
this, your second attempt.  The unexpected death of the `Baha'i 
Weekly', he feels, had badly affected the prestige of the Cause.  
It is hoped that your new fortnightly paper will enable all to 
appreciate more adequately the divine potency with which it is 
endowed.  
 
 
 
+P44 
     Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler, who has been doing such a fine 
work in Persia, is planning to leave for India at the beginning of 
winter.  Her presence among you will be certainly appreciated.  
She is such a wonderful soul, so devoted, so active and so capable.  
The Guardian hopes that you will make the utmost use of 
her stay in India.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          Your unswerving loyalty and inflexible resolve to carry on 
     the work you have so nobly initiated are indeed worthy of 
     the highest praise.  I will pray for your success and the 
     steady and uninterrupted progress of your activities whenever 
     I lay my head on the sacred Threshold and will supplicate 
     for you all the strength and guidance you need for the 
     prosecution of your task.  The friends in India and Burma 
     should bestir themselves and, under the guidance and by the 
     aid of the National Assembly prepare the way for the forthcoming 
     visit of our able and brilliant international teacher 
     Mrs. Kehler.  May the Lord sustain and guide them in their 
     endeavours and reward them for their acts of self-sacrifice in 
     His Path.  
 
June 13, 1933 
 
 
Publication of Baha'u'llah [&amp;and] the New Era 
 
     As regards the Urdu translation of Dr. Esslemont's book, 
Shoghi Effendi wishes you to make all the necessary effort to 
have it published as soon as possible.  He is fully aware of 
the difficulties that have caused an inevitable delay in the 
publication of this highly important work, but he feels certain 
that, through your perseverance and through the kind and 
invaluable assistance of Prof. Pritam Singh ... 
the translation will be soon completed and be ready for 
publication.  
     The Guardian would like you also to take all the necessary 
steps for the Hindi translation of this same work.  It is hoped 
that no delay will be caused this time.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          The Serbian and Hungarian versions of "The New Era" 
 
 
 
+P45 
     have been recently published through the efforts of Martha 
     Root.  The Rumanian translation has been undertaken and 
     the Greek version will soon be started.  I long to see the 
     Urdu, the Hindi and the Burmese versions in print and 
     circulated among the masses of the Indian people.  Persevere 
     and redouble in your efforts.  
 
August 6, 1933 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi was deeply gratified to learn of the important 
steps you have taken for the translation and publication of 
Dr. Esslemont's book into Hindi.  He has greatly appreciated 
the assistance of Dr. Kaushal Kishore, and sincerely trusts that 
through your combined efforts the work will be soon completed 
and will be ready for circulation.  In a recent communication to 
the Guardian, our devoted friend Siyyid, Mustafa Rumi, has 
given the news of the publication of this same book in Burmese.  
It is hoped that this will serve to encourage our Indian believers 
to follow his example.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am so pleased and grateful to you for your incessant 
     efforts in connexion with the translation and publication of 
     the `New Era', and I am deeply gratified to learn of the progress 
     already achieved.  I will continue to pray for the speedy 
     realization of your hopes, plans and wishes in the service 
     of this glorious Faith.  
 
September 10, 1933 
 
 
Passing Away of Brilliant Teacher--Mrs. Kehler 
 
     The sudden passing of that wholly-consecrated and brilliant 
teacher and international promoter of the Cause Mrs. Keith 
Ransom-Kehler, has plunged Shoghi Effendi into deepest 
sorrow for in her he has lost not only a valuable co-worker 
but a dear friend.  After more than a year of intense teaching 
work in Persia, where she was entrusted by the Guardian with 
the mission of acquainting our Persian brethren with the basic 
 
 
 
+P46 
principles of the Administration and of liberating them from 
the appalling persecutions to which they have been lately 
subjected, our precious Keith left this world under so tragic 
circumstances that she was given by the Guardian the title of 
the first western martyr on Persian soil, and was raised by him 
to the station of one of the Hands of the Cause.  Her deep-rooted 
and unshakable faith, her unqualified loyalty to the 
Cause of the Administration and her profound knowledge of 
the Teachings, all these fully entitle her to occupy such an 
eminent rank among the faithful.  
     Our Indian friends, who have been so appreciative of her 
last visit to them, must have been particularly affected by such 
an irretrievable loss.  May the memory of her services inspire 
them to follow in her footsteps, and to tread the path of service 
as firmly and as successfully as she did.  
 
 
Twentyfive Printed Versions of Baha'u'llah [&amp;and] 
the New Era 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I am so eager to receive the news of the completion and 
     publication of the Hindi and Urdu versions of the "New 
     Era", and it will please and encourage you to know that 
     we have already twentyfive different printed versions of 
     this precious book translated into Eastern and Western 
     tongues.  
 
November 26, 1933 
 
 
Registration of Bombay Assembly 
 
     The Guardian was greatly pleased to read the minutes of 
the last meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
Baha'is of India and Burma and he wishes me to express his 
genuine appreciation of the important steps which your 
Assembly has taken for the further extension and consolidation 
 
 
 
+P47 
of the administrative institutions of the Faith in that country.  
He would be very grateful if you send him regularly the minutes 
of the meetings of the N.S.A. and he would be only too glad 
to offer any suggestion or advice which may help its members 
to better discharge their manifold and delicate functions.  He 
sincerely hopes that your Assembly will meet as regularly and 
as frequently as possible in order to maintain the efficiency of 
its functioning and to raise the standard and to widen the scope 
of its activities.  
     The important decision of the N.S.A. relative to the registration 
of the Bombay Assembly as a recognized religious body is, 
in the Guardian's opinion, a leading step towards the official 
recognition of the Cause as an independent religious organisation 
by the Government authorities both in India and Burma.  He 
would strongly urge, however, that the constitution to be 
adopted should not only be based on that which the New York 
Assembly has adopted for its own registration but should 
reproduce it identically without any change whatsoever but 
with due consideration to all local and geographical differences.  
     The Guardian wishes also to stress the necessity of completing 
the Urdu and the Hindi translations of Dr. Esslemont's `New 
Era'.  He has already, in several communications addressed 
to Mr. N.R. Vakil, requested him to take all the necessary steps 
in this direction.  May the decision of the N.S.A. on this point 
hasten and insure the completion of this task to which the 
Guardian has so repeatedly drawn the attention of the friends.  
 
December 27, 1933 
 
 
Bedrock of Baha'i Administrative Order 
 
     The Guardian was very pleased to learn of the progress 
done by the Indian N.S.A. in its efforts to consolidate, widen 
and maintain the scope of its national activities.  The difficulties 
in your way are tremendous.  The differences of language and 
of social and intellectual background do, undoubtedly, render 
the work somewhat difficult to carry out and may temporarily 
 
 
 
+P48 
check the efficient and smooth working of the national administrative 
machinery of the Faith.  They, nevertheless, impart to 
the deliberations of the National Assembly a universality which 
they would be otherwise lacking, and give to its members a 
breadth of view which is their duty to cultivate and foster.  It 
is not uniformity which we should seek in the formation of 
any national or local assembly.  For the bedrock of the Baha'i 
administrative order is the principle of unity in diversity, which 
has been so strongly and so repeatedly emphasized in the 
writings of the Cause.  Differences which are not fundamental 
and contrary to the basic teachings of the Cause should be 
maintained, while the underlying unity of the administrative 
order should be at any cost preserved and insured.  Unity, both 
of purpose and of means is, indeed, indispensable to the safe 
and speedy working of every Assembly, whether local or 
national.  
     Another factor which, in the Guardian's opinion, is essential 
to the development of your N.S.A. is the holding of frequent 
meetings.  Although the members are stationed at great distances 
from one another, yet they can communicate through correspondence.  
It is not necessary that all the members should be 
present in all the sessions.  Those who for some reason or 
another are unable to attend in person the meetings of the 
N.S.A., can express their views in a written form and send them 
to the Assembly.  The main point is that your national 
activities should not be let to suffer in any way, and its work 
be retarded and postponed because of such necessarily unimportant 
and secondary considerations.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          I wish to assure you in person of my prayers for the 
     removal of the difficulties, domestic and otherwise, that 
     beset your path in these days.  I will supplicate the Almighty 
     to guide you in your manifold and valuable activities in the 
     service of His Faith, to cheer your heart, and to deepen 
     your understanding of the fundamentals of His Faith.  You 
     should concentrate your efforts at the present time on whatever 
     will, in your opinion reinforce the basis and extend the 
     influence, of the administrative institutions and the teaching 
     activities of the Faith.  The Cause will, no doubt, surmount 
 
 
 
+P49 
     the obstacles that now hinder its growth and will establish 
     its ascendency in the fulness of time and at the appointed 
     hour.  We should persevere and never feel disheartened.  
 
January 2, 1934 
 
 
Accept Justified Resignation 
 
     The N.S.A. cannot refuse accepting a resignation when it is 
well justified, and when it is done not with the purpose of 
shirking responsibility but with the intention of giving a chance 
to others to prove themselves worthy of occupying responsible 
posts in the administrative field.  
 
April 10, 1934 
 
 
Revival of the Spirit of Fellowship 
 
     The resolutions passed by your N.S.A. at its recent meeting 
at Delhi have given him sufficient evidence of the new spirit 
that has come to animate its members.  It is his hope that 
through the continued development of that same spirit your 
Assembly will be enabled to do more effective work for the 
Cause.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          The splendid resolutions passed by the National Assembly 
     at Delhi are admirable and indicate the revival of the spirit 
     of fellowship and determination to consolidate the administrative 
     basis of the Faith in India and Burma.  I am eagerly 
     anticipating to hear the news that these resolutions have 
     been duly carried out, particularly regarding the incorporation 
     of the Bombay Assembly and the translation and 
     publication of the New Era into Urdu and Sindhi.  
 
May 29, 1934 
  

Changes in Membership of Baha'i 
Assemblies 
 
     He fully agrees with the Bombay Assembly that they are 
in need of an English-speaking Secretary, in view of the 
 
 
 
+P50 
increasingly large volume of correspondence they receive in English.  
But he feels that this emergency does not afford sufficient 
justification to any believer or Assembly to make the slightest 
departure from the recognized and duly established principles 
governing the election of the members of any Assembly, whether 
local or national.  If the Bombay Assembly feels it necessary 
to have a Secretary for the English correspondence they can 
appoint an Assistant Secretary from outside the Assembly.  
It is only the body of Baha'i electors who can bring about 
any change in the membership of the Assembly, and this during 
the Ridvan feast which for all administrative purposes is the 
beginning of the Baha'i Year.  
 
June 5, 1934 
 
 
Intensify Teaching Throughout India 
 
     He notes with deep satisfaction the important steps taken by 
your N.S.A. for intensifying the spread of the Cause throughout 
India and Burma, and particularly values the encouragement 
and help which they have extended to dear Mr. Pritam 
Singh in his teaching tour in Northern India.  He is praying 
from the depth of his heart for the success of this trip, as well 
as for the speedy and complete materialisation of the plans 
which you, in close collaboration with your fellow-members in 
the National Assembly, are initiating for the wider diffusion of 
the teachings throughout your country.  
     He fully appreciates, indeed, the suggestions you have 
offered him in this connection.  The lack of competent teachers 
is no doubt a serious obstacle facing the Indian believers at 
present.  But it is by no means the most difficult problem with 
which they have to deal.  The essential is that all the friends, 
without any exception whatever, should realise the full measure 
of the responsibility which Baha'u'llah has placed on them for 
teaching far and wide His Message.  It is only through such an 
awakened consciousness of their heavy and sacred responsibilities 
and duties that the believers can hope to effectively promote and 
safeguard the interests of the Cause.  The Baha'i era is thus 
 
 
 
+P51 
the age of individual responsibility--the age in which everyone is 
called to consider the spread of the Cause as his most sacred and 
vital obligation.  
     This is the point which the Guardian wishes your Assembly 
to emphasize in connection with the problem of teaching in 
India.  He hopes that through their collective efforts a new 
zeal for teaching will come to animate the entire community of 
the believers throughout India and Burma.  
     Shoghi Effendi approves of your suggestion to utilize the 
fifty pounds which he sent to you, for the publication of the 
Bengali translation of the "New Era".  He hopes that this 
work will soon be ready for distribution.  
 
November 25, 1934 
 
 
"Kitab-i-Iqan" Translated in Many Languages 
 
     I am directed by the Guardian to request you to kindly mail 
to his address five copies of the Urdu translation of the "Kitab-i-Iqan" 
(Book of Certitude).  
     You will certainly be interested to know that the Iqan has 
already been translated and published into Russian, English, 
French, German, Chinese, Albanian, Urdu and Braille.  Steps 
have also been taken for its rendering and publication into 
Arabic, Armenian, Swedish and Danish.  
 
November 27, 1934 
 
 
Persecution of the Baha'is in Iran 
 
     The persecutions from which the Persian friends are now 
suffering represent, indeed, the culmination in the long and 
nation-wide campaign which the authorities in that country have 
during the last two years launched against the Faith.  In many 
of its aspects this campaign is reminiscent of the persecutions 
suffered by the early Babis,...  
 
 
 
+P52 
     The first incident which led to this outburst of fierce antagonism 
on the part of the Government was in connection with 
the Tarbiat Schools in Tehran.  The school authorities having, 
after due consultation with the N.S.A. and in strict conformity 
with the principle governing the observance of Baha'i holidays, 
decided to close the schools on the occasion of the celebration 
of the anniversary of Bab's martyrdom, the authorities in the 
capital immediately issued orders that the schools be permanently 
closed, and that also no public meetings of any kind be 
held by the believers.  This has been done in spite of the fact 
that other religious communities, such as the Muslims and the 
Zoroastrians, are allowed to celebrate their own feasts, and as 
such enjoy full religious freedom.  Similar orders were issued 
to the believers in all other parts of Persia, with the result that 
today the friends find their activities in Persia completely 
paralyzed.  Their schools have all been definitely closed, their 
meetings suspended, their correspondence intercepted, and their 
assemblies and committees for the most part dissolved.  
     The situation, as it stands at present, is highly disconcerting.  
The friends, however, faithful to the injunctions of the Master 
regarding obedience to government in all administrative matters 
as distinguished from those affecting their conscience and loyalty 
to the Cause strictly adhere to the laws and orders of the 
government.  Their sole hope is the assurance that in due time 
all these restrictions are bound to disappear....  
     In the meantime, the Guardian would urge all the friends to 
patiently and prayerfully wait until these sad happenings take 
their due course.  For the history of the Cause, particularly in 
Persia, is a clear illustration of the truth that such persecutions 
invariably serve to strengthen the believers in their faith, by 
stimulating the spiritual powers latent in their hearts, and by 
awakening in them a new and deeper consciousness of their 
duties and responsibilities towards the Faith.  Indeed, the mere 
progress of the Cause, by provoking the hatreds and jealousies 
of peoples and nations, creates for itself such difficulties and 
obstacles as only its divine spirit can overcome.  Abdu'l-Baha 
has emphatically stated that the enmity and opposition of the 
 
 
 
+P53 
world will increase in direct proportion to the extension and 
progress of the Faith.  The greater the zeal of the believers and 
the more striking the effect of their achievements, the fiercer 
will be the opposition of the enemy.  
     Many are the passages in the Writings of Baha'u'llah wherein 
He foreshadows the persecutions awaiting His Faith.  But 
side by side with such emphatic predictions is the assurance 
that out of these sufferings and trials His Cause will emerge 
triumphant and purified.  May we not, therefore, gather strength 
from such an assurance, and with hearts filled with confident 
and joyous hope arise to fulfil our part in the establishment of 
His Cause?  
 
January 20, 1935 
 
 
Training of Baha'i Teachers 
 
     With regard to the teaching outline you had enclosed, 
Shoghi Effendi has read it with interest and appreciation and 
wishes me to assure you of his whole-hearted approval.  The 
method you have adopted for the training of Baha'i teachers is, 
indeed, very similar to the one used by the American friends.  
It is very thorough, yet clear and highly effective.  The Guardian 
trusts that the believers in India and Burma will make full use 
of your Assembly's suggestions and directions, and in this way 
help in inaugurating a new and effective teaching campaign 
throughout India and Burma.  
 
July 8, 1935 
 
 
Registration of L.S.A. of Karachi 
 
     He has been particularly pleased and encouraged to receive 
the copy of the Certificate of Registration of the Karachi Baha'i 
Assembly, and is eagerly awaiting for the registration papers of 
the Delhi and Rangoon Spiritual Assemblies.  He hopes that 
the N.S.A. will expedite the matter of legalizing all the Local 
 
 
 
+P54 
Assemblies of India and Burma and in this way insure the 
stability of the administrative institutions of the Cause in these 
two countries.  
 
August 12, 1935 
 
 
Formation of an Assembly in Lahore 
 
     He is pleased to learn of the possibility of establishing an 
Assembly in Lahore in the near future.  He would urge you, 
and through you your fellow-members in the N.S.A., to make a 
special effort to bring about such a formation as soon as conditions 
are found to be favourable.  He hopes that the establishment 
of a local Assembly in so important and central a town 
in India will greatly help the expansion of the Faith, and will 
consolidate the foundations of its institutions throughout that 
country.  
 
October 17, 1935 
 
 
Historic Step in Development of Administrative 
Order 
 
     He wishes me to congratulate you, and through you your 
fellow-members in the N.S.A., for the steps you have taken for 
the registration of the Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon and other local 
Assemblies.  He hopes that by the end of the year six out of 
the eight Assemblies will be duly registered.  Needless to say 
that the obtention of such an official recognition from the 
authorities is an historic step in the development of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith throughout India and Burma, and 
one which shall greatly enhance its prestige, and consolidate its 
position in the eyes of the public.  May Baha'u'llah continue 
to guide and assist your efforts for the fulfilment of this task.  
     The Guardian is also very much gratified to learn that the 
N.S.A. is considering the possibility of establishing a local 
 
 
 
+P55 
Assembly in Lucknow.  He trusts that in Jaunpur too an 
Assembly will be formed very soon, and that through these two 
valuable additions to the list of local Baha'i Assemblies, the 
administrative work of the Cause in India will make further 
and steady advancement.  
     In connection with the Teaching School which the N.S.A. is 
planning to start, the Guardian wishes me to express his approval, 
as well as his appreciation of this important action taken 
by your Assembly for the extension of their teaching work.  He 
is also very pleased at the news of the teaching tour undertaken 
by Prof. Pritam Singh throughout Northern India and Bengal.  
He is praying for the success of this trip, and cherishes the hope 
that it may serve to bring into the Cause people of capacity 
and of true spiritual vision.  
 
 
Circulation of Abdu'l-Baha's Photographs 
 
     Regarding the use of Abdu'l-Baha's photographs; Shoghi 
Effendi sees no objection to their circulation.  He would, however, 
suggest that the Paris photograph be used, as well as the 
American reproduction of it, printed on yellow paper with a 
quotation from the Kitab-i-Ahd at the bottom.  
 
 
Splendid Initiative 
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          My heart swells with pride and gratitude as I witness, in 
     rapid succession and with ever-increasing dearness, the 
     evidences of the splendid initiative, the unwavering determination 
     and solidarity which have characterized your 
     accomplishments in recent months.  The National Assembly 
     of India and Burma may be said to have resuscitated our 
     Cause and its institutions throughout the length and breadth 
     of that land.  A mighty power whose source is centred in 
     Baha'u'llah Himself is copiously flowing through and permeating 
     the various organs of the Administrative Order of 
 
 
 
+P56 
     His Faith in both India and Burma.  You and your collaborators 
     stand on the threshold of unparalleled achievements.  I 
     cannot but congratulate you on the start you have made and 
     on your choice of the path, which, after so many trials and 
     vicissitudes, you are so confidently treading.  Persevere, and 
     be happy and thankful to Baha'u'llah.  
 
November 15, 1935 
 
 
Baha'i Holidays must be Observed 
 
     The Guardian ... feels truly delighted at the news of the 
splendid meetings that were held in Bombay in honour of the 
anniversary of the birthday of His Holiness Baha'u'llah.  This 
fresh evidence of the loyalty and devotion with which the Bombay 
friends are upholding the institutions of the Faith is highly 
gratifying and encouraging to him, indeed.  
     But he cannot but deplore the fact that some of the believers 
are reluctant to observe, as strictly as they should, the Feasts 
and anniversaries prescribed by the Cause.  This attitude, which 
may be justified in certain exceptional circumstances, is fraught 
with incalculable dangers and harm to the community, and will, 
if allowed to persist, seriously endanger its influence and prestige 
in the public eye.  Unity of action, in matters of so vital an 
importance as the observance of Baha'i holidays, is essential.  
It is the responsibility of the N.S.A. to remind and urge the 
friends to faithfully carry out all such laws and precepts of the 
Cause, the enforcement of which does not constitute an open 
violation of the laws of their country.  
 
     [From the Guardian:]  
          The striking evidences of renewed Baha'i activity throughout 
     India and Burma, the recent manifestations of loyalty, 
     solidarity and self-sacrifice on the part of individuals, groups 
     and Assemblies in both the teaching and administrative 
     spheres of Baha'i service, rejoice my heart and revive and 
     enliven my hopes for the future of that land.  The friends 
     in India and Burma have made a splendid start.  They have 
 
 
 
+P57 
     laid a firm foundation within the framework of the 
     administrative order of our Faith.  They have weathered 
     manifold and distressing difficulties and successfully 
     surmounted formidable obstacles.  A new era is opening 
     before them.  I have no doubt that they will rise to the 
     height of the occasion, and will prove themselves worthy of 
     their high destiny.  
 
November 22, 1935 
 
 
Effective Publicity Throughout India 
 
     He feels greatly rejoiced at the important steps you have 
taken for giving the Cause a wide and effective publicity 
throughout India.  He has read with much interest the newspaper 
clipping which you had enclosed, and sincerely hopes 
that your masterly sketch of the history and teachings of the 
Cause will serve to attract leading personalities among the 
Indian public to the Faith.  
     Regarding the publication of the Hindi, Sindhi and Bengali 
translations of "Baha'u'llah and the New Era," the Guardian 
very much appreciates your N.S.A.'s response to his call for 
speeding up the printing of these works which, he hopes, will, 
when widely circulated throughout the country open a new era 
of unprecedented teaching activity not only in India and 
Burma, but also in Ceylon and other neighbouring countries.  
 
January 3, 1936 
 
 
     He feels really proud of you and of your distinguished and 
able co-workers in the National Assembly for the unity, 
efficiency and zeal with which you are labouring for the consolidation 
of the Administration throughout India and Burma.  
He is convinced that your sustained and collective efforts in this 
connection will soon result in ushering in a new era in the 
history of the Cause in that country.  
 
 
 
+P58 
Correspondence with the Guardian 
 
     The N.S.A. should, indeed, advise the believers to lessen their 
correspondence with the Guardian.  But under no circumstances 
it can prevent them from writing to him.  For this is a sacred 
right and a supreme privilege which every believer can rightly 
claim to possess, as through it alone he can get in direct touch 
with his Guardian.  If individuals feel, after the advice of the 
N.S.A. to lessen correspondence, an inner urge to write to the 
Guardian they should not be prevented or discouraged.  
 
 
"New-Era" in Sindhi [&amp;and] Bengali Printed 
 
     Shoghi Effendi is delighted to learn that the Sindhi and the 
Bengali translations of the "New Era" have been already sent 
to the press.  He hopes that the Hindi version will also be completed 
very soon.  He is also very pleased that the N.S.A. is 
taking the necessary steps for presenting to the authorities the 
pamphlet regarding various laws and ordinances of the Cause on 
matters of personal status.  He sincerely hopes that the bill you 
are planning to submit to the government will be approved.  
He is eagerly awaiting to read the text himself.  
 
 
Union With Loved Ones in the Next World 
 
     ...the possibility of securing union with his beloved in 
the next world is one which the Baha'i Teachings are quite 
clear about.  According to Baha'u'llah the soul retains its 
individuality and consciousness after death, and is able to commune 
with other souls.  This communion, however, is purely 
spiritual in character, and is conditioned upon the disinterested 
and selfless love of the individuals for each other.  
 
 
Effort in the Field of Teaching Urgently 
Required 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The evidences of the rise, the consolidation, and expansion 
 
 
 
+P59 
     of the Administrative Order of our beloved Faith in India 
     and Burma are highly significant and most encouraging.  
     The incorporation of several local Assemblies is of historic 
     importance.  Reproduction of all the Certificates of Incorporation 
     will adorn the pages of the forthcoming Biennial.  
     Now that the basis of Baha'i institutions has been firmly 
     laid, an unprecedented effort in the field of teaching is 
     urgently required.  Such an effort is of vital and paramount 
     importance.  May the Almighty sustain, inspire and guide 
     you in this meritorious endeavour.  
 
March 10, 1936 
 
 
     ...He would also appeal to all the friends to lend full 
and continued support to the Cause of teaching throughout 
India.  He would suggest that those believers who have the 
means and the necessary physical requirements, to settle in 
those localities where the light of the Cause has not yet penetrated, 
with the view of establishing a new group.  This, he 
feels, is a very effective way of spreading the Cause in a vast 
and exceptionally varied country like India.  
 
 
Voting is Sacred Obligation 
 
     Regarding voting; it is not only the right but the sacred 
obligation of every member of any Baha'i administrative body, 
whether permanent, or temporary like the Convention, to fully 
and freely exercise this function.  Abstention from voting is, 
as a rule, not advisable, as it implies a shirking of responsibility 
which every loyal and conscientious believer should consider it 
a privilege to shoulder.  
 
 
It is But a Beginning 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The work thus far achieved, in both the teaching and 
     administrative spheres of Baha'i service, is highly reassuring 
     and truly meritorious in the sight of God.  It is but a beginning 
     however.  Much remains to be achieved.  A systematic 
     effort, aiming at the settlement of individual believers in 
 
 
 
+P60 
     those states and provinces of India where the banner of the 
     Faith has not yet been hoisted, must be deliberately exerted 
     and vigorously sustained.  Southern India particularly, the 
     island of Ceylon and other outlying centres on the fringe of 
     the Indian Empire as well as within its very heart should be 
     won over, through your strenuous, constant and devoted 
     labours, to the ever-advancing Cause of Baha'u'llah.  To 
     extend the outposts of our far-flung Faith should be your 
     immediate objective.  
 
May 31, 1936 
 
 
Daidanaw Baha'i School 
 
     Much as he realizes the heavy and ever-increasing expenses 
which your Assembly is incurring, particularly in these hard 
times, he feels nevertheless the urge to impress upon you the 
vital necessity for the Indian and Burmese believers to help in 
maintaining this Baha'i school in Daidanaw which, in addition 
to the educational advantages it offers to the Baha'is, can be of 
great help in promoting the cause of teaching throughout 
Burma.  
     In view of that the Guardian wishes you to lay this matter 
before the N.S.A. and to urge them to give it their careful consideration.  
He himself is sending through the care of Siyyid 
Mustafa Roumie, thirty pounds as his contribution towards the 
upkeep of the school at Daidanaw.  
 
July 10, 1936 
 
 
Two Main Principles to Follow 
 
     With regard to the problems confronting the believers; these, 
the Guardian fully realizes, are by no means easy to solve.  But 
the friends should be confident that the very progress of the 
Cause will enable them to find the necessary solution to the 
difficulties which appear now to so seriously puzzle their minds.  
 
 
 
+P61 
     There are two main principles which the Guardian wishes 
the friends to always bear in mind and to conscientiously and 
faithfully follow.  First is the principle of unqualified and whole-hearted 
loyalty to the revealed Word.  The believers should be 
careful not to deviate, even a hair-breadth, from the Teachings.  
Their supreme consideration should be to safeguard the purity 
of the principles, tenets and laws of the Faith.  It is only by 
this means that they can hope to maintain the organic unity of 
the Cause.  There can and should be no liberals or conservatives, 
no moderates or extremes in the Cause.  For they are all 
subject to the one and the same law which is the Law of God.  
This law transcends all differences, all personal or local tendencies, 
moods and aspirations.  
     Next is the principle of complete, and immediate obedience 
to the Assemblies, both local and national.  It is the responsibility 
of these Baha'i administrative bodies to enable the community 
to acquire, and increasingly deepen in the knowledge 
and understanding of the Cause.  Doctrinal unity and administrative 
unity, these are the two chief pillars that sustain the 
edifice of the Cause, and protect it from the storms of opposition 
which so severely rage against it.  
 
September 5, 1936 
 
 
Visit of Mr. Schopflocher to India 
 
     I am addressing you these few lines on behalf of our beloved 
Guardian to ask you to kindly inform your fellow-members in 
the Indian N.S.A. of the happy news of the projected visit of dear 
Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher to India, and to request you to take 
any step that your Assembly deems advisable in order to make 
his journey as fruitful and abundant in its results as possible.  
     Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher is not in need of any introduction, 
as his long and manifold services to the Cause in America 
and particularly his generous and unfailing support of the local, 
national as well as international Baha'i funds, have endeared 
him to all the friends, whether in the East or in the West.  
 
 
 
+P62 
     For many years he has been a member of the American 
N.S.A. and he contributed no small part in the steady development 
and consolidation of the Administration ever since the 
early days of its establishment in the States.  He is indeed an 
outstanding champion of the Administration not only in America 
but also in the West, and has proved in deeds his profound 
attachment and loyalty to all its principles, laws and institutions.  
     His name will be ever associated with the beloved Temple 
in Wilmette.  Had it not been for the continued and whole-hearted 
support, both financial and moral, which he so 
generously extended to it, that edifice could have never been 
reared so steadily and efficiently.  The friends will always 
remember with deep gratitude the eminent services he has rendered 
the Faith in this connection.  
     In view of these labours so devotedly accomplished, the 
Guardian wishes your Assembly to urge the friends to draw full 
benefit from Mr. Schopflocher's visit to India.  He is confident 
that you will extend to him a most hearty welcome, and will, 
through association with him, draw fresh strength and inspiration 
in your arduous labours for the Cause.  
 
September 25, 1936 
 
 
Systematized and Nation-wide Teaching 
Campaign 
 
     Our beloved Guardian has read with intense interest and 
deepest satisfaction your most welcome letter of the fifth 
October conveying to him the joyful news of the teaching travels 
undertaken by Prof. Pritam Singh and Dr. G.Y. Chitnis throughout 
India.  He wishes you to congratulate most warmly on his 
behalf these two distinguished friends upon their determination 
to carry the Message to those numerous and varied sections of 
the Indian population who have not received as yet the blessings 
which the knowledge of the Cause confers.  He is deeply grateful 
to them, and to those who have, whether directly or indirectly, 
assisted them in the pursuit of this truly noble aim.  
 
 
 
+P63 
     The Guardian wishes also to express his heartfelt thanks to 
the Indian N.S.A. for its splendid efforts for the extension of the 
teaching work throughout India.  The evidences of its warm and 
effective response to his earnest appeal for the inauguration of a 
new systematized and nation-wide teaching campaign in that 
country are indeed such as to give him fresh hopes concerning 
the future expansion and consolidation of the Faith not only in 
India and Burma but in the neighbouring regions where the 
light of the Teachings has not yet penetrated.  It is his sincere 
hope that the National Assembly will, faithful to its pledge, 
continue exerting its utmost for the furtherance of the cause of 
teaching in India, and particularly in Southern India and Ceylon 
where there are almost no centres at present.  Nothing short of 
the unity, self sacrifice and intelligent and systematized planning 
which the local and national assemblies and also the individual 
believers may show forth throughout the coming years can 
enable them to attain this vital teaching goal.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I hasten to assure you in person of my personal and intense 
     satisfaction and of my special and fervent prayers for these 
     two stalwart pioneers who have arisen to accomplish so 
     noble a task in such difficult circumstances.  The hosts of 
     the Abha Kingdom will assuredly guide and sustain them, 
     and will, if they persevere, crown their high endeavours with 
     success.  May their example be followed by an increasingly 
     large number of their fellow workers.

Inflexible Determination Required 
 
     Now, that the teaching work is making a steady headway, 
the friends should be on their guard lest they lose the opportunity 
they have of spreading the Message in every corner 
throughout India and Burma.  
     In this connection, he feels, he must congratulate most 
warmly the members of the N.S.A. for the valuable steps they 
have taken for the introduction of the Cause in central and 
southern India. 
 
 
 
+P64 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The progress of the teaching activities initiated by your 
     Assembly is highly gratifying.  Inflexible determination is 
     required to carry it to a successful conclusion.  The methods 
     adopted by the American Baha'i community, the zeal, the 
     initiative, the efficiency, the fidelity with which they are prosecuting 
     their enterprise should be exemplified by individuals 
     and Assemblies in India and Burma.  The administrative 
     machinery which the American believers have erected and 
     perfected has already had its counterpart in the institutions 
     you have so nobly reared in recent years.  Your teaching 
     campaign, the supreme purpose for which this machinery 
     has been fashioned, should likewise be modelled according 
     to the plan which your sister community has devised and 
     is now developing so strenuously and successfully.  
 
November 7, 1936 
 
 
Welcome Extended to Mr. Schopflocher 
 
     He wishes me now to express in particular to you, and to 
your distinguished fellow-members in the Indian N.S.A., his 
most loving appreciation and thanks for the cordial welcome 
you have extended to our dearly-beloved friend, Mr. Siegfried 
Schopflocher, during his visit to India and Burma.  He is confident 
that the steps you have taken to render his trip successful 
will greatly help in giving the Faith a wide and long-needed 
publicity.  The opportunity that has been offered you has been 
truly splendid, and you certainly deserve to be heartily congratulated 
for having fully availed yourselves of it.  May the Beloved 
reward you a thousand-fold for your ceaseless and 
devoted endeavours in His Path.  
 
January 7, 1937 
 
 
Theosophists 
 
     With regard to the Theosophists and their activities; 
although they obviously try to copy and claim as their own 
some of the principles of the Cause, yet the Guardian feels that 
it would be of no advantage to oppose them and to refute their 
 
 
 
+P65 
arguments.  The best attitude for the friends to adopt in such 
cases at the present time is to totally disregard and even neglect 
their opponents.  This has invariably been his advice to the 
friends, whether in the East or in the West.  
 
 
Baha'i Holidays 
 
     Regarding the sale of tea and other refreshments in a cinema 
under non-Baha'i ownership; those friends who have hired 
from the owner of the cinema a stall for the sale of such refreshments 
should make every effort to obtain permission to close on 
Baha'i holidays.  In case, however, the non-Baha'i owner or 
partner refuses to grant their request their only alternative is to 
obey.  
     The case is different with a bread bakery owned by a believer.  
In this case there can be no excuse whatever why the 
shop should not be closed during Baha'i holidays, as there are 
always non-Baha'i bakers from whom the public can buy.  
 

Baha'i Administration 
 
     Concerning the LSA's right to suspend one of its members 
from Assembly membership; the Assembly can, by a majority 
vote, take such an action, even though the suspension may be 
for a long period.  
     As regards your question whether the President of the N.S.A. 
is entitled to give any ruling during the period of his tenure; the 
Guardian wishes me to state that no such ruling can be valid 
unless approved by the other members of the National Assembly.  
The President has no special legislative capacity, except as a 
member of the Assembly.  
     As to the question of removing a believer from the voting 
list; although every duly constituted local Assembly has the 
right to take such an action against any individual believer in 
 
 
 
+P66 
the community, nevertheless the Guardian feels the advisability 
for the Local Assemblies to seek the advice and approval of the 
N.S.A. in this most delicate and vital matter, as it is one fraught 
with grave and far-reaching responsibilities.  
     Before closing I wish to express to you, and through you to 
your fellow-members in the N.S.A., how happy the Guardian 
feels to learn of the strong preparations your Assembly has 
made for the holding of the next Annual Convention of the 
friends in Karachi.  He is the more rejoiced that the main item 
of the discussions will be the problem of teaching.  He is fervently 
praying that the program upon which the delegates and 
the N.S.A. will decide will mark the inauguration of an unprecedented 
teaching campaign throughout India and Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am delighted to learn of the work which is being steadily 
     and efficiently accomplished in so many spheres of Baha'i 
     activity throughout India and Burma.  My heart is filled 
     with gratitude as I witness the progress you have achieved, 
     the enterprises you have initiated, the method and measures 
     you have adopted, the plans you have conceived and above 
     all the spirit of exemplary loyalty and magnificent devotion 
     that impels you forward in the great mission you are destined 
     to fulfil.  
 
February 28, 1937 
 
 
Obligatory Prayers 
 
     ...concerning the three daily obligatory prayers.  The 
friends are free to choose any one of these three prayers, but 
have to follow the instructions revealed by Baha'u'llah concerning 
them.  The long prayer should be recited once in every 
24 hours, and is accompanied by certain physical acts.  The 
short prayer, consisting of one verse, should be recited once a 
day at noon; while the medium prayer should be said three 
times a day:  in the morning, at noon and in the evening.  The 
believer is entirely free to choose any one of these three prayers 
for daily use.  
 
 
 
+P67 
     While praying it would be better to turn one's thoughts to 
the Manifestation as He continues, in the other world, to be our 
means of contact with the Almighty.  We can, however, pray 
directly to God Himself.  
 
April 27, 1937 
 
 
Progress of Teaching Most Gratifying 
 
     The reports of the progress of the teaching work in India and 
Burma are most gratifying, and all indicate the high measure 
of devotion and zeal which the friends are putting at the service 
of this most noble and sacred task.  Dr. Ali of Rangoon is specially 
active working through the press, and has already succeeded 
in giving a very wide publicity to the Faith in many circles, both 
native and foreign.  He is certainly the most promising teacher 
we have in Rangoon, and the N.S.A. would do well to encourage 
him, and to give him every possible assistance with the view 
of further extending the scope of his teaching activities throughout 
Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am so glad ... of the progress of the teaching work in 
     India and Burma.  I pray that Martha's forthcoming visit 
     to your shores may greatly stimulate the splendid work 
     which has been so nobly initiated and is being so painstakingly 
     continued.  
 
July 12, 1937 
 
 
National Fund 
 
     I wish, in particular, to express his gratification at the success 
that has attended your annual Convention this year, and at the 
recommendations and decisions taken by the N.S.A. with the 
view of intensifying the teaching campaign throughout India 
and Burma.  He would strongly urge your Assembly to maintain 
the standard of the teaching work, and to appeal to the 
friends to rise up to the call of the hour, and to be ready to 
undergo any sacrifice that their sacred task requires.  
 
 
 
+P68 
     Above all he wishes through you to reiterate his wish, 
already expressed in his recent cable to the N.S.A., that the 
National Fund, which undoubtedly constitutes the bedrock 
upon which all the activities of the Cause ultimately rest, should 
receive the continued and whole-hearted support of all the 
believers.  Both the local Assemblies and the individual believers 
should realize that unless they contribute regularly and 
generously to that Fund the progress of the Faith in India and 
Burma will not only be considerably retarded, but will inevitably 
come to a standstill.  There should be a continual flow of 
funds to the National treasury of the N.S.A., if that body 
wishes to properly administer the manifold and ever-increasing 
activities of the Faith.  Every Baha'i no matter how poor, must 
realize what a grave responsibility he has to shoulder in this 
connection, and should have confidence that his spiritual progress 
as a believer in the World Order of Baha'u'llah will largely 
depend upon the measure in which he proves, in deeds, his 
readiness to support materially the divine institutions of His 
Faith.  
     With reference to your question in connection with the 
observance of Baha'i Holy Days; the Baha'i day begins and ends 
at sunset.  The night preceding a Holy day is therefore included 
in the day, and consequently work during that period is 
forbidden.  
     The Guardian is most delighted to hear of the activities 
initiated recently by various local Assemblies in India, and 
wishes you to convey to these dear friends, and particularly to 
Prof. Abdu'l-Aziz of Hyderabad and the members of his teaching 
group, the expression of his keenest appreciation of their 
labours for the spread of the Cause.  He would urge them each 
and all to lend every effort to assist your N.S.A. in its nation-wide 
teaching endeavours, and is most ardently praying that 
they may be assisted and guided by the confirmations from on 
high.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am deeply touched by the varied and compelling evidences 
     of the vigour and loyalty which characterize the National 
     Assembly's conduct of Baha'i affairs in both India and 
 

  
+P69 
     Burma.  The Cause, as a result of their self-sacrificing 
     endeavours and inflexible resolve, is being firmly consolidated 
     and widely propagated in those regions.  Perseverance 
     will enable you to attain your goal and to lay an unassailable 
     foundation for your future work in both the teaching 
     and administrative spheres of Baha'i service.  I will 
     continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.  
 
July 17, 1937 
 
 
Martha Root's Teaching Trip 
 
     Shoghi Effendi has been most pleased to receive your letter 
of October 25th and to learn of the very warm reception you 
have accorded Miss Martha L. Root upon her arrival in 
India.  He has every reason to hope that with the program the 
N.S.A. has so carefully arranged for her she will be able to do 
an extensive teaching work, and to contact as many classes and 
sections of the population as her time and energies permit.  
     The Guardian would call upon you specially to make every 
effort possible to render Miss Root's teaching trip successful 
in every way, and wishes you to continually urge the friends 
to make her visit an occasion for giving the Faith a widespread 
publicity throughout India and Burma.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am so glad to hear of the plans that have been conceived 
     and the activity that is being displayed by the friends in 
     connexion with dear Martha's visit to India.  
 
November 7, 1937 
 
 
     He was particularly delighted to know of the warm hospitality 
and wholehearted assistance which the friends have so 
kindly extended to dear Miss Root all through her travels 
throughout India and Burma.  
     This truly memorable visit of Miss Root to the friends in 
that vast continent is indeed a God-sent opportunity, of which 
the believers should fully avail themselves in order to give the 
 
 
 
+P70 
Faith the widest possible publicity, and also to attract to it the 
attention and sympathy of responsible leaders throughout India 
and Burma.  
     The Guardian will continue to pray that at the termination 
of this year the results of this historic teaching trip undertaken 
by our beloved Miss Root may prove to be such as to ensure 
for many years to come the uninterrupted extension of the 
teaching work in all parts of India.  
 
March 20, 1938 
 
 
Resting Place of Holy Mother 
 
     It will surely please and interest the believers to know that 
the Holy Mother's remains have been laid to rest in a spot 
in the vicinity of, and overshadowed by the resting-place of the 
Greatest Holy Leaf on Mt. Carmel.  
 
 
L.S.A. [&amp;and] Summer School in Simla 
 
     The Guardian was delighted to hear of the formation of a 
Spiritual Assembly in Simla, and wishes that body to apply 
soon for official registration.  He would very much appreciate 
receiving two copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the 
Assembly, as soon as they are obtained from the authorities.  
     The news of the projected holding of the first Indian Baha'i 
Summer School in Simla has also considerably rejoiced the 
heart of our beloved Guardian.  He will pray that this excellent 
and indeed historic project may be satisfactorily carried out, 
and receive the whole-hearted, generous and sustained support 
of the entire body of the believers throughout India and Burma.  
 
 
Six-Year Plan 
 
     The Six-Year Plan which your N.S.A. has resolved to 
 
 
 
+P71 
initiate with the purpose of furthering the teaching work has 
met with the full approval of the Guardian.  He wishes your 
Assembly every success in this remarkable and nation-wide 
undertaking which you have decided to launch.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          Your letter of June 19, enclosing reports of great interest 
     and value, has also reached me and I am filled with a sense 
     of happiness and gratitude for these incessant evidences of 
     your zeal and united endeavours.  I am truly impressed by 
     the sound progress and expansion of the activities in which 
     the believers of India and Burma are so earnestly and 
     devotedly engaged.  The institutions you have recently 
     initiated, the plan of teaching you have launched, the degree 
     of unity, of consecration and solidarity you have attained, 
     the measures for internal consolidation you have devised, 
     the support you have consistently and cordially extended 
     to our dear Martha, all proclaim the depth of your devotion 
     and attest the nobility and staunchness of your faith.  The 
     utmost care is now required to nurse, foster, multiply and 
     coordinate these nascent institutions and activities.  Every 
     nerve should be strained, every sacrifice should be made to 
     enable them to fructify and prosper.  
 
July 4, 1938 
 
 
First Indian Baha'i Summer School 
 
     I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge 
with thanks the receipt of your communication dated October 
17th, together with the enclosed report on the first Indian 
Baha'i Summer School held in Simla during last September.  
     And as to the photographs of the Summer School you had 
submitted under separate cover, these will be placed in the 
Mansion of Baha'u'llah at Bahji, and will also appear in the 
"Baha'i World" Vol. VIII.  
     The Guardian wishes me in this connection to express his 
profound satisfaction at the success that has attended the 
N.S.A.'s efforts for the formation of this first Baha'i Summer 
School in India--a step which, he strongly feels, is bound to 
 
 
 
+P72 
accelerate the extension of the teaching activities of the believers 
in that land.  
     He is truly delighted to know that the attendance at the school 
has been satisfactory, and that the young believers, in particular, 
have been most enthusiastic about it.  What he feels now is 
most essential for the N.S.A. is to make arrangements to have 
this school held regularly every year, so that it may develop 
into an effective, and increasingly vital, instrument for the 
propagation of the Faith, and also for the education and training 
of Baha'i teachers.  
     It is the Guardian's fervent hope that as this Institution 
expands, and fulfils the high hopes you all set upon it, it will 
be felt advisable by the N.S.A. to consider the possibilities of 
establishing, in due time, one or two more of such schools, 
thus permitting those friends, who in view of their limited means 
are not in a position to travel over large distances, to avail 
themselves of the benefits derived from these nascent Baha'i 
institutions of learning.  
 
 
Task Immense--Time Short 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The Six-Year Plan, initiated by the National Assembly of 
     India and Burma with such spontaneous devotion, admirable 
     zeal and unflinching resolve, marks a milestone on the road 
     of progress trodden by them and their fellow-workers in both 
     of those countries.  The task is immense, the time is short, the 
     hour critical but the faith that animates and sustains them is 
     strong enough to surmount all obstacles, however formidable, 
     that may stand in their way.  That they may persevere, 
     redouble their efforts and win signal success in their mighty 
     enterprise is the dearest wish of my heart and the object of 
     my constant and earnest prayers.  
 
December 1, 1938 
 
 
Splendid Work Accomplished by Miss Root 
 
     The Guardian was most pleased to receive your letter of the 
3rd inst. and has noted with genuine satisfaction the farewell 
meeting which the N.S.A. had arranged in Bombay in honour 
 
 
 
+P73 
of our indefatigable and distinguished Baha'i sister Miss Martha 
L. Root on the occasion of her departure to Australia.  
     The feelings of unbounded joy with which you all unanimously 
acclaimed her arrival in India, and the expressions of 
deep and sorrowful regret which your National Assembly, as 
the official mouthpiece of all the Indian and Burmese believers, 
had been moved to convey to her upon her leaving your shores, 
all attest the high value which the friends have attached to her 
presence in India and the splendid work accomplished by her 
throughout her travels in that country.  The cooperation she 
had received from the Assemblies and individual believers in 
every centre she visited, and the effective support, both moral 
and material, so lovingly and continually extended to her by the 
N.S.A. in the execution of her teaching plans, have contributed 
to a marked degree to the success of her journey, which 
has been indeed the longest and most fruitful she had ever 
undertaken to your shores.  
     The Guardian hopes that the friends, and in particular the 
N.S.A., will now endeavour to follow up, with united and unflinching 
resolve, the splendid work accomplished by Miss Root.  
The contacts she has formed with leading personalities in social, 
religious and university circles should be maintained, nay 
extended and consolidated, and every effort exerted in order to 
speed up the progress of the teaching work which has received 
such a fresh impetus as a result of her uninterrupted teaching 
activity during this past year.  
 
January 25, 1939 
 
 
     He has noted with profound appreciation, in particular, the 
account of the farewell meeting held in Bombay under the 
auspices of your Assembly on the occasion of the departure of 
our indefatigable and highly esteemed Baha'i sister Miss Martha 
Root from India.  No more eloquent tribute could have been 
paid indeed to the historic work accomplished by that well-beloved 
star-servant of the Cause during her stay of one full 
year in that country than that beautiful and impressive gathering 
which had met to bid her a last farewell upon her leaving your 
 
 
 
+P74 
shores.  The warmth and spontaneity of your love must have 
profoundly impressed and moved her heart, and given her an 
added proof of the unbounded gratitude which you all surely 
cherish for her, after these many months of ceaseless teaching 
activity she has spent in your midst.  
     The Guardian wishes to express his own gratitude to the 
members of the N.S.A., and through them to the community of 
believers throughout India and Burma for the hospitality and 
loving assistance you have all, individually as well as collectively, 
continually extended to Miss Root all through her stay in 
your country.  The essential now, he feels, is for each one 
of the friends, and particularly the local Assemblies, to arise 
and with unflinching resolve to endeavour to follow up the 
splendid work she has so ably, yet so unostentatiously, accomplished.  
They would be certainly failing in their debt of gratitude 
to her, if they allow the seeds she has faithfully and 
painstakingly scattered, during these months of arduous and 
uninterrupted effort, to get lost.  Rather, they should spare no 
effort to water these seeds and enable them to germinate and 
yield in due time most abundant and lasting results.  
 
 
Baha'i Youth Groups 
 
     With regard to the formation of Baha'i Youth groups; the 
Guardian is most pleased to hear of the satisfactory progress 
that has been accomplished along this line, and of the extensive 
programme you have arranged for the development of Baha'i 
Youth activity during the coming year.  He wishes me to 
express, in particular, his appreciation of the very warm 
response made by six of these youth groups to the suggestion 
of the National Youth Committee of America regarding the 
holding of special youth meetings on the 26th of this month.  
He wishes you to assure them of his special prayers for the success 
and confirmation of their efforts.  
 
 
 
+P75 
Six-Year Plan--Spontaneous Undertaking of 
Indian Baha'i Community 
 
     In connection with the Six-Year Plan initiated by your 
N.S.A.; the Guardian cannot too highly praise this undertaking 
of unprecedented magnitude which your Assembly has resolved 
to carry out.  One year has already elapsed since that Plan was 
first launched, and the task that will have to be accomplished 
during the remaining five years is indeed immense, and calls for 
no less than a combined and tremendous sacrificial effort by 
every Assembly, group and individual believer throughout India 
and Burma.  
     But the friends should derive much encouragement at the 
realization that their efforts for the prosecution of this Plan are, 
in a way, far more meritorious than those which their fellow-believers 
in the American Continent are exerting in connection 
with the Seven-Year Plan of the American N.S.A.  
     Whereas this latter Plan, which, it should be fairly admitted, 
is the largest enterprise of its kind ever undertaken by any 
national Baha'i Community, has been conceived and formulated 
directly by the Guardian himself, the Six-Year Plan adopted 
by the Indian N.S.A. has been initiated solely through the efforts 
of the elected body of the national representatives of the Indian 
and Burmese believers, and represents therefore the spontaneous 
undertaking of the Indian Baha'i Community itself, and as such 
is endowed with a special merit and a unique spiritual potency.  
When successfully completed this Plan will constitute indeed an 
abiding monument to the resourceful energy, the unstinted 
devotion, and the unquenchable enthusiasm of the Indian Baha'is, 
from which future generations of believers in that land will derive 
endless inspiration and guidance.  
     In view of the paramount importance of this Six-Year Plan, 
and the urgency which the friends must undoubtedly feel to 
carry it out as speedily and efficiently as possible during the 
remaining five years, the Guardian would advise that in the 
next Annual Convention meeting in Calcutta a special session 
be devoted to the findings and consideration by all the delegates 
 
 
 
+P76 
and friends present of such policies and means as, in their considered 
opinion, can best insure the speedy and timely completion 
of this glorious undertaking.  
     The Guardian would particularly suggest that special stress 
be laid on the necessity for pioneer teaching in those states and 
provinces in India and Burma, where the Cause has not yet been 
introduced.  Those believers who have the means, and also the 
capacity to teach, should be encouraged, no matter how great 
the sacrifice involved, to settle in these virgin territories, until 
such time as a local assembly has been constituted, or at least 
a group of firm believers formed that can safely and gradually 
evolve into a firmly-organized and properly-functioning local 
assembly.  This policy of teaching by settlement which the 
Guardian has also advised and indeed urged the American 
believers to adopt has been proved by experience to be the most 
effective way of establishing the Faith in new territories, and he 
therefore confidently recommends it for adoption by your 
Assembly.  
 
 
Summer School 
 
     As regards the Indian Summer School; its importance, the 
Guardian feels, cannot be overstressed, specially in view of its 
recognized teaching value, both as a centre for the training of 
Baha'i teachers, and also for the attraction of outsiders to the 
Cause.  The wide popularity which this newly-established yet 
highly-promising institution is already enjoying, truly attests its 
high value as one of those vital institutions of the Faith in this 
formative age of its development.  
 
 
David 
 
     ...The David referred to by the Bab, and stated by Him 
to have preceded Moses, is not the same one as King David, 
the father of King Solomon, who lived in the tenth century 
B.C. and who obviously lived many years, and indeed many 
 
 
 
+P77 
centuries after Moses.  Abdu'l-Baha has explained this in a 
Tablet.  
 
 
Inheritance 
 
     ...Although in the "Questions [&amp;and] Answers" Baha'u'llah 
has specifically stated that non-Baha'is have no right to inherit 
from their Baha'i parents or relatives, yet this restriction applies 
only to such cases when a Baha'i dies without leaving a will and 
when, therefore, his property will have to be divided in accordance 
with the rules set forth in the Aqdas.  Otherwise, a Baha'i 
is free to bequeath his property to any person, irrespective of 
religion, provided however he leaves a will, specifying his wishes.  
As you see therefore it is always possible for a Baha'i to provide 
for his non-Baha'i wife, children or relatives by leaving a will.  
And it is only fair that he should do so.  
 
 
Reason of Severe Laws Revealed by the Bab 
 
     ...The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Bab can 
be properly appreciated and understood only when interpreted 
in the light of His own statements regarding the nature, purpose 
and character of His own Dispensation.  As these statements 
clearly reveal, the Babi Dispensation was essentially in the 
nature of a religious and indeed social revolution, and its duration 
had therefore to be short, but full of tragic events, of 
sweeping and drastic reforms.  These drastic measures enforced 
by the Bab and His followers were taken with the view of undermining 
the very foundations of Shi'ah orthodoxy, and thus paving 
the way for the coming of Baha'u'llah.  To assert the 
independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare also the 
ground for the approaching Revelation of Baha'u'llah the Bab 
had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most of 
them, were never enforced.  But the mere fact that He revealed 
them was in itself a proof of the independent character of His 
Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation, 
 
 
 
+P78 
and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that 
led them to cause His eventual martyrdom.  
     The Bab specified that the "Bayan" is not completed and 
that "He Whom God would manifest" (Baha'u'llah) would 
complete it, though not in its actual form, but only spiritually 
in the form of another book.  The "Iqan" is believed to be its 
continuation.  
 
February 17, 1939 
 
 
Teaching--The Paramount Task 
 
     He is truly delighted to know that your Annual Convention 
this year has been most united, and highly constructive and 
fruitful in its result, and trusts that the important discussions 
and deliberations held by the delegates at various Convention 
sessions will have the result of stimulating afresh the progressive 
and systematic penetration of the teaching work throughout 
India and Burma.  The Six-Year Plan of teaching inaugurated last 
year by your N.S.A., the Guardian feels, however, cannot succeed 
unless it receives the continued moral and material support of 
the entire body of the Indian and Burmese believers, and it is 
this fact which the National Assembly should continually endeavour 
to impress upon them all, through frequent appeals 
destined at once to encourage and provide the facilities required 
for all those friends who are qualified to work in the field of 
pioneer teaching.  The Guardian would particularly recommend 
that the N.S.A. should make every possible effort to open up to 
the Cause those Indian provinces which still remain deprived of 
the light of the Teachings, and to this end would suggest that 
those believers who can arrange to settle in those virgin territories 
should at once be urged to do so, and the necessary 
facilities extended to them by the N.S.A., with the view of 
enabling them to prolong their stay until some definite results 
are accomplished.  Also, he feels, your Assembly should endeavour 
to strengthen the weak areas which have been recently 
opened, and also launch a wide and systematic campaign for 
the dissemination of Baha'i literature throughout the whole 
country.  
 
 
 
+P79 
Membership in Baha'i Assembly or Committee 
is a Sacred Obligation 
 
     ...The Guardian wishes you to make clear to all the 
believers that membership in a Baha'i Assembly or Committee is 
a sacred obligation which should be gladly and confidently 
accepted by every loyal and conscientious member of the Community, 
no matter how humble and inexperienced.  Once elected 
to serve in a given Assembly a believer's duty is to do his utmost 
to attend all Assembly meetings, and cooperate with his fellow-members, 
unless, however, he is prevented from doing so by 
some major reason such as illness, and even then he should 
notify the Assembly to this effect.  The N.S.A.'s duty is to 
urge, and also facilitate attendance at assembly meetings.  If 
a member has no valid reason to justify his repeated absence 
from assembly meetings, he should be advised, and even warned, 
and if such warning is deliberately ignored by him, 
the assembly will then have the right to suspend his rights as a 
voting member of the Community.  Such administrative sanction 
would seem to be absolutely imperative and necessary, and while 
not tantamount to a complete expulsion of such a member from 
the Cause, deprives him of any real participation in its administrative 
functions and affairs, and is thus a most effective corrective 
measure which the Assembly can use against all such half-hearted 
and irresponsible individuals in the Community.  
 
 
Meaning of Resurrection 
 
     ...Concerning the meaning of "Resurrection":  although 
this term is often used by Baha'u'llah in His Writings, as in the 
passage quoted in your letter, its meaning is figurative.  The 
tomb mentioned is also allegorical, i.e. the tomb of unbelief.  
The Day of Resurrection, according to Baha'i interpretation, is 
the Judgement Day, the Day when unbelievers will be called 
upon to give account of their actions, and whether the world 
has prevented them from acknowledging the new Revelation.  
     The passage in Baha'u'llah's Tablet in which He explains the 
 
 
 
+P80 
Sura of "The Sun" should not be interpreted literally.  It does 
not mean that after the Day of Resurrection praise and peace 
will cease to be vouchsafed to the Prophet.  Rather it means to 
the end of time, i.e. indefinitely and for all times.  
     The intercession spoken of by Baha'u'llah in one of His 
prayers which you have quoted is a purely spiritual act and is 
applicable to Muhammad as well as to all Prophets.  This passage, 
however, refers more particularly to that kind of intercession 
in which Muslims believe, though the manner and circumstances 
of it, according to Baha'i belief, are mysterious and 
unknowable.  
 
 
Teaching--The Paramount Task 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I long to hear of the progress of your teaching work in 
     those areas and provinces where the light of the Faith has 
     not as yet shone forth.  Teaching is the paramount task that 
     urgently demands the concentrated attention and the complete 
     consecration of the united and persistent efforts of the 
     believers of India and Burma at the present stage of the Six-Year 
     Plan which they of their own accord have so magnificently 
     initiated.  No dissipation of efforts, no delay in the 
     initiation and execution of the necessary measures for its 
     success should be allowed.  All assemblies, all committees 
     and individuals should regard the teaching work as the most 
     essential factor in the discharge of their obligations to the 
     Faith of Baha'u'llah, and as the supreme purpose of the 
     machinery of the Administrative Order which they have 
     lately so laboriously and faithfully erected.  I will from all 
     my heart pray that the high aim they pursue may be reached, 
     that their hopes may be fulfilled, and that their individual 
     and corporate lives may equally reflect the noble principles 
     that animate their Cause.

Martha Root's Arrival in Bombay 
 
     Your joint and welcome message of October 18th written on 
the occasion of our beloved sister Miss Martha Root's arrival 
 
 
 
+P81 
in Bombay has duly reached the Guardian and his heart is 
filled with gratitude to you for the very warm and befitting 
welcome you have so kindly extended to that well-beloved star-servant 
of the Cause.  This is truly in keeping with the tradition 
of warm hospitality for which our Indian believers have already 
won such a high reputation.  The cordiality you have shown 
this distinguished international teacher on her previous visits to 
India could have hardly been surpassed, and there is every 
reason to believe, therefore, that on this trip, which will be 
probably the most extended one she has ever been able to 
undertake throughout that continent, she will be the object of 
the same devotion and love manifested towards her on previous 
occasions.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          May the Almighty bless you for the magnificent welcome 
     accorded to such an outstanding champion of the Cause, 
     and may He enable you, in conjunction with her, to lend a 
     mighty impetus to the progress of the Faith and the extension 
     of its institutions.  
 
November 4, 1939 
 
 
Paramount Task Facing the Believers 
 
     What you had written him regarding the various steps taken 
by the N.S.A. to further the Six-Year Plan of Teaching has 
immeasurably rejoiced his heart, and he too joins with your 
Assembly in humbly supplicating Baha'u'llah to vouchsafe to 
all those dear friends who have offered to undertake pioneer 
teaching in various parts of India such measure of His guidance 
and blessings as would enable them to effectively further the 
interests of this Plan.  He would urge you all to persevere in 
your self-sacrificing exertions, and, notwithstanding the various 
handicaps under which you may be compelled to labour, to 
confidently strive to achieve this high teaching objective.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The energetic prosecution of the Six-Year Plan, despite the 
     perils, the uncertainties and gravity of the present hour, is the 
     paramount task facing the believers of India and Burma.  All 
     projects and activities, however desirable and urgent, must 
 
 
 
+P82 
     henceforth be subordinated to this most pressing and vital 
     issue, inasmuch as it is the fountain-head from which all 
     future blessings will flow and the one and only instrument 
     which can at the present time, most effectively establish and 
     consolidate the administrative order of the Faith throughout 
     the Indian Peninsula.  My prayers for your signal success 
     in such a mighty and glorious enterprise will continue to be 
     offered, with increasing fervour, at the Threshold of Baha'u'llah.  
     Persevere and be confident.  
 
November 26, 1939 
 
 
Passing Away of Dearest Martha 
 
     Your very kind message ... expressing your profound sorrow 
and sympathy at the passing away of our beloved sister 
Miss Martha Root has just reached our dear Guardian, and he 
feels indeed most deeply touched by the very thoughtful words 
which you had been moved to convey to him.  The loss which 
the entire Baha'i world has come to sustain through her untimely 
departure from this world is indeed enormous, and can be 
compensated only partially by the self-sacrificing efforts which 
our dear Baha'i teachers in East and West are now exerting in 
their respective fields of teaching.  
     The Guardian's hope, however, is that, spurred by the noble 
example of Martha's life and character, the friends in every land 
will make a supreme and united effort to carry onward the 
great teaching task which she had so untiringly been endeavouring 
to accomplish during all these years, and thus bring eternal 
joy and impart infinite hope and solace to her heart in the other 
world.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I deeply appreciate, and am greatly touched by, the noble 
     sentiments you have expressed.  The passing of dearest 
     Martha, that distinguished hero of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, 
     is indeed a great loss to those who labour for His Cause, 
     both in the East and West.  May her glorious example 
 
 
 
+P83 
     continue to inspire the friends in India and Burma to tread in 
     her footsteps, and to extend the work she so nobly initiated.  
 
December 8, 1939 
 
 
Sacred Task 
 
     It greatly pleased and encouraged him to know that the 
Annual Convention held this year in Poona has proved such a 
high success, and that the important decisions taken by the 
delegates with the view of intensifying the teaching campaign 
in India and Burma are being effectively implemented by the 
offer made by so many of the friends to teach and travel in 
virgin territories.  He wishes these dear believers, who have so 
heroically responded to the call of the hour, every blessing and 
success in their respective fields of teaching, and will pray most 
earnestly for the confirmation of their labours in the pursuit of 
their high and sacred task.  
 
May 14, 1940 
 
 
Steady Extension of the Teaching Campaign 
 
     The slow yet steady extension of the teaching campaign 
throughout India is a matter which greatly rejoices his heart, 
and for which he feels moved to convey his warmest congratulations 
to the N.S.A.  Considering the well-nigh insufferable 
obstacles in your way, and the difficult conditions created by 
the war, the progress so far achieved, though small, has been 
remarkable in many ways, and augurs well for the future of the 
Six-Year Plan which your Assembly is so energetically carrying 
out.  
     The signal success which the able and untiring efforts 
of Mr. [&amp;and] Mrs. Bakhtiari, Mr. M. H. Ilmi ... have 
won for the Cause in Kashmir deserves particular mention; 
and it is to be hoped that the group already established in 
that center will steadily develop and soon attain the status of a 
 
 
 
+P84 
Spiritual Assembly.  To these dear teachers who have so successfully 
accomplished such high teaching mission, as well as to our 
new Baha'i brother Moulvi Abdullah of Kashmir who, notwithstanding 
the violent opposition and criticisms of the Qadianis 
has firmly stood by the Cause, the Guardian wishes you to 
convey his warmest appreciation and gratitude.  
 
 
Financial Assistance to Baha'i Teachers 
 
     In connection with your teaching campaign, the Guardian 
wishes you to inform the N.S.A. that although there exists in 
the Cause no such institution as that of paid teachers, the N.S.A. 
nevertheless should, in view of the urgent and pressing requirements 
of the Six-Year Plan, extend, though only temporarily, any 
financial assistance in its power to those believers who offer to 
undertake pioneer work throughout India and Burma.  Also, 
those believers who are not themselves able to offer their services 
as pioneers, and who wish to directly and effectively participate 
in the campaign of teaching can instead offer to defray, 
through the National Fund, the expenses of any believer they 
choose to deputize for that purpose.  Such deputy teachers, however, 
should for all other purposes be responsible to the N.S.A. 
and the teaching bodies concerned.  
 
 
Great Message Can Redeem Bewildered 
Humanity 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I regret that owing to present circumstances arising from 
     the war and its grave repercussions, the activities, particularly 
     in the teaching field, connected with the Six-Year Plan, so 
     spontaneously initiated by your Assembly, have had to be 
     curtailed.  I wish to appeal, however, to all its members, and 
     through them to the general body of the devoted friends in 
 
 
 
+P85 
     India and Burma to make a united and supreme endeavour 
     to overcome, while there is yet time, the obstacles that stand 
     in their way, and to refuse to allow the perils, the uncertainties 
     and anxieties that face and afflict their country to deter 
     them from carrying out the original plan they have so nobly 
     conceived.  Let them remember that a firm resolution on 
     their part, an absolute rededication of their resources, and an 
     actual attempt to translate into action their meritorious 
     intentions, coupled with perseverance in the discharge of 
     their duties, would suffice to ensure the success of the mission 
     to which they are now committed.  The time is indeed ripe, 
     and the minds and hearts of the suffering multitudes are 
     being mysteriously prepared for the Great Message that can 
     alone redeem, exalt and regenerate a sore-tried and bewildered 
     humanity.  I will specially and fervently pray for the 
     success of any and every effort the dearly-beloved friends in 
     India and Burma may arise to exert.  
 
November 28, 1940 
 
 
Translation of Baha'u'llah's Writings 
 
     Regarding his instruction to the N.S.A. of Iran to the effect 
that Baha'u'llah's writings in Arabic should not be translated 
into Persian; this applies to the translation of the revealed 
words into Persian only.  Your Assembly, therefore, may proceed 
with its plan for the rendering of the Tablet of Ahmad, 
the three daily obligatory prayers and other Tablets, into Urdu.  
 
                             . . . . 
 
     With reference to ... question whether it is permissible for 
the Baha'is to see pictures; there is nothing in the Teachings 
that would forbid such a practice.  
 
 
 
+P86 
                             . . . . 
 
     Also with regard to the practice of circumcision; the Teachings 
bear no reference to this matter, and it is therefore not 
enjoined upon the believers.  
 
 
Training of Children 
 
     The question of the training and education of children in 
case one of the parents is a non-Baha'i is one which solely concerns 
the parents themselves, who should decide about it the 
way they find best and most conducive to the maintenance of 
the unity of their family, and to the future welfare of their 
children.  Once the child comes of age, however, he should be 
given full freedom to choose his religion, irrespective of the 
wishes and desires of his parents.  
 
 
Membership of the International House of 
Justice 
 
     As regards the membership of the International House of 
Justice, Abdu'l-Baha states in a Tablet that it is confined to 
men, and that the wisdom of it will be revealed as manifest as 
the sun in the future.  In any case the believers should know 
that, as Abdu'l-Baha Himself has explicitly stated that sexes are 
equal except in some cases, the exclusion of women from the 
International House of Justice, should not be surprising.  From 
the fact that there is no equality of functions between the sexes 
one should not, however, infer that either sex is inherently 
superior or inferior to the other, or that they are unequal in 
their rights.  
 
 
Appearance of two Davids 
 
     Concerning the appearance of two Davids; there is a Tablet 
 
 
 
+P87 
from Abdu'l-Baha in which He says that just as there have been 
two Ishmaels, one the son of Abraham, and the other one of the 
Prophets of Israel, there have appeared two Davids, one the 
author of the Psalms and father of Solomon, and the other before 
Moses.  
 
 
Importance of the Teaching Campaign 
 
     The Guardian wishes me once again to stress the all-importance 
of the teaching campaign throughout India and Burma.  
Much as he is aware of the obstacles that stand in the way of 
the expansion of pioneer teaching--obstacles which your sister 
Assembly in the U.S.A. are far in a better position to overcome, 
owing to the larger resources at their disposal and to their longer 
and wider experience in matters of teaching--he nevertheless 
strongly feels that, through the united, determined and passionate 
resolve of your N.S.A., of all the local Assemblies, 
groups and individuals, much can be accomplished in that 
direction, and firm foundations laid down for future expansion 
and consolidation.  The greater your handicaps the firmer your 
determination should wax, and the more abundant will assuredly 
be the blessings and confirmations of Baha'u'llah.  May His 
love and guidance lead you and our dearly-beloved friends 
in that land to still greater heights of selfless accomplishment in 
His path, and thereby crown with success the Six-Year Plan so 
ably devised and so energetically pursued by the N.S.A.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I wish to reassure you in person of my fervent and continued 
     prayers for the protection, the success and the spiritual 
     advancement of the community of the Indian and Burmese 
     believers who, under your direction, and stimulated by the 
     initiative and example, of their national elected representatives, 
     are arising, in these days of widespread confusion, 
     turmoil and danger, to carry out the Plan they are pledged 
     to fulfil.  No sacrifice can be regarded as too great for the 
     attainment of so great and splendid an objective.  They 
     should persevere in their task, undaunted by the rising tide 
 
 
 
+P88 
     of calamity and despair which afflicts the world, and which 
     is mysteriously paving the way for its unification and ultimate 
     redemption.  May the Beloved guide every step you take, 
     and bless every endeavour you exert in His path.  
 
December 14, 1940 
 
 
Greatest Need of the Hour 
 
     Whenever the Guardian receives news of the spread of the 
Cause it brings him fresh hope and helps to lighten his heavy 
burden.  This is the greatest need of the present hour in India; 
more teachers in new fields!  His prayers are always being 
offered for the advancement of this all-important work and the 
fulfilment of the Six-Year Teaching Plan.  
 
April 19, 1941 
 
 
Priceless Days 
 
     He was very happy to note the spirit of true and profound 
dedication to their holy task of spreading the Faith in India 
and Burma which the members of the N.S.A. manifest, and 
he feels sure that, if they exert the utmost effort, they will, 
through the confirmations of Baha'u'llah, succeed in fulfilling 
what is required of them under the Six-Year Plan.  
     He regrets very much that circumstances have prevented any 
active furtherance of the teaching work during the past Baha'i 
year.  Because of this the Guardian felt impelled, after reading 
your Assembly's letter, to transmit by cable the sum of two 
hundred pounds sterling to be set aside by your Assembly as 
the nucleus of a special fund to be established for the specific 
purpose of furthering the all-India teaching campaign of the 
Six-Year Plan.  He trusts that this will stimulate the body of 
 
 
 
+P89 
Indian and Burmese Baha'is to also contribute to this fund 
generously and by providing the necessary means to enable 
them to speedily fulfil the task they have vowed to carry out.  
     Concerning the methods to be adopted for the realization of 
your urgent task, Shoghi Effendi approves of the suggestion 
that some business firms open branches in new districts and 
thus provide Baha'i settlement by this means.  However, he 
feels that this will not be enough, and that all the Spiritual 
Assemblies, as well as each individual believer, should rally to 
this great opportunity which, indeed, may not again be presented 
to them, of spreading the Faith through the length and 
breadth of India while they are still in a position to do so.  The 
world is day by day becoming increasingly involved in this 
cataclysmic struggle, but so far the Baha'is of India, Australia, 
New Zealand and the American continents have not felt either 
the dangers or the restrictions imposed on less fortunate communities 
which find themselves either over-run and temporarily 
eclipsed, or in the actual theatre of war.  Therefore the believers 
of India should not allow these truly priceless days to slip 
by without exerting themselves to the utmost and sacrificing 
comfort, home, and money, to the great duty of giving the 
Divine Message to the people of their vast country.  
     Smallness of numbers, lack of skilled teachers, and modesty 
of means should not discourage or deter them.  They must 
remember the glorious history of the Cause, which, both in East 
and West, was established by dedicated souls who, for the most 
part, were neither rich, famous, nor well educated, but whose 
devotion, zeal and self-sacrifice overcame every obstacle and 
won miraculous victories for the Faith of God.  Such spiritual 
victories can now be won for India and Burma by the friends.  
Let them dedicate themselves--young and old, men and women 
alike--and go forth and settle in new districts, travel, and teach 
in spite of lack of experience, and be assured that Baha'u'llah 
has promised to aid all those who arise in His Name.  His 
strength will sustain them; their own weakness is unimportant.  
 
 
Refrain from Imposing New Rules 
 
     In reading your annual Convention report the Guardian has 
 
 
 
+P90 
noted the request made that the N.S.A. should lay down certain 
rules of procedure.  He has already informed the American 
N.S.A. that they should henceforth refrain from laying down 
any further rules and regulations, as these would tend to rigidify 
the affairs of the Cause and ultimately obscure its spirit and 
retard its growth.  He feels that your Assembly should exercise 
the same care, and avoid introducing any rules of procedure not 
already in existence.  Every case coming before the Assembly 
should be judged on its own merits, and be decided individually 
without any recourse to new rulings.  
     The Guardian will constantly pray for the success of all your 
undertakings, as well as for the welfare and progress of all the 
dear believers in India and Burma.  Particularly will he remember 
in his prayers the members of the National Assembly 
who are called upon to direct, coordinate, and carry out the 
Indian Baha'is' great and noble teaching enterprise.  
 
 
Prosecute Six-Year Plan With Unremitting 
Energy 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The Six-Year Plan, which you have so nobly conceived and 
     so enthusiastically initiated, must, during these crucial years, 
     when the first century of the Baha'i Era is drawing to a 
     close, be prosecuted with unremitting energy, and unshaken 
     determination.  The vastness of the field, the smallness of 
     your numbers, the indifference of the masses, must neither 
     discourage nor appal you.  You should at all times fix your 
     gaze on the promise of Baha'u'llah, put your whole trust in 
     His creative Word, recall the past and manifold evidences of 
     His all-encompassing and resistless power and arise to become 
     worthy and exemplary recipients of His all-sustaining 
     grace and blessings.  I appeal to every Indian and Burmese 
     believer, however modest his position, however limited his 
     knowledge, however restricted his means, to rise to the height 
     of this great opportunity which if missed will not recur 
     again.  To disperse, to settle, to teach by word and deed, 
     to persevere and sacrifice are the requirements of the present 
     hour.  May the Almighty, Whose Cause you are labouring 
 
 
 
+P91 
     to advance, endow you and your fellow-workers with all the 
     wisdom, the strength, and guidance that you need to acquit 
     yourselves worthily of this task.  
 
June 29, 1941 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi was also very happy to hear from you that 
you consider the Faith is making substantial progress in India, 
due to the tireless and devoted efforts of our Baha'i brothers 
and sisters in that land.  He would, however, urge the friends 
to follow the example of the American believers by sending out 
more pioneers to work in territories where there are no Baha'is.  
This is in accordance with the idea expressed by the beloved 
Master in the "Divine Plan" Tablets, and should be followed 
by all Baha'is.  
     The Guardian will pray for the success of the Summer School 
to be held in Surat.  He is delighted that the Indian friends are 
so well organised and are, year by year, strengthening the 
administrative institutions of their Faith.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am eagerly and hopefully awaiting to witness fresh 
     evidences of the renewed determination of the believers 
     throughout India and Burma, to carry aloft and into virgin 
     territories the torch of Divine Guidance despite the dark 
     clouds that threaten on the horizon.  In these days of stress 
     and peril, every effort expended, every victory achieved, 
     every sacrifice made, will be rewarded a hundredfold.  I will 
     pray earnestly and continually that the friends may evince 
     such zeal and perseverance as to ensure the complete success 
     of the Six-Year Plan which they, of their own accord, have 
     so splendidly initiated.  
 
October 5, 1941 
 
 
Every Obstacle Should Be Surmounted 
 
     He was very happy to receive so much good news of the 
progress of the Baha'i teaching work in India, as well as the 
 
 
 
+P92 
success of the Summer School.  
     The fact that the friends of India, and also of Iran, are now 
finding themselves in a position where they can arise and teach 
the Cause far and wide, greatly cheers the Guardian's heart.  
He hopes that the Baha'is of India, in spite of the fact that the 
war is now so close to their native land, with all its attendant 
dangers and problems, will allow nothing to deter them in their 
prosecution of their Six-Year Teaching Plan for India and 
Burma.  
     Now is the time of true test and trial--the time when the 
friends must follow in the footsteps of the first Persian believers, 
who, heedless of comfort and even life itself, raised the Banner 
of Baha'u'llah's Faith aloft, for all the world to see and follow.  
     He feels confident that the believers, led by their National 
Spiritual Assembly, and aided and inspired by their Local 
Spiritual Assemblies, will arise to new heights of service, and 
distinguish themselves in the eyes of the Baha'i world.  His 
constant prayers will be offered on their behalf, and he will 
remember them in the Shrines with love and yearning for their 
success.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I wish to add a few words in person and appeal to you, and 
     through you to the dear friends in Burma and India, not to 
     allow, despite the increasing gravity of the international 
     situation and the dangers that threaten the East, the work, 
     which has been so enthusiastically initiated, to suffer through 
     any relaxation of effort, or any deflection of purpose, on the 
     part of any individual or Assembly.  These perils, sufferings 
     and commotions are blessings in disguise, which pave the way 
     and prepare the hearts of those who face and sustain them 
     for a deeper realization and an earlier and fuller acceptance 
     of the Divine Message of Baha'u'llah.  The opportunities 
     are manifold and priceless.  Every effort should be exerted, 
     every sacrifice should be made, every obstacle should be 
     surmounted.  
 
December 16, 1941 
 
 
 
+P93 
     It rejoices his heart to see that the Indian believers are now 
rising to such noble heights of self-sacrifice and utter devotion 
to the Faith of God, and that they are, despite the great difficulty 
of these war times we are living through, determined to fulfil 
their Six-Year Plan of teaching the Baha'i Cause in India and 
Burma and complete the spread of its divine and healing message 
to her peoples before the end of the first Baha'i century.  
 
 
Persecution of Baha'is of Kadwai 
 
     He was very sad to hear of the persecution of the Baha'is 
of Kadwai by the fanatical Muslim population.  Please convey 
to the friends there the assurance of his most loving prayers for 
their protection, and tell them that, though they are suffering for 
their Faith, this very persecution is a blessing to the believers 
of India, as we know that wherever the Cause has suffered it 
has always grown stronger and attracted more attention and 
more adherents.  
     He was also very pleased to hear of the success of the 
Summer School this year.  The Indian Baha'is have every reason 
to feel encouraged by the marked progress of their activities 
in all fields.  
 
 
Use of A'rabs (Vowel Points) 
 
     Regarding your question as to the use of A'rabs on the Arabic 
texts of the Tablets:  The Guardian feels that this is a matter 
which concerns the entire Baha'i world, and requires to be 
worked out by a highly specialized group of qualified people 
at some future date.  He, therefore wishes you not to print the 
A'rabs on the Holy Tablets except on rare occasions where it is 
absolutely necessary in order to distinguish the word from some 
other word just like it.  
 
 
Two Davids 
 
     Abdu'l-Baha is the one who has interpreted the reference of 
 
 
 
+P94 
the Bab concerning David, by saying that there were two 
Davids, one of them was the author of the Psalms.  The 
Tablet in which the Master states this is absolutely authentic, 
but at the moment the original is not available.  
 
 
He Whom God Will Make Manifest 
 
     The Bab said that whenever "He whom God will make 
manifest" appears, accept Him.  He never said don't accept 
Him until after the lapse of 1000 years.  Also Baha'u'llah says 
that in the year 9 of the Babi Dispensation the time was ripe 
for the Revelation of "He whom God will make manifest".  
As the Bab was not only a Manifestation but a Herald of this 
Baha'i Faith, the interval between His Revelation and that of 
Baha'u'llah was of shorter duration.  His Dispensation in a 
sense will last as long as Baha'u'llah's lasts.  
 
 
The Holy Book--The Aqdas 
 
     There are no doubtful verses in the Holy Book, the Aqdas.  
The reason it is not circulated amongst all the Baha'is is, first, 
because the Cause is not yet ready or sufficiently matured to 
put all the provisions of the Aqdas into effect and, second, 
because it is a book which requires to be supplemented by 
detailed explanations and to be translated into other languages 
by a competent body of experts.  The provisions of the Aqdas 
are gradually, according to the progress of the Cause, being 
put into effect already, both in the East and the West.  
 
 
Use of A'rabs (Vowel Points) 
 
     No vowel points, as A'rabs, should be published with any 
part of the text of the Aqdas.  Certain of the Tablets may be 
translated in Urdu, but not the Aqdas itself, for the reasons 
mentioned above.  
 
 
 
+P95 
Writings of the Bab 
 
     The books of the Bab have not as yet been printed in the 
original.  Except for the Bayan, the Seven Proofs and Commentary 
on the Surih of Joseph, we cannot be sure of the 
authenticity of most of His other works as the text has been 
corrupted by the unfaithful.  
 
 
The Universal House of Justice 
 
     The Universal House of Justice is elected by the members of 
the National Houses of Justice.  At this time when the National 
Assemblies in the Cause are not yet functioning sufficiently 
or fully representative of all the various important elements 
within it, and when some of the Baha'is are not even free to 
practise their faith, despite their numbers, it is quite impracticable 
to seek to establish the Universal House of Justice.  
Whenever conditions permit, it will be established.  
 
 
Surmount Every Obstacle 
 
     The Guardian wishes the members of your Assembly to 
persevere, in spite of the dangers of the war now raging near 
to India, in the all-important task of fulfilling the Six-Year Plan.  
     He is confident that the friends of India and Burma like their 
Baha'i brothers and sisters of other lands, will surmount every 
obstacle, overcome every difficulty, and emerge victorious at 
the end of the first Baha'i Century.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The news conveyed by your latest communication has 
     rejoiced my heart.  The manner in which the friends have 
     arisen to promote the teaching work throughout their country 
     merits the highest praise.  By their enthusiasm, their self-abnegation, 
     the determination and vigour they display, they 
     have lent a fresh impetus to the onward march of the Faith 
     and the expansion of its institutions and the multiplication of 
     its administrative centres.  The perils of the present hour, 
     the repercussions of this tremendous world ordeal on their 
 
 
 
+P96 
     native land, must, in no wise, alarm or discourage them.  
     Their purpose must never be deflected, their enthusiasm 
     never dimmed, their vision never obscured, their exertions 
     never discontinued.  Adversity prepares the hearts of men, 
     and paves the way for a wholehearted and general 
     acceptance of the tenets and claims of our beloved Faith.  
     Challenged by the obstacles in their path, encouraged by 
     work already initiated, assured of the Divine Promise of 
     Baha'u'llah, let them forge ahead until their goal is attained.  
     My prayers will ever surround them.

Remarkable Evidence of Activity 
 
     He has been greatly encouraged by the work the Indian believers 
are doing in the pioneer teaching field.  It makes him 
proud to behold the way this great eastern nation is arising, 
through its enlightened Baha'is, to serve the Cause of God, and 
is fast pushing to the forefront of Baha'i service, and becoming 
an example and an inspiration to the other Baha'i communities 
in the Orient and Far East.  
     The noble response the Indian friends are making to his 
appeals has encouraged him to send them further donations for 
their teaching work, and he trusts that, under the indefatigable 
leadership of the National Spiritual Assembly, they will redouble 
their efforts, and push on to the full and glorious completion 
of the Six-Year Plan they laid down for themselves with such 
courage and devotion.  
     The establishment of the Hyderabad Assembly and that 
of Bangalore are great steps forward, and the Guardian is 
waiting hopefully to receive the good news of more new spiritual 
Assemblies in this coming Baha'i year.  
     He was also very pleased to hear that the Summer School is 
becoming an institution of national importance, and that the 
friends are increasingly attending it and realizing its great value 
in the life of the entire Community of believers.  In a country 
such as India it might grow to be the first permanent institution 
 
 
 
+P97 
of Baha'i learning if the believers support it sufficiently and 
carry out their teaching campaign with whole-hearted devotion 
and zeal; for, with the influx of many new Baha'is into the 
Cause in that country, it should not be difficult to evolve it into 
a Baha'i university as time goes by.  
     The Guardian wishes to convey, through you, his loving 
appreciation of their noble services to all the dear Indian 
believers who have gone out as pioneers and teachers in these 
momentous days.  He will remember them, and all the Indian 
friends, in his prayers in the Holy Shrines, and supplicate for 
them a victorious conclusion for their Six-Year Plan by 1944.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I have been greatly heartened in my arduous task by the 
     remarkable evidences of activity, devotion and perseverance 
     which the believers in India have lately manifested, and 
     by the manner in which they have arisen to promote the 
     cause of our Beloved, and extend the range of its institutions.  
     I admire, their spirit, and feel truly proud of their 
     achievements.  The field is indeed vast, and the problems 
     manifold, but the spirit they have demonstrated will, if kept 
     alive, enable them to surmount every obstacle.  My prayers 
     will continue to be offered on their behalf and particularly 
     for those who are planting the banner of the Faith in 
     virgin territories.  How glorious their task, how meritorious 
     their accomplishments.  
 
January 10, 1942 
 
 
Future is Blessed and Glorious 
 
     He was very relieved to hear from Mr. Butt that the 
Burmese Baha'is were all safe, and he trusts that, in spite of the 
grave dangers now so near them, God will continue to over-shadow 
them and protect them in His mercy and wisdom.  
     We Baha'is are indeed most blessed in that we know that, 
however dark the days immediately ahead of the human race, 
the future is blessed and glorious.  It is for this future that the 
 
 
 
+P98 
believers must labour day and night, heedless of the state of the 
world and the dangers threatening.  
     The Guardian will continuously pray that Baha'u'llah will 
strengthen and guide the Indian friends to succeed in their 
teaching plans, and to persevere in their efforts until they have 
completed the Six-Year Plan.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          In these days when perils are fast gathering about India 
     and Burma my heart and my thoughts turn increasingly 
     towards the friends, and particularly those who are vigorously 
     and devotedly promoting the interests of the Six-Year 
     Plan.  I will specially and fervently pray for them all, 
     that their vision may not be obscured, that their 
     efforts may not diminish, that their courage many 
     remain undaunted, and their steadfastness and loyalty 
     unshaken.  The greater their problems and anxieties and 
     the more formidable the obstacles in their way, the more 
     glorious and abundant will be the recompense and blessings 
     that will be bestowed upon them by their all-seeing, their 
     all-bountiful, all-powerful Master.  
 
February 23, 1942 
 

New Assemblies of Hyderabad [&amp;and] Kotah 
 
     The Guardian has written the new Hyderabad Assembly, and 
he will indeed pray for their protection and blessing.  They 
are an important group in an important State, and he hopes 
that your Assembly will render them every assistance and help 
possible, in order to deepen them in the knowledge of the 
teachings and in Faith.  
     The establishment of the Assembly of Kotah, no less than 
that of Hyderabad, must be viewed in the light of another 
milestone in the forward march of the Faith in India.  The 
Guardian would like you to convey to all the dear pioneers and 
teachers whom you have enumerated in your letters, the expression 
of his deep gratitude for, and appreciation of the 
wonderful work they are doing.  The believers of India, though 
few in number in relation to the millions that form their nation, 
 
 
 
+P99 
are performing a service to their fellow-countrymen which in 
the future will be seen in the true magnitude.  Let them rest 
assured and toil ceaselessly for the establishment of the Faith 
which they serve, and which alone can ultimately heal the ills 
of sorely-tried mankind.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The pioneer activities in which the friends in India are 
     so steadfastly, so energetically and so devotedly engaged, in 
     spite of the perils, the uncertainties and the stress of the 
     present hour, are a marvellous evidence of the indomitable 
     spirit that animates them in the service of the Cause of 
     Baha'u'llah.  Perseverance is the magnet that will, in these 
     days, attract the promised blessings of the Almighty Author 
     of our beloved Faith.  Unity and harmony constitute the 
     basis on which the structure of these activities can securely 
     rest.  Self-sacrifice, audacity, undeviating adherence to the 
     essentials of the Faith, will reinforce that structure and 
     accelerate its rise.  That the dear friends in India are 
     increasingly demonstrating the quality and depth of their 
     faith and the character and range of their accomplishments 
     is a source of intense satisfaction to me, and I will continue 
     to supplicate our Beloved to guide their steps, cheer their 
     hearts, illumine their understanding, and fulfil their highest 
     and noblest aspirations.  He indeed is well pleased with 
     the record of their past services, and will, if they redouble 
     their efforts, enable them to achieve a signal victory.

Prizes to be Won 
 
     ...The extremely good news of the way the Baha'is of India 
are arising and serving in new fields in spite of the war conditions 
prevailing, and the formation of the new Assemblies of 
Hyderabad and Kotah, the work in Kashmir and various other 
centres, has all greatly cheered his heart, and impelled him to 
contribute the sum he forwarded through you to help carry out 
the many teaching enterprises now under way.  The rate at 
which the Indian believers are advancing is increasingly entitling 
 
 
 
+P100 
them to a position in the foremost ranks of the Faith, and will 
no doubt greatly inspire and encourage other Baha'is of the East 
to follow their example.  Such prizes are to be won in these 
days of universal trial and suffering, and it makes the Guardian 
very happy to feel that some of them are evidently going to be 
merited by the Indian believers!  
     It is a great deprivation that the friends should be cut off 
from their devoted fellow-Baha'is in Burma.  We can only 
hope and pray that Baha'u'llah will protect and watch over 
them until the ordeal of these times is past, and the faithful 
believers the world over can again join hands and work together 
for the peace and progress of the entire world.  
 
 
Passing of Abd'ul-Jalil Beg Saad 
 
     The passing of Abd'ul-Jalil Beg Saad was a great loss to the 
Faith in Egypt, and the Guardian was pleased to hear that his 
co-workers in India held memorial meetings for him.  Such 
occasions constitute eloquent testimonials to the profound love 
that binds Baha'is to each other, whoever and wherever they 
may be.  
 
 
Painstaking and Fruitful Efforts 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I wish to reaffirm my deep sense of satisfaction and 
     gratitude for the sustained, the painstaking and fruitful 
     efforts exerted so far by the Indian believers for the promotion 
     of the Six-Year Plan.  The limits of the Faith have 
     been enlarged, the centres and groups have multiplied, and 
     the determination and zeal of the prosecutors of the Plan 
     are visibly increasing.  I am greatly cheered and encouraged, 
     and will, with redoubled fervour, pray at the holy Shrines, 
     for the victorious conclusion of the campaign initiated with 
     such devotion, energy, and resolution.  May the Beloved 
     sustain them in their noble task.  
 
July 27, 1942 
 
 
 
+P101 
     The marked, and extremely encouraging, progress which the 
Cause is making in India has so pleased the Guardian and 
cheered his over-burdened heart that he felt impelled to forward 
to your Assembly the sum of two hundred pounds to be expended 
for the further promotion of the teaching work.  
     That at such a time, when dangers threaten on every side and 
the whole planet is plunged in war and confusion, the Indian 
believers should, so steadily and patiently, with such devotion 
and enthusiasm, pursue their tasks of teaching under the Six-Year 
Plan, is, indeed, a cause for universal acclaim and rejoicing 
on the part of their fellow-Baha'is.  They are ever increasingly 
arising to take their place as one of the foremost Baha'i 
Communities, and their spirit and their accomplishments are 
arousing the envy and the admiration of their fellow-workers in 
Eastern lands.  
 
 
Placing of Burial Stone 
 
     The placing of the burial stone on the dead has no other 
significance than to emphasize our profound conviction that our 
souls come from our Creator and to Him they return, and in 
Him we believe and trust.  
 
 
Ensure the Triumphant Conclusion 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The accomplishments of the believers of India, in virgin 
     fields and in furtherance of the interests of the Six-Year 
     Plan, merit the highest praise.  Prompted by their achievements, 
     and as a token of my keen appreciation of their 
     notable services, and in order to facilitate further expansion 
     and consolidation of their teaching activities, I have forwarded 
     to you a contribution which I trust will serve as a 
     nucleus for a Fund designed to promote the vital and urgent 
     interests of the nation-wide teaching enterprise in which you 
     have embarked, and which constitutes the greatest single 
 
 
 
+P102 
     organized undertaking launched in the service of Baha'u'llah 
     in that country.  Perseverance, coupled with a spirit of complete 
     dedication to the cause of teaching, will, I feel confident, 
     ensure the triumphant conclusion of your labours.  I will 
     continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.  
     Redouble your efforts and be confident.

Proper Administrative Headquarters 
 
     Concerning his recent cable to the National Spiritual Assembly:  
The Guardian feels that, if feasible, it is highly desirable 
and necessary that the rapidly growing and strengthening Indian 
Baha'i Community should have a proper administrative Headquarters, 
situated in the capital--Delhi--and suitable for the 
next few years at least.  He wishes the N.S.A. to find a building 
or house which will suit their requirements in every way, and 
inform him at once of the price required.  He considers that it 
is premature at present to think of purchasing a site for a future 
Baha'i Temple.  The thing for the friends to concentrate on at 
present is the Haziratu'l-Quds.  
     He has been greatly encouraged of late to witness the 
marked increase of activity shown by the Baha'i Communities 
everywhere in India.  They are demonstrating their right to a 
place in the foremost ranks of the Baha'i World, and he is very 
pleased with them and eager that they should forge ahead in 
every field of Baha'i life.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          May the Almighty graciously assist the Indian believers 
     to establish, at the close of the first Baha'i Century, their 
     administrative headquarters in the capital city of India, and 
     thus befittingly crown their meritorious teaching activities.  
 
January 28, 1943 
 
 
 
+P103 
Passing Away of Mr. Vakil 
 
     He was very sad to hear of the passing of our dear and 
esteemed brother, Mr. Vakil.  His loss will be much felt by the 
Indian believers, and the many services he rendered the Cause 
will never be forgotten.  It is too bad that he was denied the 
burial he himself longed for, but no doubt his spirit is now rejoicing 
in the Abha Kingdom after its long and faithful labours 
in this world.  
 
 
Secretary of the N.S.A. 
 
     Regarding your question concerning the Secretary of the 
N.S.A.:  There cannot be any permanently elected Secretary who 
would year after year hold office, as this would be contrary to 
the principles of the administration; however, the Guardian 
feels that the N.S.A. should supply the Secretary with a paid 
helper in order to enable him to carry on his duties properly 
and at the same time pursue his own profession, if that is 
necessary for him.  In other words the Secretary of the N.S.A. 
can have a full-time secretary under him if the work requires it.  
 
 
Election of L.S.A.'s 
 
     The Guardian has notified the friends in other countries 
that, in view of the fact that this is the hundredth year of the 
Faith and we are going to celebrate our Centenary next May, 
Spiritual Assemblies may be constituted or elected anytime 
before next April, wherever there are 9 or more believers.  He 
has done this in order to encourage the friends and stimulate 
the work everywhere.  He would like you to impress this fact 
on the believers in India so that they may redouble their efforts 
and have a truly impressive number of Assemblies by next 
May.  
 
 
 
+P104 
National Administrative Headquarters 
 
     He is sorry to hear that you have not as yet been able to 
find a suitable house for the National administrative Headquarters.  
The establishment of this headquarters will greatly 
enhance the prestige of the Indian Baha'i Community and 
stimulate the growth and work of the Cause.  He hopes you 
will soon meet with success, and cable him the glad news he is 
eagerly waiting to receive.  
 
 
Baha'is Can Undertake Philanthropic Work 
 
     Mr. Mani Mehta forwarded to the Guardian a copy of the 
N.S.A.'s decision informing him that he must either give up his 
connection with the War Comforts Fund or his Baha'i administrative 
work.  The Guardian feels that there is no objection to 
a Baha'i undertaking work of a philanthropic or humanitarian 
nature and at the same time being on elected Baha'i bodies or 
holding office in them.  The War Comforts Fund is in no way 
contrary to our principles, and there can be no objection to Mr. 
Mehta's work in this connection.  He hopes that the N.S.A. 
will clarify this matter and remove any misunderstandings 
that have arisen.  
 
 
Centenary Celebrations 
 
     The friends in India are, after years of labour and devotion, 
beginning to find their number greatly increased, their assemblies 
multiplied, their Faith increasingly well-known to the public; 
they are about to initiate their first national headquarters, and 
in a few months will be celebrating the glorious occasion of the 
hundredth anniversary of their Faith.  At such a critical time 
they should, one and all, devote their energies to achieving their 
 
 
 
+P105 
objectives and impressing upon the public the nobility and 
beauty of their teachings, divinely inspired, and of such vast 
import to the entire world, and cast aside, once for all, any 
differences of opinion or personal viewpoints or prejudices that 
may hinder the success of their plans and cast a blight on the 
wonderful achievements they have carried out and are about to 
crown with still greater victories.  
     The Guardian feels that the N.S.A. must from now on 
coordinate its plans and set in motion its preparations for the 
Centenary Celebration.  The believers must hold gatherings for 
the Baha'is at exactly 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset on 
May 22nd, 1944 as this is the exact time when the Bab declared 
His Mission to Mulla Hussayn.  They should also arrange to 
hold public gatherings on May 23rd and enlist the support of 
prominent friends of the Faith as speakers, together with 
Baha'i speakers, on that occasion.  They should, as far as possible, 
hold festive gatherings at this time, give banquets at which 
friends of the Cause and believers are present, obtain as much 
space in the press of India as possible, and in general devise 
ways and means of making this a glorious and memorable celebration.  
He would also like to have the N.S.A. publish, in 
conjunction with the Centenary, a pamphlet giving a brief outline 
of the Faith's origin and teachings and major events in 
India, since its establishment there, and a detailed outline of the 
accomplishments of the Indian Baha'i Community, its early 
history, its development, etc.  
     He has been greatly encouraged by the progress made by the 
Indian Baha'i Community in recent years, and he longs to see 
them shine still brighter amidst its fellow communities the world 
over.  
     You may be sure that his loving prayers will be offered on 
your behalf and on behalf of all the other N.S.A. members, 
that you may speedily find a suitable Hazira, that the Cause 
may go on to still greater triumphs during this last year of the 
Century, and that the unity of the friends may be increased 
everywhere, as befits our Holy Faith.  
 
 
 
+P106 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The celebration of the Centenary of our glorious Faith by 
     the friends in India should, under your direction, and with 
     your encouragement and the assistance of individuals and 
     local Assemblies throughout India, constitute a befitting 
     conclusion to the magnificent labours and accomplishments 
     that have marked your stewardship in the service of the 
     Cause of Baha'u'llah in recent years.  A special fund should 
     be initiated, a strong committee should be set up, the utmost 
     care should be taken, the most diligent efforts should be 
     exerted and every sacrifice should be made to ensure the 
     unqualified success of this great undertaking.  I will pray 
     for your success from the depths of my heart.  There is no 
     time to lose.  The Beloved will, no doubt, crown your exertions 
     with signal victory if you arise and persevere.  
 
June 22, 1943 
 
 
Friends Should Unite 
 
     He was very pleased to hear that the Convention was so 
well attended, and the believers enthusiastic and united.  One 
of the most paramount needs of the Cause in India is that the 
friends should unite, should become really keenly conscious of 
the fact that they are one spiritual family, held together by 
bonds more sacred and eternal than those physical ties which 
make people of the same family.  If the friends will forget all 
personal differences and open their hearts to a great love for 
each other for the sake of Baha'u'llah, they will find that their 
powers are vastly increased; they will attract the heart of the 
public, and will witness a rapid growth of the Holy Faith in 
India.  The N.S.A. should do all in its power to foster unity 
among the believers, and to educate them in the administration 
as this is the channel through which their community life must 
flow, and which, when properly understood and practised, will 
enable the work of the Cause to go ahead by leaps and bounds.  
     The excellent news you conveyed of the progress of the Faith 
in so many hitherto virgin territories of India greatly rejoiced 
 
 
 
+P107 
the Guardian's heart, and he is proud to witness the manner in 
which the Indian believers are arising, teaching, and sacrificing 
for the Faith of God.  The friends themselves must be astonished 
at the rapidity with which the devoted pioneers have succeeded 
in establishing new spiritual Assemblies; and he hopes that 
many more souls will, thrilled by these achievements, follow in 
their footsteps, and thus ensure a truly glorious celebration of 
the hundredth anniversary of the Cause next May.  The eyes of 
the Baha'i world are being increasingly attracted by the achievements 
of the Indian friends, and they have the opportunity of 
crowning their Centenary celebrations with a victory outstanding 
in the records of the Baha'is of the East.  The Guardian 
hopes that in this connection many more Baha'i young people 
will arise and serve.  They have the advantages of health and 
freedom from family responsibilities which are not always 
enjoyed by older people, and they should cooperate to the full 
with more experienced believers in carrying on the pioneer work 
of the Cause.  
     He is most anxious that now that the National administrative 
Headquarters of the Faith has been successfully established--
a tremendous step forward for the Faith there--you should give 
special attention to getting out the Esslemont book in three 
additional languages as soon as possible.  
 
 
The Six-Year Plan Has Progressed Magnificently 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The achievements of the Indian believers in recent months 
     have been truly stupendous.  The Six-Year Plan has progressed 
     magnificently; the dissemination of Baha'i literature has 
     been stimulated, the national administrative headquarters, to 
     be henceforth designated as the Haziratu'l-Quds, has been 
     established; a new spirit stirs in the hearts of the believers, 
     teachers, pioneers as well as administrators; the evidences of 
     a fast-developing community life are evident everywhere.  The 
     impetus lent to these activities must be continually reinforced 
     in these concluding months of the first Baha'i century.  
     The Indian believers have amply demonstrated the vitality 
     of the faith they profess.  They must win fresh laurels.  They 
     cannot rest on their oars.  They must scale still loftier 
 
 
 
+P108 
     heights.  They must persevere till the end.  They must sacrifice 
     to the utmost.  They must unite as never before.  They 
     must prove themselves worthy of the task they have so nobly 
     initiated and are now so energetically prosecuting.  I will, 
     with redoubled fervour, pray for its consummation.  Rest 
     assured.  
 
October 26, 1943 
 
 
Centenary Celebrations 
 
     He approves of the plans for holding the Centenary, and 
wishes the annual Baha'i Convention to be held in conjunction 
with it (as already confirmed by cable to you).  All Baha'i 
Communities free to convene conventions will be also meeting 
this year during the Centenary celebrations.  This will both facilitate 
the work of the Cause, stimulate the friends, and be of 
added interest to the public.  
     The truly remarkable work accomplished by the pioneers 
and teachers in India during this last year has greatly pleased, 
and even astonished, the Guardian, and he hopes that the 
friends, newly enlisted under the banner of Baha'u'llah, will 
study the teachings deeply, help to promote unity and concord 
among the believers, and greatly aid in spreading the Divine 
Message among the people of India.  
 
 
Historic Achievements 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The truly splendid and indeed historic achievements of 
     the Indian believers during the concluding months of the 
     first Baha'i century deserve the highest praise.  The repeated 
     and striking evidences of their high accomplishments invigorate, 
     encourage, and excite the admiration of, their sister 
     communities in East and West.  They are holding aloft the 
     standard of Divine guidance in a manner that cannot but 
     evoke the unstinted praise and the unqualified gratitude of 
     their brethren throughout the Baha'i world.  The Beloved is 
     well pleased with their magnificent record of service.  I feel 
 
 
 
+P109 
     truly proud of their stewardship of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, 
     of the spirit which animates them, and of the steadfastness 
     with which they pursue their manifold and ever-expanding 
     activities in the service of this glorious Faith.

Baha'u'llah and the New Era in Kanarese 
 
     A few days ago the Kanarese volumes reached him and he 
was very happy to see them; he has placed most of them in the 
Mansion of Baha'u'llah and the others he has distributed to 
various Assemblies and Baha'i libraries.  He is eagerly awaiting 
copies of the various other translations your Assembly has undertaken, 
and in this connection he urges you again to persevere 
in your efforts to overcome every obstacle and get these further 
additions to your Baha'i literature in India speedily out and in 
the hands of the newly-attracted souls.  
 
 
Achieved Mighty Victories 
 
     The Guardian wishes to once again stress the immediate tasks 
which face your Assembly:  the important--and almost miraculous
--work achieved during the closing years of our first Baha'i 
Century in forming so many Assemblies, most of them in virgin 
territory, should be carefully consolidated through travelling 
teachers, additional pioneers (if necessary), extension of financial 
help, etc., so that none of them will be weakened and forced 
to revert to group status.  Also the newly formed groups should 
be given every assistance to enable them to become Assemblies 
and take part in the administrative order of the Cause in India.  
He urges you to concentrate on these three things:  the publication 
and distribution of the newly translated books; the firm consolidation 
of the new Assemblies; and the development of existing 
groups, that they may speedily achieve Assembly status.  
 
 
 
+P110 
     Important as new teaching undertakings are they should 
not be given precedence at the present time until these other 
objectives are well on the way to being realized.  
     In closing let me assure you that the beloved Guardian 
cherishes the brightest hopes for the future development of the 
Cause there, and expects great things of the Indian believers in 
view of the truly remarkable tasks they have been accomplishing 
these last few years with such a spirit of zeal and devotion.  His 
loving prayers are offered on your behalf and for your fellow-members 
of the N.S.A., that you may be blessed and guided 
always.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The achievements of the Indian Baha'i Community during 
     the closing years of the first Baha'i Century have shed a 
     great lustre on the record of their imperishable services ever 
     since the inception of the Faith in their vast and promising 
     country.  Both in the teaching and administrative spheres 
     of Baha'i activity they have assiduously laboured, nobly persevered, 
     generously given of their resources, consistently 
     collaborated, achieved mighty victories and raised to a new 
     level the standard of Baha'i stewardship.  The field now 
     stretching before them during the opening year of the second 
     Baha'i Century is vast and highly promising.  The call is 
     urgent, the opportunities priceless, the need of the waiting 
     masses desperate, the machinery for the execution of the 
     Divine Purpose already erected and vigorously functioning, 
     the promise of signal victory clear and definite.  A higher 
     degree of administrative efficiency; a closer collaboration 
     between the various elements constituting the organic Baha'i 
     Community; a greater measure of self sacrifice; a still more 
     intensified exertion aiming at the consolidation and preservation 
     of the newly constituted Assemblies and the rapid conversion 
     of the existing groups into full-fledged Assemblies; a 
     systematic, sustained and nation-wide endeavour for the purpose 
     of disseminating the literature of the Faith, increasing 
     its volume and adding to its diversity and lastly a more 
     audacious and convincing presentation of its tenets to the 
     masses of the people--these constitute the primary tasks facing 
 
 
 
+P111 
     now the Indian believers.  That they may achieve their 
     high destiny is my constant hope and fervent prayer. 
 
December 20, 1944 
 
 
Re-instate Assemblies in Burma 
 
     First let me say that he was very pleased to receive your 
cable telling him the Baha'is in at least a part of Burma have 
survived.  His thoughts and prayers have often been with them 
during these terrible years of war.  
     He wishes to urge the N.S.A. to concentrate above all on 
re-instating any Spiritual Assemblies which were disbanded last 
Baha'i year owing to insufficient numbers.  This must always 
be the first consideration, so that the hardly won prizes of these 
new Assemblies may not be lost.  
 
 
Depriving of Voting Rights--Function of 
N.S.A. 
 
     Also he wishes to point out that the power to put a person 
outside the Faith administratively must be solely, for the present 
time, in the hands of the N.S.A.  This applies only to the 
cases where believers are deprived of their voting rights.  Such 
extremely important and dramatic measures should never be resorted 
to unless absolutely necessary, and should certainly never 
be left in the hands of local assemblies, where personal feelings 
might colour the Assembly's decision.  On the other hand, the 
right to enroll believers has always been given to the Local 
Assemblies.  But they should be strongly urged to make sure the 
applicant is sincere and fully understands and accepts the fundamentals 
of the Faith.  
 
 
Teach a Wider Range of Indians 
 
     He also feels that now that you have so much literature on 
hand in various languages you should endeavour to teach a 
 
 
 
+P112 
wider range of Indian races; especially the Hindus and Moslems 
as they form the preponderating mass of the people.  Also Hindu 
and Moslem believers should be encouraged to teach, pioneer, 
lecture, and be appointed on Committees, and elected to 
Assemblies, so that our true inter-racial, inter-religious character 
may be incontestably demonstrated to the world.  
     The Guardian does not feel that it is necessary to wait one 
whole year before an applicant is admitted into the Faith.  The 
Assemblies must not be too strict, but should make every effort 
to increase the membership of their communities.  
 
June 26, 1945 
 
 
Passing Away of Siyyid Mustafa 
 
     He was deeply grieved to hear of the death of our very dear 
and esteemed Baha'i brother, Siyyid Mustafa.  He was truly an 
example of steadfast devotion and one of the outstanding pioneers 
the Faith produced during the first century of its existence.  
He was also very sad to hear of the ruin of the Baha'i Haziras 
and the plight of the Baha'is in general.  He wishes your Assembly 
to exert its utmost in alleviating the suffering of the Burmese 
friends, and assisting them in every way possible.  Convey to 
them all the assurance of his ardent and loving prayers on their 
behalf, and for the speedy re-establishment of the Faith and its 
institutions in Burma.  
 
 
Baha'i Marriage 
 
     Regarding the question of ... marriage:  She should have 
performed the Baha'i marriage rites, but, as the Guardian 
already wrote her, she can now be re-instated in her voting 
rights by having a Baha'i marriage ceremony performed.  As 
she was married by civil, and not religious, law she need have 
no divorce or annulment of her civil marriage.  
     As at present a Baha'i marriage is not yet legally recognized 
by the authorities, the friends should also have the civil 
marriage in addition.  We have no objection to it at all, as it is 
non-sectarian and in no way affects our Baha'i status.  
 
 
 
+P113 
     As long as both the Baha'i and the other religious (whatever 
it may be) ceremony are both performed prior to the consummation 
of the marriage, we do not mind which ceremony is 
performed first.  It should be left to the individuals concerned 
to decide among themselves.  
 
 
Task Urgent, Vast and Sacred 

     [From the Guardian:]  
          The task facing the members of the Indian Baha'i community 
     in these days of stress and trial, is urgent, vast and 
     sacred.  The responsibilities they shoulder are growing in 
     number and complexity.  The obstacles in their path are 
     numerous and seemingly insurmountable.  The victories, 
     however, which they have won during the concluding years 
     of the first Baha'i century, augur well for the future, and 
     constitute only a preliminary stage in the great work they 
     are destined to accomplish in the years that lie ahead.  A 
     unity that is truly unshakable, a consecration to their task 
     which no trial or test can impair, a resolve that no force, 
     however inimical, can shake, a united and systematic endeavour 
     to proclaim and firmly establish their Faith which 
     enemies neither from within nor from without can undermine
     --all these are vitally required to enable them to 
     achieve their high destiny.  To you as their national elected 
     representatives I desire to appeal in particular to exercise 
     the utmost forbearance, care and vigilance, to exert the 
     utmost endeavour, to deliberate, cooperate and carry out 
     with exemplary vigour the necessary measures which the 
     urgency of the task and the criticalness of the hour imperatively 
     demand.  That their glorious mission may be crowned 
     with signal success is the object of my constant and fervent 
     prayers at the holy Shrine.  
 
August 9, 1945 
 
 
Shoulder Heavy Responsibilities 
 
     He was very sad to read of the sufferings of the beloved 
Burmese friends, of the death of that bright star of the Faith, 
Siyyid Mustafa, and of the murder of many other of the friends!  
 
 
 
+P114 
At the same time his heart swelled with pride when he saw 
that already the believers have re-assembled, elected an Assembly, 
and started their school again.  This shows how deep their 
faith is, and presages a glorious future for the Cause there.  
     As you already know he has sent you a sum to be devoted 
to rebuilding the Baha'i institutions, teaching the Faith, and 
assisting the friends who are in desperate need.  He has also 
invited other National Assemblies to contribute to this fund, 
and thus assist your Assembly to carry out this very important 
task of re-establishing a flourishing Community in Burma.  
     The Indian believers are finding themselves increasingly 
called upon to shoulder heavy responsibilities; they are becoming 
more numerous, have spread to many new centres, undertaken 
a large publishing program, increased the number of their 
institutions, and are gradually becoming known to their fellow-Indians 
as followers of a new and glorious Faith.  In view of 
this he feels your Assembly should constantly exhort the friends 
to be more conscious of their duties, and to be very careful of 
having differences of opinion which are so strong as to lead to 
disputes and thus humiliate our beloved Faith in the eyes of non-Baha'is.  
The public is beginning to observe them, and they must 
therefore conduct themselves at all times as befits those who 
bear the glorious Name of Baha.  They must be forgetful of self, 
but ever mindful of the Cause of God!  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The rehabilitation of the community of the sore-stricken 
     believers throughout Burma constitutes the most urgent task 
     of the Indian believers, and is a direct challenge which they 
     cannot ignore or neglect.  The reconstitution of dissolved 
     assemblies, the extension of relief to the needy, the promotion 
     of the teaching work, the dissemination of Baha'i 
     literature, the construction of the Haziras, the re-establishment 
     of schools and committees are all vitally urgent, and 
     should be carried out fully, systematically, and with 
     the utmost speed.  I long to hear of the progress of your 
     labours in this important field, upon which the future welfare 
     of the Burmese community depends, and with which 
     the destinies of the Indian believers are closely interwoven.  
 
 
 
+P115 
     I will pray from the depths of my heart that your meritorious 
     efforts may soon be crowned with magnificent 
     success.  
 
December 18, 1945 
 
 
Threefold Task 
 
     There is no objection to permitting the name of a Baha'i 
or his relative, to be placed on a stone incorporated in some 
Baha'i building he has donated to the Faith.  
     He is delighted with the progress your work is making in 
every field, and he urges you all to continually stimulate and 
inspire the friends to make ever greater effort and sacrifice in 
the service of their beloved Faith.  The opportunity is unique 
and the rewards of Baha'u'llah inestimably glorious.  
  
     [From the Guardian:] 
          My heart swells with joy, pride, and gratitude as I contemplate 
     the range of the services rendered in recent years by 
     the Indian believers to the Cause of Baha'u'llah.  I particularly 
     rejoice at the splendid initiative, the magnificent zeal, 
     the unconquerable spirit that have characterised their recent 
     understanding associated with the new Plan which they 
     have audaciously conceived, and which, I feel confident, they 
     will prosecute with exemplary vigour and constancy.  
     Simultaneous with the united efforts that must be strenuously 
     exerted to ensure its success, a systematic endeavour must 
     be made to proclaim the verities of our glorious Faith 
     to the masses, and to disseminate far and wide its literature.  
     This threefold task requires the concentrated and sustained 
     attention of the rank and file of the believers, the subordination 
     of every consideration to its paramount interests, the 
     extension of generous financial assistance to the agencies 
     designed for its promotion.  The believers in India have 
     set an inspiring example to their fellow-believers throughout 
     the East, and even to the great mass of their co-religionists 
     in Baha'u'llah's native land, and have abundantly demonstrated 
 
 
 
+P116 
     to them all, what organized activity, boldly conceived 
     and soundly and energetically conducted, can achieve 
     when directed and animated by the ennobling influences and 
     the generative spirit of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.  Their 
     exploits are indeed unsurpassed by those of any community 
     throughout the Baha'i world except those which stand 
     associated with the community that may well claim to be 
     the standard-bearer of the Cause of God in the West.  That 
     these exploits may be the forerunners of still mightier and 
     nobler achievements is my fervent hope and prayer.

Baha'is Can Accept Grants-in-aid From The 
Government 
 
     Your question about whether Baha'is can accept grants-in-aid 
and free plots from Government....  
     There is no objection, the beloved Guardian says, to the 
Baha'is receiving this type of help from the Government 
and civic authorities.  
 
March 24, 1946 
 
 
Baha'i Holy Days 
 
     He thinks it is better for Baha'i doctors not to work on our 
9 Holy Days--but, of course, that does not mean they should 
not attend to very sick people and emergencies on these days.  
 
 
Voting Rights 
 
     As he already told you in a previous communication he feels 
that your Assembly should not deprive people of their voting 
rights unless the matter is really very grave; this is a very heavy 
sanction, and can embitter the heart if lightly imposed, and 
also make people think we unduly resort to pressure of a strong 
nature.  The friends must be nursed and assisted, for they are 
still mostly immature spiritually, and their "sins" are those of 
 
 
 
+P117 
immaturity!  Their hearts are loyal to the Cause, and this is the 
most important thing.  
 
 
Responsibilities Immense 

     [From the Guardian:]  
          The responsibilities confronting the Indian and Burmese 
     Baha'i Communities, in these days of stress and turmoil, are 
     immense and inescapable.  The task facing them is urgent, 
     complex and rich in possibilities.  The Plan which they 
     are now striving to carry out demands the utmost vigilance, 
     care, vigour and perseverance.  All must arise to lend their 
     assistance, and ensure its unqualified success in all its 
     aspects.  An intensification of effort aimed at increasing 
     the number of pioneers who are labouring throughout the 
     length and breadth of that land; a more vigorous and 
     systematic endeavour to ensure the speedy publication of 
     Baha'i literature in all the languages that have already been 
     determined upon and its immediate dissemination as an 
     adjunct to the all-important teaching work; the elimination 
     of every trace of inharmony, misunderstanding and ill-will 
     so detrimental, at this juncture, to the interests of the Plan; 
     the initiation of measures designed to give greater publicity 
     to the aims and purposes of the Faith and its fundamental 
     teachings, through the Press and radio; the adoption and 
     enforcement of whatever measures are required to 
     increase the number of Indian and Muslim converts to the 
     Faith, on whom its ultimate triumph and recognition must 
     depend; the steady consolidation and expansion of newly-established 
     institutions, such as the Summer School, the 
     hostel and the local Haziras; a more liberal and widespread 
     contribution of funds to the National Treasury for the 
     support of these institutions, and for the promotion of the 
     general interests of the Faith--these stand out as the 
     primary duties and obligations of both the participants of 
     the Plan and of those who conduct its operation.  
          A special effort must simultaneously be exerted to provide 
     whatever is required to re-establish the long-suffering and 
     dearly-loved Burmese community on a secure foundation.  
  
 
 
+P118 
     The despatch of competent teachers and visitors to that 
     sorely-tried land; the extension of the necessary relief to those 
     who are still in need; the reconstruction of the administrative 
     headquarters and the re-establishment of the Baha'i 
     school; the construction of the memorial to the beloved and 
     unforgettable pioneer and martyr Siyyid Mustafa; the 
     formation of Assemblies and Groups in as many localities 
     as possible--these constitute the immediate tasks confronting 
     your Assembly in addition to the responsibilities you 
     are called upon to discharge under the new Plan.  
          No sacrifice can be deemed too great for the achievement of 
     this dual purpose, no effort should be spared in order to 
     carry out in its entirety this twofold objective.  May the 
     Beloved grant you the strength you require for the 
     accomplishment of your historic task.  
 
August 2, 1946 
 
 
Answer to Various Matters 
 
     Concerning ... divorce:  He has no right to demand 
from his wife a refund of the marriage expenses he incurred.  In 
the Aqdas it is quite clear that the husband must not only give 
the dowry but must support his wife until the time when the 
divorce is completed.  In view of this she is not required to repay 
expenses of the marriage, etc.  
     The paying of the Huquq is a spiritual obligation; the friends 
must not be obliged by the Assemblies to pay it, but they should 
be encouraged to fulfil this spiritual obligation laid upon them 
in the Aqdas.  
     He is very pleased to note the list of literature the publishing 
committee is forwarding to him, and urges you to persevere in 
pressing the translation and publishing of the New Era in the 
important languages already chosen for the purpose, as he attaches 
the greatest importance to this work.  
     He was also delighted to see that the Srinagar Assembly held 
its elections.  These new Assemblies must receive every aid and 
 
 
 
+P119 
encouragement from your Assembly and every effort must be 
made to carry the Faith to new Centres, and to stimulate pioneering 
amongst the friends.  
     The Indian believers have a great opportunity to compete 
with both the American and British Baha'is in pioneer services; 
they already have a record to be proud of, and are first among 
the countries of the East in the record they hold of achievements 
in this field.  He hopes they will go on from victory to victory, 
and vindicate the high hopes he cherishes for their future.  
     If the National Assembly is sure that it was Siyyid Mustafa 
Roumie's wish to be buried next to his wife in Mandalay, then 
you should, by all means, arrange for the interment of his remains 
there.  A befitting memorial can then be erected over 
the vault.  The spirit of this great and valiant teacher surely 
watches over the land of his adoption, and will aid the Burmese 
believers in their efforts to rebuild their centres and promulgate 
the Cause of God there.  
     As we see the confusion in the world spreading, and the hatreds 
that divide men augmenting steadily, we, as the trustees of 
our Lord's glorious Faith, must rise to higher levels of self-sacrifice 
and devotion.  He prays that the Indian believers may 
achieve wonderful victories for Baha'u'llah in the months that 
lie ahead, and prove themselves worthy of the great destiny that 
beckons to them.  
 
 
Unstinted Devotion Displayed 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The perseverance, the tenacity, the unstinted devotion displayed 
     consistently by the Indian Baha'i Community, so 
     clearly demonstrated by the reports recently received by their 
     national elected representatives, are truly exhilarating and 
     augur well for the future of the Plan.  The members of this 
     Community, however, must not be content with the standard 
     already achieved, but must exert themselves ever more determinedly 
     and unitedly to fulfil the high hopes cherished for 
 
 
 
+P120 
     the success of their collective enterprise.  The Burmese Baha'i 
     Community, which they are so devotedly striving to rehabilitate, 
     must, likewise participate without reserve, in the glorious 
     task that confronts them, and demonstrate, thereby, 
     its virility and resilience in the face of the trials and obstacles 
     which it has had to struggle against in the past.  The 
     establishment of new centres in Burma, the consolidation of 
     the reinstated Assemblies, are both equally vital and urgent.  
     The verities of the Faith must be proclaimed, its literature 
     must be disseminated and its institutions reinforced and multiplied 
     throughout that land.  Both communities must collaborate 
     and through sustained, vigorous and systematic effort 
     and mutual assistance lend an unprecedented impetus to the 
     onward march of the Faith in India and Burma.  The greater 
     the effort and self-sacrifice, the richer the benefits that will 
     accrue, and the more potent the blessings that will be vouchsafed 
     from on high.  The goals are clearly defined.  The prizes 
     to be won are within reach and inexpressibly glorious.  Time 
     is running out and the opportunity is priceless.  The promise 
     of Divine unfailing assistance is assured.  All are challenged 
     to arise, to toil and to persevere, until their solemn pledge 
     under the Plan is completely and totally fulfilled.  That they 
     may prove themselves worthy of their high mission is my fervent 
     hope and constant prayer.  
 
October 12, 1946 
 
 
More Pioneers to Go Forth 
 
     He has been very encouraged to see the way the Indian, and 
now the Burmese friends have responded to his repeated call 
for greater sacrifice and for more pioneers to go forth into the 
teaching field.  Your country is so vast that less valiant hearts 
than those possessed by the indomitable Baha'is might well 
have quailed before the tasks to be undertaken.  But, on the 
contrary, the Indian and Burmese friends have arisen and demonstrated 
the calibre of their faith and courage in a manner 
which excites the admiration of their fellow Baha'is East and 
West.  
     Now is not the time to rest on their oars, but rather to re-double 
 
 
 
+P121 
their efforts and go on from victory to victory, and to 
add new fame to their exploits, conscious that the eyes of their 
fellow-believers are focussed upon them to see what they will 
achieve next.  
     He was particularly happy to see how active the beloved 
Burmese friends are, and that through the efforts of some members 
of their Community and Indian friends they have now established 
a new centre in Kyigone, where a Spiritual Assembly 
can exist.  This is a great step forward, and he hopes many new 
Baha'i Assemblies will be developed in Burma during the coming 
Baha'i year.  
     He was also very pleased to hear of the book exhibit held in 
Kolhapur, and of the interest shown in our Baha'i literature 
by persons of standing in the Community.  Such exhibitions 
offer a great opportunity to show the public what the Cause is 
doing and what it stands for, and every advantage of them 
should be taken.  
     Although your Assembly has succeeded in getting out a 
number of new language publications, you should not relax for 
a moment in your efforts to translate and publish the New Era 
in the remaining languages chosen, as this work is of the utmost 
importance, enables you to teach new language groups the Faith, 
and adds to the prestige of the Cause not only in India but abroad.  
Although you have many obstacles to overcome the results 
in the future will be great.  
     He cannot impress too strongly upon the friends the need 
for action:  they must arise in still greater numbers to pioneer; 
those who cannot go themselves should remember the admonition 
of Baha'u'llah and send, through the N.S.A., someone in 
their stead; the young people should learn to teach and go forth 
in the field in the days of their youth and receive this great blessing; 
more qualified teachers should arise, and circulate among 
the new and weak Assemblies in order to consolidate them.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The rich and varied material which you have been forwarding 
     during recent months to the Holy Land proclaim and 
     demonstrate, beyond the shadow of a doubt the assiduous 
 
 
 
+P122 
     care, the magnificent devotion, the exemplary fidelity, the 
     increased efficiency with which you are conducting the 
     affairs, and consolidating the activities of a steadily growing 
     community.  My heart swells with gratitude as I witness, in 
     so many fields, the striking evidences of the growth, the multiplication 
     and establishment of highly diversified communities 
     throughout the length and breadth of India and Burma, the 
     expansion of Baha'i literature, the rise of new institutions, 
     the growing consciousness and solidarity of the teachers and 
     administrators of the Faith, and of the contact that is being 
     established between them and the great masses of their countrymen, 
     at so critical a period in their history.  However 
     much these communities have already achieved, they cannot 
     afford, for a moment, to rest content with the laurels that 
     they have won.  Spurred on by these initial and superb victories
     --victories unprecedented in the annals of their Faith in 
     that land--they must press on, more diligently than ever, to 
     reinforce their unity, to deepen their understanding of the 
     spiritual verities of their Faith and of the administrative 
     principles underlying its new world order, to multiply its 
     nascent institutions, to broadcast its Message, to disseminate 
     its literature, to exemplify its spirit, to proclaim its truths, 
     and to swell the ranks of its unreserved supporters.  The 
     greater the effort they exert along these lines, the more abundant 
     the measure of celestial grace that will be vouchsafed 
     to them from on high.  That they may go from strength to 
     strength, that they may add still more glorious chapters to 
     the distinguished record of their immortal services to the 
     Cause of Baha'u'llah is my constant prayer and the most cherished 
     desire of my heart.

Esslemont Book in Karen Language 
 
     He advises you to make every effort to have the Esslemont 
book translated into Karen at present, and to persevere in 
your attempts to find someone to translate it into Chin in the 
future.  He urges you to make a supreme effort to complete 
 
 
 
+P123 
these translations and publication of the Esslemont book in 
the remaining chosen languages.  
 
 
Rules [&amp;and] Regulations Should Not Be Multiplied 
 
     You may not perhaps know that in connection with all 
National Assemblies the Guardian is advising that rules and regulations 
should not be multiplied and new statements on "procedure" 
issued; we should be elastic in details and rigid in principles; 
consequently he does not want your Assembly to issue 
statements of a binding nature unless absolutely necessary....  It is 
only those who have been spiritually ex-communicated by the 
Guardian with whom the believers are forbidden to associate, 
and not a person who is being punished by being deprived of his 
voting rights.  As contributions to Baha'i funds are used to support 
the administration of the Faith, they should not be accepted 
from those who are deprived of their voting rights; but such 
believers, should not be prevented from being buried in a Baha'i 
Cemetery or receiving charity--which we even give to non-Baha'is
--if in dire need.  
 
 
Added Responsibility 
 
     As the N.S.A. of Persia is, it would seem, unable 
to send pioneers to Bahrayn or Afghanistan, he fully approves 
of your Assembly doing so, if some of the dear Indian believers 
are willing to assume this added responsibility and perform this 
valuable service, highly meritorious in the sight of God.  
     The recent news conveyed to him by you of the achievement 
of the immediate goals that lay before the Indian and Burmese 
Baha'is, pleased him greatly.  He feels that the Community of 
believers there, as they see their own Plan developing and their 
own labours bearing fruit, their fame spreading amongst their 
sister-communities and their star rising in the heaven of the 
Baha'i world, are now acquiring a new zest for teaching, and are 
 
 
 
+P124 
ever more ready to sacrifice themselves in order to win complete 
victory for their Plan!  This pleases him greatly and encourages 
him to believe the future of the dear Indian and Burmese 
believers is very bright.  
     He was also delighted and relieved to hear that unity was 
achieved at Convention amongst the friends, and that all of 
them have resolved to put away childish differences, unworthy 
of them as servants and custodians of our glorious Faith in that 
great country, and unitedly strive for the good of the Cause 
and the successful completion of their sacred tasks.  
     He wishes once more to impress upon your Assembly the 
great importance of immediately finding and purchasing, and 
moving into, a befitting Hazira in Delhi.  This will bring upon 
the entire community great confirmations.  
 
 
Threshold of a New Epoch 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The perusal of your Annual Report and the messages conveyed 
     by the elected representatives of the Indian and Burmese 
     Baha'i communities, assembled at Convention, have served 
     to deepen my sense of admiration for the work collectively 
     achieved by the members of these communities, and of my 
     gratitude for the magnificent qualities they display, and 
     for the spirit which so powerfully animates them in their 
     stewardship to the Faith of Baha'u'llah.  
          They now stand on the threshold of a new epoch in 
     the history of the evolution of the Administrative Order 
     in their land.  The transfer of the central institution of 
     that Order to the capital of India; the wide measure of centralization 
     which this historic step must needs involve; the purchase 
     of a befitting seat for the ever expanding activities and 
     multiplying agencies of that institution in that same capital, 
     the progressive transfer of the national committees to the 
     national Haziratu'l-Quds--all these must synchronize with a 
     remarkable, and indeed unprecedented, intensification of 
     effort in the pioneer field of Baha'i activity, as well as in the 
     sphere of public teaching, designed to arouse the masses and 
 
 
 
+P125 
     proclaim the verities of the Faith throughout the length and 
     breadth of that subcontinent and its adjoining territory of 
     Burma.  
          In this twofold activity, supporting directly and indirectly 
     the interests of the Plan, committed to your charge, the 
     Hindu, the Moslem, the Burmese and Zoroastrian believers 
     must jointly, unitedly, and effectively participate.  The 
     minority elements in these ever-expanding communities 
     must be continually stimulated, encouraged, trained and in 
     some cases, as when an equal number of ballots have been 
     cast in an election, given priority, in order to reinforce the 
     representative character of Baha'i institutions, demonstrate 
     the distinction of these institutions from all other man-made 
     agencies, and win, to an ever-increasing degree, the 
     sympathy and support of the teeming masses of Hindu and 
     Moslem extraction, on whose adherence to the Faith, the 
     ultimate progress, establishment, and triumph of the Cause 
     of Baha'u'llah must chiefly depend.  
          Courage, good-will, resolution, self-abnegation, are imperatively 
     required, at this momentous stage in the evolution 
     of these nascent communities, who, having reared, with 
     assiduous care, the machinery of their Administrative Order, 
     and launched the Plan which the institutions of that Order 
     are now so efficiently promoting, have arisen to initiate 
     a crusade which, as it gathers momentum, must embrace 
     all the diversified races, classes and creeds of that vast 
     country, and its adjoining territories.  May the impelling 
     power of the Faith which they champion enable them 
     to surmount every obstacle, and reach their destined goal.  
 
May 8, 1947 
 
 
Set the Highest Example of Tolerance 
 
     During the great period of transition that vast land has been, 
and still is, going through his thoughts have been very frequently 
with you all, and his anxiety for the safety of the beloved 
friends there is very keen.  
     He fully appreciates the fact that the Baha'is, in spite of 
their total lack of religious or other prejudice, and their 
 
 
 
+P126 
strict political neutrality, are nevertheless placed in danger 
sometimes by the passions and unrest of their countrymen.  
His ardent prayers are offered for their protection, and he urges 
them to, at all times, set the highest example of tolerance, freedom 
from any form of partisanship in the present troubles and 
disputes going on, and sympathy with the deep sufferings of all 
classes and creeds.  
 
 
Greater Dedication to Service 
 
     The work of your Assembly is even more onerous and 
delicate than before.  Now that India, Burma and Pakistan 
no longer form one unit, in the sense of being under one 
regime, you will, no doubt, have many new problems to meet.  
But he feels assured that the experience the Community of 
believers has gained during recent years, the increased awareness 
of the glory of this Cause, and the greater dedication to 
its service which unites the hearts of all the Baha'is out there, 
will now manifest themselves in the Community's wholehearted 
cooperation with the N.S.A., and in a renewed determination 
to achieve its Plan.  
     The believers must realize that they, in fulfilling the immediate 
goals of this Plan, are hastening the day when India, 
Pakistan and Burma can respectively have each its own National 
Spiritual Assembly, which, in due time, will become one of the 
pillars of the International House of Justice.  Although three 
N.S.A.'s and not one must be envisaged in the future, how 
appropriate it is that, at present, when political division has 
taken place and animosities are fanned into flame, the believers 
in the Cause of God are united under one Spiritual Assembly, 
guiding and aiding all believers with love and understanding!  
     Please particularly assure the Serampur Baha'is of his loving 
prayers, and that he is proud of their devotion to the Faith.  
     He also wishes to assure you of his prayers for the progress 
of all the work your Assembly is doing, and especially for the 
solution of the problems involved in the National Headquarters' 
purchase.  He attributes great importance to this undertaking, 
 
 
 
+P127 
and is delighted to see the determined and self-sacrificing 
manner in which the believers are supporting it.  
 
 
Opportunity Which May Never Occur Again 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The strife and bloodshed, with their attendant misery, sorrow 
     and confusion, that have afflicted the entire subcontinent 
     of India, in recent months, have caused me the gravest 
     concern.  The disorders, following in the wake of this great 
     crisis in the life of its people, constitute a challenge, which 
     the Community of the steadfast followers of Baha'u'llah 
     in that land must resolutely face, and demonstrate in meeting 
     it the quality of their faith, the depth of their devotion,  
     the strength of their unity, the solidity of their institutions 
     and the heroic character of their resolve.  They must neither 
     feel alarmed, nor falter or hesitate in the execution of their 
     Plan.  Shielded by the institutions which their hands have 
     reared, abiding securely in the stronghold of their love 
     for Baha'u'llah and their devotion to His Faith, pursuing 
     with unrelaxing vigilance and singleness of purpose the 
     course set by the Plan they themselves have inaugurated, 
     heartened by the initial success already achieved since that 
     Plan was set in motion, they, however much buffeted by 
     present circumstances, and no matter how perilous the path 
     they now tread, must press forward, unafraid of persecution, 
     scorn of calumny, towards the shining goals they have set 
     themselves to attain.  
          The newly-fledged Assemblies, constituted with so much 
     labour and sacrifice, must above all be thoroughly safe-guarded.  
     The administrative nuclei formed throughout the 
     length and breadth of that land, must, however great the 
     effort demanded, be preserved and continually fostered, 
     and enabled to develop into groups destined in time to 
     evolve into firmly knit Assemblies.  The obstacles that have 
     arisen in connection with the purchase and registration of 
     the Haziratu'l-Quds in Delhi must be resolutely overcome 
     and all the subsidiary issues connected with it definitely and 
     speedily settled, enabling thereby the attention of your 
     Assembly to be focussed on the vital requirements of the 
 
 
 
+P128 
     teaching work on which the prosperity of the community 
     and its rapid growth must ultimately depend.  Attention, 
     moreover, should be directed to the completion of the task 
     undertaken in connexion with the translation and publication 
     of the New Era in the few remaining languages selected 
     for that purpose.  The dissemination of Baha'i literature 
     should, likewise, be simultaneously carried out with increasing 
     vigour.  Whatever measures are required to ensure a 
     more systematic and extensive propagation of the teaching 
     of the Faith among the masses must be promptly and 
     unhesitatingly adopted.  
          The hour is indeed propitious.  The ordeals and tribulations 
     which the hungry, the dispossessed, the sick, as well as the 
     disillusioned and restless multitudes, are now experiencing, 
     offer the bearers of the Message of the Most Great Name, an 
     opportunity which may never again recur.  There is no time 
     to lose.  Every warrior in the ever-advancing army of 
     Baha'u'llah must arise and participate in this holy crusade.  
     The rewards and prizes to be won are inestimable.  However 
     circumscribed its resources, however small its numbers, however 
     formidable the obstacles with which it is confronted, 
     the entire community of the believers in India, Burma and 
     Pakistan, must arise as one man, and, pledging anew its 
     fidelity to its Faith prove itself fully worthy of the Cause it 
     has espoused and the high mission it has undertaken.  
 
October 24, 1947 
 
 
Excommunication is a Spiritual Matter 
 
     Excommunication is a spiritual thing and up until now the 
Guardian has always been the one who exerted this power, 
and he feels for the present he must continue to be.  Only actual 
enemies of the Cause are ex-communicated.  On the other hand, 
those who conspicuously disgrace the Faith or refuse to abide by 
its laws can be deprived, as a punishment, of their voting rights; 
this in itself is a severe action, and he therefore always urges all 
National Assemblies (who can take such action) to first warn 
and repeatedly warn the evil-doer before taking the step of 
depriving him of his voting rights.  He feels your Assembly must 
 
 
 
+P129 
act with the greatest wisdom in such matters, and only impose 
this sanction if a believer is seriously injuring the Faith in the 
eyes of the public through his conduct or flagrantly breaching 
the laws of God.  If such a sanction were lightly used the friends 
would come to attach no importance to it, or to feel the N.S.A. 
used it every time they got angry with some individual's disobedience 
to them.  We must always remember that, sad and often 
childish, as it seems, some of those who make the worst nuisances 
of themselves to their National Bodies are often very loyal 
believers, who think they are protecting the true interests of their 
Faith by attacking N.S.A. decisions!  
 
 
Unite to Serve Him 
 
     The Guardian feels very strongly that everywhere, throughout 
the entire Baha'i world, the believers have got to master and 
follow the principles of their divinely laid down Administrative 
Order.  They will never solve their problems by departing from 
the correct procedure...  The Baha'is have got to learn to live up 
to the laws of Baha'u'llah which are infinitely higher, more 
exacting and more perfect than those the world is at present 
familiar with.  Running away, fighting with each other, fostering 
dissension, is not going to advance the Indian or any other 
Community; all it is going to do is to bring Baha'u'llah's plans 
and work to a standstill until such time as the believers unite to 
serve Him, or new and more dedicated souls arise to take their 
place.  
 
 
Seeking to Purify the World 
 
     He also feels very strongly, as he has pointed out in the 
enclosed letter to the Calcutta Assembly, that the Baha'is must 
be mature and realize that, whether they are conscious of it or 
not, the intense feelings of hatred, suspicion and jealousy which 
are flaming up everywhere in India and Pakistan, are tinging the 
attitudes of the believers themselves.  At such a time, seeing 
 
 
 
+P130 
this colossal example before them of the very essence of everything 
we are seeking to purify the world from, the Hindu, 
Moslem and Zoroastrian Baha'is should determine to show a 
love for each other and an inner spiritual solidarity so great as 
to forcibly attract the attention of their countrymen and impress 
them with the fact that Baha'u'llah's Message is, indeed, the only 
remedy for the ills afflicting the great multitudes of the Far 
East.  It would seem, however, from your reports and those of 
individuals who write him, that the Baha'is are doing the very 
opposite and enabling outsiders to point the finger at them and 
say "the very rivalry we are experiencing between various communities, 
the Baha'is are also experiencing!"  How terrible, how 
tragic, if Baha'is should let such a situation develop, such a 
betrayal of not only the trust God has placed in their hands but 
also a betrayal of the glorious victories they themselves won during 
the past decade!  
     The Guardian assures you all, and through you, the believers 
of India, Pakistan and Burma, that he will supplicate in the Holy 
Shrines that the labours you have all achieved together may be 
preserved from blemish, and that you may go on together to 
fulfil your plan and raise still higher the name of your fame.  
 
 
Stormy Yet Glorious Path of Service 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The work now engaging the attention of the members of the 
     Baha'i Communities in India, Pakistan and Burma, as it 
     develops and is further consolidated, acquires momentous 
     importance, and should be pursued with added zeal, ever 
     deepening consecration, firmer unity, closer collaboration, 
     greater vigilance and nobler self-sacrifice.  The sufferings and 
     trials they have recently experienced, the disappointments 
     and anxieties they have borne, the obstacles and setbacks they 
     have encountered in their path, should, far from causing them 
     to flinch in their determination or to relax in their efforts, act 
     as a stimulant and challenge, to scale loftier heights, and win 
     mightier victories in their strenuous labours for the propagation 
     of their beloved Faith.  
 
 
 
+P131 
     Though they are pressed by the multitudinous demands of an 
     ever-growing task, though overburdened by the manifold 
     responsibilities of an ever-expanding administration, I have, 
     in my desire to enable them to enrich the splendid record of 
     their stewardship to the Faith in recent years, and enhance 
     the prestige of all three communities, urged them to push 
     still further the outposts of the Faith, both southward and 
     eastward of the present field of their joint labours.  In the 
     island of Ceylon, the Republic of Indonesia and the 
     sovereign State of Siam, which due to their proximity must, 
     sooner or later be opened up to the Faith by these Communities, 
     an effort, however tentative, must be made to 
     establish a nucleus, through the settlement of one or two 
     pioneers which will, as Plans are initiated in the years to 
     come, develop into full-fledged communities capable of 
     illuminating the eastern and southern fringes of the continent 
     of Asia.  
          Through the successful conclusion of this added task to be 
     shouldered by these communities, the believers in these 
     three communities will have contributed, to a marked degree, 
     to the raising to one hundred of the number of countries included 
     within the pale of the ever-advancing Faith of 
     Baha'u'llah.  They will be emulating the example of their 
     American, Canadian and Persian brethren, who, through 
     their respective plans, are hastening this glorious consummation 
     by initiating Baha'i activities in Latin America, in 
     Greenland and New Foundland and the territories of the 
     Arabian Peninsula.  
          Their solid achievements in recent years, the marvellous 
     multiplication of Baha'i Centres, the establishment of befitting 
     national headquarters, the remarkable impetus lent to the 
     translation, publication and dissemination of Baha'i Literature, 
     embolden me to appeal to them, to undertake fresh enterprises, 
     ere the termination of the present Plan, and on however 
     small a scale, beyond the confines of India and Burma.  
          The greater the range of their collective enterprises, the 
     mightier the effusion of the Abha grace from on high, a 
     grace that will sustain, protect, guide and cheer them as they 
 
 
 
+P132 
     tread the stormy yet glorious path of service for the furtherance 
     of their beloved Cause.  
          Let them, at this momentous stage of their historic labours, 
     eliminate, once and for all, every trace of inharmony from 
     their midst, purge their hearts from every lingering suspicion, 
     prejudice and animosity, acquire a clearer vision of the 
     greatness of their Faith and the significance of their mission, 
     give heed to the urgent and tragic needs of the vast multitudes 
     of their disillusioned and sore-tried countrymen, now 
     hungering for the Bread of Life, and arise, as one man, to 
     discharge their sacred and inescapable responsibilities.  The 
     hour is propitious, the situation critical, the Cause infinitely 
     precious, the prize within reach and inexpressibly glorious.  
 
May 8, 1948 
 
 
Old and Tried Community 
 
     The news that from Calcutta two souls have volunteered to 
go forth as pioneers to Siam and Indonesia greatly pleased him.  
Likewise, he was rejoiced to hear a pioneer for Ceylon has been 
found.  
     The Burmese, Indian and Pakistan Baha'is, forming as they 
do a relatively old and tried Community of believers, have 
heavy responsibilities to discharge.  They cannot be looked 
upon as children or youngsters in this great Cause, but rather 
must be considered more in the light of elders, and consequently 
their Baha'i brothers and sisters expect great things of them, 
and look to them for signs of leadership in that part of the 
world!  Therefore, the fulfilment of their Plan, and the sending 
forth of their pioneers to neighbouring Asiatic countries, is of 
crucial importance in maintaining their leadership in this field 
and their prestige in the Baha'i world.  
     He was very glad to see your Assembly has not relaxed its 
efforts in the matter of translating and publishing the Esslemont 
book.  As you know, he considers this a vital service being 
rendered by your Community to not only the peoples of that part 
 
 
 
+P133 
of the world, but to the Faith as a world-wide movement.  He 
has begun to receive lately some of your publications, and 
trusts, now the mails are again running, to receive safely all the 
material you are sending.  
 
 
Arcade of the Shrine of the Bab 
 
     The Foundation of the arcade of the Shrine has now been 
laid and all the heavy threshold stones placed in position.  More 
than half of the stone work ordered in Italy for this first unit 
of the beautiful shell, which will enclose and protect for all-time 
the sacred building built by the beloved Master Himself, has 
now been received on the Shrine property, and plans are being 
made for the next stage of construction to go ahead.  
     This glorious work, so cheering to all our hearts, is, however, 
greatly increasing the burden our beloved Guardian bears, 
and he hopes the friends will understand this when they find 
letters to him can no longer be answered promptly.  At such a 
time, when this country has passed through so much danger and 
difficulty, it is little short of miraculous the way this work on 
the Shrine has been facilitated and protected and gone ahead 
steadily!  It is greatly enhancing the prestige of the Faith here, 
and the authorities have been cooperative and helpful.  
 
 
Grave Challenge 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The communications addressed to me several months ago 
     by your Assembly have, after considerable delay in transmission, 
     reached the Holy Land, and, together with the 
     reports and minutes accompanying them, were read with 
     deep and sustained interest.  
          The tremendous task facing the Baha'i Communities in India, 
     Pakistan and Burma, constitutes a grave challenge to the 
     followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in these countries and 
     must be faced and met with courage, determination and a 
 
 
 
+P134 
     spirit of complete dedication to His Cause.  The disturbances 
     that have so gravely shaken the peoples of these countries, on 
     the morrow of a world-convulsing international conflict; the 
     unfortunate and sudden cessation of communications between 
     these countries and the World Centre of the Faith in the 
     Holy Land during the past year; the fears and anxieties engendered 
     by a steadily deteriorating international situation 
     which cannot but dismay the stoutest hearts, have no doubt 
     contributed, in varying degrees, and in no small measure, to 
     a slowing down of the progress of the collective enterprise, 
     so nobly, so enthusiastically and so energetically initiated by 
     the upholders of the Faith throughout the sub-continent of 
     India and Burma.  
          The reverses they have suffered, with their attendant 
     disappointments, confusion and relaxation of effort, 
     must never be allowed, however short the period remaining 
     before the termination of their Plan, to jeopardize 
     the chance of a success which is still in their power to achieve.  
     They must close their ranks, gird up their loins, rededicate 
     their souls and spirits to the unfinished tasks which face 
     them, purge themselves of every taint of communal prejudice, 
     detach themselves from every thought of self-interest, 
     and arise, while there is yet time, to attain the goals they 
     have pledged themselves to attain.  
          The final phase of the Plan with which they stand identified, 
     and on which their immediate destiny depends, coincides 
     with the hundredth anniversary of the most bloody, tragic 
     and turbulent period in the history of their Faith--a period 
     immortalised by the noblest evidences of Baha'i self-sacrifice, 
     marked by acts of sublime heroism, and ennobled by a spirit 
     of dedication and determination unsurpassed at any subsequent 
     stage in Baha'i history.  Now, if ever, is the time 
     to emulate the example of these heroes, saints and martyrs.  
     Now is the time to pour out one's substance as copiously 
     and as readily, as the Dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age of 
     the Faith have shed their life-blood in the path of this most 
     precious Cause.  No more befitting tribute can be paid to 
     the memory of these luminous souls, by those who carry the 
     torch of Divine Guidance after them, than by a corresponding 
 
 
 
+P135 
     manifestation of solidarity, self-abnegation, zeal and devotion, 
     which will impel them to forsake their homes, sacrifice 
     their treasure, brave every danger, endure every hardship, 
     expend every ounce of energy, that the Plan which they have 
     spontaneously and unitedly sponsored may, through its triumphant 
     termination, carry them a stage further along the 
     broad highway of their destiny.  
          The multiplication of Baha'i Assemblies, at any cost 
     and with the utmost speed; the reconstitution of 
     dissolved Assemblies, however great the effort required; 
     the completion of the translation into, and the 
     printing of the New Era, in the few remaining languages, 
     within the shortest possible time, the despatch of no more 
     than one pioneer, to the neighbouring Island of Ceylon, to 
     Siam and to Indonesia, ere the termination of the closing year 
     of the Plan--these stand out as the immediate requirements 
     of the present challenging hour--requirements that the prosecutors 
     of the Plan must meet.  The eyes of their fellow-workers 
     in East and West, are fixed upon them.  The Concourse 
     on high watches their actions, and stands ready to 
     bless and reinforce their labours.  The Centre of the Covenant 
     Himself is eagerly waiting to witness the evidences of 
     their victory, and will no doubt intercede, on their behalf, 
     before the throne of Baha'u'llah, if they but arise resolutely 
     and spur their chargers into the arena of service.  
          The sands are indeed running out.  The task that remains to 
     be accomplished is indeed colossal.  The distractions, temptations, 
     and pitfalls that might interfere with its consummation 
     are many and varied.  The resources however spiritual 
     and material still at the disposal of the members of these 
     communities, are still adequate, if they but resolve to utilize 
     them, to the needs of the present hour.  The blessings from 
     on high, ready to be showered upon them, are more than 
     adequate to ensure their complete and total victory.  So much 
     hangs on the fortunes of the present Plan!  So much must 
     necessarily depend on the manner and the spirit in which 
     they discharge their terrific responsibilities, during the few 
     fleeting months still allotted them ere the expiry of the Plan!  
 
 
 
+P136 
     I entreat them, with all the fervour of my soul, not to allow 
     this golden opportunity to slip from their grasp.  They have, 
     in the past, proved themselves capable, in times of crisis, of 
     overleaping the most formidable barriers, and of wresting 
     victory from the jaws of impending defeat.  Theirs is the 
     opportunity, now if ever, to demonstrate a similar resolution, 
     a no less spectacular outburst of enthusiasm, an even 
     nobler heroism and self-sacrifice than they have ever shown 
     in the past.  
          Then, and only then, will the next stage in the evolution of 
     their common destiny be unveiled to their eyes.  Then, and 
     only then, will the call summoning them to press forward to 
     yet another landmark in their history be sounded.  Then, and 
     only then, will a still fuller measure of heavenly prizes be 
     laid up for them in reward for their inestimable and arduous 
     services in the treasuries of the Abha Kingdom by Him who 
     alone knows how to re-ignite His faithful servants.

Superstructure of the Shrine of the Bab 
 
     He would like you to please thank on his behalf those friends 
who have forwarded Huquq to him and contributions for the 
building of the Super-structure of the Bab's Shrine.  
     This building is now beginning to take shape and promises 
to be very beautiful, befitting and dignified.  It is the realization 
of the fond hope of the beloved Master, who stated to Badi 
Bushrui one day, as He looked up at the building He Himself 
had already completed:  "The Shrine is as yet unbuilt....  God 
willing, it will be built.  We have brought it up to this stage."  
     The friends should be told this, as many of them do not 
realize it was the Master's own plan to go much further, and 
erect a dome over the Resting Place of the Bab.  
 
 
 
+P137 
Keep in Close Touch With Pioneers 
 
     The Guardian desires your Assembly to keep in close touch 
with your pioneers abroad and give them strong moral, as well 
as financial support.  It will please you to know two Dutch 
Baha'is are going out to Indonesia, and he has asked them to 
communicate with your Assembly and cooperate with you in 
spreading the Faith there and in having at least a pamphlet, to 
begin with, translated into the most needed native language.  
     His heart has been very anxious over the fate of the believers 
in Burma, and it relieved him greatly to hear that you received 
news they were safe.  Please assure them his loving prayers are 
with them and offered for their protection.  
 
 
End of Six-Year Plan Approaches 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          As the end of the Plan to which your community stands 
     committed inexorably approaches, my anxious thoughts increasingly 
     turn towards you and your fellow workers, on 
     whose shoulders a staggering responsibility--grave as well as 
     inescapable--is weighing so heavily in these days.  I am fully 
     aware of the character of the manifold and unexpected trials 
     this community has been called upon to face in India, Pakistan 
     and Burma since its inception.  The ordeal of internal 
     disorder and of civil strife; the dislocation of the machinery 
     of internal administration, the inevitable consequence 
     of the vast political changes that have been effected in these 
     countries; the reverses suffered by this same community 
     through the temporary seizure of its newly acquired administrative 
     headquarters and the loss of some of its precious 
     assets in both India and Burma; the hardships endured by 
     the pioneers of this community as well as its administrators 
     as a consequence of severely imposed restrictions, outbursts 
     of fanaticism and civil riots--have been such as to dismay 
     the stoutest heart and tax to the uttermost the determination 
     of the most resolute.  
 
 
 
+P138 
     And yet, in spite of these successive afflictions the members 
     of this community have forged ahead, valiantly, unitedly and 
     determinedly, and have even extended the original range of 
     their Plan by embarking on fresh and historical enterprises 
     beyond the confines of these territories, through the despatch 
     of pioneers to the neighbouring Dominion of Ceylon and the 
     adjacent Kingdom of Siam and the Republic of Indonesia.  
     Whatever the fate of the Plan which they are now seeking 
     to bring to its consummation, this striking evidence of the 
     indomitable spirit of faith that animates the rank and file of 
     this community, and which has prompted it to seek fresh 
     laurels in virgin territories beyond the frontiers of its homeland, 
     will, without the slightest doubt, redound eternally to 
     its credit, and be abundantly rewarded by a vigilant and all-Bountiful 
     Master.  
          To enhance the value of so rich a prize won, in so 
     short a period, by a community so burdened by cares 
     and anxieties, in territories for the most part overshadowed 
     by discord and internal revolution, through the triumphant 
     conclusion of the major task entrusted to its hands, 
     and the successful conclusion of the second collective enterprise 
     embarked upon by its indefatigable and resolute members, 
     on the morrow of a world-encircling conflict, must now 
     be the paramount and all-absorbing purpose of all who are 
     privileged to participate in this mighty endeavour.  Time is 
     short.  Every week is precious.  The resources of the community, 
     financial, moral and spiritual are, I firmly believe, 
     adequate to meet the needs of this critical hour.  So golden 
     an opportunity, if missed, will not recur for who knows how 
     extensive a period.  The launching of subsequent enterprises 
     destined to culminate in the triumph and ascendancy of a 
     struggling Faith in the subcontinent of India, as well 
     as in the establishment of its institutions in South-East 
     Asia, will be inevitably and indefinitely postponed.  
          Undaunted by the setbacks it has experienced; heartened 
     by the settlement and the initial victory won by its 
     pioneers in the newly opened virgin territories in the 
     North, the South and the East; fully conscious of its ability 
 
 
 
+P139 
     to perform adequately its task and discharge befittingly its 
     responsibility; relying on the unfailing grace of an all-Powerful, 
     ever solicitous, continually watching Providence; deriving 
     fresh inspiration and confidence from the amazing feat 
     achieved, by the small band of its brethren, in the West, and 
     in a continent more devastated by the ravages of war than 
     any other continent of the globe; let this community, while 
     time still remains, gird up its loins, sink its differences, rededicate 
     itself to its urgent task, sweep away every barrier that 
     confronts it, and rise, with an upsurge of unprecedented 
     enthusiasm and determination, to those heights to which its 
     spiritual destiny is now beckoning it.  
          With a heart, aglow with gratitude for what 
     this community has in the initial stage of its administrative 
     development accomplished, filled with confidence 
     in the potentialities with which our beloved 
     Master has endowed it in the years of His earthly ministry, 
     and overflowing with love for those who, through their incessant 
     labours and heroic self-sacrifice, have achieved unforgettable 
     victories in recent years, I will continue to supplicate 
     for all its members, at home and abroad, in their administrative 
     spheres of activity as well as in the teaching field 
     such blessings as will enable them to crown their concerted 
     efforts with a success that will resound throughout the 
     Baha'i world.

Arcade of the Shrine 
 
     The past winter and spring have been very arduous months 
for our beloved Guardian and very anxious ones.  As you 
know, he has been pressing the work on the arcade of the Shrine 
of the Bab in order to have it completed by the Centenary of 
His martyrdom.  As the arcade which fits about and protects 
the Holy Tomb, built by our beloved Master, is considerably 
larger than the original edifice, it has been necessary to excavate 
the mountain immediately behind the Shrine, and this very difficult 
work was carried out under the close and constant supervision 
of the Guardian himself in order to ensure it was accomplished 
safely, quickly and economically.  This absorbed, for 
 
 
 
+P140 
many months, his precious time and energies.  When this was 
accomplished he looked forward to turning his attention to the 
various National Assembly letters piled up, but, unfortunately, 
Mr. Maxwell, the architect of the Shrine, became dangerously 
ill at the beginning of April, and is still in hospital.  His condition 
was so grave that for weeks our Guardian and household 
were prevented from concentrating on the many tasks waiting to 
be attended to owing to the constant anxiety, the coming and 
going of doctors, etc.  He feels you should be informed of these 
facts as an explanation of the long delay in hearing from him.  
Mr. Maxwell, thanks to the mercy of God and the determination 
of the Guardian, is now recovering, and we hope will live to 
continue his work on the Shrine.  
     The contributions sent by the Indian believers for the Holy 
Shrine were very much appreciated.  Ever since the Burmese 
friends contributed the Sarcophagus for the Holy Remains, the 
friends in that part of the world have been linked with this 
sacred enterprise.  Their joy will be great when, once the pilgrimage 
can be resumed, their eyes fall upon the beauty of this 
Shrine.  
 
 
Baha'is May Join Non-Partisan Organisations 
 
     There is no objection to the Baha'is associating with such 
organisations as the World Government Organisation.  The 
instructions he gave to the British Baha'is may be followed.  
However, great care should be taken to make sure these organisations 
are absolutely non-partisan in their political views and 
lean neither to East or West.  
 
 
A Baha'i Cannot be a Theosophist 
 
     A Baha'i cannot at the same time be a theosophist; many 
theosophists have become believers and very enlightened ones, 
but as we do not believe in reincarnation we obviously cannot be 
active as theosophists and Baha'is at the same time.  
 
 
Killing of a Believer in Kamarhatti 
 
     The tragic killing of a believer in Kamarhatti grieved the 
 
 
 
+P141 
Guardian very much.  If you are in touch with any of the relatives 
please convey his sympathy to them, and assure them of his 
prayers.  Terrible as persecution is, we must always remember 
that it waters the tree of Religion, and that from such deeds as 
this the believers--far from being cowed and silenced--must derive 
inspiration and courage.  
 
 
Convention Delegates 
 
     The Guardian feels that, if a delegate is elected to represent 
an Assembly (or community having Assembly status) during 
the administrative year in which the Assembly existed he is 
properly qualified, even if at Ridvan that community falls back 
to group status.  A community, however, which reverts to 
group status at Ridvan cannot have a delegate to the following 
year's Convention.  
 
 
No Effort is Too Great 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The severe restrictions to which the dearly-loved, highly 
     devoted, long struggling Baha'i community of India, Pakistan 
     and Burma have been subjected, the repeated setbacks 
     they have suffered, the grave disturbances in the wake of 
     which their manifold and meritorious activities have been 
     caught, evoke my heartfelt sympathy and arouse my deep 
     concern.  The spirit which, despite adversities, delays and 
     dislocations, they have consistently manifested in recent years 
     is, however, worthy of the highest praise, and will, no doubt, 
     triumph over every obstacle, and will enable them to weather 
     every storm and win ultimate victory.  
          Though the course of the Plan they spontaneously undertook 
     has, of necessity, been affected by these constant vicissitudes 
     and unexpected developments, their achievements, beyond 
     the confines of their homelands, as well as in the publishing 
     field, have ennobled the record of their service to the Cause 
     of Baha'u'llah, and constitute a memorable chapter in the 
     history of the Faith in the sub-continent of India.  
 
 
 
+P142 
          The translation and publication of the "New Era" in more 
     than twenty languages in recent years, the planting of the 
     banner of the Faith in the Island of Ceylon, the Republic 
     of Indonesia and the Kingdom of Siam--though not originally 
     an integral part of their Plan--has signalized the 
     opening of a new epoch in the evolution of the Faith in 
     South Eastern Asia, and has marked the formal association 
     of the Indian the Pakistani and Burmese believers with 
     their brethren in Europe, America, Egypt and Persia, in 
     carrying the torch of the Faith beyond the confines of their 
     respective continents and countries, and in executing the 
     last wishes of the Centre of the Covenant so movingly expressed 
     in His Will [&amp;and] Testament.  
          Whatever these communities, so valiantly labouring in that 
     disturbed and strife-ridden corner of the Asiatic continent, 
     undertake to perform within the confines of their homelands 
     in the years ahead, this double process of extending the range 
     of the literature of the Faith and of propagating its Message 
     within the virgin territories, lying to the North and South-East 
     of their native lands, must continue with undiminished 
     momentum, and must receive the undivided attention of 
     the elected representatives of these communities.  
          Consolidation at home, and the provision of the necessary 
     measures to ensure the speedy and effective extension of 
     the influence of the Faith abroad, constitute the dual, the 
     immediate and inescapable responsibilities of all the members 
     of these communities, who are labouring, at so critical 
     a period, with such steadfast zeal and devotion, amidst the 
     masses of their fearful and harassed countrymen, for so 
     lofty an ideal and so precious a Faith.  
          Firmly united in their purpose, banishing, once and 
     for all, every trace of estrangement and prejudice 
     from their midst, assured of the all-compelling, ever-sustaining 
     power of Baha'u'llah, deriving fresh inspiration 
     from the triumphs collectively achieved by their 
     brethren in all continents of the globe, undeflected 
     in their resolve by any setback, opposition or injustice, let 
     them, with so notable a record of service behind them, 
     march resistlessly forward, entering still wider fields, scaling 
 
 
 
+P143 
     nobler heights, plumbing still greater depths of heroism and 
     self-sacrifice.  
          As the Centenary of the birth of Baha'u'llah's prophetic 
     mission approaches, these sorely tried, much loved, indefatigable 
     communities, must brace themselves, however 
     challenging future circumstances may prove to be, however 
     arduous the tasks they are called upon to discharge, to 
     contribute, in whatever, way possible in whatever field they 
     may find it practicable, a memorable share to the collective 
     tribute which the followers of the Most Great Name are 
     now arising to pay, through action in the field of service, 
     to the Founder of their Faith on the occasion of the 
     hundredth anniversary of the inception of His Revelation.  
          The hour is indeed both precious and propitious.  The 
     opportunity is glorious and will not recur in the lifetime of 
     this generation.  No effort is too great to ensure the 
     success of so historic a commemoration.  Time is short 
     for an adequate preparation for the celebration, through 
     collective and sound achievement, of so great a jubilee.  All 
     must arise and contribute a share worthy of the name they 
     bear and of the privilege bestowed upon them.  
          That all three communities may rise to this occasion, may 
     rededicate themselves with renewed resolve and fresh 
     vigour, is my ardent and constant prayer.

Photos of the Arcade of the Shrine 
 
     Under separate cover two enlargements of the arcade of the 
Shrine of the Bab have been mailed you.  The Guardian wishes 
this gift from him to be shown to the believers as widely as possible, 
and then be hung in the National Headquarters.  
     He has sent the American N.S.A. two negatives of the 
Shrine, and the Baha'is can order from the States copies if they 
desire to purchase some.  
     He feels it will make the friends happy to see the beauty 
 
 
 
+P144 
of this blessed building so dear to all our hearts.  
 
November 2, 1950 
 
 
Inter-Assembly Conferences 
 
     He was very pleased to see that the policy of holding inter-assembly 
conferences has been adopted and is meeting with 
success; and he urges your Assembly to encourage the believers 
to hold more of such gatherings.  It cannot but have a stimulating 
effect upon the teaching work, and inspire the friends to 
make greater efforts in their respective communities.  
 
 
Assembly in Moulmein, Burma 
 
     The news of the formation of an Assembly in Moulmein 
pleased him very much; and he wishes you to assure the 
believers there that he will pray for them in the Holy Shrines.  
The devotion and loyalty of the Burmese believers, in the face 
of so much turmoil in their native land, has aroused his admiration 
and increased his affection for this long-standing Baha'i 
Community, so persevering and so attached to the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah.  
 
 
Centenary Pamphlet Excellent 
 
     In connection with your publications, he would like to say 
that he found your "Centenary of the Martyrdom of the Bab" 
pamphlet excellent in every way, and was delighted to see that 
the Indian Baha'is had shown so much initiative in getting out 
this memorial pamphlet.  
 
 
Increase the Number of Delegates to 95 
 
     The increase in the number of delegates to 95 is an important 
milestone in the history of the Cause in those parts; and he 
feels that the friends, proud of the progress they have made, 
should determine that the coming Convention will be distinguished 
 
 
 
+P145 
as one of the most harmonious and constructive ever 
held.  
 
 
Pioneering to Siam 
 
     The Guardian is very anxious that pioneer activities should 
be carried forward in Siam; and he urges your Assembly to 
push this matter further, and ... send some other pioneer 
there.  
 
 
Registration of Assemblies 
 
     The Guardian hopes that wherever you have a strongly 
established Spiritual Assembly, you will make every effort to 
register it legally, as he attaches great importance to the registration 
and incorporation of Spiritual Assemblies, and hopes 
that you will make every effort to add to their number in areas 
under your jurisdiction.  
 
 
Contribution for the Shrine of the Bab 
 
     The contributions sent by the believers for the construction 
of the Tomb of the Bab have been deeply appreciated by our 
beloved Guardian.  It is only right that this old Baha'i Community, 
so tried in the fire of tests, and having been in existence 
from practically the days of the beloved Bab Himself, should 
play a part in building his sepulchre.  The Guardian is now 
undertaking the second phase of the construction work, which 
involves raising the Edifice above the level of the original Tomb.  
 
 
Baha'is Cannot Become Freemasons 
 
     The Guardian does not consider it advisable for Baha'is to 
become Freemasons.  
 
 
Reviewing of Baha'i Books 
 
     ...Local Spiritual Assemblies are not empowered to review 
material which is for national circulation.  The Guardian thinks 
 
 
 
+P146 
that your Assembly, or the Committee that you delegate such 
authority to, should review the pamphlet in question; and if 
it is in accordance with the Teachings, there is certainly no 
reason why it should not be circulated; but in the future, the 
Spiritual Assemblies should be more careful about publishing 
literature which is for more than local use.  
 
 
Pioneers for Indonesia and Siam 
 
     In closing, he would like to urge the members of your 
Assembly to redouble your efforts to assist pioneers to go forth 
to Indonesia and Siam.  The extraordinary success the promulgation 
of the Faith has met with in Ceylon should be sufficient 
evidence for all concerned of the way in which God strengthens 
the endeavours of His servants, and blesses their seed-sowing, 
and brings it to harvest.  He hopes that many of the believers, 
not only in India, but in Pakistan and Burma as well, will 
volunteer to go forth as pioneers, and will make every effort to 
do so.  
     The success of your past endeavours should encourage you 
all and the Community whom you represent, to forge ahead, 
unmindful of obstacles, and forgetful of personal differences of 
opinion in one united and unanimous effort to carry out all 
the work you have set for yourselves and achieve all your 
goals.  
 
 
Great Historic Enterprise 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The communications received in recent months from your 
     Assembly testify to the perseverance and devotion with 
     which the Baha'i Communities of India, Pakistan and Burma 
     have pursued the course of their activities in the face of 
     manifold obstacles and trials and despite the severity of 
     the problems which have confronted them since the outbreak 
     of the political disturbances that have agitated the Indian 
     sub-continent.  Though suffering from various reverses, 
     though afflicted with disappointment, though sustaining 
     repeated losses they have persevered in their labours, widened 
     the scope of their task, pushed further the outposts of 
 
 
 
+P147 
     the Faith, and won their initial victories beyond the confines 
     of their respective homelands.  
          In the field of Baha'i publications, in the publicity given to 
     the Baha'i teachings, in their negotiations with the civil 
     authorities under whose jurisdiction they function, in their 
     constant encouragement and support of the pioneers labouring 
     both at home and abroad, the national elected representatives 
     of these communities have, likewise, demonstrated 
     a spirit of dedication, a zeal and fidelity worthy of the 
     highest praise.  
          The great historic enterprise launched by them in recent 
     years in the neighbouring territories of Ceylon, Siam, Indonesia 
     and the Malayan Peninsula,--a vast and highly 
     meritorious undertaking still in its initial stage of development, 
     and conferring a great and imperishable lustre on 
     its valiant initiators--must be energetically prosecuted notwithstanding 
     the unsettled political situation prevailing in 
     those territories, and however threatening the clouds gathering 
     on the international horizon.  The movement and settlement 
     of pioneers throughout India, Pakistan and Burma 
     must, moreover, continue unabated and must be paralleled 
     by a steady multiplication of Baha'i Centres and the consolidation 
     of nascent institutions, the negotiations with the civil 
     authorities, however disillusioning and unfruitful they have 
     been so far in their results, must continue to be conducted 
     with extreme vigilance and unrelaxing vigour.  The highly 
     commendable task of completing the translation and publication 
     of the "New Era" in the languages already chosen 
     should be promptly and befittingly consummated.  The 
     efforts exerted to publicize the Faith, disseminate its teachings 
     and spread its fame, should be redoubled by all administrative 
     agencies concerned with this vital sphere of Baha'i 
     activity.  The sacred duty of deepening and enriching the 
     spiritual life of the newly enrolled believers should be faithfully 
     discharged by both the local and national elected 
     representatives of these communities.  The added responsibility 
     of contributing to the raising of the superstructure of 
     the Bab's holy Sepulchre, now entering upon the second 
 
 
 
+P148 
     phase of its construction, and of speeding its consummation 
     in view of the increasingly critical world condition, should 
     be valiantly faced and nobly discharged.  Above all, the inescapable 
     obligation of guarding the integrity of the Faith, 
     of preserving the unity of its followers, and of reinforcing 
     its spiritual and administrative foundations, must be continually 
     borne in mind not only by the representatives of these 
     communities but by every individual believer labouring for 
     the good name and the glorification of the Cause of 
     Baha'u'llah.  
          The Baha'i Communities of the Indian sub-continent and of 
     Burma constituting the largest entity throughout the Orient, 
     next to the body of believers residing in the Cradle of the 
     Faith, and enjoying, unlike their Eastern sister communities 
     in Persia, Egypt and Iraq, the blessings of relative freedom 
     from repression or persecution, and including within their 
     fold a greater variety of races, creeds and tongues than 
     any of their sister communities throughout the world, are 
     faced with both a peculiar challenge and a unique opportunity.  
     The resources at their disposal, the privileges they 
     possess, the facilities they enjoy should, with clear vision, 
     with confident hearts and inflexible resolve, be consecrated 
     to the noble objectives which it is their mission to pursue.  
     Conscious of their high calling, aware of the potentialities 
     with which their homelands have been endowed, these communities, 
     placing their reliance on the all-conquering power 
     of Baha'u'llah must unitedly arise, however numerous the 
     barriers imposed between them, to achieve their destiny, and 
     contribute collectively and effectively, to the world-wide propagation, 
     the universal recognition and ultimate world 
     triumph of the Cause of Baha'u'llah.  
 
March 10, 1951 
 
 
Increase of Believers in Benares 
 
     The wonderful news of the increase of believers in the 
Benares area, thanks largely to the heroic determination and 
 
 
 
+P149 
great faith of Mr. Badi-uz-Zaman, brought great happiness to 
the Guardian.  Please assure this devoted soul that the Guardian 
is very pleased about the wonderful services he is rendering the 
Cause of God, and that he is praying for him to be richly blessed 
by Baha'u'llah.  He has suffered from the enemies of the 
Cause, but his reward will be very great!  
 
 
Teaching in South-East Asia 
 
     It brought great joy to the Guardian's heart to see there are 
so many believers now in the area of South-East Asia.  This 
marks a new epoch in the unfoldment of our Faith and an 
important one.  Just as Ceylon, at one time empty of believers, 
has now developed an active and devoted community of Baha'is, 
so now, in these far-flung territories, Assemblies and groups 
must be built up....  He urges the younger believers, who are less 
held down by family ties, to make an effort to migrate there 
and seek employment.  
 
 
The 19-Month Plan 
 
     He was delighted over the formulation of your Assembly's 
19-Month Plan.  This spirit of initiative shown by you is highly 
commendable, and he hopes that all the Baha'is, whether of 
Indian or Persian origin, will arise to unitedly see it achieve its 
goals.  Determination, courage, faith and perseverance are 
necessary if the Plan is to be a success, but he feels sure the 
friends will not hesitate to demonstrate their capacity to meet 
the challenge it presents.  
 
 
Pioneers to Settle in Africa 
 
     He, likewise, wishes to call special attention to the work in 
Africa which is very promising and which is going ahead very 
well.  Your Assembly must do all it can to speedily get pioneers 
settled in the two countries allotted to you as your portion in 
this historic campaign.  Also, you should keep in close touch 
with the British NSA as they are the co-ordinators of this work, 
and well situated in order to give advice as English experts, 
 
 
 
+P150 
having had such a long contact with Africa, its peoples and 
problems, are available in London and elsewhere for consultation 
with the British Africa Committee.  
 
 
19-Month Plan--Third of its Kind 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The initiation of the 19-Month Plan by the elected representatives 
     of the Baha'i Communities of the sub-continent 
     of India and of Burma--the third of its kind undertaken by 
     them since the inception of the epoch marking the commencement 
     of the Formative Age of the Baha'i Dispensation--
     evokes my deepest admiration.  Through this spontaneous act, 
     momentous in its consequences, and eloquently testifying to 
     the initiative, the zeal and the valour of the followers of 
     Baha'u'llah in India, Pakistan and Burma, the body of 
     their elected national representatives can well boast of the 
     distinction it has achieved, throughout the Baha'i world 
     through the successive formulation of no less than three far-reaching 
     Plans since the inauguration of the First Epoch 
     in the history of the systematic prosecution of Abdu'l-Baha's 
     Divine Plan.  This striking demonstration of their resourcefulness 
     and dedication to the interests of the Faith is, indeed, 
     highly praiseworthy, extremely encouraging and augurs 
     well for the future of the Mission which it is theirs to 
     carry out, in the years to come, not only in that subcontinent 
     and the adjoining territories and neighbouring islands, but 
     in South Asia as well.  
          They cannot, however, ensure the success of the Plan they 
     have devised, unless the unity and solidarity of those who 
     are participating in its execution, and above all the harmony 
     of the body directing its operation, are safeguarded, maintained 
     and consolidated.  Time is pressing.  The issues 
     involved are momentous.  The centenary celebrations of the 
     birth of Baha'u'llah's prophetic Mission will soon be upon 
     us.  The inauguration of the first organized Crusade, in 
     which several Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies, in no 
     less than four continents of the globe will be intimately 
     associated, for the purpose of proclaiming the Message of 
 
 
 
+P151 
     Baha'u'llah in the South Pacific Islands as well as in South 
     Eastern Asia, must directly depend upon the successful conclusion 
     of the Plan now envisaged.  The obligations involved 
     in, and the privileges conferred by, such an association
     --an association that will find its parallel in the collective 
     and organized effort now being exerted in the African Continent, 
     as well as in the joint campaign destined to be launched, 
     by other national Baha'i communities, in both Northern 
     and North Eastern Asia,--are at once sacred and unique.  
     Their significance, at this early stage, cannot be fully apprehended.  
     It is not for them, however, to attempt at the 
     present time, to assess their value.  Theirs, rather, is the 
     duty, to avoid any action or thought that might delay the 
     unfoldment of so glorious a Plan or damage so splendid a 
     destiny.  
          The members of all the communities participating in this 
     Nineteen-Month Plan, which may be regarded as a prelude 
     to the mighty and historic Crusade, of still vaster dimensions 
     and nobler scope, that is to be launched in the future, 
     irrespective of race, creed, or class, of either sex and of every 
     age, must rise as one man to the occasion that now presents 
     itself.  
          No trace of bickering, no consciousness of racial distinction, 
     no petty jealousies, must be allowed, under any circumstances, 
     to darken the glorious prospect opening before 
     them.  They must neither flinch, nor hesitate nor lose sight, 
     however briefly, of the distant and shining goal.  An all-powerful, 
     all-loving, all-Bountiful Master, watching their 
     exertions from on high, will, surely, bless their effort, will 
     intercede on their behalf before the throne of His all-glorious 
     Father, and will, if they persevere in their high endeavours, 
     render them victorious.  
          I, for my part, will, with a prayerful heart, follow the course 
     of their activities, and will continue to lend them whatever 
     assistance that lies in my power, for the complete discharge 
     of their inescapable duty and the total fulfilment of their 
     united pledge to the Author of their Faith.

First Pilgrims from India 
 
     It has been a great pleasure to the beloved Guardian to 
welcome recently in Haifa the first pilgrims from India; their 
love and devotion to the Faith have brought their brethren in 
that far-off land very close, and he hopes that they, in turn, 
will carry back to the friends there a new sense of nearness to 
the World Center at Haifa, and thus serve to create greater unity 
and dedication amongst the believers.  
 
 
Inter-Continental Conference 
 
     The Guardian attaches the greatest possible importance to 
the forthcoming Inter-continental Conference to be held during 
the Holy Year in New Delhi; as the National Assemblies of 
Persia, United States, Canada, Central and South America, 
Iraq, Australia and New Zealand, as well as your own body, are 
to send representatives to it, it will, through having eight N.S.A.s 
pooling their thoughts and suggestions, be, no doubt, the 
most important of the four Inter-continental Conferences to be 
held.  Also, aside from the numerical importance of the participating 
bodies, the vast field their plans must embrace is truly 
awe-inspiring.  In view of this he feels that the members of 
your Assembly have very heavy responsibilities to discharge 
during the coming months, and that all petty details and 
misunderstandings must be put aside, once and for all, in 
order to ensure a brilliant success--a success, whose repercussions 
must be felt during ten years of Baha'i history between 
this coming great Jubilee and the Most Great Jubilee which will 
take place in 1963.  
     As convenor of this great Conference you must lay your 
plans very carefully to ensure that the representatives of the 
various N.S.A.s., the visiting Hands of the Cause, the many 
Baha'is attending, are properly accommodated, the sessions of 
the Conference held in an efficient manner, and suitable 
publicity given to this event.  The Guardian also suggests that 
one or two private sessions could be held at which the 
 
 
 
+P153 
N.S.A. representatives and the Hands of the Cause could meet 
to better and more effectively suggest plans for the future campaign.  
There will, naturally, be no delegates to the Conference, 
as it is in no sense a convention, but more concentrated 
consultation can be obtained through a smaller number being 
present.  No doubt you will also, without sacrificing the interests 
of the Conference, make good use of any visiting teachers and 
lecturers.  
 
 
No Harm in Taking Part in Dramas 
 
     In the teachings there is nothing against dancing, but the 
friends should remember that the standard of Baha'u'llah is 
modesty and chastity.  The atmosphere of modern dance halls, 
where so much smoking and drinking and promiscuity goes on, 
is very bad, but decent dances are not harmful in themselves.  
There is certainly no harm in classical dancing or learning 
dancing in school.  There is also no harm in taking part in 
dramas.  Likewise in cinema acting.  The harmful thing, nowadays, 
is not the art itself but the unfortunate corruption 
which often surrounds these arts.  As Baha'is we need avoid 
none of the arts, but acts and the atmosphere that sometimes 
go with these professions we should avoid.  
 
 
Encouraging the Hindu Baha'is 
 
     As regards the question you asked about minorities:  because 
the Hindu believers are a minority at present in the 
Faith in India, preference should be given to them in India, 
where the majority of the population is Hindu.  A special effort 
should be made to convert them, so that our enemies may have 
no excuse for stating that the Cause has scarcely affected the 
largest elements in the country.  There is also an added reason 
for encouraging the Hindu Baha'is because within the Faith in 
India they are a minority.  In every country throughout the 
Baha'i World the Baha'is must make a special effort to attract 
to the Faith the element which constitutes the majority, whether 
religious or national.  
 
 
 
+P154 
The Work is Still Formidable 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The multiplicity of the vital issues that have of late confronted 
     me at the World Centre of the Faith, the opening of the 
     door of pilgrimage, and the unexpected problems which, by 
     their urgency, have required my immediate and close attention 
     have, to my extreme regret, prevented me from acknowledging, 
     as promptly as I would have wished the communications 
     which various Baha'i National Assemblies have 
     addressed me in recent months.  I have followed, however, 
     with admiration and keen interest the progress of the activities 
     initiated under the 19-Month Plan by the valiant 
     Baha'i Communities of India, Pakistan and Burma.  The 
     generous, unceasing contributions made by them for the 
     completion of the Bab's holy Sepulchre proclaim, in unmistakable 
     terms, their devotion to the Cause for which He laid 
     down so heroically His life.  The expansion of the activities 
     initiated by the high-minded and resolute pioneers in Ceylon, 
     Indonesia, Siam, Malaya and Sarawak indeed merit the 
     highest praise.  The efforts exerted for the multiplication of 
     the institutions of the Faith and their consolidation both in 
     the subcontinent of India and beyond its confines augur well 
     for the future of the Plan, the third of its kind embarked 
     upon by the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, who are 
     destined to play a predominant part in the unfoldment of 
     His World Order throughout the territories of South East 
     Asia.  The steady endeavours made for the translation, publication 
     and dissemination of the literature of the Faith by 
     your Assembly have greatly enriched and ennobled the 
     record of the services you have rendered it in recent years.  
          Great as have been the victories already won in its service, 
     the work that still remains to be accomplished under this 
     same Plan during the fleeting months that lie ahead is still 
     formidable, and demands unrelaxing vigilance, heroic self-sacrifice, 
     and inflexible resolve on the part of not only the 
     elected representatives of these communities but of all their 
     members as well.  The uninterrupted and rapid multiplication 
     of Baha'i administrative centres; the conversion of groups 
     into assemblies; the development of isolated centers into 
 
 
 
+P155 
     groups; a marked increase in the number of incorporated 
     Local Assemblies; the early completion of the highly important 
     task assumed in connexion with the translation and 
     publication of the New Era in the remaining languages already 
     selected for that purpose; the despatch, without further 
     delay, of no more than one pioneer for the present to Nepal 
     and Indo-China, as well as to Zanzibar and Madagascar, in 
     pursuance of the Plan initiated in both Africa and South 
     East Asia; the maintenance, at any cost, of the present status 
     of the newly formed assemblies; the concentration of effort 
     for the promotion of unity and cooperation among the divers 
     elements that constitute the warp and woof of these communities
     --these stand out as the predominating obligations 
     facing the entire body of the followers of the Faith in the 
     subcontinent of India and its neighbouring territories.  
          Nor must the privileged members of these communities, and 
     particularly their elected representatives, neglect, for a moment, 
     the paramount duty, of preparing, by every means at 
     their disposal, for the historic and in some respects, the 
     most vital, Conference to be held in the course of the Holy 
     Year which the entire Baha'i world will soon befittingly 
     celebrate.  As the Convenor of such a fate-laden Conference, 
     whose task is to facilitate the execution of the most far-reaching, 
     the most challenging, and the most dramatic of all the 
     enterprises destined to be launched by the followers of the 
     Faith throughout the whole planet, your Assembly assumes 
     a responsibility at once immense, soul-stirring and inescapable.  
          In providing adequate facilities for the accommodation of 
     the Hands of the Cause and of the official representatives of 
     no less than eight National Spiritual Assemblies and of the 
     large number of visitors who will participate in its proceedings; 
     in ensuring wide publicity through the press and radio 
     for such a unique gathering; in exerting their utmost for the 
     maintenance of harmony and for full consultation on the 
     weighty issues that will face its attendants; in fostering the 
     spirit of heroic adventure and noble resolve on the part of 
     the members of the communities that are to act as hosts to 
     the honoured participants of such an epoch-making assemblage, 
 
 
 
+P156 
     which will, God willing, enable them to play a notable 
     role in the Crusade destined to embrace the continents of 
     Asia and Australasia and of the Pacific Islands--in all these 
     the members of your Assembly, supported by the rank and 
     file of the faithful, must display a determination, a valour and 
     consecration that will excite the admiration of the entire 
     Baha'i world.  
          The work that calls for unswerving fidelity, urgent attention 
     and continuous vigilance, during the swiftly passing months 
     ahead, is immense, truly sacred and infinitely meritorious.  
     The consummation of the Plan already initiated would constitute 
     the best preparation for the assumption of the 
     still greater functions, and the discharge of still weightier 
     responsibilities, that await the patiently labouring, 
     the steadfast, the loyal and devoted followers of the Most 
     Great Name in India, Pakistan and Burma.  That they 
     may victoriously discharge their present responsibilities, 
     that they may befittingly embark on the glorious Mission 
     that lies ahead of them, that they may distinguish themselves 
     through their collective contribution to the success of the 
     World Crusade soon to be inaugurated by the followers of 
     Baha'u'llah in both the East and the West, is the object 
     of my constant prayer and one of the most cherished desires 
     of my heart.

No Age Limit for Serving the Cause 
 
     There is no age limit whatsoever for serving the Cause in 
administrative capacities after one has reached twenty-one years.  
Indeed we are supposed to serve the Cause to our last breath.  
 
 
Contributions Not Accepted From Those 
Whose Voting Rights are Suspended 
 
     As regards the question of accepting contributions from 
people whose voting rights are suspended, the Guardian says 
this is not permissible.  
 
 
 
+P157 
Answer to Various Questions 
 
     Local Haziras may be converted to National ones; this is 
premature at present.  
     The recognition of our Laws of Personal Status must naturally 
precede formation of Baha'i courts; as long as your 
translation is correct his approval is not needed.  
     You should start a Temple Fund; the site need not exceed 
two or three acres, and should be inside Delhi or near the city 
limits.  
     You will be able to consult with the members of Australian 
N.S.A. at the time of the Conference in New Delhi about literature; 
they will certainly assist your Assembly with the publications.  
     Baha'is from India, Pakistan and Burma are eligible for your 
Asian Teaching Committee.  
     Consolidation can mean the establishment of the institutions 
you enumerate, but it is not essential at present; to increase 
the assemblies and groups, and bring in new believers, is the 
most important part of consolidation; as the plan unfolds, he 
will have to see what other things are really essential and call 
your attention to them.  
 
 
Consolidation of the Manifold Institutions 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The splendid efforts, so devotedly exerted by the members 
     of the Baha'i communities in India, Pakistan and Burma, 
     extending over more than a decade, in connexion with the 
     launching and prosecution of no less than three successive 
     Plans, formulated for the promotion of the interests of the 
     Faith in South-East Asia, have raised their prestige in the 
     eyes of the Baha'i World, and have fitted them to undertake, 
     at this auspicious hour in the evolution of its institutions in 
     the Indian sub-continent and its neighbouring territories and 
     islands, yet another collective enterprise, of still vaster 
     dimensions, of far greater possibilities, requiring the utmost 
 
 
 
+P158 
     exertion and consecration for a period of no less than ten 
     years, and culminating in the Most Great Jubilee, designed 
     to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration 
     of the Mission of the Founder of their Faith.  
          The task they now assume involves the consolidation of the 
     manifold institutions which, through the operation of three 
     successive Plans, have been patiently and laboriously established, 
     as well as the erection of the administrative structure 
     of the Faith in the virgin territories along the shores, and 
     in the vicinity, of the Indian sub-continent, in the Islands of 
     the Indian Ocean, in African Dependencies, and as far as 
     the Islands of the South Pacific Ocean.  
          Through the prosecution of the Plans initiated by your 
     Assembly these communities have acquired the training and 
     experience that have qualified them to embark upon so extensive 
     and momentous an undertaking--an undertaking 
     which if victoriously consummated will eclipse all the joint 
     efforts and enterprises which have illuminated the pages of 
     Indian Baha'i history since the inception of the Formative 
     Age of the Baha'i Dispensation.  
          The first and most sacred obligation confronting them, 
     on the morrow of the launching of their Ten-Year 
     Plan, is the despatch and settlement, during the current year 
     and the one succeeding it, of pioneers in the sixteen virgin 
     territories and islands, assigned to your Assembly according 
     to the provisions of the aforementioned Plan.  The opening 
     of the six dependencies along the eastern and western coasts 
     of the Indian subcontinent must be given careful attention, 
     and must be carried out with promptitude and vigour.  The 
     despatch and definite settlement of no more than one or two 
     pioneers in each of these territories and islands is a task not 
     only of great urgency but of infinite merit, and constitutes 
     the most important feature of the initial phase of the Plan.  
          Next in importance and of no less urgency is the selection 
     and purchase, either within or in the outskirts of the capital-city 
     of India--in which the Administrative Headquarters of 
     the Faith has already been established--of the site of the 
 
 
 
+P159 
     First Mashriq'ul Adhkar of the Indian sub-continent, covering 
     an area of approximately one or two acres at least which 
     can gradually be enlarged in the course of the coming years.  
          Collateral with this vital project is the preparation in conjunction 
     with the Australian National Assembly of a suitable 
     pamphlet by your Assembly, and the adoption of energetic 
     measures for its translation into the languages allocated to 
     the Australian and Indian National Assemblies.  
          While this threefold objective is being assiduously pursued, 
     the process of the multiplication of local Assemblies, of 
     groups and isolated centres must be maintained, nay accelerated, 
     for upon it will depend the early formation of independent 
     National Spiritual Assemblies in India, Pakistan, 
     Burma, Ceylon and South-East Asia.  
          The responsibilities devolving upon your Assembly in the 
     course of the opening stage of the Plan are enormous, sacred 
     and pressing.  All Baha'i communities participating in 
     this glorious enterprise must bend every effort, and sacrifice 
     to the utmost of their power to ensure the unqualified success 
     of the great work that lies immediately ahead.  
          There is no time to lose.  The newly launched Plan demands 
     a vigilance, an expenditure of effort and resources on a scale 
     unprecedented in Indian Baha'i history.  Baha'i communities 
     in East and West, embarked on a similar Crusade, are vying 
     with one another and with your Assembly in the world-wide 
     field of Baha'i pioneering.  The glory of the prizes to be 
     won, the benefits that will accrue to all participants are unimaginable.  
          I direct my appeal to your Assembly and, through its members, 
     to all communities participating in this unprecedented 
     enterprise, to arise to this great and unique occasion that 
     now presents itself, at this critical hour in the fortunes of 
     mankind and at so significant a stage in the evolution of the 
     Faith, and to resolve, with inflexible determination, to consummate, 
     at the appointed time, this fate-laden enterprise on 
     which all our hearts are set and upon which the immediate 
 
 
 
+P160 
     destinies of the Cause of Baha'u'llah so largely depend. 
          In my hours of prayer and meditation in the holy Shrines I 
     will supplicate on behalf of your Assembly, as well as on 
     behalf of the communities you represent, that Divine Guidance 
     may direct your steps, that God's sustaining grace 
     may aid you to overcome every obstacle, that His strength 
     may be poured out upon you, that His providence and love 
     may enfold you, and that the inspiration of the Dawn-breakers, 
     who proclaimed the birth of His Cause, may carry you 
     to ultimate and total victory.  
 
June 21, 1953 
 
 
The Most Important Thing is to Serve 
 
     The most important thing we know from the Teachings is 
to serve.  In carrying out the Plans of God we are strengthened, 
blessed and purified; we attract the loving attention of Baha'u'llah; 
our efforts are confirmed; and we are enabled through His 
power to achieve great victories for His Faith.  
     He urges you, one and all, as one soul in many bodies, to 
consecrate yourselves to fulfilling the objectives of the Ten-Year 
Plan.  He feels sure that when the proper unity and dedication 
prevail in the National Body, it will be sensed by the mass of 
the believers, and react upon their efforts.  As Abdu'l-Baha said, 
nothing is impossible if we have faith; and this must always be 
the standard for all the Baha'is.  As we have faith, so are our 
powers and our blessings.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          May the Almighty enable you to lend a fresh and unprecedented 
     impetus to the onward march of the Faith, revive the 
     spirit of its supporters, enlarge its limits, multiply its local 
     institutions, consolidate its foundations, safeguard its rights, 
     spread abroad its fame, and aid its followers to discharge 
     befittingly their responsibilities, and concentrate on the 
     attainment of the objectives of the Ten-Year Plan, on which 
     the immediate destiny of the entire community depends.

Youth [&amp;and] the Ten-Year Crusade 
 
     The Guardian urges as many of the Baha'i youth of India, 
Pakistan and Burma as possible to attend the historic Conference 
to be held in New Delhi, in October.  At that Conference, 
plans will be made for the carrying of the Message of Baha'u'llah, 
during the coming ten years, far beyond the borders of 
their homeland; and it will be the youth who will shoulder a 
great part of this and the other tasks that will be given to your 
Community.  In fact, the settling of these virgin fields both close 
to your own lands, and in far-off areas, is the very first responsibility 
of the believers, in this Ten-Year World Crusade.  Therefore, 
each one of you should think now seriously what you are 
going to do about it, and start making your plans accordingly.  
The sooner the virgin fields are settled, the sooner will be witnessed 
the tremendous power that is released in this day; and 
the bounties that await those who go forth to pioneer in these 
lands, are great indeed.

Translation of Literature 
 
     Naturally it will be difficult for the Faith to be established 
in the new territories or amongst the new tribes if they 
do not have at least a pamphlet for distribution to the new 
contacts.  
     He therefore feels that along with the sending of pioneers 
into the virgin areas, the translation of literature into the languages 
assigned to the Indian National Assembly should take 
place.  
     The Guardian feels that one of the existing pamphlets would 
be satisfactory, or a new one, which you may feel it desirable to 
prepare.  At this time it is not necessary to enter into the question 
of translation of Baha'i books, simply a pamphlet, which 
can be used for teaching purposes.  
     The Guardian wishes you to budget the necessary funds to 
 
 
 
+P162 
cover this work, and to see that it is actively pursued, so that 
the literature will be available at an early date.

Keynote of the Crusade 
 
     Our beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by reports 
reaching him from all parts of the Baha'i world; of the 
victories already gained, and the plans being laid for the prosecution 
of the Ten-Year Crusade.  
     They have evoked his awe-inspiring, and soul-stirring cablegram 
of May 28th, calling for the immediate settlement of all 
the 131 virgin areas of the Plan, just as quickly as possible.  He 
is convinced, that the friends will arise and translate their enthusiasm 
into Action, because the Keynote of the Crusade, must 
be Action, Action, Action!  
     The beloved Guardian has directed me to write your Assembly 
to amplify some of the aspects of his dynamic message.  
     The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an emergency 
nature, that he feels pioneering in one of them takes precedence 
over every other type of Baha'i service--whether it be in the 
teaching or administrative fields of the Faith.  So important is 
it that the National Assembly may delay initiation of steps to 
fulfill other phases of the Plan, until all these areas are conquered 
for the Faith.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, must be 
allowed to interfere with the placing of pioneers in each of the 
131 goal countries.  
     In America some 150 people have volunteered for pioneer 
service, and some of them already are preparing to leave for 
their posts.  The beloved Guardian fully expects the dear 
friends in India, Pakistan and Burma to follow this example, 
and quickly settle the areas allotted to them.  
     Because of it being the Chief Executor of the Divine Plan, 
and having so many pioneers available, the Guardian has given 
permission to the United States to send pioneers into any area 
 
 
 
+P163 
of the globe regardless of whom it may be assigned to.  Thus 
pioneers from the United States may ask permission to settle in 
one of the areas assigned to your Assembly.  If this is done, you 
should assist them in every way possible.  
     There are some general observations which the Guardian 
shares with you, and then some specific suggestions which are 
enumerated below:  
     1.  Every individual who has offered to pioneer, must be encouraged 
         in every way by the National Assembly.  
     2.  The National Assembly should assist each pioneer, so 
         they may be placed in their post just as quickly as 
         possible.  
     3.  The handling of each application for pioneering service, 
         must be expedited, and not allowed to be bogged down 
         for any reason, or in the hands of Committees.  
     4.  The National Assembly should make it their first 
         order of business to follow up actively this most important 
         task.  They must make it the first order of business 
         at each Assembly meeting, to see that each application 
         is being progressed rapidly.  This does not mean 
         the special committees should not handle the details; but 
         it does mean the Assembly itself, must review each application 
         at each meeting; and see that the pioneer gets into 
         the field as soon as possible.  
     5.  A large number of pioneers should not be sent to any 
         one country.  One, or even two, will be sufficient for the 
         time being.  Later on, if supplementary assistance is 
         needed, that of course can be taken care of.  The all important 
         thing now, is to get at least one pioneer in each 
         of the 131 virgin areas.  
     6.  The National Assembly may exercise its prerogatives and 
         suggest to applicants where their services are most needed.  
         This, of course, applies particularly to pioneers, 
         where a large number wish to go to the same place.  
 
 
 
+P164 
     The specific suggestions of the Guardian, are:  
     a.  Areas close at hand and easy of settlement should be 
         filled first.  Then the areas more difficult, and finally, 
         those which will be difficult.  
     b.  Whenever a pioneer enters a new territory, a cable 
         should be sent at once to the Guardian, giving the name, 
         place, and any pertinent information.  
     c.  A monthly report of progress is to be sent by your 
         Assembly to the Secretary-General of the International 
         Baha'i Council.  Special matters of report nature, for the 
         Guardian, in connection with the plan of settling these 
         131 areas, should be sent to the Secretary-General of the 
         Council also.  
              This does not mean that any administrative matters in 
         connection with the settlement of pioneers should be 
         handled with the council.  These should continue to be 
         handled with the Guardian direct.  The Council is simply 
         to coordinate reports, consolidate them, keep maps up 
         to date, etc. for the Guardian, and your reports will enable 
         them to do this.  
     d.  The Guardian feels the following areas should be easily 
         settled, and he would appreciate your early cable advice 
         of such new victories:  
              Bhutan, Daman, Diu, Goa, Karikal, Mahe, Pondicherry, 
         Sikkim, as pointed out in his cable to your Assembly of 
         May 30th, 1953.  These have first precedence.  
     The beloved Guardian feels the friends living in large 
Baha'i Centres, could easily move into these territories, which 
are a part of India itself.  
     As his dramatic cable indicates, the Guardian will have prepared 
an illuminated "Roll of Honor" on which will be inscribed 
the names of the "Knights of Baha'u'llah" who first enter 
these 131 virgin areas.  This "Roll of Honor" will be placed 
 
 
 
+P165 
inside the entrance door of The Inner Sanctuary of the Tomb of 
Baha'u'llah.  
     From time to time, the Guardian will announce to the Baha'i 
World, the names of those Holy Souls who arise under the conditions 
outlined in his message, and settle these areas and conquer 
them for Baha'u'llah.  
     Now is the time for the Baha'is of the World to demonstrate 
the spiritual vitality of the Faith, and to arise as one soul to 
spread the Glory of the Lord, over the face of the Earth.  The 
Guardian is sure, that the Baha'is of India, Pakistan and 
Burma who have served and sacrificed so long for the Faith, 
will continue their glorious record by winning many new victories 
for the Faith.

Message to the Inter Continental Conference, 
New Delhi 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          To the Hands of the Cause, the members of the National 
     Spiritual Assemblies, the pioneers, the resident believers 
     and visitors attending the Asian Intercontinental Teaching 
     Conference in New Delhi, India.  
 
     Well-beloved friends:  
 
          With high hopes and a joyful heart I acclaim the convocation, 
     in the leading city of the Indian sub-continent, of 
     the fourth and last of the Intercontinental Teaching Conferences 
     of a memorable Holy Year commemorating the centenary 
     of the birth of the prophetic Mission of Baha'u'llah.  
          On this historic occasion, when the members of the National 
     Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'is of the United States of 
     America, of the Dominion of Canada, of Central and of 
     South America, of Persia, of the Indian subcontinent and of 
     Burma, of Iraq and of Australasia, as well as representatives 
     of the sovereign states and dependencies of the Asiatic 
 
 
 
+P166 
     continent, of the Republics of North, Central and South 
     America, and of Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania are 
     assembled, and are to deliberate on the needs and requirements 
     of the recently launched triple Campaign embracing 
     the Asiatic mainland, the Australian continent and the 
     islands of the Pacific Ocean--a campaign which may well 
     be regarded as the most extensive, the most arduous and 
     the most momentous of all the campaigns of a world-girdling 
     Crusade, and which, in its scope, is unparalleled in the 
     history of the Faith in the entire eastern Hemisphere--my 
     thoughts, on such an occasion, go back to the early dawn 
     of our Faith, to those unforgettable scenes of matchless 
     heroism, of dark tragedy, of imperishable glory which 
     heralded its birth, and accompanied the spread, of its infant 
     Light, in the heart of the Asiatic continent.  
          I vividly recall the meteoric rise of the Faith of the Bab in 
     the provinces of Persia and the stirring episodes associated 
     with His cruel incarceration in the mountain-fastnesses of 
     Adhirbayjan, with the revelation of the laws of His Dispensation, 
     with the proclamation of the independence of His 
     Faith, with the peerless heroism of His disciples, with the 
     fiendish cruelty of His foes--the Chief Magistrate, the civil 
     authorities, the ecclesiastical dignitaries and the masses of the 
     people, of His native land--with the humiliation, the spoliation, 
     the dispersal, the eventual massacre of a vast number 
     of His followers, and, above all, with His own execution in 
     the City of Tabriz.  
          With a throb of wonder I call to mind the early and sudden 
     fruition of His Dispensation in the capital city of that land, 
     and the dramatic circumstances attending the birth of 
     Baha'u'llah's Revelation culminating in His precipitate 
     banishment to Iraq.  
          I am reminded, moreover, of the initial spread of the light 
     of this Revelation, in consequence of the banishment of 
     Baha'u'llah, to the adjoining territories of Iraq, and, as far as 
     the western fringes of that continent, to Turkey and the 
     neighbouring territories of Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, and, 
     at a later stage, to the Indian sub-continent and China, 
 
 
 
+P167 
     situated on the southern and eastern extremities of that continent 
     as well as to the Caucasus and Russian Turkistan.  
          Nor can I fail to remember the series of alternating crises 
     and victories--each constituting a landmark in the evolution 
     of the Faith--which it has experienced in some of these 
     territories, associated with the distressful withdrawal of its 
     Author to the mountains of Sulaymaniyyih; with the 
     glorious Declaration of His Mission in Baghdad; with His 
     second and third banishments to Constantinople and 
     Adrianople; with the grievous rebellion of His half-brother; 
     with the proclamation of His own Mission; with His fourth 
     banishment to the desolate and far-off penal colony of 
     Akka in Syria; with the revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
     His Most Holy Book; with His ascension in the Holy 
     Land; with the establishment of His Covenant and the inauguration 
     of the Ministry of Abdu'l-Baha, His son and the 
     Exemplar and authorized interpreter of His teachings.  
          These opening stages in the evolution of His Faith in the 
     Asiatic continent were followed, while the first and Apostolic 
     Age of His Dispensation was drawing to a close, by the 
     opening of the Islands situated in the Pacific Ocean, Japan in 
     the north, and the Australian continent in the South.  To 
     these memorable chapters of Asian Baha'i history another 
     was soon added, on the morrow of the ascension of the 
     Centre of Baha'u'llah's Covenant, and during the initial 
     epoch of the Formative Age of the Faith, distinguished 
     by the rise of the Administrative Order and the erection of 
     its pillars in the cradle of that Faith, in Iraq, in India, 
     Pakistan and Burma and in the Antipodes.  This memorable 
     episode in its development in that vast continent was 
     succeeded by the initiation, during the second Epoch of 
     that same Age, of a series of Plans in those same territories 
     in support of Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan and as a prelude 
     to the opening of the recently launched world-embracing 
     Spiritual Crusade.  
          The hour has now struck for this continent, on whose soil, 
     more than a century ago, so much sacred blood was shed, 
 
 
 
+P168 
     in whose very heart deeds of such tragic heroism were performed, 
     and in many of whose territories such brilliant 
     victories have been won, to contribute, in association with 
     its sister continents, to the progress and ultimate triumph of 
     this global Crusade, in a manner befitting its unrivalled 
     position in the entire Baha'i world.  
          The various Baha'i Communities dwelling within the borders 
     of this continent and those situated to the south of its shores 
     in the Antipodes, which include the oldest and most venerable 
     among all the communities of the Baha'i world, and 
     whose members in their aggregate constitute the overwhelming 
     majority of the followers of Baha'u'llah, are called upon, 
     in close association with four other Baha'i communities in 
     the Western Hemisphere, to undertake in the course of the 
     coming decade:  First, the construction of the first 
     Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Baha'u'llah's native land, in the 
     City of Tihran, surnamed by Baha'u'llah "Mother of the 
     World".  Second, the purchase of land for the future construction 
     of three Mashriqu'l-Adhkars, one in the city of 
     Baghdad, enshrining the "Most Great House", the third 
     holiest city of the Baha'i world, one in New Delhi, the leading 
     city of the Indian sub-continent, and the third in Sydney, 
     the oldest and foremost Baha'i Centre in the Antipodes.  
     Third, the formation of no less than eleven National Spiritual 
     Assemblies, one each in Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, under 
     the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is 
     of India, Pakistan and Burma; one in Turkey and one 
     in Afghanistan, under the aegis of the National Spiritual 
     Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia; one in Japan, under the 
     aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the 
     United States of America; one in New Zealand, under the 
     aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is 
     of Australia and New Zealand, as well as four regional 
     National Spiritual Assemblies, one in the Arabian Peninsula, 
     under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
     Baha'is of Persia; one in South-East Asia, under the aegis 
     of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India, 
     Pakistan and Burma; a third in the South Pacific, under the 
     aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of 
 
 
 
+P169 
     the United States of America; and a fourth in the Near 
     East, under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly 
     of the Baha'is in Iraq.  Fourth, the opening of the following 
     forty-one virgin territories and islands:  Andaman Islands, 
     Bhutan, Daman, Diu, Goa, Karikal, Mahe, Mariana Islands, 
     Nicobar Islands, Pondicherry, Sikkim, assigned to the 
     National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India, Pakistan 
     and Burma; Caroline Islands, Dutch New Guinea,

     Brunei, Chagos Archipelago, Krigizia, Mongolia, Solomon 
     Islands, Tadzhikistan, Uzbekistan, assigned to the National 
     Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia; Admiralty

     National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Central 
     America; Hadhramaut, Kuria-Muria Islands, assigned to 
     the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Iraq; 
     Marquesas Islands, Samoa Islands, assigned to the National 
     Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada; Cook 
     Islands, assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
     Baha'is of South America.  Fifth, the translation and publication 
     of Baha'i literature in the following forty languages, 
     to be undertaken by the National Spiritual Assembly of 
     the Baha'is of India, Pakistan and Burma, in association 
     with the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of 
     Australia and New Zealand:  Abor Miri, Aneityum, Annamese, 
     Balochi, Bentuni, Binandere, Cheremiss, Chungchia, 
     Georgian, Houailou, Javanese, Kado, Kaili, Kopu, Kusaie, 
     Lepcha, Lifu, Manchu, Manipuri, Manus Island, Marquesas, 
     Mentawei, Mongolian, Mordoff, Mwala, Na-Hsi, Nicobarese, 
     Niue, Ossete, Ostiak, Pali, Panjabi, Pashto, Perm, Petats, 
     Samoan, Tho, Tibetan, Tonga, Vogul.  Sixth, the consolidation 
     of Aden Protectorate, Adhirbayjan, Afghanistan, Ahsa, 
     Armenia, Bahrayn Island, Georgia, Hijaz, Saudi-Arabia, 
     Turkey, Turkmenistan, Yemen, allocated to the National 
 
 
 
+P170 
     Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia; of Baluchistan, 
     Borneo, Burma, Ceylon, Indo-China, Indonesia, Malaya,

     Seventh, the incorporation of the eleven above-mentioned 
     National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as those of Persia and 
     Iraq.  Eighth, the establishment by these above-mentioned 
     eleven National Spiritual Assemblies of national Baha'i endowments.  
     Ninth, the establishment of a national Haziratu'l-Quds 
     in the capital cities of each of the countries where 
     National Spiritual Assemblies are to be established, as well 
     as one in Suva, one in Jakarta, one in Bahrayn and one 
     in Beirut.  Tenth, the establishment of a national Baha'i 
     Court in the capital cities of Persia, of Iraq, of Pakistan and 
     of Afghanistan--the leading Muslim centres in the Asiatic 
     continent.  Eleventh, the establishment of two National 
     Baha'i Publishing Trusts, one in Tihran and one in New 
     Delhi.  Twelfth, the formation of Israel Branches of the 
     National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'is of Persia, of 
     Iraq and Australia; authorized to hold on behalf of their 
     parent institutions property dedicated to the holy Shrines at 
     the World Centre of the Faith in the State of Israel.  Thirteenth, 
     the appointment, during Ridvan 1954, by the Hands 
     of the Cause in Asia and in Australia of an auxiliary Board 
     of nine members who will, in conjunction with the eight 
     National Spiritual Assemblies participating in the Asiatic 
     and Australian campaigns, assist, through periodic and 
     systematic visits to Baha'i centres, in the efficient and 
     prompt execution of the Plans formulated for the prosecution 
     of the teaching campaigns in the continent of Asia 
 
 
 
+P171 
     and in the Antipodes.  
          The Asiatic continent, the cradle of the principal religions 
     of mankind; the home of so many of the oldest and 
     mightiest civilizations which have flourished on this planet; 
     the crossways of so many kindreds and races; the battleground 
     of so many peoples and nations; above whose 
     horizon, in modern times, the suns of two independent Revelations
     --the promise and consummation of a six thousand-year-old 
     religious Cycle--have successively arisen; where 
     the Authors of both of these Revelations suffered banishment 
     and died; within whose confines the Centre of a 
     divinely-appointed Covenant was born, endured a forty-year 
     incarceration and passed away; on whose Western extremity 
     the Qiblih of the Baha'i world has been definitely established; 
     in whose heart the City proclaimed by Baha'u'llah as the 
     "Mother of the World" is enshrined; within whose borders 
     another City regarded as the "cynosure of an adoring world" 
     and the scene of the greatest and most glorious Revelation 
     the world has witnessed is embosomed; on whose soil so 
     many saints, heroes and martyrs, associated with both of 
     these Revelations, have lived, struggled and died--such a 
     continent, so privileged among its sister continents and yet 
     so long and so sadly tormented, now stands, at the hour of 
     the launching of a world-encompassing Crusade, on the 
     threshold of an era that may well recall, in its glory and 
     ultimate repercussions, the great periods of spiritual revival 
     which, from the dawn of recorded history have, at various 
     stages in the revelation of God's purpose for mankind, 
     illuminated the path of the human race.  
          May this Crusade, launched simultaneously on the Asiatic 
     mainland, its neighbouring islands and the Antipodes, under 
     the direction of eight National Spiritual Assemblies, and 
     through the operation of eight systematic Teaching Plans, 
     and the concerted efforts of Baha'i communities in both 
     the East and the West, provide, as it unfolds, an effective 
     antidote to the baneful forces of atheism, nationalism, secularism 
     and materialism that are tearing at the vitals of this 
     turbulent continent, and may it re-enact those scenes of 
 
 
 
+P172 
     spiritual heroism which, more than any of the secular revolutions 
     which have agitated its face, have left their everlasting 
     imprint on the fortunes of the peoples and nations 
     dwelling within its borders.                      --SHOGHI 
 
October, 1953 
 
 
Consultation of Delegates 
 
     It should be pointed out to the delegates that the function 
of consultation of the delegates takes place only when they are 
in session at the Annual Convention.  They do not have any 
consultative status prior to the Convention or after the Convention.  
In other words, they are elected to serve as electors 
of the new National Assembly during the Convention, and to 
consult on all matters properly coming before the Convention 
during the Convention period, not before and not after.  
 
April 27, 1956 
 
 
Concentrate on Home Front 
 
     The Guardian has been greatly pleased with the results of 
the expansion of the Faith in the new centers during the past 
year, and the establishment of new Assemblies.  He urges the 
National Assemblies to concentrate on this type of teaching 
work, and particularly on the home front.  The Ten-Year 
Crusade is making most remarkable progress in all fields 
except the teaching on the home front.  If the Baha'is remaining 
"at home" would arise with the same spirit of devotion and 
fervor as animates the pioneers, there is no question of the 
remarkable results that would be achieved.  
 
May 6, 1956 
 
 
Increase Number of Assemblies 
 
     The Guardian was very happy to note the intensive manner 
in which your Assembly is taking hold of the very important 
 
 
 
+P173 
matter of increasing the number of Baha'is, isolated Centers, 
Groups and particularly Assemblies in the territories under your 
jurisdiction, particularly those where National Assemblies are 
to be elected.  
     He feels every effort should be made to bring as many 
groups up to Assembly status during this critical year as 
possible.  The Assemblies formed at Ridvan 1957, cannot take 
part in the election of the National Assemblies elected during 
that same Ridvan period; but they do make a much stronger 
base on which the National Assembly can be formed.  
     In other words, answering directly your question, the 
Guardian advises the practice prevalent now throughout the 
world that a local Assembly may not participate in the election 
of a National Assembly, until a year after its coming into being, 
must continue, and be applicable in the areas referred to by 
you.  
 
September 11, 1956 
 
 
Translation of Baha'i Books into Russian 
 
     With regard to the translations into the languages of the 
countries of the Russian Zones--the Guardian feels you should 
under no circumstances contact Universities in Russia.  He feels 
this might create great difficulty for the Faith, particularly 
during these troublesome times.  
     If there are Universities in India, or Great Britain where 
the translations can be made, there is no objection to utilizing 
such sources, but no University or institution in Russia.  
Perhaps the British NSA can be helpful--or the Italo-Swiss 
NSA, as there are many Russian refugees in Switzerland.  
 
November 12, 1956 
 
 
Many Victories Won 
 
     He is quite distressed that some of the hard won goals have 
 
 
 
+P174 
become virgin again.  He requests that your Assembly study the 
matter carefully, to see if you cannot send pioneers into these 
areas that have fallen back.  He is thinking particularly of 
Nepal, Bhutan, and Goa.  Also, he is very anxious indeed 
that some assistance be given our lone pioneer in Tibet.  That 
noble soul is holding the difficult post, without any aid, and the 
Guardian hopes you will be able to send a pioneer into that 
land to cooperate in establishing the Faith.  
     He assures you of his prayers in your behalf so you may 
quickly regain the lost ground in these virgin areas, and go 
forward to new victories.  
     The fact of the matter is, in some countries, they have been 
able to add new areas to the Crusade--in other words, they 
have established the Faith in areas, where the Faith has not 
existed, and which were not included in the Crusade.  
     In other areas, many other victories have been won, not 
contemplated in the Crusade.  The Guardian has set up a new 
map, showing the supplementary goals won, so far,--outside 
the Crusade goals.  It would be wonderful if India could add 
some objectives to this supplementary map.

Pioneering to Ceram 
 
     The Guardian feels it is most important the teaching work 
in the areas mentioned by Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of 
the Divine Plan, be carried forward with intensive activity.... 
     It has been over 40 years since the Master wrote the Tablets 
of the Divine Plan, and only now has this center mentioned by 
him, been settled.  Surely the Master will watch over his devoted 
servant who is labouring so diligently in this center, and 
guide and protect him; as well as to confirm his work.

Baha'i Literature in Native Tongues 
 
     He was very happy to receive these reports, which indicate 
that the work of translating is actively in hand.  He feels this 
is a very important aspect of our teaching work, as it is impossible, 
or at least, most difficult to teach natives, without some 
of the literature being translated into their languages.  Thus 
he hopes you will follow up the matter quite actively.  
 
January 19, 1957 
 
 
Pioneers in Sikkim 
 
     The beloved Guardian has directed me to write you concerning 
the wonderful news that he has received of the fact 
that there are now ten Baha'is in Sikkim.  
     The pioneers there have been very successful and have been 
able to win souls to the Cause of God.  This is a distinct victory 
for the Faith, and all are to be congratulated.  The 
Guardian wishes them to know how much he values their 
services.  
     The most difficult goals, and the most arduous duties win 
the greatest spiritual rewards.  Thus, he hopes that the friends 
in Sikkim, who naturally are looking forward to their Spiritual 
Assembly this coming Ridvan, will realise how great would be 
their reward, if they were able now to reinforce the work in 
Tibet.  There is only one pioneer there, and perhaps some of 
the new Baha'is could enter Tibet to assist in the work there.  
Great would be their reward if they could do so.  
     Should others be able to go to Nepal and Bhutan, that 
would be most helpful.  In other words, the Guardian feels 
that more important than an Assembly in Sikkim, would be the 
reinforcing of the pioneers and teaching work, first in Tibet, 
and then in Bhutan and Nepal.

Pioneers to be Sent to Maldive Islands 
 
     The beloved Guardian has directed me to write to your 
Assembly with regard to the Maldive Islands.  
     He attaches great importance to these Islands, and hopes 
they can be settled by one or more pioneers at an early date.  
The Light of Divine Guidance should shine in that area, and 
if one of the friends will arise to pioneer there, he is sure they 
will win many signal victories for the Cause of God.  
 
February 17, 1957 
 
 
Historic and Heart-Stirring 
 
     The beloved Guardian has been very pleased with the 
teaching work which has been done in the Virgin Areas of the 
Ten-Year Crusade.  Indeed, all the pioneers have rendered 
historic and heart-stirring service to the Cause of God.  Now, 
the banner of the Faith is firmly established over the entire face 
of the Globe.  Blessed and happy is everyone who has been 
able to join in this, the Greatest Spiritual Crusade of all times.

                                TO THE BAHA'I 
                               YOUTH OF INDIA 
 
 
 
+P178 
+P179 
     Though as yet your youth group is small in number he 
hopes that through your efforts during the coming year it will 
grow and become a strong and vital one and play an important 
part in helping the youth of India to better serve the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah.  
     The field of work open to Baha'i young people is very great, 
and they must increasingly bear their share of the all-important 
teaching campaign which the Indian Baha'is have embarked 
upon.  
 
June 19, 1941 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I have just heard the very sad news of the passing of your 
     dearly-loved father.  This is a great loss to the Baha'i Community 
     in that land and indeed to the Baha'i world.  His 
     exemplary devotion, his indefatigable efforts, his shining 
     faith, his unswerving fidelity, his zeal, his magnificent achievements, 
     in both the administrative and teaching spheres of 
     Baha'i activity have enriched the annals of the Cause of 
     Baha'u'llah.  I personally greatly loved and admired him.  
     The Beloved, I assure you, was pleased with him, and will 
     now bless his soul in the Great Beyond.  I will pray for him 
     from the depths of my heart.  (Letter addressed to the 
     daughters of Mr. N.R. Vakil).  
 
May 5, 1943 
 
 
     The responsibility of young believers is very great, as they 
must not only fit themselves to inherit the work of the older 
Baha'is and carry on the affairs of the Cause in general, but the 
world which lies ahead of them--as promised by Baha'u'llah--
will be a world chastened by its sufferings, ready to listen to 
His Divine Message at last; and consequently a very high character 
will be expected of the exponents of such a religion.  To 
deepen their knowledge, to perfect themselves in the Baha'i 
 
 
 
+P180 
standards of virtue and upright conduct, should be the paramount 
duty of every young Baha'i.  
 
June 6, 1941 
 
 
     He was very happy to see how active and devoted the young 
Baha'is of India are.  The interests of our beloved Faith require 
that the youth in particular exert every effort to spread it, while 
at the same time deepening their own knowledge of the Teachings 
and perfecting their private lives in accordance with the 
standards of conduct laid down by Baha'u'llah.  
     Upon the present generation of youth will devolve the 
weighty task of helping to construct a new world after the 
effects of this tragic war have passed away.  They must be ever 
conscious of their supreme duty towards their fellow-men--the 
duty of holding up to their enquiring gaze the model upon 
which a sound future society can be constructed.  This is the 
system of Baha'u'llah which the Baha'is must first learn themselves 
to live up to, and then share with the whole world.  
 
June 19, 1941 
 
 
     He has been most encouraged by the increasing evidences of 
the activity of the Baha'i youth of India and their determination 
to play their part in the great teaching campaign which the believers 
of that country have undertaken.  
     The responsibility of the Baha'i youth is very great indeed, 
as they constitute the generation of Baha'is who will be called 
upon to help re-construct the world after this devastating war 
is over.  They should devote their lives to the supreme objective 
of perfecting themselves as members in Baha'u'llah's divine 
World Order.  
     The Guardian hopes that during the coming year an ever-increasing 
number of young believers will devote themselves to 
teaching the Cause and helping the Six-Year Plan to be fulfilled.  
 
June 19, 1941 
 
 
 
+P181 
     The Guardian feels that the role of Baha'i youth in these 
days is becoming increasingly important, and that your Committee, 
as well as all local youth committees, should do all in 
your power to encourage the Baha'i young people to a greater 
activity and sense of responsibility.  In the field of teaching, in 
pioneer service and settlement, in the administration of the 
Cause, they must increasingly take an active part, as upon these 
same youth will devolve the many and heavy responsibilities of 
the future when the Baha'is will be called upon to demonstrate 
to their fellow-men the perfection of Baha'u'llah's laws and 
World Order in such a manner that bewildered humanity will 
turn to them as their only refuge.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I was greatly cheered and heartened by the expressions of 
     devotion, determination and loyalty conveyed in the welcome 
     message enclosed in your letter, attesting the significant 
     spirit that animates the Baha'i youth of India.  They 
     are indeed the object of my unfailing solicitude and of my 
     ardent and constant prayers.  I feel proud of the work which 
     they are so strenuously promoting.  Baha'u'llah is indeed 
     well pleased with them, and our Beloved Master will no 
     doubt reinforce their labours.  May their work prosper, and 
     their numbers increase, and their influence extend and their 
     enterprises be consolidated and their highest hopes be 
     fulfilled.  
 
June 19, 1941 
 
 
     The young Baha'is of India must take part in all the work of 
the Indian Baha'i Community, whether it be in teaching the 
Cause, pioneering in new territory, attending the Summer 
School, or aiding in the administrative work of the Faith.  Only 
in this way can they prepare and train themselves for all that 
they will have to do in the future.  
 
December 27, 1941 
 
 
     That at such a time the young believers should be so busy, 
 
 
 
+P182 
both studying the teachings and spreading them, is an eloquent 
testimony to the character of their Faith and the devotion it inspires 
in its adherents.  The Guardian hopes that in these days 
of universal danger and suffering, the young Baha'is of Karachi 
will play an ever-increasing part in the spread and consolidation 
of the Faith in that city and nearby centres, and arise and 
help lighten the load of the older believers who have so patiently 
and tirelessly served the Cause in that land.  
 
July 3, 1942 
 
 
     He is greatly pleased to note the progress which the young 
Baha'is of India are making.  Year by year he sees them growing 
stronger in faith, more conscious of their duties and privileges 
as Baha'is; more anxious to develop their knowledge of the 
teachings and their capacity to serve in the administration.  
     He strongly feels that now is the time for them to arise and 
follow the example of their American brothers and sisters, and 
begin, wherever possible, to undertake pioneer teaching work.  
The services rendered in this field by some of the American 
youth have been little short of astounding, and he sees no 
reason why the young believers of India should not win for 
themselves similar laurels in the path of Baha'u'llah.  
     Their beginning has been excellent, and he hopes that their 
future will be even more outstanding and praiseworthy.  
 
June 27, 1942 
  
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I was deeply touched by your messages, and I greatly value 
     the sentiments you have expressed, and your determination 
     to promote the interests of our beloved Faith.  The Plan 
     conceived by your national elected representatives offers you 
     a wide field in which to demonstrate your resourcefulness, 
     your energy, your perseverance, and your devotion to the 
     vital interests of the Cause and its nascent institutions.  May 
     the Beloved, whose Cause you are so eager to serve, bless 
     your activities, increase your numbers, guide your steps, and 
 
 
 
+P183 
     enable you to contribute a notable share to the advancement 
     of its institutions.  
 
April 8, 1946 
 
 
     It pleased him greatly to see that there are so many active 
Baha'i youth groups in India, and his heart was particularly rejoiced 
to receive messages from such far-off centres as Kashmir 
and Baluchistan, where, a few years ago, there were practically 
no Baha'is at all!  
     He hopes that in the years that lie ahead of us--years of unrest, 
of trouble; of transition for the whole world--that the 
Baha'i youth will increasingly rise to meet the challenge of the 
times, and to carry the Message of Baha'u'llah, through 
both teaching and example, all over India and, indeed, Asia.  
     You who are at present in your teens, or twenties, must realize 
that tomorrow, to a large extent, the burden of the Cause 
will rest on your shoulders; you will have to be the administrators 
and teachers and scholars of the Faith.  Now is the time to 
prepare yourselves for your future duties.  
     He hopes you will study the teachings deeply, their spiritual, 
moral, and administrative precepts, and at the same time take 
as active a part as possible in the life of your respective Baha'i 
communities.  
 
April 12, 1945 
 
 
     He was indeed highly pleased and encouraged to note from 
the contents of your annual report how alive the members of 
the Baha'i Youth Group in Bombay are to their responsibilities 
and duties towards the Cause, and he will assuredly pray on 
their behalf that in spite of the perils, the uncertainties and dangers 
of the present hour their activities for the Faith may steadily 
gain in scope and in effectiveness, and that they may 
each and all receive such confirmations from On High as would 
 
 
 
+P184 
enable them to forge ahead, and to attain their high destiny in 
service to our beloved Cause.  
 
October 15, 1940 
 
 
     He feels that, in the important teaching Plans now being undertaken 
by the Indian Baha'is, the youth have an ever-increasingly 
significant part to play; they are standing at the threshold 
of active Baha'i service in both the pioneer and administrative 
fields, and they must prepare themselves for the future and 
follow, at the same time, the example of American Baha'i young 
people, so many of whom have entered the field as pioneers 
during the last ten years, and not only rendered the Cause great 
services but prepared themselves, through this experience, for 
their future tasks as administrators and teachers of the Faith.

     Our dear Shoghi Effendi owing to the shock he received 
at the sudden news of the Ascension of our Master and owing 
to the great fatigue occasioned to him through the excess of 
work has become susceptible to malaria of which Haifa is a 
great centre.  This summer is very hot too.  He was troubled 
with malaria two days or three in every week.  So the members 
of the Holy Family conjointly with the Haifa Spiritual Assembly 
repeatedly begged him to change his residence during these 
hot summer months to some cooler climate.  At last he affectionately 
accepted our humble entreaty and left this morning 
for Egypt whence he'll proceed to some summer resort as he 
considers suitable.  He wishes all the friends to be more 
active in his absence.  
 
June 20, 1923.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I trust that the National Assembly of which you are the 
     honoured and esteemed President will distinguish itself by 
     its unremitting labours, its profound wisdom, its distinct 
     contribution to the deepening of the spirit of love, service, 
     unity, understanding and confidence amongst the friends.  It 
     is the vital and urgent duty of the Secretary to keep in close 
     and constant touch with Burma and the various other 
     Baha'i localities and distribute with efficiency and promptitude 
     all the glad tidings it receives from the Holy Land and 
     elsewhere.  
 
November 5, 1924 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi trusts that your elections are over and that 
they were conducted in the proper manner.  He earnestly hopes 
that the new N.S.A. will be able to accelerate the progress of 
 
 
 
+P188 
the Cause in India and Burma and will bring in the dawning of 
a new day for the Baha'i movement in India.  Both Shoghi 
Effendi and the friends have had to satisfy their eagerness with 
insufficient progress in the past, and although there are many 
difficulties to meet and overcome and in spite of the fact that 
no one is more alive to them than Shoghi Effendi himself, we 
hope and pray that the future may have great accomplishments 
in store for us.  
 
May 17, 1926 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I trust that by now a better understanding and more 
     substantial cooperation has been attained by the friends of 
     India and Burma.  It is for the delegates who are to be 
     chosen by them this year, to elect those whom they think 
     are best qualified for membership of the National Spiritual 
     Assembly, and once elected, the unity and efficiency of this 
     body must at any cost be maintained.  I cannot but pray 
     that they may be guided in their choice, and discharge 
     honourably their functions.  
 
March 2, 1929 
 
 
     He was very glad that your N.S.A. meeting in Bombay was 
such a success and he is extremely happy of your decision to 
hold your next meeting in Burma, for he shares your hope that 
by meeting the friends in Burma and ventilating in a spirit of 
goodwill all past misunderstandings and problems, a new and 
enduring unity of purpose and effort may prevail and the 
Cause may make a fresh start.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          I trust and pray that your gathering in Rangoon may prove 
     a landmark in the history of the Cause in India and Burma 
     and may lend a fresh and unprecedented impetus to the 
     onward march of the Cause in those lands.  May the 
 
 
 
+P189 
     Beloved strengthen you and guide you and enable you to 
     consolidate the foundations of His Faith.  
 
December 17, 1929 
 
 
     He is pleased to hear of the receipt of his cablegram addressed 
to the Asian Women's Conference through Prof. Pritam 
Singh and he sincerely hopes that the Baha'i members attending 
will take an active share in its proceedings and will thereby 
be putting to actual effect the teachings of Baha'u'llah.  Various 
and innumerable contacts will naturally be made and the effort 
should be to take advantage of this unique opportunity.  
 
January 14, 1931 
 
 
     Shoghi Effendi is as usual extremely busy.  But his health 
is in a very good condition and he is anxiously awaiting the 
news of further achievements for the spreading of the Cause.  
The conditions in India are now quite favourable but what the 
Baha'is need is a group of well-educated and seriously-minded 
people who would spend a good deal of their time in lecturing 
before large audiences and in writing and distributing books 
and pamphlets.  We are in need of such people.  They are, as 
you know very well, very few in number and the Guardian 
hopes that you will do your utmost to organize or to encourage 
and assist the formation of such a group.  
 
July 10, 1931 
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          Your previous letter of Aug. 25 has reached me and I rejoice 
     to learn that the Burmese version of the "New Era" 
     is being circulated.  I long to hear of the completion and 
     publication of the Hindi and Urdu versions.  The utmost 
     effort should be exerted in order to expedite this most 
     important and urgent work.  
 
October 27, 1933 
 

     [From the Guardian:] 
          I am so glad to note a decided improvement in the administrative 
     conduct of Baha'i affairs in India, and I 
 
 
 
+P190 
     trust and pray that the teaching work will as a result 
     receive a fresh and unprecedented impetus.  To teach 
     the Cause is the ultimate purpose and the supreme objective 
     of all Baha'i institutions.  These are but means to 
     an end.  May the Beloved grant you strength to enhance 
     the splendid work you have already achieved.  I am eagerly 
     awaiting the news of the publication of the Urdu and the 
     Sindhi editions of the "New Era".  
 
November 3, 1934 
 
 
     The report of your teaching work in Mysore and Bangalore, 
and of your meeting with Prof. Shastri and His Highness the 
Maharaja of Mysore, who had been gracious enough to accord 
you an audience, has been noted with feelings of highest satisfaction 
and gratitude by the Guardian.  He wishes me to 
express to you his heart's warmest congratulations upon the 
success of your efforts in contacting such eminent personalities 
who, if closely drawn and attracted to the Faith, can lend 
invaluable support to its spread and wider recognition throughout 
India.  
     Shoghi Effendi would indeed urge that you follow up these 
important contacts by every means you can, so that you may 
obtain some more tangible results in the way of confirming 
some important personalities in these high social and intellectual 
Indian circles.  
 
October 15, 1940 
 
 
     The Guardian wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated September 14th 1932 expressing your words of 
sympathy for the passing away of the Greatest Holy Leaf.  
     She was such a source of joy, hope and inspiration to those 
who met her that not only Shoghi Effendi but every single 
Baha'i pilgrim will miss her terribly.  To the lady pilgrims it 
was a real treat to go and have tea with her in the afternoons.  
 
 
 
+P191 
She was always so radiantly hopeful and tried to persuade 
others that sorrows are passing and have to be disregarded.  The 
only consolation of Shoghi Effendi is that she has been freed 
from the physical weakness that during these last years was 
confining her to her room for most of the time.  He is 
sure that in the realm in which she now is she is thinking of 
her friends and asking for them divine guidance and help.  
 
October 12, 1932 
 
 
     The Indian believers, in spite of the troubled condition of 
their country, its vastness, and the relative fewness of their numbers, 
are really demonstrating a remarkable tenacity of purpose in 
carrying out their pioneer teaching plan and in organizing and 
supporting their Baha'i activities.  He is therefore very pleased 
with them, and wishes the young people to take part more and 
more in the work of the Cause in India.  
 
May 2, 1947 
 
 
     There is no refuge in the world today except the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah.  The believers must rest assured that, having the 
Faith, they have everything.  They must place their lives in the 
Hand of God, and, confident of His mercy and protection, go 
on teaching the Cause and serving it, no matter what happens.  
 
May 8, 1942 
 
 
     He considers that the most important thing, as he has often 
pointed out to the friends, is to maintain the Spiritual Assemblies 
already in existence throughout India, to create Spiritual 
Assemblies out of Groups, and to establish new Centres.  He 
therefore does not feel that, if the Cause is precarious in Surat 
and this goal of the Assembly has not been successfully achieved, 
the Baha'is who are working there should leave and go 
elsewhere.  
     The principle he has laid down has invariably been that 
 
 
 
+P192 
the friends must establish a Spiritual Assembly on a firm and 
enduring basis with a nucleus of about fifteen Baha'is in the 
Community, so that the Assembly would be maintained, and 
then the other believers are free above the number fifteen to 
disperse and teach elsewhere; in fact they should consider it 
their duty to do so.  This instruction of our beloved Guardian 
applies to Surat as well as to other Centres.  
 
February 2, 1957 
 
 
     Your frank expression of the situation in India and your 
energetic desire to see things moving after years of practical 
stagnation, is gladly welcomed by the Guardian, and he is 
refreshed to see a feeling of dissatisfaction with present conditions 
and a desire for fresh endeavours along enlightened lines, 
evident among a good many of our friends in India and Burma.  
     It is especially gratifying to see you realize the fact that 
when the world has developed and been enlightened enough 
through the unseen powers of the Almighty, to be led to the 
teachings and spirit of the Cause, it will be our shameful task 
to go round proclaiming such principles as we were taught so 
many years before and none of which we had lived up to.  
     Concerning Huquq, the Guardian wishes me to inform you 
that at present it is not obligatory for the friends to pay, but 
that they should be urged to contribute to the local and 
national funds.  
 
September 19, 1929 
 
 
     Concerning the Esslemont book in languages read by 
Hindus:  The text of the book can in no way be changed, but 
two things can be done to make it more suitable for teaching 
Hindus:  a footnote can be added informing the reader that the 
book was written by a Scotsman who was anxious to present 
to the Christians the Baha'i Faith in relation to their own 
religion, and hence he used many Biblical quotations with 
Baha'i interpretations given; secondly an appendix may be 
 
 
 
+P193 
added which will include quotations from the Baha'i writings 
suitable to the Hindu mind and interests.  
     Regarding Baha'i women using facial make-up:  individuals 
are entirely free to do as they please in such purely personal 
matters.  As Baha'is are enjoined to use moderation in all 
things, and to seek the Golden mean, the N.S.A. can, if it 
deems it necessary or advisable, counsel the believers to use 
moderation in this respect also.  
     Concerning your question as to whether a person may sign 
a registration card and then request his declaration to not be 
made public:  all such administrative details must be referred 
to the N.S.A. for decision and their instructions followed.  
     The Guardian counsels you to refrain by all means from 
criticizing and attacking the National Assembly and its members 
or any local assemblies.  The good that you think can be 
done by such criticism is far out-weighed by the harm it does.  
The new assemblies and believers will cease to have confidence 
in the administration, cease to love and respect their representatives 
and the pioneer work you have done will suffer in 
general.  
 
December 1, 1944 
 
 
     The Guardian has been very pleased to note the progress 
the Bombay friends have been making in their various activities.  
He would, however, urge the Bombay Assembly and 
community to redouble their efforts in the field of teaching; 
to send forth new souls into the pioneer field; and to devote 
as much time as possible to fostering the spread of the Cause in 
nearby centres.  
     He hopes that the contemplated celebration of the anniversary 
of the Birthday of Baha'u'llah will prove to be a great 
success, and he sees no objection to the friends helping nearby 
centres to hold a similar public meeting to attract new souls and 
teach the Faith.  
     In all matters of national importance, or which in any way 
 
 
 
+P194 
transcend the purely local jurisdiction of the assembly, the 
Guardian would urge your Assembly to consult with, and seek 
the advice of, the N.S.A., as only in this way can administrative 
authority be upheld, and the work of the Cause progress 
swiftly and smoothly just as the individual believers are bound 
to support and sustain their local assembly, for the preservation 
of the unity of the Faith and the strengthening of its as 
yet embryonic World Order, so must the local assemblies obey 
and sustain their national representatives.  The closer the 
cooperation between local and national assemblies, the greater 
will be the power and radiance which can and must stream forth 
from these institutions to the suffering ranks of humanity.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The activities of the Indian believers in the teaching field, in 
     these days of uncertainty and peril, deserve the highest praise.  
     I will specially pray at the holy Shrines for the expansion 
     of these activities to which I attach the utmost importance in 
     these concluding years of the First Baha'i Century.  What 
     the Bombay believers have accomplished in this respect is 
     noteworthy, and I trust and pray that the Beloved may aid, 
     sustain and guide them to achieve great victories in the 
     pioneer field in the days to come.  
 
July 29, 1942 
 
 
     Regarding your question concerning Baha'is printing and 
circulating matter on the Faith:  Whether the person writes it 
openly, as a Baha'i, or gives the impression he is not a Baha'i, 
(in order to make his statements seem those of a dispassionate 
observer and thus carry more weight with some minds), if he 
is a voting member of our Faith he should submit the material 
to the N.S.A., or its appointed Committee, to be passed upon 
as to its accuracy and acceptability.  Naturally non-Baha'i 
material the individual is free to do as he likes about.  The 
National Assembly should deal efficiently with such matters and 
thus encourage the friends to follow the correct procedure.  The 
whole object in Baha'i administration is not only to manage 
the affairs of the Cause, but to stimulate the believers 
 
 
 
+P195 
to work for it and to teach it to the masses.  When the N.S.A. 
provides competent and quick service, in its own work and 
that of its Committees, it will see a far greater manifestation 
of enthusiasm and enterprise on the part of the believers.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The steady extension of the activities of the Indian Baha'i 
     Community, in accordance with the fundamental administrative 
     principles of the Faith, constitutes a landmark in 
     the early history of the Formative Age of the Baha'i Dispensation, 
     and augurs well for the ultimate triumph and official 
     recognition of the Cause of Baha'u'llah in the course of the 
     second Baha'i Century.  The concerted endeavours of the 
     Indian believers during the closing years of the first century 
     have been crowned with signal success.  A solid foundation 
     has been laid.  The machinery for the systematic and efficient 
     development of the institutions of the Faith in the capital 
     and in the provinces is now functioning.  Its literature is 
     being widely disseminated.  Its pioneers are labouring in 
     distant fields.  What is now required is an intensification 
     of effort to establish direct contact with the masses, proclaim 
     audaciously the verities of the Faith, to consolidate the work 
     already achieved and to lend further impetus to the settlement 
     of pioneers in areas where the light of the Faith has not 
     as yet penetrated.  A greater measure of self-sacrifice, closer 
     cooperation, and a higher degree of consecration to the task 
     facing them are required of the believers of India in the 
     course of the second year of the second Baha'i Century.  
     May the Beloved sustain, aid and bless their concerted 
     and meritorious endeavours.  
 
March 28, 1945 
 
 
     He admires very much the devoted manner in which the 
Kolhapur Baha'is have built up the Spiritual Assembly there 
and caused that community to be one of the most active in 
Southern India.  You must not now become discouraged because 
some of your teachers have left and gone to serve the Cause 
 
 
 
+P196 
elsewhere.  This gives you the opportunity of learning to do 
more of the work yourselves, and of also putting your reliance 
on Baha'u'llah and realizing that He will assist all those who 
arise to serve Him.  
     The Guardian assures you he will pray in the Holy Shrines 
for your protection and that God may assist you in your work, 
aid you to be united and show the greatest love, one for another, 
and bless your work.  
 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          May the Almighty guide every step you take in the path of 
     service, and enable you to proclaim the verities of His Faith, 
     and contribute effectively to the consolidation of its newly-born 
     institutions.  
 
December 19, 1949 
 
 
     He was surely very sorry to hear of the passing away of 
your father who was such an old and devoted servant of the 
Cause.  Such persons, at their passing, proceed to the presence 
of Baha'u'llah and partake of His infinite blessings and divine 
bounties.  They enter into a state which, should we only have 
the eye to see, we would envy and earnestly desire.  It is only 
because we ignore the beautiful and glorious life of the world 
beyond that we seem attached to our earthly abode and often 
forget the goal of our very existence here.  
 
May 14, 1932 
 
 
     It is to the youth that the Guardian is today eagerly looking, 
and it is upon their shoulders that he is laying all the responsibility 
for the promotion of the Faith.  Theirs is the opportunity 
to arise and serve to their utmost this great Cause of God.  
 
June 6, 1933 
 
 
     Concerning the use of alcoholic drinks and drugs the Guardian 
wishes you to know that they have been explicitly 
 
 
 
+P197 
forbidden in the "Kitab-i-Aqdas".  Opium is, undoubtedly, 
prohibited.  But smoking, though allowed, is discouraged.  Various 
other points which may be raised in this connection and 
which have not been explained in the Holy Writings have to be 
carefully considered and acted upon by the future International 
House of Justice which is the body empowered by Baha'u'llah 
to legislate in all matters which have not been explicitly revealed 
in the Sacred Writings of the Faith.  
 
December 27, 1933 
 
 
     What, in the last resort, is most essential to every believer 
is a conscious and an unwavering faith in the mission which the 
Cause has been called upon to fulfill.  Through the light of 
faith the darkness which envelops our thoughts and feelings 
gives way to a radiance and a splendour before which every 
gloom vanishes.  
 
January 7, 1934 
 
 
     While secrecy in matters of religious faith should be deprecated 
as being against the spirit of the Cause yet, it is always 
recommendable to exercise full tact and wisdom whenever, by 
too frank and open a declaration of our beliefs, we run the risk 
of exciting the animosity and opposition of those around us.  
 
September 25, 1934 
 
 
     With regard to your question relative to the advisability of 
having Baha'is join film companies.  Although on principle 
there is no objection if any believer wishes to become a cinema 
actor, yet in view of the excessive corruption that now prevails 
along such a line of occupation, the Guardian would not advise 
any believer to choose this kind of profession, unless he finds 
this to be the only means of earning his livelihood.  
     Concerning the passage in the Old Testament in which 
Abraham is reported to have addressed his wife as his sister, the 
 
 
 
+P198 
interpretation given it by some Christians cannot hold, as it 
implies that the Messengers of God are all sinners.  A much 
more plausible explanation would be, that in doing so Abraham 
wished to emphasize the superiority of the spiritual relationship 
binding him with his wife to the purely physical and material 
one.  
 
September 4, 1935 
 
 
     As regards your study of the Hindu religion.  The origins of 
this and many other religions that abound in India are not quite 
known to us, and even the Orientalists and the students of 
religion are not in complete accord about the results of their 
investigations in that field.  The Baha'i Writings also do not 
refer specifically to any of these forms of religion current in 
India.  So, the Guardian feels it impossible to give you any 
definite and detailed information on that subject.  He would 
urge you, however, to carry on your studies in that field, although 
its immensity is well-nigh bewildering, with the view of 
bringing the Message to the Hindus.  The task of converting 
this section of the Indian population is a most vital obligation, 
although the Guardian is fully aware of the many difficulties 
that it presents.  Nevertheless the friends should do their best 
to make as many converts among the Hindus as they possibly 
can.  
     Also with regard to the problem of inter-marriage between 
the Zoroastrian and Hindu Baha'is, this is a highly delicate and 
vital question, as important as the problem of the black and 
white in America.  The friends should all realize that racial 
considerations do not, in the light of the Baha'i Teachings, constitute 
any hindrance to any kind of intercourse between the 
believers.  The Hindu and Zoroastrian Baha'is should forget 
their former and traditional prejudices whether religious, racial 
or social, and commune together on a common basis of equality, 
love and devotion to the Cause.  While the goal is quite clear 
yet, wisdom and caution are needed in order to carry this ideal 
into full practice.  
 
April 17, 1936 
 
 
 
+P199 
     In these days when the forces of inharmony and disunity 
are rampant throughout the world, the Baha'is must cling to 
their Faith and to each other, and, in spite of every difficulty 
and suffering, protect the unity of the Cause.  Often the first 
efforts at getting the administration of the Faith to mark 
harmoniously, are painful because the individual must learn to 
subject his will to the whole--but these are all minor details, and 
the friends must all concentrate on constructive work for the 
Cause.  
     Of course no one is debarred from becoming a Baha'i; rich 
or poor, learned or ignorant, all have a sacred and equal right 
to accept the Supreme Manifestation for this age.  
     The question of residence and taking part in administrative 
affairs hangs together:  wherever a Baha'i has his legal residence, 
he belongs to the community that is established in that 
same civil area as his residence, and he cannot vote or be elected 
to any Baha'i body outside of that area except, of course, 
National Assembly and Committees.  This, of course, does not 
prevent his teaching in nearby towns or anywhere else.  But 
he cannot live in one city and be a voting Baha'i in another.  
 
May 7, 1941 
 
 
     He urges you to redouble your efforts during the coming 
year, to teach the youth this great Message of Baha'u'llah.  It 
is indeed the one hope for the spiritual and material security of 
the world; and although the response may be slow at first, 
through your perseverance and devotion, you will gradually 
succeed in attracting a very large group to the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah.  
 
April 7, 1952 
 
 
     He was also delighted to hear that the Message was given to 
such large crowds of people in a spot associated with the 
enlightenment of the Manifestation of God, Buddha.  The 
Guardian attaches great importance to the conversion of 
 
 
 
+P200 
Buddhists to the Faith as well as Hindus, and he urges your 
Assembly to do everything in your power to attract the members 
of these Faiths and convert them.  
 
January 27, 1957 
 
 
     The Guardian is confident that the ceremony of your 
marriage will be conducted along strictly Baha'i lines and feels 
certain that your example will create a deep impression upon 
the non-believers, and will also serve to greatly encourage the 
believers in their efforts for the emancipation of the Cause from 
the doctrines and traditions of the past, and for its wide and 
effective recognition as an independent religion.  
 
February 7, 1937 
 
 
     In this connection, the Guardian feels the necessity of bringing 
to your attention the fact that the validity of a Baha'i 
marriage is conditioned upon the consent of the two parties and 
their parents only.  So that in case the other members of your 
family show any dislike or opposition to your sister's union ... 
their objection does under no circumstances invalidate it.  Your 
parents' approval would be sufficient, even though all the rest 
of your family may violently oppose it.  
 
March 31, 1937 
 
 
     1.  In the passage "eschew all fellowship with the ungodly", 
Baha'u'llah means that we should shun the company of those 
who disbelieve in God and are wayward.  The word "ungodly" 
is a reference to such perverse people.  The words "Be thou as 
a flame of fire to My enemies and a river of life eternal to My 
loved ones" should not be taken in their literal sense.  Baha'u'llah's 
advice is that again we should flee from the enemies of 
God, and instead seek the fellowship of His lovers.  
     2.  A believer has the right to vote for himself during the 
election time, if he conscientiously feels the urge to do so.  This 
 
 
 
+P201 
does not necessarily imply that he is ambitious or selfish.  For 
he might conscientiously believe that his qualifications entitle 
him to membership in a Baha'i administrative body, and he 
might be right.  The essential, however, is that he should be 
sincere in his belief, and should act according to the dictates of 
his conscience.  Moreover, membership in an assembly or committee 
is a form of service, and should not be looked upon 
as a mark of inherent superiority or a means for self-praise.  
     3.  The Baha'i view of "reincarnation" is essentially different 
from the Hindu conception.  The Baha'is believe in the 
return of the attributes and qualities, but maintain that the 
essence or the reality of things cannot be made to return.  Every 
being keeps its own individuality, but some of his qualities can 
be transmitted.  The doctrine of metempsychosis upheld by the 
Hindus is fallacious.  
     4.  The eating of pork is not forbidden in the Baha'i 
Teachings.  
     5.  Genesis XIX, 29-38--the text makes it quite clear that 
Lot was not responsible for the action committed by his two 
daughters, as they gave him wine and made him drunk.  
     6.  Electioneering and all forms of propaganda are against 
the spirit of Baha'i elections.  The chief opportunity which the 
friends have for discussion on administrative questions is during 
the Nineteen Day Feasts, at which time the members of the 
assembly can meet with the body of the believers and discuss 
in common the affairs of the Cause, and suggest new policies 
and methods.  But even then no reference to individuals should 
be made.  
     7.  Baha'is are permitted to marry non-believers but they 
should insist on observing the Baha'i marriage ceremony and 
should also not object if their non-Baha'i partner wishes to 
observe the marriage ceremony of his or her particular religion.  
Civil marriage is generally practised amongst the Western 
believers, but in most of the East it is unknown.  
 
March 27, 1938 
 
 
 
+P202 
     ...as to the meaning of the passage in the "Iqan" in which 
Baha'u'llah refers to the renewal of the "City of God" once in 
about a thousand years; this, as the word about implies, is 
simply an approximate date, and should not therefore be taken 
literally.  
     The Administrative Order of the Cause, though first established 
in America, copied as a model by other national Baha'i 
communities, is not an American production, but is a universal 
system based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah.  It is not simply 
by coincidence however that it was first initiated and perfected 
by the American believers.  
 
October 29, 1938 
 
 
     The task of bringing up a Baha'i child, as emphasized time 
and again in Baha'i Writings, is the chief responsibility of the 
mother, whose unique privilege is indeed to create in her home 
such conditions as would be most conducive to both his material 
and spiritual welfare and advancement.  The training 
which the child first receives through his mother constitutes the 
strongest foundation for his future development...  
 
November 16, 1939 
 
 
     The Baha'is all over the world are subject sometimes to 
suffering, along with their fellow-men.  Whatever vicissitudes 
befall their country, they will be protected though, and watched 
over by Baha'u'llah, and should not fear the future but rather 
fear any failure on their part to carry out the work of His 
Cause.  This applies to the Indian Baha'is.

                         LETTERS ADDRESSED TO BURMESE

+P204 
+P205 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          Your most welcome letter has rejoiced my heart, and has 
     redoubled my confidence and hope in that little band of 
     earnest and ardent followers of the Baha'i Faith who labour 
     so devotedly for the diffusion of the Light of Baha'u'llah 
     throughout the world.  
          The glowing account you give me of your recent efforts and 
     activities to extend and consolidate the Campaign of Service 
     in that land has been shared with the resident friends and 
     pilgrims in the Holy Land, and incorporated in the circular 
     letters which the Haifa Spiritual Assembly addresses to the 
     Baha'i world.  It will send, I am sure, a thrill of enthusiasm 
     and courage throughout the body of the friends the world 
     over, and will serve to strengthen the ties that bind us all 
     to you, our beloved co-workers in that far-eastern land!  
          I am looking forward with the greatest interest, to the time 
     when your high hopes will have been fully realized, your 
     plans fulfilled and your selfless efforts crowned with glorious 
     success.  It is my fervent hope and prayer that your endeavours 
     to constitute a Central Council for all Burma, and 
     establish a Baha'i Magazine, exclusively devoted to the 
     progress of the work in that province, will soon bear abundant 
     fruit, and will stand a testimony to the efficiency, the 
     energy and the zeal of the beloved Burmese friends.  
          May our loving and ever-watchful Master, guide and protect 
     you in all the services you are so whole-heartedly tendering 
     to His sacred Threshold, and may He enable you to 
     contribute your full share in carrying out His Great Purpose 
     for mankind!  This is my prayer for you all whenever I visit 
     the Three Holy Shrines, and I feel certain that He will not 
     fail to answer it, if we but hold fast to those principles for 
     which He lived, laboured and died.  
 
June 1, 1923 
 
 
 
+P206 
     [From the Guardian:] 
          The detailed report I have recently received from the tried 
     and faithful servant of Baha'u'llah, Aqa Syed Mustapha, 
     regarding the progress of your labours in those remote regions 
     of the world has filled my heart with hope and gladness, 
     and has served to fortify the ties of loving fellowship 
     that bind our hearts together in the service of His Cause.  
          I have read and re-read the account of your activities with 
     profound interest, and have been deeply touched to realize 
     how constantly and fervently you are carrying on the work 
     entrusted to your charge.  May His Spirit guide you, sustain 
     you and protect you in all your endeavours, and make of 
     you the vanguard of His Host that shall conquer the world.  
          I shall await the joyful news of the expansion of your work, 
     the establishment of your Magazine, the consolidation of 
     your Assemblies, the increase of your numbers, with keen 
     interest, and wish to assure you again and again of my 
     readiness and desire to help you and serve you in your 
     efforts to promote the Cause in even the uttermost corners 
     of the world.  
          By day and by night, in my hours of prayer and meditation, 
     I tenderly remember every one of you, and pray from the 
     bottom of my heart, for your spiritual happiness, material 
     prosperity, and ultimate success in your sacred mission 
     in this world.  
          I shall be most pleased to receive frequent and direct letters 
     from every Baha'i locality in Burma, and will not fail to do 
     all I can to stimulate your work, and extend your activities 
     throughout that distant province.  
          May the day be not far distant when the few and ardent 
     followers of the Faith in that land, will have increased a 
     hundred-fold, and the promises of our beloved Abdu'l-Baha 
     strikingly and speedily fulfilled.
