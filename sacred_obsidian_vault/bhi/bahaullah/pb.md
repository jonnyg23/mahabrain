     We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the 
nations; yet they deem Us a stirrer up of strife and sedition 
worthy of bondage and banishment....  That all nations 
should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the 
bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should 
be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and 
differences of race be annulled--what harm is there in this?... 
Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars 
shall pass away, and the `Most Great Peace' shall come.... 
Yet do We see your kings and rulers lavishing their treasures 
more freely on means for the destruction of the human race 
than on that which would conduce to the happiness of mankind.... 
These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must 
cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family....  Let 
not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him 
rather glory in this, that he loves his kind....

                   Introduction 

     One hundred years ago, &amp;Baha'u'llah, Founder 
of the &amp;Baha'i Faith, proclaimed in clear and unmistakable 
language, to the kings and rulers of 
the world, to its religious leaders, and to mankind 
in general that the long-promised age of world peace 
and brotherhood had at last dawned and that He Himself 
was the Bearer of the new message and power from God 
which would transform the prevailing system of antagonism 
and enmity between men and create the spirit and form 
of the destined world order. 
     At that time the splendour and panoply of the monarchs 
reflected the vast power which they exercised, autocratically 
for the most part, over the greater portion of the 
earth.  &amp;Baha'u'llah, an exile from His native Persia for His 
religious teaching, was the prisoner of the tyrannical, all-powerful 
&amp;Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.  In such circumstances 
He addressed the rulers of the world.  His Tablets to 
particular kings and to the Pope, although delivered, were 
either ignored or rejected, their wise counsels and dire 
warnings went unheeded, and in one instance the bearer 
was cruelly tortured and killed. 
     &amp;Baha'u'llah, viewing that old world and seeing it `at the 
mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern 
clearly their own best advantage' declared that 
`...the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is 
daily increasing.  The signs of impending convulsions and 
 
x 
chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing 
order appears to be lamentably defective.'  Although 
painting in sombre tones the `divine chastisement' which 
would assail most of those rulers and engulf in ruin the 
peoples of the world, He nevertheless left no doubt about 
the outcome.  `Soon', He declared, `will the present day 
order be rolled up and a new one spread out in its stead.' 
Since the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah in 1892, in the Holy 
Land, the rolling up of the old order has become the daily 
experience of mankind and no abatement of this process is 
discernible.  The essence of &amp;Baha'u'llah's World Order is 
the unity of the human race.  `O ye children of men', He 
writes, `the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of 
God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote 
the unity of the human race...'  And He warns, `The 
well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable 
unless and until its unity is firmly established.' 
The achievement of this unity is &amp;Baha'u'llah's declared 
mission and the aim of all &amp;Baha'i activity.  Its outline and 
structure are indicated in the following passage from the 
writings of Shoghi Effendi, great-grandson of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and Guardian of the &amp;Baha'i Faith: 
          The unity of the human race, as envisaged by 
     &amp;Baha'u'llah, implies the establishment of a world 
     commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and 
     classes are closely and permanently united, and in 
     which the autonomy of its state members and personal 
     freedom and initiative of the individuals that 
 
xi 
     compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. 
     This commonwealth must, as far as we can 
     visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members 
     will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately 
     control the entire resources of all the component 
     nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required 
     to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust 
     the relationships of all races and peoples.  A world executive, 
     backed by an international Force, will carry 
     out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted 
     by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic 
     unity of the whole commonwealth.  A world 
     tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory 
     and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise 
     between the various elements constituting this universal 
     system.  A mechanism of world inter-communication 
     will be devised, embracing the whole planet, 
     freed from national hinderances and restrictions, and 
     functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect 
     regularity.  A world metropolis will act as the nerve 
     centre of a world civilization, the focus towards which 
     the unifying forces of life will converge and from 
     which its energizing influences will radiate.  A world 
     language will either be invented or chosen from 
     among the existing languages and will be taught in 
     the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary 
     to their mother tongue.  A world script, a world literature, 
     a uniform and universal system of currency, of 
 
xii 
     weights and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse 
     and understanding among the nations and 
     races of mankind.  In such a world society, science and 
     religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will 
     be reconciled, will co-operate, and will harmoniously 
     develop.  The press will, under such a system, while 
     giving full scope to the expression of the diversified 
     views and convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously 
     manipulated by vested interests, whether 
     private or public, and will be liberated from the influence 
     of contending governments and peoples.  The 
     economic resources of the world will be organized, its 
     sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, 
     its markets will be co-ordinated and developed, 
     and the distribution of its products will be equitably 
     regulated. 
          National rivalries, hatreds and intrigues will cease, 
     and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by 
     racial amity, understanding and co-operation.  The 
     causes of religious strife will be permanently removed, 
     economic barriers and restrictions will be completely 
     abolished, and the inordinate distinction between 
     classes will be obliterated.  Destitution on the one hand, 
     and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, 
     will disappear.  The enormous energy dissipated and 
     wasted on war, whether economic or political, will be 
     consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of 
     human inventions and technical development, to the 
 
xiii 
     increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination 
     of disease, to the extension of scientific research, 
     to the raising of the standard of physical health, 
     to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, 
     to the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources 
     of the planet, to the prolongation of human 
     life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that 
     can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual 
     life of the entire human race. 
          A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and 
     exercising unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably 
     vast resources, blending and embodying 
     the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated 
     from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on 
     the exploitation of all the available sources of energy 
     on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force 
     is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained 
     by its universal recognition of one God and by its 
     allegiance to one common Revelation--such is the 
     goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying 
     forces of life, is moving. 

     &amp;Baha'u'llah's message is one of hope, of love, of practical 
reconstruction.  Today we reap the appalling results of our 
forebears' rejection of His divine call; but today there are 
new rulers, new people, who perchance may hear and 
avoid or mitigate the severity of impending catastrophe.  It 
is with this hope and believing it to be its sacred duty, that 
the Universal House of Justice, the international governing 
 
xiv 
body of the &amp;Baha'i Faith, proclaims again, through publication 
of these selected passages, the essence of that 
mighty call of a century ago.  In the same hope and belief 
the &amp;Baha'is throughout the world will do their utmost during 
this centenary period to bring to the attention of their 
fellow-men the redeeming fact of this new outpouring of 
divine guidance and love.  We believe they will not labour 
in vain.

              SUMMONS TO THE KINGS AND 
                 RULERS OF THE WORLD 

+P2 

+P3 
                      COLLECTIVELY 

+P4 

+P5 
     O KINGS of the earth!  He Who is the sovereign 
Lord of all is come.  The Kingdom is God's, 
the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting. 
Worship none but God, and, with radiant 
hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord, the Lord of all 
names.  This is a Revelation to which whatever ye possess 
can never be compared, could ye but know it.  We see you 
rejoicing in that which ye have amassed for others, and 
shutting out yourselves from the worlds which naught except 
My Guarded Tablet can reckon.  The treasures ye have 
laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. 
This ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it. 
Wash your hearts from all earthly defilements, and hasten 
to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the Creator of earth 
and heaven, Who caused the world to tremble, and all its 
peoples to wail, except them that have renounced all things 
and clung to that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained.... 
     O Kings of the earth!  The Most Great Law hath been 
revealed in this Spot, this Scene of transcendent splendour. 
Every hidden thing hath been brought to light, by virtue of 
the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He Who hath ushered 
in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been 
cleft, and every irrevocable decree expounded. 
     Ye are but vassals, O Kings of the earth!  He Who is the 
King of kings hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous 
glory, and is summoning you unto Himself, the Help 

+P6 
in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  Take heed lest pride deter you 
from recognizing the Source of Revelation; lest the things 
of this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the 
Creator of heaven.  Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire 
of all nations, Who hath created you through a word from 
Him, and ordained you to be, for all time, the emblems of 
His sovereignty. 
     By the righteousness of God!  It is not Our wish to lay 
hands on your kingdoms.  Our mission is to seize and possess 
the hearts of men.  Upon them the eyes of &amp;Baha are fastened. 
To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names, could ye but 
comprehend it.  Whoso followeth his Lord, will renounce 
the world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, 
must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a 
station!  Forsake your palaces, and haste ye to gain admittance 
into His Kingdom.  This, indeed, will profit you both 
in this world and in the next.  To this testifieth the Lord of 
the realm on high, did ye but know it. 
     How great is the blessedness that awaiteth the king who 
will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach 
himself from all else but Me!  Such a king is numbered 
with the companions of the Crimson Ark, the Ark 
which God hath prepared for the people of &amp;Baha.  All must 
glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to 
unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent 
Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible 
kingdoms.  Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the 
luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead 

+P7 
of blessings unto the whole world.  Offer up, O people 
of &amp;Baha, your substance, nay your very lives, for his 
assistance. 
     We have asked nothing from you.  For the sake of God 
We, verily, exhort you, and will be patient as We have 
been patient in that which hath befallen Us at your hands, 
O concourse of kings! 
 

     O KINGS of the earth!  Give ear unto the Voice of God, 
calling from this sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath 
sprung out of the Crimson Hill, upon the holy Plain, intoning 
the words:  `There is none other God but He, the 
Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.'...  Fear God, O 
concourse of kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived 
of this most sublime grace.  Fling away, then, the 
things ye possess, and take fast hold on the Handle of God, 
the Exalted, the Great.  Set your hearts towards the Face of 
God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden 
you to follow, and be not of those who perish.  Relate unto 
them, O Servant, the story of &amp;Ali (the &amp;Bab), when He came 
unto them with truth, bearing His glorious and weighty 
Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and proof 
from God, and holy and blessed tokens from Him.  Ye, 
however, O Kings, have failed to heed the Remembrance 
of God in His days and to be guided by the lights which 

+P8 
arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent 
Heaven.  Ye examined not His Cause when so to do would 
have been better for you than all that the sun shineth upon, 
could ye but perceive it.  Ye remained careless until the 
divines of Persia--those cruel ones--pronounced judgment 
against Him, and unjustly slew Him.  His spirit ascended 
unto God, and the eyes of the inmates of Paradise 
and the angels that are nigh unto Him wept sore by reason 
of this cruelty.  Beware that ye be not careless henceforth as 
ye have been careless aforetime.  Return, then, unto God, 
your Maker, and be not of the heedless....  My face hath 
come forth from the veils, and shed its radiance upon all 
that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye turned not towards 
Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, 
O concourse of kings!  Follow, therefore, that which I 
speak unto you, and hearken unto it with your hearts, and 
be not of such as have turned aside.  For your glory consisteth 
not in your sovereignty, but rather in your nearness 
unto God and your observance of His command as sent 
down in His holy and preserved Tablets.  Should any one of 
you rule over the whole earth, and over all that lieth within 
it and upon it, its seas, its lands, its mountains, and its plains, 
and yet be not remembered by God, all these would profit 
him not, could ye but know it....  Arise, then, and make 
steadfast your feet, and make ye amends for that which 
hath escaped you, and set then yourselves towards His 
holy Court, on the shore of His mighty Ocean, so that 
the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God hath 

+P9 
stored up within the shell of His radiant heart, may be 
revealed unto you....  Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of 
God from blowing over your hearts, the breeze through 
which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be 
quickened.... 
     Beware not to deal unjustly with any one that appealeth 
to you, and entereth beneath your shadow.  Walk ye in the 
fear of God, and be ye of them that lead a godly life.  Rest 
not on your power, your armies, and treasures.  Put your 
whole trust and confidence in God, Who hath created you, 
and seek ye His help in all your affairs.  Succour cometh 
from Him alone.  He succoureth whom He willeth with 
the hosts of the heavens and of the earth. 
     Know ye that the poor are the trust of God in your midst. 
Watch that ye betray not His trust, that ye deal not unjustly 
with them and that ye walk not in the ways of the 
treacherous.  Ye will most certainly be called upon to 
answer for His trust on the day when the Balance of Justice 
shall be set, the day when unto every one shall be rendered 
his due, when the doings of all men, be they rich or poor, 
shall be weighed. 
     If ye pay no heed unto the counsels which, in peerless 
and unequivocal language, We have revealed in this Tablet, 
Divine chastisement shall assail you from every direction, 
and the sentence of His justice shall be pronounced 
against you.  On that day ye shall have no power to resist 
Him, and shall recognize your own impotence.  Have 
mercy on yourselves and on those beneath you, and judge 

+P10 
ye between them according to the precepts prescribed by 
God in His most holy and exalted Tablet, a Tablet wherein 
He hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure, 
in which He hath given, with distinctness, an explanation 
of all things, and which is in itself a monition unto 
them that believe in Him. 
     Examine Our Cause, inquire into the things that have 
befallen Us, and decide justly between Us and Our 
enemies, and be ye of them that act equitably towards their 
neighbours.  If ye stay not the hand of the oppressor, if ye 
fail to safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, what right 
have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men?  What is it of 
which ye can rightly boast?  Is it on your food and your 
drink that ye pride yourselves, on the riches ye lay up in 
your treasuries, on the diversity and the cost of the ornaments 
with which ye deck yourselves?  If true glory were to 
consist in the possession of such perishable things, then the 
earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you, 
because it supplieth you, and bestoweth upon you, these 
very things, by the decree of the Almighty.  In its bowels 
are contained, according to what God hath ordained, all 
that ye possess.  From it, as a sign of His mercy, ye derive 
your riches.  Behold then your state, the thing in which ye 
glory!  Would that ye could perceive it!  Nay, By Him 
Who holdeth in His grasp the kingdom of the entire creation! 
Nowhere doth your true and abiding glory reside 
except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of God, 
your wholehearted observance of His laws, your resolution 

+P11 
to see that they do not remain unenforced, and to pursue 
steadfastly the right course.... 
     Twenty years have passed, O Kings, during which We 
have, each day, tasted the agony of a fresh tribulation.  No 
one of them that were before Us hath endured the things 
We have endured.  Would that ye could perceive it!  They 
that rose up against Us, have put Us to death, have shed 
Our blood, have plundered Our property, and violated 
Our honour.  Though aware of most of Our afflictions, ye, 
nevertheless, have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor. 
For is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the 
oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that 
your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all 
mankind? 
     God hath committed into your hands the reins of the 
government of the people, that ye may rule with justice 
over them, safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and 
punish the wrong-doers.  If ye neglect the duty prescribed 
unto you by God in His Book, your names shall be numbered 
with those of the unjust in His sight.  Grievous, indeed, 
will be your error.  Cleave ye to that which your 
imaginations have devised, and cast behind your backs the 
commandments of God, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible, 
the All-Compelling, the Almighty?  Cast away the things 
ye possess, and cling to that which God hath bidden you 
observe.  Seek ye His grace, for he that seeketh it treadeth 
His straight Path.... 
     The day is approaching when God will have exalted His 

+P12 
Cause and magnified His testimony in the eyes of all who 
are in the heavens and all who are on the earth.  Place, in all 
circumstances, Thy whole trust in Thy Lord, and fix Thy 
gaze upon Him, and turn away from all them that repudiate 
His truth.  Let God, Thy Lord, be Thy sufficing Succourer 
and Helper.  We have pledged Ourself to secure Thy 
triumph upon earth and to exalt Our Cause above all 
men, though no king be found who would turn his face 
towards Thee. 
 

     O KINGS of the earth!  We see you increasing every year 
your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your 
subjects.  This, verily, is wholly and grossly unjust.  Fear the 
sighs and tears of this Wronged One, and lay not excessive 
burdens on your peoples.  Do not rob them to rear palaces 
for yourselves; nay rather choose for them that which ye 
choose for yourselves.  Thus We unfold to your eyes that 
which profiteth you, if ye but perceive.  Your people are 
your treasures.  Beware lest your rule violate the commandments 
of God, and ye deliver your wards to the hands of 
the robber.  By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by 
their aid ye conquer.  Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon 
them!  How strange, how very strange! 
     Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye 
fast unto this, the Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some 

+P13 
degree better your own condition and that of your dependents. 
     O Rulers of the earth!  Be reconciled among yourselves, 
that ye may need no more armaments save in a measure to 
safeguard your territories and dominions.  Beware lest ye 
disregard the counsel of the All-Knowing, the Faithful. 
     Be united, O Kings of the earth, for thereby will the 
tempest of discord be stilled amongst you, and your people 
find rest, if ye be of them that comprehend.  Should any one 
among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against 
him, for this is naught but manifest justice. 
 

     THE one true God, exalted be His glory, hath ever regarded, 
and will continue to regard, the hearts of men as 
His own, His exclusive possession.  All else, whether pertaining 
to land or sea, whether riches or glory, He hath bequeathed 
unto the kings and rulers of the earth.  From the 
beginning that hath no beginning the ensign proclaiming 
the words `He doeth whatsoever He willeth' hath been unfurled 
in all its splendour before His Manifestation.  What 
mankind needeth in this day is obedience unto them that 
are in authority, and a faithful adherence to the cord of 
wisdom.  The instruments which are essential to the immediate 
protection, the security and assurance of the 
human race have been entrusted to the hands, and lie in the 

+P14 
grasp, of the governors of human society.  This is the wish 
of God and His decree....  We cherish the hope that one of 
the kings of the earth will, for the sake of God, arise for the 
triumph of this wronged, this oppressed people.  Such a 
king will be eternally extolled and glorified.  God hath 
prescribed unto this people the duty of aiding whosoever 
will aid them, of serving his best interests, and of demonstrating 
to him their abiding loyalty.  They who follow Me 
must strive, under all circumstances, to promote the welfare 
of whosoever will arise for the triumph of My Cause, 
and must at all times prove their devotion and fidelity unto 
him.  Happy is the man that hearkeneth and observeth My 
counsel.  Woe unto him that faileth to fulfil My wish. 

+P15 
              NAPOLEON III 

+P16 

+P17 
     O KING of Paris!  Tell the priest to ring the bells no 
longer.  By God, the True One!  The Most 
Mighty Bell hath appeared in the form of Him 
Who is the Most Great Name, and the fingers 
of the will of Thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, 
toll it out in the heaven of Immortality, in His name, the 
All-Glorious.  Thus have the mighty verses of Thy Lord 
been again sent down unto thee, that thou mayest arise to 
remember God, the Creator of earth and heaven, in these 
days when all the tribes of the earth have mourned, and the 
foundations of the cities have trembled, and the dust of irreligion 
hath enwrapped all men, except such as God, the 
All-Knowing, the All-Wise, was pleased to spare.  Say:  He 
Who is the Unconditioned is come, in the clouds of light, 
that He may quicken all created things with the breeze of 
His Name, the Most Merciful, and unify the world, and 
gather all men around this Table which hath been sent 
down from heaven.  Beware that ye deny not the favour of 
God after it hath been sent down unto you.  Better is this 
for you than that which ye possess; for that which is yours 
perisheth, whilst that which is with God endureth.  He, in 
truth, ordaineth what He pleaseth.  Verily, the breezes of 
forgiveness have been wafted from the direction of your 
Lord, the God of Mercy; whoso turneth thereunto, shall 
be cleansed of his sins, and of all pain and sickness.  Happy 
the man that hath turned towards them, and woe betide 
him that hath turned aside. 

+P18 
     Wert thou to incline thine inner ear unto all created 
things, thou wouldst hear:  `The Ancient of Days is come 
in His great glory!'  Everything celebrateth the praise of its 
Lord.  Some have known God and remember Him; others 
remember Him, yet know Him not.  Thus have We set 
down Our decree in a perspicuous Tablet. 
     Give ear, O King, unto the Voice that calleth from the 
Fire which burneth in this verdant Tree, on this Sinai which 
hath been raised above the hallowed and snow-white Spot, 
beyond the Everlasting City:  `Verily, there is none other 
God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful!'  We, 
in truth, have sent Him Whom We aided with the Holy 
Spirit (Jesus Christ) that He may announce unto you this 
Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of 
your Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and Whose 
signs have been revealed in the West.  Set your faces towards 
Him (&amp;Baha'u'llah) on this Day which God hath exalted 
above all other days, and whereon the All-Merciful 
hath shed the splendour of His effulgent glory upon all 
who are in heaven and all who are on earth.  Arise thou to 
serve God and help His Cause.  He, verily, will assist thee 
with the hosts of the seen and unseen, and will set thee king 
over all that whereon the sun riseth.  Thy Lord, in truth, is 
the All-Powerful, the Almighty. 
     The breezes of the Most Merciful have passed over all 
created things; happy the man that hath discovered their 
fragrance, and set himself towards them with a sound 
heart.  Attire thy temple with the ornament of My Name, 

+P19 
and thy tongue with remembrance of Me, and thine heart 
with love for Me, the Almighty, the Most High.  We have 
desired for thee naught except that which is better for thee 
than what thou dost possess and all the treasures of the 
earth.  Thy Lord, verily, is knowing, informed of all.  Arise, 
in My Name, amongst My servants, and say:  `O ye peoples 
of the earth!  Turn yourselves towards Him Who hath 
turned towards you.  He, verily, is the Face of God amongst 
you, and His Testimony and His Guide unto you.  He hath 
come to you with signs which none can produce.'  The 
voice of the Burning Bush is raised in the midmost heart of 
the world, and the Holy Spirit calleth aloud among the 
nations:  `Lo, the Desired One is come with manifest 
dominion!' 
     O King!  The stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, 
they who seek to establish the truth of My Cause 
through the things they possess, and who make mention of 
God in My Name.  And yet, when I came unto them in My 
glory, they turned aside.  They, indeed, are of the fallen. 
This is, truly, that which the Spirit of God (Jesus Christ) 
hath announced, when He came with truth unto you, He 
with Whom the Jewish doctors disputed, till at last they 
perpetrated what hath made the Holy Spirit to lament, and 
the tears of them that have near access to God to flow.... 
     O King!  We heard the words thou didst utter in answer 
to the Czar of Russia, concerning the decision made regarding 
the war (Crimean War).  Thy Lord, verily, knoweth, 
is informed of all.  Thou didst say:  `I lay asleep upon my 

+P20 
couch, when the cry of the oppressed, who were drowned 
in the Black Sea, wakened me.'  This is what we heard thee 
say, and, verily, thy Lord is witness unto what I say.  We 
testify that that which wakened thee was not their cry but 
the promptings of thine own passions, for We tested thee, 
and found thee wanting.  Comprehend the meaning of My 
words, and be thou of the discerning.  It is not Our wish to 
address thee words of condemnation, out of regard for the 
dignity We conferred upon thee in this mortal life.  We, 
verily, have chosen courtesy, and made it the true mark of 
such as are nigh unto Him.  Courtesy, is, in truth, a raiment 
which fitteth all men, whether young or old.  Well is it with 
him that adorneth his temple therewith, and woe unto him 
who is deprived of this great bounty.  Hadst thou been sincere 
in thy words, thou wouldst have not cast behind thy 
back the Book of God, when it was sent unto thee by Him 
Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise.  We have proved thee 
through it, and found thee other than that which thou didst 
profess.  Arise, and make amends for that which escaped 
thee.  Ere long the world and all that thou possessest will 
perish, and the kingdom will remain unto God, thy Lord 
and the Lord of thy fathers of old.  It behoveth thee not to 
conduct thine affairs according to the dictates of thy desires. 
Fear the sighs of this Wronged One, and shield Him from 
the darts of such as act unjustly. 
     For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown 
into confusion, and thine empire shall pass from thine 
hands, as a punishment for that which thou hast wrought. 

+P21 
Then wilt thou know how thou hast plainly erred.  Commotions 
shall seize all the people in that land, unless thou 
arisest to help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the 
Spirit of God (Jesus Christ) in this, the Straight Path.  Hath 
thy pomp made thee proud?  By My Life!  It shall not endure; 
nay, it shall soon pass away, unless thou holdest fast 
by this firm Cord.  We see abasement hastening after thee, 
whilst thou art of the heedless.  It behoveth thee when 
thou hearest His Voice calling from the seat of glory to cast 
away all that thou possessest, and cry out:  `Here am I, O 
Lord of all that is in heaven and all that is on earth!' 
     O King!  We were in &amp;Iraq, when the hour of parting 
arrived.  At the bidding of the King of &amp;Islam (&amp;Sultan of 
Turkey) We set Our steps in his direction.  Upon Our 
arrival, there befell Us at the hands of the malicious that 
which the books of the world can never adequately recount. 
Thereupon the inmates of Paradise, and they that 
dwell within the retreats of holiness, lamented; and yet the 
people are wrapped in a thick veil!... 
     More grievous became Our plight from day to day, nay, 
from hour to hour, until they took Us forth from Our 
prison and made Us, with glaring injustice, enter the Most 
Great Prison.... 
     Know of a truth that your subjects are God's trust 
amongst you.  Watch ye, therefore, over them as ye watch 
over your own selves.  Beware that ye allow not wolves to 
become the shepherds of the fold, or pride and conceit to 
deter you from turning unto the poor and the desolate. 

+P22 
Arise thou, in My name, above the horizon of renunciation, 
and set, then, thy face towards the Kingdom, at the 
bidding of thy Lord, the Lord of strength and of might. 
     Adorn the body of Thy kingdom with the raiment of 
My name, and arise, then, to teach My Cause.  Better is this 
for thee than that which thou possessest.  God will, thereby, 
exalt thy name among all the kings.  Potent is He over all 
things.  Walk thou amongst men in the name of God, and 
by the power of His might, that thou mayest show forth 
His signs amidst the peoples of the earth.... 
     Regard ye the world as a man's body, which is afflicted 
with divers ailments, and the recovery of which dependeth 
upon the harmonizing of all of its component elements. 
Gather ye around that which We have prescribed unto 
you, and walk not in the ways of such as create dissension. 
Meditate on the world and the state of its people.  He, for 
Whose sake the world was called into being, hath been 
imprisoned in the most desolate of cities (&amp;Akka), by reason 
of that which the hands of the wayward have wrought. 
From the horizon of His prison-city He summoneth mankind 
unto the Dayspring of God, the Exalted, the Great. 
Exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess, knowing 
they shall perish?  Rejoicest thou in that thou rulest a 
span of earth, when the whole world, in the estimation of 
the people of &amp;Baha, is worth as much as the black in the eye 
of a dead ant?  Abandon it unto such as have set their affections 
upon it, and turn thou unto Him Who is the Desire 
of the world.  Whither are gone the proud and their 

+P23 
palaces?  Gaze thou into their tombs, that thou mayest 
profit by this example, inasmuch as We made it a lesson 
unto every beholder.  Were the breezes of Revelation to 
seize thee, thou wouldst flee the world, and turn unto the 
Kingdom, and wouldst expend all thou possessest, that 
thou mayest draw nigh unto this sublime Vision.

              CZAR ALEXANDER II 

+P26 

+P27 
     O CZAR of Russia!  Incline thine ear unto the 
voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn 
thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth 
He Who, among the Concourse on high, beareth 
the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of 
creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the 
All-Glorious.  Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning 
towards the face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the 
Most Merciful.  We, verily, have heard the thing for which 
thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst secretly communing 
with Him.  Wherefore, the breeze of My loving-kindness 
wafted forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We 
answered thee in truth.  Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, 
the All-Wise.  Whilst I lay chained and fettered in the 
prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his aid.  Wherefore 
hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge 
of none can comprehend except His knowledge. 
Beware lest thou barter away this sublime station...  Beware 
lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is 
the Supreme Sovereign.  He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, 
and all the atoms cry aloud:  `Lo!  The Lord is come 
in His great majesty!'  He Who is the Father is come, and 
the Son (Jesus), in the holy vale, crieth out:  `Here am I, 
here am I, O Lord, My God!' whilst Sinai circleth round 
the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud:  `The All-Bounteous 
is come mounted upon the clouds!  Blessed is he 

+P28 
that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are 
far away.' 
     Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling 
Cause, and summon, then, the nations unto God, 
the Exalted, the Great.  Be thou not of them who called 
upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is 
the Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned 
aside from Him, and, in the end, pronounced sentence 
against Him with manifest injustice.  Consider and call 
thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit of God (Jesus) 
appeared, and Herod gave judgment against Him.  God, 
however, aided Him with the hosts of the unseen, and protected 
Him with truth, and sent Him down unto another 
land, according to His promise.  He, verily, ordaineth what 
He pleaseth.  Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, 
be he in the midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, 
or beneath the sword of the oppressor.... 
     Again I say:  Hearken unto My Voice that calleth from 
My prison that it may acquaint thee with the things that 
have befallen My Beauty, at the hands of them that are the 
manifestations of My glory, and that thou mayest perceive 
how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding My 
might, and how immense My forbearance, notwithstanding 
My power.  By My Life!  Couldst thou but know the 
things sent down by My Pen, and discover the treasures of 
My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in 
the seas of My names and in the goblets of My words, thou 
wouldst, in thy love for My name, and in thy longing for 

+P29 
My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay down thy life in 
My path.  Know thou that though My body be beneath the 
swords of My foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable 
afflictions, yet My spirit is filled with a gladness with which 
all the joys of the earth can never compare. 
     Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration 
for the world, and say:  O peoples of the earth!  Have 
ye denied the One in Whose path He Who came with the 
truth, bearing the announcement of your Lord, the Exalted, 
the Great, suffered martyrdom?  Say:  This is an Announcement 
whereat the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers 
have rejoiced.  This is the One Whom the heart of the 
world remembereth and is promised in the Books of God, 
the Mighty, the All-Wise.  The hands of the Messengers 
were, in their desire to meet Me, upraised towards God, 
the Mighty, the Glorified....  Some lamented in their 
separation from Me, others endured hardships in My path, 
and still others laid down their lives for the sake of My 
Beauty, could ye but know it.  Say:  I, verily, have not 
sought to extol Mine Own Self, but rather God Himself 
were ye to judge fairly.  Naught can be seen in Me except 
God and His Cause, could ye but perceive it.  I am the One 
Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with 
Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were 
adorned....  Blessed be the king whose sovereignty hath 
withheld him not from his Sovereign, and who hath 
turned unto God with his heart.  He, verily, is accounted of 
those that have attained unto that which God, the Mighty, 

+P30 
the All-Wise hath willed.  Ere long will such a one find 
himself numbered with the monarchs of the realms of the 
Kingdom.  Thy Lord is, in truth, potent over all things.  He 
giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and 
withholdeth what He pleaseth from whomsoever He 
willeth.  He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.

              QUEEN VICTORIA 

+P32 

+P33 
     O QUEEN in London!  Incline thine ear unto the 
voice of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, 
calling from the Divine Lote-Tree:  Verily, no 
God is there but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise! 
Cast away all that is on earth, and attire the head of 
thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy 
Lord, the All-Glorious.  He, in truth, hath come unto the 
world in His most great glory, and all that hath been mentioned 
in the Gospel hath been fulfilled.  The land of Syria 
hath been honoured by the footsteps of its Lord, the Lord 
of all men, and North and South are both inebriated with 
the wine of His presence.  Blessed is the man that inhaled the 
fragrance of the Most Merciful, and turned unto the Dawning-Place 
of His Beauty, in this resplendent Dawn.  The 
Mosque of &amp;Aqsa vibrateth through the breezes of its Lord, 
the All-Glorious whilst &amp;Batha (Mecca) trembleth at the 
voice of God, the Exalted, the Most High.  Whereupon 
every single stone of them celebrateth the praise of the 
Lord, through this Great Name. 
     Lay aside thy desire, and set then thine heart towards thy 
Lord, the Ancient of Days.  We make mention of thee for 
the sake of God, and desire that thy name may be exalted 
through thy remembrance of God, the Creator of earth 
and heaven.  He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. 
We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading 
in slaves, both men and women.  This, verily, is what 

+P34 
God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation.  God hath, 
truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this.  He, verily, 
will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou 
to follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the 
All-Knowing, the All-Informed.  As to him who turneth 
aside, and swelleth with pride, after that the clear tokens 
have come unto him, from the Revealer of signs, his work 
shall God bring to naught.  He, in truth, hath power over 
all things.  Man's actions are acceptable after his having 
recognized (the Manifestation).  He that turneth aside from 
the True One is indeed the most veiled amongst His creatures. 
Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the 
Almighty, the Most Powerful. 
     We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of 
counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people. 
Thou, indeed, hast done well, for thereby the foundations 
of the edifice of thine affairs will be strengthened, and the 
hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether high or 
low, will be tranquillized.  It behoveth them, however, to 
be trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves 
as the representatives of all that dwell on earth.  This 
is what counselleth them, in this Tablet, He Who is the 
Ruler, the All-Wise...  Blessed is he that entereth the assembly 
for the sake of God, and judgeth between men with 
pure justice.  He, indeed, is of the blissful.... 
     Turn thou unto God and say:  O my Sovereign Lord!  I 
am but a vassal of Thine, and Thou art, in truth, the King 
of Kings.  I have lifted my suppliant hands unto the heaven 

+P35 
of Thy grace and Thy bounties.  Send down, then, upon 
me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will rid 
me of all save Thee, and draw me nigh unto Thyself.  I beseech 
Thee, O my Lord, by Thy name, which Thou hast 
made the king of names, and the manifestation of Thyself 
to all who are in heaven and on earth, to rend asunder the 
veils that have intervened between me and my recognition 
of the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Day Spring of 
Thy Revelation.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, 
the All-Bounteous.  Deprive me not, O my 
Lord, of the fragrances of the Robe of Thy mercy in Thy 
days, and write down for me that which Thou hast written 
down for thy handmaidens who have believed in Thee and 
in Thy signs, and have recognized Thee, and set their 
hearts towards the horizon of Thy Cause.  Thou art truly 
the Lord of the worlds and of those who show mercy the 
Most Merciful.  Assist me, then, O my God, to remember 
Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy Cause in 
Thy lands.  Accept, then, that which hath escaped me when 
the light of Thy countenance shone forth.  Thou, indeed, 
hast power over all things.  Glory be to Thee, O Thou in 
Whose hand is the kingdom of the heavens and of the 
earth.

              KAISER WILHELM I

+P39 
     O KING of Berlin!  Give ear unto the Voice calling 
from this manifest Temple:  Verily, there is 
none other God but Me, the Everlasting, the 
Peerless, the Ancient of Days.  Take heed lest 
pride debar thee from recognizing the Dayspring of Divine 
Revelation, lest earthly desires shut thee out, as by a 
veil, from the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth 
below.  Thus counselleth thee the Pen of the Most High. 
He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful.  Do 
thou remember the one whose power transcended thy 
power (Napoleon III), and whose station excelled thy 
station.  Where is he?  Whither are gone the things he possessed? 
Take warning, and be not of them that are fast 
asleep.  He it was who cast the Tablet of God behind him, 
when We made known unto him what the hosts of tyranny 
had caused Us to suffer.  Wherefore, disgrace assailed him 
from all sides, and he went down to dust in great loss. 
Think deeply, O King, concerning him, and concerning 
them who, like unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled 
over men.  The All-Merciful brought them down from 
their palaces to their graves.  Be warned, be of them who 
reflect...  O banks of the Rhine!  We have seen you covered 
with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were 
drawn against you; and you shall have another turn.  And 
We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today 
in conspicuous glory.

     O EMPEROR of Austria!  He who is the Dayspring 
of God's Light dwelt in the prison of &amp;Akka, at 
the time when thou didst set forth to visit the 
&amp;Aqsa Mosque (Jerusalem).  Thou passed Him 
by, and inquired not about Him, by Whom every house is 
exalted, and every lofty gate unlocked.  We, verily, made it 
(Jerusalem) a place whereunto the world should turn, that 
they might remember Me, and yet thou hast rejected Him 
Who is the Object of this remembrance, when He appeared 
with the Kingdom of God, thy Lord and the Lord 
of the worlds.  We have been with thee at all times, and 
found thee clinging unto the Branch and heedless of the 
Root.  Thy Lord, verily, is a witness unto what I say.  We 
grieved to see thee circle round Our Name, whilst unaware 
of Us, though We were before thy face.  Open thine 
eyes, that thou mayest behold this glorious Vision, and 
recognize Him Whom thou invokest in the daytime and in 
the night-season, and gaze on the Light that shineth above 
this luminous Horizon.

              &amp;SULTAN &amp;ABDU'L-'AZIZ 

+P46 

+P47 
     HEARKEN, O King, to the speech of Him that 
speaketh the truth, Him that doth not ask 
thee to recompense Him with the things God 
hath chosen to bestow upon thee, Him Who 
unerringly treadeth the straight Path.  He it is Who 
summoneth thee unto God, thy Lord, Who showeth 
thee the right course, the way that leadeth to true felicity, 
that haply thou mayest be of them with whom it shall be 
well. 
     Beware, O King, that thou gather not around thee such 
ministers as follow the desires of a corrupt inclination, as 
have cast behind their backs that which hath been committed 
into their hands and manifestly betrayed their trust. 
Be bounteous to others as God hath been bounteous to 
thee, and abandon not the interests of thy people to the 
mercy of such ministers as these.  Lay not aside the fear of 
God, and be thou of them that act uprightly.  Gather 
around thee those ministers from whom thou canst perceive 
the fragrance of faith and of justice, and take thou 
counsel with them, and choose whatever is best in thy sight, 
and be of them that act generously. 
     Know thou for a certainty that whoso disbelieveth in 
God is neither trustworthy nor truthful.  This, indeed, is 
the truth, the undoubted truth.  He that acteth treacherously 
towards God will, also, act treacherously towards his king. 
Nothing whatever can deter such a man from evil, nothing 

+P48 
can hinder him from betraying his neighbour, nothing can 
induce him to walk uprightly. 
     Take heed that thou resign not the reins of the affairs of 
thy state into the hands of others, and repose not thy confidence 
in ministers unworthy of thy trust, and be not of 
them that live in heedlessness.  Shun them whose hearts are 
turned away from thee, and place not thy confidence in 
them, and entrust them not with thy affairs and the affairs 
of such as profess thy faith.  Beware that thou allow not the 
wolf to become the shepherd of God's flock, and surrender 
not the fate of His loved ones to the mercy of the malicious. 
Expect not that they who violate the ordinances of God 
will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they profess. 
Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself, lest 
their devices and mischief hurt thee.  Turn away from them, 
and fix thy gaze upon God, thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the 
Most Bountiful.  He that giveth up himself wholly to God, 
God shall, assuredly, be with him; and he that placeth his 
complete trust in God, God shall, verily, protect him from 
whatsoever may harm him, and shield him from the 
wickedness of every evil plotter. 
     Wert thou to incline thine ear unto My speech and observe 
My counsel, God would exalt thee to so eminent a 
position that the designs of no man on the whole earth 
could ever touch or hurt thee.  Observe, O King, with thine 
inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts of 
God, and walk not in the paths of the oppressor.  Seize 
thou, and hold firmly within the grasp of thy might, the 

+P49 
reins of the affairs of thy people, and examine in person 
whatever pertaineth unto them.  Let nothing escape thee, 
for therein lieth the highest good. 
     Render thanks unto God for having chosen thee out of 
the whole world, and made thee king over them that profess 
thy faith.  It well beseemeth thee to appreciate the 
wondrous favours with which God hath favoured thee, 
and to magnify continually His name.  Thou canst best 
praise Him if thou lovest His loved ones, and dost safeguard 
and protect His servants from the mischief of the 
treacherous, that none may any longer oppress them. 
Thou shouldst, moreover, arise to enforce the law of God 
amongst them, that thou mayest be of those who are firmly 
established in His law. 
     Shouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters 
amongst thy subjects, God would surely aid thee with the 
hosts of the unseen and of the seen and would strengthen 
thee in thine affairs.  No God is there but Him.  All creation 
and its empire are His.  Unto Him return the works of the 
faithful. 
     Place not thy reliance on thy treasures.  Put thy whole 
confidence in the grace of God, thy Lord.  Let Him be thy 
trust in whatever thou doest, and be of them that have submitted 
themselves to His Will.  Let Him be thy helper and 
enrich thyself with His treasures, for with Him are the 
treasuries of the heavens and of the earth.  He bestoweth 
them upon whom He will, and from whom He will He 
withholdeth them.  There is none other God but Him, the 

+P50 
All-Possessing, the All-Praised.  All are but paupers at the 
door of His mercy; all are helpless before the revelation of 
His sovereignty, and beseech His favours. 
     Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly 
with them that serve thee.  Bestow upon them according 
to their needs and not to the extent that will enable them to 
lay up riches for themselves, to deck their persons, to embellish 
their homes, to acquire the things that are of no 
benefit unto them, and to be numbered with the extravagant. 
Deal with them with undeviating justice, so that none 
among them may either suffer want, or be pampered with 
luxuries.  This is but manifest justice. 
     Allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them 
who are noble and worthy of honour, and suffer not the 
high-minded to be at the mercy of the contemptible and 
worthless, for this is what We observed upon Our arrival 
in the City (Constantinople), and to it We bear witness. 
We found among its inhabitants some who were possessed 
of an affluent fortune and lived in the midst of excessive 
riches, whilst others were in dire want and abject poverty. 
This ill beseemeth thy sovereignty, and is unworthy of thy 
rank. 
     Let My counsel be acceptable to thee, and strive thou to 
rule with equity among men, that God may exalt thy name 
and spread abroad the fame of thy justice in all the world. 
Beware lest thou aggrandize thy ministers at the expense of 
thy subjects.  Fear the sighs of the poor and of the upright 
in heart who, at every break of day, bewail their plight, 

+P51 
and be unto them a benignant sovereign.  They, verily, are 
thy treasures on earth.  It behoveth thee, therefore, to safeguard 
thy treasures from the assaults of them who wish to 
rob thee.  Inquire into their affairs, and ascertain, every 
year, nay every month, their condition, and be not of them 
that are careless of their duty. 
     Set before thine eyes God's unerring Balance and, as one 
standing in His Presence, weigh in that Balance thine 
actions every day, every moment of thy life.  Bring thyself 
to account ere thou art summoned to a reckoning, on the 
Day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of 
God, the Day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be 
made to tremble. 
     It behoveth every king to be as bountiful as the sun, 
which fostereth the growth of all beings, and giveth to 
each its due, whose benefits are not inherent in itself, but 
are ordained by Him Who is the Most Powerful, the Almighty. 
The king should be as generous, as liberal in his 
mercy as the clouds, the outpourings of whose bounty are 
showered upon every land, by the behest of Him Who is 
the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Knowing. 
     Have a care not to entrust thine affairs of state entirely 
into another's hands.  None can discharge thy functions 
better than thine own self.  Thus do We make clear unto 
thee Our words of wisdom, and send down upon thee that 
which can enable thee to pass over from the left hand of 
oppression to the right hand of justice, and approach the 
resplendent ocean of His favours.  Such is the path which 

+P52 
the kings that were before thee have trodden, they that 
acted equitably towards their subjects, and walked in the 
ways of undeviating justice. 
     Thou art God's shadow on earth.  Strive, therefore, to act 
in such a manner as befitteth so eminent, so august a station. 
If thou dost depart from following the things We have 
caused to descend upon thee and taught thee, thou wilt, 
assuredly, be derogating from that great and priceless 
honour.  Return, then, and cleave wholly unto God, and 
cleanse thine heart from the world and all its vanities, and 
suffer not the love of any stranger to enter and dwell therein. 
Not until thou dost purify thine heart from every trace 
of such love can the brightness of the light of God shed its 
radiance upon it, for to none hath God given more than 
one heart.  This, verily, hath been decreed and written 
down in His ancient Book.  And as the human heart, as 
fashioned by God, is one and undivided, it behoveth thee 
to take heed that its affections be, also, one and undivided. 
Cleave thou, therefore, with the whole affection of thine 
heart, unto His love, and withdraw it from the love of any 
one besides Him, that He may aid thee to immerse thyself 
in the ocean of His unity, and enable thee to become a true 
upholder of His oneness.  God is My witness.  My sole purpose 
in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee 
from the transitory things of the earth, and aid thee to enter 
the realm of everlasting glory, that thou mayest, by the 
leave of God, be of them that abide and rule therein.... 
     Let thine ear be attentive, O King, to the words We have 

+P53 
addressed to thee.  Let the oppressor desist from his tyranny, 
and cut off the perpetrators of injustice from among them 
that profess thy faith.  By the righteousness of God!  The 
tribulations We have sustained are such that any pen that 
recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish. 
No one of them that truly believe and uphold the unity of 
God can bear the burden of their recital.  So great have been 
Our sufferings that even the eyes of Our enemies have wept 
over Us, and beyond them those of every discerning person. 
And to all these trials have We been subjected, in spite 
of Our action in approaching thee, and in bidding the 
people to enter beneath thy shadow, that thou mightest be 
a stronghold unto them that believe in and uphold the 
unity of God. 
     Have I, O King, ever disobeyed thee?  Have I, at any 
time, transgressed any of thy laws?  Can any of thy ministers 
that represented thee in &amp;Iraq produce any proof that 
can establish my disloyalty to thee?  No, by Him Who is the 
Lord of all worlds!  Not for one short moment did We 
rebel against thee, or against any of thy ministers.  Never, 
God willing, shall We revolt against thee, though We be 
exposed to trials more severe than any We suffered in the 
past. 
     In the day-time and in the night season, at even and at 
morn, We pray to God on thy behalf, that He may 
graciously aid thee to be obedient unto Him and to observe 
His commandment, that He may shield thee from 
the hosts of the evil ones.  Do, therefore, as it pleaseth thee, 

+P54 
and treat Us as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy 
sovereignty.  Be not forgetful of the law of God in whatever 
thou desirest to achieve, now or in the days to come. 
Say:  Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!

+P57 
     O KING!  I was but a man like others, asleep upon 
My couch, when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious 
were wafted over Me, and taught Me 
the knowledge of all that hath been.  This thing 
is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. 
And He bade Me lift up My voice between earth 
and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused 
the tears of every man of understanding to flow.  The learning 
current amongst men I studied not; their schools I 
entered not.  Ask of the city wherein I dwelt, that thou 
mayest be well assured that I am not of them who speak 
falsely.  This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy 
Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have stirred.  Can it be 
still when the tempestuous winds are blowing?  Nay, by 
Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes!  They 
move it as they list.  The evanescent is as nothing before 
Him Who is the Ever-Abiding.  His all-compelling summons 
hath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise 
amidst all people.  I was indeed as one dead when His behest 
was uttered.  The hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate, 
the Merciful, transformed Me.  Can any one 
speak forth of his own accord that for which all men, both 
high and low, will protest against him?  Nay, by Him Who 
taught the Pen the eternal mysteries, save him whom the 
grace of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath strengthened. 
The Pen of the Most High addresseth Me saying: 

+P58 
Fear not.  Relate unto His Majesty the &amp;Shah that which befell 
thee.  His heart, verily, is between the fingers of thy 
Lord, the God of Mercy, that haply the sun of justice and 
bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his heart. 
Thus hath the decree been irrevocably fixed by Him Who 
is the All-Wise. 
     Look upon this Youth, O King, with the eyes of justice; 
judge thou, then, with truth concerning what hath befallen 
Him.  Of a verity, God hath made thee His shadow amongst 
men, and the sign of His power unto all that dwell on 
earth.  Judge thou between Us and them that have wronged 
Us without proof and without an enlightening Book. 
They that surround thee love thee for their own sakes, 
whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine own sake, and hath 
had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of 
grace, and to turn thee toward the right-hand of justice. 
Thy Lord beareth witness unto that which I declare. 
     O King!  Wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of 
the Pen of Glory and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity 
which, on the branches of the Lote-Tree beyond which 
there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the Maker of all 
names and Creator of earth and heaven, thou wouldst 
attain unto a station from which thou wouldst behold in 
the world of being naught save the effulgence of the 
Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty as the 
most contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to 
whosoever might desire it, and setting thy face toward the 
Horizon aglow with the light of His countenance.  Neither 

+P59 
wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the burden of 
dominion save for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the 
Exalted, the Most High.  Then would the Concourse on 
high bless thee.  O how excellent is this most sublime station, 
couldst thou ascend thereunto through the power of a 
sovereignty recognized as derived from the Name of 
God!... 
     O King of the age!  The eyes of these refugees are turned 
towards and fixed upon the mercy of the Most Merciful. 
No doubt is there whatever that these tribulations will be 
followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy, and 
these dire adversities be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity. 
We fain would hope, however, that His Majesty 
the &amp;Shah will himself examine these matters, and bring 
hope to the hearts.  That which We have submitted to thy 
Majesty is indeed for thine highest good.  And God, verily, 
is a sufficient witness unto Me.... 
     O would that thou wouldst permit Me, O &amp;Shah, to send 
unto thee that which would cheer the eyes, and tranquillize 
the souls, and persuade every fair-minded person that with 
Him is the knowledge of the Book...  But for the repudiation 
of the foolish and the connivance of the divines, I 
would have uttered a discourse that would have thrilled 
and carried away the hearts unto a realm from the murmur 
of whose winds can be heard:  `No God is there but He!'... 
     I have seen, O &amp;Shah, in the path of God what eye hath 
not seen nor ear heard...  How numerous the tribulations 
which have rained, and will soon rain, upon Me!  I advance 

+P60 
with My face set towards Him Who is the Almighty, the 
All-Bounteous, whilst behind Me glideth the serpent. 
Mine eyes have rained down tears until My bed is drenched. 
I sorrow not for Myself, however.  By God!  Mine head 
yearneth for the spear out of love for its Lord.  I never 
passed a tree, but Mine heart addressed it saying:  `O would 
that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified 
upon thee, in the path of My Lord!'...  By God! 
Though weariness lay Me low, and hunger consume Me, 
and the bare rock be My bed, and My fellows the beasts of 
the field, I will not complain, but will endure patiently as 
those endued with constancy and firmness have endured 
patiently, through the power of God, the Eternal King and 
Creator of the nations, and will render thanks unto God 
under all conditions.  We pray that, out of His bounty-- 
exalted be He--He may release, through this imprisonment, 
the necks of men from chains and fetters, and cause 
them to turn, with sincere faces, towards His Face, Who is 
the Mighty, the Bounteous.  Ready is He to answer whosoever 
calleth upon Him, and nigh is He unto such as commune 
with Him.

              THE RULERS OF AMERICA 

+P62 

+P63 
     HEARKEN ye, O Rulers of America and the Presidents 
of the Republics therein, unto that 
which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of 
Eternity:  There is none other God but Me, the 
Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.  Adorn ye 
the temple of dominion with the ornament of justice and of 
the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the remembrance 
of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens.  Thus 
counselleth you He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as 
bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 
The Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station, 
whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced. 
Take ye advantage of the Day of God.  Verily, to meet Him 
is better for you than all that whereon the sun shineth, 
could ye but know it.  O concourse of rulers!  Give ear unto 
that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur: 
Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of 
Utterance, the All-Knowing.  Bind ye the broken with the 
hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth 
with the rod of the commandments of your Lord, the 
Ordainer, the All-Wise.

              THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES 
              OF THE PEOPLES IN EVERY LAND 

+P66 

+P67 
     O YE the elected representatives of the people in 
every land!  Take ye counsel together, and let 
your concern be only for that which profiteth 
mankind, and bettereth the condition thereof, 
if ye be of them that scan heedfully.  Regard the world as 
the human body which, though at its creation whole and 
perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with 
grave disorders and maladies.  Not for one day did it gain 
ease, nay its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the 
treatment of ignorant physicians, who gave full rein to 
their personal desires, and have erred grievously.  And if, at 
one time, through the care of an able physician, a member 
of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. 
Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 
     We behold it, in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk 
with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best 
advantage, much less recognize a Revelation so bewildering 
and challenging as this.  And whenever any one of them 
hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been 
his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness 
of this motive hath limited his power to heal or 
cure. 
     That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign 
remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the 
world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, 
one common Faith.  This can in no wise be achieved except 

+P68 
through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired 
Physician.  This, verily, is the truth, and all else 
naught but error.... 

+P69 
              SUMMONS TO THE WORLD'S 
                RELIGIOUS LEADERS 

+P70 

+P71 
                   COLLECTIVELY 

+P72 

+P73 
     O LEADERS of religion!  Weigh not the Book of 
God with such standards and sciences as are 
current amongst you, for the Book itself is the 
unerring balance established amongst men.  In 
this most perfect balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds 
of the earth possess must be weighed, while the measure 
of its weight should be tested according to its own 
standard, did ye but know it. 
     The eye of My loving-kindness weepeth sore over you, 
inasmuch as ye have failed to recognize the One upon 
Whom ye have been calling in the daytime and in the night 
season, at even and at morn.  Advance, O people, with 
snow-white faces and radiant hearts, unto the blest and 
crimson Spot, wherein the &amp;Sadratu'l-Muntaha is calling: 
`Verily, there is none other God beside Me, the Omnipotent 
Protector, the Self-Subsisting!' 
     O ye leaders of religion!  Who is the man amongst you 
that can rival Me in vision or insight?  Where is he to be 
found that dareth to claim to be My equal in utterance or 
wisdom?  No, by My Lord, the All-Merciful!  All on the 
earth shall pass away; and this is the face of your Lord, the 
Almighty, the Well-Beloved. 
     We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end 
of all learning be the recognition of Him Who is the Object 
of all knowledge; and yet, behold how ye have allowed 
your learning to shut you out, as by a veil, from Him Who 

+P74 
is the Dayspring of this Light, through Whom every hidden 
thing hath been revealed.  Could ye but discover the 
source whence the splendour of this utterance is diffused, 
ye would cast away the peoples of the world and all that 
they possess, and would draw nigh unto this most blessed 
Seat of glory. 
     Say:  This, verily, is the heaven in which the Mother 
Book is treasured, could ye but comprehend it.  He it is 
Who hath caused the Rock to shout, and the Burning Bush 
to lift up its voice, upon the Mount rising above the Holy 
Land, and proclaim:  `The Kingdom is God's, the sovereign 
Lord of all, the All-Powerful, the Loving!' 
     We have not entered any school, nor read any of your 
dissertations.  Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered 
One, wherewith He summoneth you unto God, 
the Ever-Abiding.  Better is this for you than all the treasures 
of the earth, could ye but comprehend it. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of divines!  When My verses were sent 
down, and My clear tokens were revealed, We found you 
behind the veils.  This, verily, is a strange thing....  We have 
rent the veils asunder.  Beware lest ye shut out the people by 
yet another veil.  Pluck asunder the chains of vain imaginings, 
in the name of the Lord of all men, and be not of the 
deceitful.  Should ye turn unto God, and embrace His 

+P75 
Cause, spread not disorder within it, and measure not the 
Book of God with your selfish desires.  This, verily, is the 
counsel of God aforetime and hereafter....  Had ye believed 
in God, when He revealed Himself, the people 
would not have turned aside from Him, nor would the 
things ye witness today have befallen Us.  Fear God, and be 
not of the heedless....  This is the Cause that hath caused all 
your superstitions and idols to tremble....  O concourse of 
divines!  Beware lest ye be the cause of strife in the land, 
even as ye were the cause of the repudiation of the Faith in 
its early days.  Gather the people around this Word that 
hath made the pebbles to cry out:  `The Kingdom is 
God's, the Dawning-Place of all signs!'...  Tear the veils 
asunder in such wise that the inmates of the Kingdom 
will hear them being rent.  This is the command of God, 
in days gone by, and for those to come.  Blessed the man 
that observeth that whereunto he was bidden, and woe 
betide the negligent. 
 

     HOW long will ye, O concourse of divines, level the 
spears of hatred at the face of &amp;Baha?  Rein in your pens.  Lo, 
the Most Sublime Pen speaketh betwixt earth and heaven. 
Fear God, and follow not your desires which have altered 
the face of creation.  Purify your ears that they may hearken 
unto the Voice of God.  By God!  It is even as fire that consumeth 

+P76 
the veils, and as water that washeth the souls of all 
who are in the universe. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of divines!  Can any one of you race with 
the Divine Youth in the arena of wisdom and utterance, or 
soar with Him into the heaven of inner meaning and explanation? 
Nay, by My Lord, the God of mercy!  All have 
swooned away in this Day from the Word of thy Lord. 
They are even as dead and lifeless, except him whom thy 
Lord, the Almighty, the Unconstrained, hath willed to 
exempt.  Such a one is indeed of those endued with knowledge 
in the sight of Him Who is the All-Knowing.  The inmates 
of Paradise, and the dwellers of the sacred Folds, bless 
him at eventide and at dawn.  Can the one possessed of 
wooden legs resist him whose feet God hath made of steel? 
Nay, by Him Who illumineth the whole of creation! 
 

     WHEN We observed carefully, We discovered that Our 
enemies are, for the most part, the divines...  Among the 
people are those who said:  He hath repudiated the divines. 
Say:  Yea, by My Lord!  I, in very truth, was the One Who 
abolished the idols!  We, verily, have sounded the Trumpet, 

+P77 
which is Our Most Sublime Pen, and lo, the divines and 
the learned, and the doctors and the rulers, swooned away 
except such as God preserved, as a token of His grace, and 
He, verily, is the All-Bounteous, the Ancient of Days... 
     O concourse of divines!  Fling away idle fancies and 
imaginings, and turn, then, towards the Horizon of Certitude. 
I swear by God!  All that ye possess will profit you 
not, neither all the treasures of the earth, nor the leadership 
ye have usurped.  Fear God, and be not of the lost ones... 
Say:  O concourse of divines!  Lay aside all your veils and 
coverings.  Give ear unto that whereunto calleth you the 
Most Sublime Pen, in this wondrous Day....  The world is 
laden with dust, by reason of your vain imaginings, and the 
hearts of such as enjoy near access to God are troubled 
because of your cruelty.  Fear God, and be of them that 
judge equitably. 
 

     O YE the dawning-places of knowledge!  Beware that ye 
suffer not yourselves to become changed, for as ye change, 
most men will, likewise, change.  This, verily, is an injustice 
unto yourselves and unto others....  Ye are even as a 
spring.  If it be changed, so will the streams that branch out 
from it be changed.  Fear God, and be numbered with the 
godly.  In like manner, if the heart of man be corrupted, his 
limbs will also be corrupted.  And similarly, if the root of a 

+P78 
tree be corrupted, its branches, and its offshoots, and its 
leaves, and its fruits, will be corrupted.... 
     O concourse of divines!  Be fair, I adjure you by God, 
and nullify not the Truth with the things ye possess.  Peruse 
that which We have sent down with truth.  It will, verily, 
aid you, and will draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, 
the Great.  Consider and call to mind how when &amp;Muhammad, 
the Apostle of God, appeared, the people denied 
Him.  They ascribed unto Him what caused the Spirit 
(Jesus) to lament in His Most Sublime Station, and the 
Faithful Spirit to cry out.  Consider, moreover, the things 
which befell the Apostles and Messengers of God before 
Him, by reason of what the hands of the unjust have 
wrought.  We make mention of you for the sake of God, 
and remind you of His signs, and announce unto you the 
things ordained for such as are nigh unto Him in the most 
sublime Paradise and the all-highest Heaven, and I, verily, 
am the Announcer, the Omniscient.  He hath come for 
your salvation, and hath borne tribulations that ye may ascend, 
by the ladder of utterance, unto the summit of understanding.... 
Peruse, with fairness and justice, that which 
hath been sent down.  It will, verily, exalt you through the 
truth, and will cause you to behold the things from which 
ye have been withheld, and will enable you to quaff His 
sparkling Wine. 
 
+P79 
     THOSE divines ... who are truly adorned with the ornament 
of knowledge and of a goodly character are, verily, as 
a head to the body of the world, and as eyes to the nations. 
The guidance of men hath, at all times, been and is dependent 
upon these blessed souls. 
 

     THE divine whose conduct is upright, and the sage who 
is just, are as the spirit unto the body of the world.  Well is 
it with that divine whose head is attired with the crown of 
justice, and whose temple is adorned with the ornament of 
equity. 
 

     THE divine who hath seized and quaffed the most holy 
Wine, in the name of the sovereign Ordainer, is as an eye 
unto the world.  Well is it with them who obey him, and 
call him to remembrance. 
 

     GREAT is the blessedness of that divine that hath not 
allowed knowledge to become a veil between him and the 
One Who is the Object of all knowledge, and who, when 
the Self-Subsisting appeared, hath turned with a beaming 

+P80 
face towards Him.  He, in truth, is numbered with the 
learned.  The inmates of Paradise seek the blessing of his 
breath, and his lamp sheddeth its radiance over all who are 
in heaven and on earth.  He, verily, is numbered with the 
inheritors of the Prophets.  He that beholdeth him hath, 
verily, beheld the True One, and he that turneth towards 
him hath, verily, turned towards God, the Almighty, 
the All-Wise. 

 
     O CONCOURSE of divines!  Ye shall not henceforth behold 
yourselves possessed of any power, inasmuch as We 
have seized it from you, and destined it for such as have believed 
in God, the One, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, 
the Unconstrained. 

+P81 
              POPE PIUS IX 

+P82 

+P83 
     O POPE!  Rend the veils asunder.  He Who is the 
Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with 
clouds, and the decree hath been fulfilled by 
God, the Almighty, the Unrestrained...  He, 
verily, hath again come down from Heaven even as He 
came down from it the first time.  Beware that thou dispute 
not with Him even as the Pharisees disputed with Him 
(Jesus) without a clear token or proof.  On His right hand 
flow the living waters of grace, and on His left the choice 
Wine of justice, whilst before Him march the angels of 
Paradise, bearing the banners of His signs.  Beware lest any 
name debar thee from God, the Creator of earth and heaven. 
Leave thou the world behind thee, and turn towards 
thy Lord, through Whom the whole earth hath been illumined... 
Dwellest thou in palaces whilst He Who is the 
King of Revelation liveth in the most desolate of abodes? 
Leave them unto such as desire them, and set thy face with 
joy and delight towards the Kingdom...  Arise in the name 
of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, amidst the peoples of the 
earth, and seize thou the Cup of Life with the hands of confidence, 
and first drink thou therefrom, and proffer it then 
to such as turn towards it amongst the peoples of all faiths... 
     Call thou to remembrance Him Who was the Spirit 
(Jesus), Who when He came, the most learned of His age 
pronounced judgment against Him in His own country, 
whilst he who was only a fisherman believed in Him.  Take 

+P84 
heed, then, ye men of understanding heart!  Thou, in truth, 
art one of the suns of the heaven of His names.  Guard thyself, 
lest darkness spread its veils over thee, and fold thee 
away from His light...  Consider those who opposed the 
Son (Jesus), when He came unto them with sovereignty 
and power.  How many the Pharisees who were waiting to 
behold Him, and were lamenting over their separation 
from Him!  And yet, when the fragrance of His coming 
was wafted over them, and His beauty was unveiled, they 
turned aside from Him and disputed with Him...  None 
save a very few, who were destitute of any power amongst 
men, turned towards His face.  And yet, today, every man 
endowed with power and invested with sovereignty 
prideth himself on His Name!  In like manner, consider 
how numerous, in these days, are the monks who, in My 
Name, have secluded themselves in their churches, and 
who, when the appointed time was fulfilled, and We unveiled 
Our beauty, knew Us not, though they call upon 
Me at eventide and at dawn.... 
     The Word which the Son concealed is made manifest.  It 
hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in 
this day.  Blessed be the Lord Who is the Father!  He, verily, 
is come unto the nations in His most great majesty.  Turn 
your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous... 
This is the day whereon the Rock (Peter) crieth out and 
shouteth, and celebrateth the praise of its Lord, the All-Possessing, 
the Most High, saying:  `Lo!  The Father is 
come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is 

+P85 
fulfilled!...'  My body longeth for the cross, and Mine 
head waiteth the thrust of the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful, 
that the world may be purged from its transgressions.... 
     O Supreme Pontiff!  Incline thine ear unto that which the 
Fashioner of mouldering bones counselleth thee, as voiced 
by Him Who is His Most Great Name.  Sell all the embellished 
ornaments thou dost possess, and expend them in the 
path of God, Who causeth the night to return upon the day, 
and the day to return upon the night.  Abandon thy kingdom 
unto the kings, and emerge from thy habitation, with 
thy face set towards the Kingdom, and, detached from the 
world, then speak forth the praises of thy Lord betwixt 
earth and heaven.  Thus hath bidden thee He Who is the 
Possessor of Names, on the part of thy Lord, the Almighty, 
the All-Knowing.  Exhort thou the kings and say:  `Deal 
equitably with men.  Beware lest ye transgress the bounds 
fixed in the Book.'  This indeed becometh thee.  Beware lest 
thou appropriate unto thyself the things of the world and 
the riches thereof.  Leave them unto such as desire them, 
and cleave unto that which hath been enjoined upon thee 
by Him Who is the Lord of creation.  Should any one offer 
thee all the treasures of the earth, refuse to even glance 
upon them.  Be as thy Lord hath been.  Thus hath the 
Tongue of Revelation spoken that which God hath made 
the ornament of the book of creation...  Should the inebriation 
of the wine of My verses seize thee, and thou determinest 
to present thyself before the throne of thy Lord, 

+P86 
the Creator of earth and heaven, make My love thy vesture 
and thy shield remembrance of Me, and thy provision 
reliance upon God, the Revealer of all power...  Verily, the 
day of ingathering is come, and all things have been separated 
from each other.  He hath stored away that which He 
chose in the vessels of justice, and cast into fire that which 
befitteth it.  Thus hath it been decreed by your Lord, the 
Mighty, the Loving, in this promised Day.  He, verily, 
ordaineth what He pleaseth.  There is none other God save 
He, the Almighty, the All-Compelling. 

+P87 
              THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE OF 
                    VARIOUS FAITHS 

     At one time We address the people of the Torah and summon 
them unto Him Who is the Revealer of verses, Who hath 
come from Him Who layeth low the necks of men....  At another, 
We address the people of the Evangel and say:  `The 
All-Glorious is come in this Name whereby the Breeze of 
God hath wafted over all regions.'...  At still another, We 
address the people of the &amp;Qur'an saying:  `Fear the All-Merciful, 
and cavil not at Him through Whom all religions 
were founded.'...  Know thou, moreover, that We have addressed 
to the Magians Our Tablets, and adorned them with 
Our Law....  We have revealed in them the essence of all the 
hints and allusions contained in their Books.  The Lord, 
verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. 

+P88 

+P89 
     CALL out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the 
joyful tidings:  He that was hidden from mortal 
eyes is come!  His all-conquering sovereignty 
is manifest; His all-encompassing splendour is 
revealed.  Beware lest thou hesitate or halt.  Hasten forth 
and circumambulate the City of God that hath descended 
from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled 
in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the 
company of the most exalted angels.  O how I long to announce 
unto every spot on the surface of the earth, and to 
carry to each one of its cities, the glad-tidings of this Revelation 
--a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath been 
attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling: 
`Unto God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of 
earth and heaven.'  Verily this is the Day in which both land 
and sea rejoice at this announcement, the Day for which 
have been laid up those things which God, through a 
bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath 
destined for revelation.  Ere long will God sail His Ark upon 
thee, and will manifest the people of &amp;Baha who have been 
mentioned in the Book of Names. 

 
     THE Most Great Law is come, and the Ancient Beauty 
ruleth upon the throne of David.  Thus hath My Pen 
spoken that which the histories of bygone ages have related. 

+P90 
At this time, however, David crieth aloud and saith: 
`O my loving Lord!  Do Thou number me with such as 
have stood steadfast in Thy Cause, O Thou through 
Whom the faces have been illumined, and the footsteps 
have slipped!' 
 

     THE Breath hath been wafted, and the Breeze hath 
blown, and from Zion hath appeared that which was hidden, 
and from Jerusalem is heard the Voice of God, the 
One, the Incomparable, the Omniscient. 
 

     LEND an ear unto the song of David.  He saith:  `Who will 
bring me into the Strong City?'  The Strong City is 
&amp;Akka, which hath been named the Most Great Prison, and 
which possesseth a fortress and mighty ramparts...  Peruse 
that which Isaiah hath spoken in His Book.  He saith:  `Get 
thee up into the high mountain, O Zion, that bringest good 
tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, O Jerusalem, that 
bringest good tidings.  Lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the 
cities of Judah:  "Behold your God!  Behold the Lord God 
will come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for 
Him."'  This Day all the signs have appeared.  A great City 
hath descended from heaven, and Zion trembleth and exulteth 

+P91 
with joy at the Revelation of God, for it hath heard 
the Voice of God on every side. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of Christians!  We have, on a previous 
occasion, revealed Ourself unto you, and ye recognized 
Me not.  This is yet another occasion vouchsafed unto you. 
This is the Day of God; turn ye unto Him...  The Beloved 
One loveth not that ye be consumed with the fire of your 
desires.  Were ye to be shut out as by a veil from Him, this 
would be for no other reason than your own waywardness 
and ignorance.  Ye make mention of Me, and know 
Me not.  Ye call upon Me, and are heedless of My Revelation.... 
O people of the Gospel!  They who were not in the 
Kingdom have now entered it, whilst We behold you, in 
this day, tarrying at the gate.  Rend the veils asunder by the 
power of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bounteous, 
and enter, then, in My name My Kingdom.  Thus biddeth 
you He Who desireth for you everlasting life...  We behold 
you, O children of the Kingdom, in darkness.  This, verily, 
beseemeth you not.  Are ye, in the face of the Light, fearful 
because of your deeds?  Direct yourselves towards Him... 
Verily, He (Jesus) said:  `Come ye after Me, and I will make 
you to become fishers of men.'  In this day, however, We 
say:  `Come ye after Me, that We may make you to become 
quickeners of mankind.' 
 
+P92 
     WE, verily, have come for your sakes, and have borne 
the misfortunes of the world for your salvation.  Flee ye the 
One Who hath sacrificed His life that ye may be quickened? 
Fear God, O followers of the Spirit (Jesus), and walk not 
in the footsteps of every divine that hath gone far astray... 
Open the doors of your hearts.  He Who is the Spirit (Jesus) 
verily, standeth before them.  Wherefore keep ye afar from 
Him Who hath purposed to draw you nigh unto a Resplendent 
Spot?  Say:  We, in truth, have opened unto you 
the gates of the Kingdom.  Will ye bar the doors of your 
houses in My face?  This indeed is naught but a grievous 
error. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of patriarchs!  He Whom ye were promised 
in the Tablets is come.  Fear God, and follow not the 
vain imaginings of the superstitious.  Lay aside the things ye 
possess, and take fast hold of the Tablet of God by His 
sovereign power.  Better is this for you than all your possessions. 
Unto this testifieth every understanding heart, 
and every man of insight.  Pride ye yourselves on My Name 
and yet shut yourselves out as by a veil from Me?  This indeed 
is a strange thing! 
 
+P93 
     O CONCOURSE of archbishops!  He Who is the Lord of 
all men hath appeared.  In the plain of guidance He calleth 
mankind, whilst ye are numbered with the dead!  Great is 
the blessedness of him who is stirred by the Breeze of God, 
and hath arisen from amongst the dead in this perspicuous 
Name. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of bishops!  Trembling hath seized all the 
kindreds of the earth, and He Who is the Everlasting 
Father calleth aloud between earth and heaven.  Blessed the 
ear that hath heard, and the eye that hath seen, and the heart 
that hath turned unto Him Who is the Point of Adoration 
of all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth.... 
 

     O CONCOURSE of bishops!  Ye are the stars of the heaven 
of My knowledge.  My mercy desireth not that ye should 
fall upon the earth.  My justice, however, declareth:  `This is 
that which the Son (Jesus) hath decreed.'  And whatsoever 
hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking, 
trustworthy mouth, can never be altered.  The bells, verily, 
peal out My Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit 
rejoiceth with evident gladness.  The body of the Loved 

+P94 
One yearneth for the cross, and His head is eager for the 
spear, in the path of the All-Merciful.  The ascendancy of 
the oppressor can in no wise deter Him from His purpose... 
The stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, they that 
adduce the proofs they possess in order to demonstrate the 
truth of My Cause, and who make mention of God in My 
name.  When I came unto them, in My majesty, however, 
they turned aside from Me.  They, verily, are of the fallen. 
This is what the Spirit (Jesus) prophesied when He came 
with the truth, and the Jewish doctors cavilled at Him, 
until they committed what made the Holy Spirit to lament, 
and the eyes of such as enjoy near access to God to weep. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of priests!  Leave the bells, and come 
forth, then, from your churches.  It behoveth you, in this 
day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great Name among the 
nations.  Prefer ye to be silent, whilst every stone and every 
tree shouteth aloud:  `The Lord is come in His great glory!' 
...He that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, 
and he will show forth that which is beyond the power of 
all that are on earth...  Let the Breeze of God awaken you. 
Verily, it hath wafted over the world.  Well is it with him 
that hath discovered the fragrance thereof and been 
accounted among the well-assured.... 
 
+P95 
     O CONCOURSE of priests!  The Day of Reckoning hath 
appeared, the Day whereon He Who was in heaven hath 
come.  He, verily, is the One Whom ye were promised in 
the Books of God, the Holy, the Almighty, the All-Praised. 
How long will ye wander in the wilderness of 
heedlessness and superstition?  Turn with your hearts in the 
direction of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of monks!  Seclude not yourselves in 
churches and cloisters.  Come forth by My leave, and 
occupy yourselves with that which will profit your souls 
and the souls of men.  Thus biddeth you the King of the 
Day of Reckoning.  Seclude yourselves in the stronghold of 
My love.  This, verily, is a befitting seclusion, were ye of 
them that perceive it.  He that shutteth himself up in a 
house is indeed as one dead.  It behoveth man to show 
forth that which will profit all created things, and he that 
bringeth forth no fruit is fit for fire.  Thus counselleth you 
your Lord, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. 
Enter ye into wedlock, that after you someone 
may fill your place.  We have forbidden you perfidious 
acts, and not that which will demonstrate fidelity.  Have ye 
clung to the standards fixed by your own selves, and cast 
the standards of God behind your backs?  Fear God, and be 

+P96 
not of the foolish.  But for man, who would make mention 
of Me on My earth, and how could My attributes and My 
name have been revealed?  Ponder ye, and be not of them 
that are veiled and fast asleep.  He that wedded not (Jesus) 
found no place wherein to dwell or lay His head, by reason 
of that which the hands of the treacherous had wrought. 
His sanctity consisteth not in that which ye believe or 
fancy, but rather in the things We possess.  Ask, that ye may 
apprehend His station which hath been exalted above the 
imaginings of all that dwell on earth.  Blessed are they who 
perceive it. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of monks!  If ye choose to follow Me, I 
will make you heirs of My Kingdom; and if ye transgress 
against Me, I will, in My long-suffering, endure it patiently, 
and I, verily, am the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful... 
Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. 
We hear her voice saying:  `O most generous Lord!  Where 
is Thy great glory established?  The sweet savours of Thy 
presence have quickened me, after I had melted in my 
separation from Thee.  Praised be Thou in that Thou hast 
raised the veils, and come with power in evident glory.' 
We called unto her from behind the Tabernacle of Majesty 
and Grandeur:  `O Bethlehem!  This Light hath risen in the 
orient, and travelled towards the occident, until it reached 

+P97 
thee in the evening of its life.  Tell Me then:  Do the sons 
recognize the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do they 
deny Him, even as the people aforetime denied Him 
(Jesus)?'  Whereupon she cried out saying:  `Thou art, in 
truth, the All-Knowing, the Best-Informed.' 
 

     CONSIDER, likewise, how numerous at this time are the 
monks who have secluded themselves in their churches, in 
My name, and who, when the appointed time came, and 
We unveiled to them Our beauty, failed to recognize Me, 
notwithstanding that they call upon Me at dawn and at 
eventide. 
 

     READ ye the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the 
All-Glorious Lord?  This indeed beseemeth you not, O 
concourse of learned men!...  The fragrances of the All-Merciful 
have wafted over all creation.  Happy the man 
that hath forsaken his desires, and taken fast hold of guidance. 
 
+P98 
     PERUSED ye not the &amp;Qur'an?  Read it, that haply ye may 
find the Truth, for this Book is verily the Straight Path. 
This is the Way of God unto all who are in the heavens and 
all who are on the earth.  If ye have been careless of the 
&amp;Qur'an, the &amp;Bayan cannot be regarded to be remote from 
you.  Behold it open before your eyes.  Read ye its verses, 
lest perchance ye desist from committing that which will 
cause the Messengers of God to mourn and lament. 
     Speed out of your sepulchres.  How long will ye sleep? 
The second blast hath been blown on the trumpet.  On 
whom are ye gazing?  This is your Lord, the God of Mercy. 
Witness how ye gainsay His signs!  The earth hath quaked 
with a great quaking, and cast forth her burdens.  Will ye 
not admit it?  Say:  Will ye not recognize how the mountains 
have become like flocks of wool, how the people are 
sore vexed at the awful majesty of the Cause of God?  Witness 
how their houses are empty ruins, and they themselves 
a drowned host. 
     This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath come 
down in the clouds of knowledge, clothed with manifest 
sovereignty.  He well knoweth the actions of men.  He it is 
Whose glory none can mistake, could ye but comprehend 
it.  The heaven of every religion hath been rent, and the 
earth of human understanding been cleft asunder, and the 
angels of God are seen descending.  Say:  This is the Day of 
mutual deceit; whither do ye flee?  The mountains have 
passed away, and the heavens have been folded together, 

+P99 
and the whole earth is held within His grasp, could ye but 
understand it.  Who is it that can protect you?  None, by 
Him Who is the All-Merciful!  None, except God, the Almighty, 
the All-Glorious, the Beneficent.  Every woman 
that hath had a burden in her womb hath cast her burden. 
We see men drunken in this Day, the Day in which men 
and angels have been gathered together. 
     Is there any doubt concerning God?  Behold how He 
hath come down from the heaven of His grace, girded with 
power and invested with sovereignty.  Is there any doubt 
concerning His signs?  Open ye your eyes, and consider His 
clear evidence.  Paradise is on your right hand, and hath 
been brought nigh unto you, while Hell hath been made to 
blaze.  Witness its devouring flame.  Haste ye to enter into 
Paradise, as a token of Our mercy unto you, and drink 
ye from the hands of the All-Merciful the Wine that is 
life indeed. 
 

     BY Him Who is the Great Announcement!  The All-Merciful 
is come invested with undoubted sovereignty. 
The Balance hath been appointed, and all them that dwell 
on earth have been gathered together.  The Trumpet hath 
been blown, and lo, all eyes have stared up with terror, and 
the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on the earth 

+P100 
have trembled, except them whom the breath of the verses 
of God hath quickened, and who have detached themselves 
from all things. 
     This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. 
The workers of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but 
perceive it.  The moon of idle fancy hath been cleft, and the 
heaven hath given out a palpable smoke.  We see the people 
laid low, awed with the dread of thy Lord, the Almighty, 
the Most Powerful.  The Crier hath cried out, and men 
have been torn away, so great hath been the fury of His 
wrath.  The people of the left hand sigh and bemoan.  The 
people of the right abide in noble habitations:  they quaff 
the Wine that is life indeed, from the hands of the All-Merciful, 
and are, verily, the blissful. 
     The earth hath been shaken, and the mountains have 
passed away, and the angels have appeared, rank on rank, 
before Us.  Most of the people are bewildered in their 
drunkenness and wear on their faces the evidences of anger. 
Thus have We gathered together the workers of iniquity. 
We see them rushing on towards their idol.  Say:  None shall 
be secure this Day from the decree of God.  This indeed is a 
grievous Day.  We point out to them those that led them 
astray.  They see them, and yet recognize them not.  Their 
eyes are drunken; they are indeed a blind people.  Their 
proofs are the calumnies they uttered; condemned are their 
calumnies by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. 
The Evil One hath stirred up mischief in their hearts, and 
they are afflicted with a torment that none can avert.  They 

+P101 
hasten to the wicked, bearing the register of the workers 
of iniquity.  Such are their doings. 
     Say:  The heavens have been folded together, and the 
earth is held within His grasp, and the corrupt doers have 
been held by their forelock, and still they understand not. 
They drink of the tainted water, and know it not.  Say:  The 
shout hath been raised, and the people have come forth 
from their graves, and arising are gazing around them. 
Some have made haste to attain the court of the God of 
Mercy, others have fallen down on their faces in the fire of 
Hell, while still others are lost in bewilderment.  The verses 
of God have been revealed, and yet they have turned away 
from them.  His proof hath been manifested and yet they 
are unaware of it.  And when they behold the face of the 
All-Merciful, their own faces are saddened, while they are 
disporting themselves.  They hasten forward to Hell Fire, 
and mistake it for light.  Far from God be what they fondly 
imagine!  Say:  Whether ye rejoice or whether ye burst for 
fury, the heavens are cleft asunder, and God hath come 
down, invested with radiant sovereignty.  All created 
things are heard exclaiming:  `The Kingdom is God's, the 
Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.' 
 

     O CONCOURSE of Persian divines!  In My name ye have 
seized the reins of men, and occupy the seats of honour by 

+P102 
reason of your relation to Me.  When I revealed Myself, 
however, ye turned aside, and committed what hath 
caused the tears of such as have recognized Me to flow. 
Erelong will all that ye possess perish, and your glory be 
turned into the most wretched abasement, and ye shall 
behold the punishment for what ye have wrought, as decreed 
by God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. 
 

     O YE divines of the City!  We came to you with the 
truth, whilst ye were heedless of it.  Methinks ye are as dead, 
wrapt in the coverings of your own selves.  Ye sought not 
Our presence, when so to do would have been better for 
you than all your doings....  Know ye, that had your 
leaders, to whom ye owe allegiance, and on whom ye 
pride yourselves, and whom ye mention by day and by 
night, and from whose traces ye seek guidance--had they 
lived in these days, they would have circled around Me, 
and would not have separated themselves from Me, 
whether at eventide or at morn.  Ye, however, did not turn 
your faces towards My face, for even less than a moment, 
and waxed proud, and were careless of this Wronged One, 
Who hath been so afflicted by men that they dealt with 
Him as they pleased.  Ye failed to inquire about My condition, 
nor did ye inform yourselves of the things which 
befell Me.  Thereby have ye withheld from yourselves the 

+P103 
winds of holiness, and the breezes of bounty, that blow 
from this luminous and perspicuous Spot.  Methinks ye 
have clung to outward things, and forgotten the inner 
things, and say that which ye do not.  Ye are lovers of 
names, and appear to have given yourselves up to them. 
For this reason make ye mention of the names of your 
leaders.  And should any one like them, or superior unto 
them, come unto you, ye would flee him.  Through their 
names ye have exalted yourselves, and have secured your 
positions, and live and prosper.  And were your leaders to 
reappear, ye would not renounce your leadership, nor 
would ye turn in their direction, nor set your faces towards 
them.  We found you, as We found most men, worshipping 
names which they mention during the days of their life, 
and with which they occupy themselves.  No sooner do the 
Bearers of these names appear, however, than they repudiate 
them, and turn upon their heels....  Know ye that 
God will not, in this day, accept your thoughts, nor your 
remembrance of Him, nor your turning towards Him, nor 
your devotions, nor your vigilance, unless ye be made new 
in the estimation of this Servant, could ye but perceive it. 
 

     BECAUSE of you the Apostle (&amp;Muhammad) lamented, 
and the Chaste One (&amp;Fatimih) cried out, and the countries 
were laid waste, and darkness fell upon all regions.  O concourse 

+P104 
of divines!  Because of you the people were abased, 
and the banner of &amp;Islam was hauled down, and its mighty 
throne subverted.  Every time a man of discernment hath 
sought to hold fast unto that which would exalt &amp;Islam, you 
raised a clamour, and thereby was He deterred from 
achieving His purpose, while the land remained fallen in 
clear ruin. 
 

     OF all the peoples of the world, they that have suffered 
the greatest loss have been, and are still, the people of Persia. 
I swear by the Day Star of Utterance which shineth upon 
the world in its meridian glory!  The lamentations of the 
pulpits, in that country, are being raised continually.  In the 
early days such lamentations were heard in the Land of &amp;Ta 
(&amp;Tihran), for pulpits, erected for the purpose of remembering 
the True One--exalted be His glory--have now, in 
Persia, become places wherefrom blasphemies are uttered 
against Him Who is the Desire of the worlds. 
 

     IN this day the world is redolent with the fragrances of the 
robe of the Revelation of the Ancient King ... and yet, 
they (divines) have gathered together, and established 

+P105 
themselves upon their seats, and have spoken that which 
would put an animal to shame, how much more man himself! 
Were they to become aware of one of their acts, and 
perceive the mischief it hath wrought, they would, with 
their own hands, dispatch themselves to their final abode. 
 

     O CONCOURSE of divines!...  Lay aside that which ye 
possess, and hold your peace, and give ear, then, unto that 
which the Tongue of Grandeur and Majesty speaketh. 
How many the veiled handmaidens who turned unto Me, 
and believed, and how numerous the wearers of the turban 
who were debarred from Me, and followed in the footsteps 
of bygone generations! 
 

     O HIGH priests!  Ears have been given you that they may 
hearken unto the mystery of Him Who is the Self-Dependent, 
and eyes that they may behold Him.  Wherefore flee 
ye?  The Incomparable Friend is manifest.  He speaketh that 
wherein lieth salvation.  Were ye, O high priests, to discover 
the perfume of the rose-garden of understanding, ye 
would seek none other but Him, and would recognize, in 
His new vesture, the All-Wise and Peerless One, and would 

+P106 
turn your eyes from the world and all who seek it, and 
would arise to help Him. 
 

     WHATSOEVER hath been announced in the Books hath 
been revealed and made clear.  From every direction the 
signs have been manifested.  The Omnipotent One is calling, 
in this Day, and announcing the appearance of the 
Supreme Heaven. 
 

     THIS is not the day whereon the high priests can command 
and exercise their authority.  In your Book it is stated 
that the high priests will, on that Day, lead men far astray, 
and will prevent them from drawing nigh unto Him.  He 
indeed is a high priest who hath seen the light and hastened 
unto the way leading to the Beloved. 
 

     O HIGH priests!  The Hand of Omnipotence is stretched 
forth from behind the clouds; behold ye it with new eyes. 
The tokens of His majesty and greatness are unveiled; gaze 
ye on them with pure eyes....  Say, O high priests!  Ye are 

+P107 
held in reverence because of My Name, and yet ye flee Me! 
Ye are the high priests of the Temple.  Had ye been the high 
priests of the Omnipotent One, ye would have been united 
with Him, and would have recognized Him....  Say, O 
high priests!  No man's acts shall be acceptable, in this Day, 
unless he forsaketh mankind and all that men possess, and 
setteth his face towards the Omnipotent One. 

+P108 

+P109 
              THE GREAT ANNOUNCEMENT 
                    TO MANKIND 

+P110 

+P111 
     THE time fore-ordained unto the peoples and 
kindreds of the earth is now come.  The promises 
of God, as recorded in the holy Scriptures, 
have all been fulfilled.  Out of Zion hath 
gone forth the Law of God, and Jerusalem, and the hills and 
land thereof, are filled with the glory of His Revelation. 
Happy is the man that pondereth in his heart that which 
hath been revealed in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, 
the Self-Subsisting.  Meditate upon this, O ye beloved of 
God, and let your ears be attentive unto His Word, so that 
ye may, by His grace and mercy, drink your fill from the 
crystal waters of constancy, and become as steadfast and 
immovable as the mountain in His Cause. 
 

     VERILY I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold 
the Face, and hear the Voice, of the Promised One. 
The Call of God hath been raised, and the light of His countenance 
hath been lifted up upon men.  It behoveth every 
man to blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet 
of his heart, and to gaze, with an open and unbiased 
mind, on the signs of His Revelation, the proofs of His 
Mission, and the tokens of His glory. 
     Great indeed is this Day!  The allusions made to it in all 

+P112 
the sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. 
The soul of every Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, 
hath thirsted for this wondrous Day.  All the divers 
kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to attain it. 
No sooner, however, had the Day Star of His Revelation 
manifested itself in the heaven of God's Will, than all, except 
those whom the Almighty was pleased to guide, were 
found dumbfounded and heedless. 
     O thou that hast remembered Me!  The most grievous 
veil hath shut out the peoples of the earth from His glory, 
and hindered them from hearkening to His call.  God grant 
that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth, and 
that the seal, `the Kingdom is God's', may be stamped 
upon the brow of all its peoples. 
 

     O YE children of men!  The fundamental purpose animating 
the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard 
the interests and promote the unity of the human race, and 
to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. 
Suffer it not to become a source of dissension and discord, 
of hate and enmity.  This is the straight Path, the fixed and 
immovable foundation.  Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, 
the changes and chances of the world can never impair 
its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries 
undermine its structure.  Our hope is that the world's 

+P113 
religious leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise 
for the reformation of this age and the rehabilitation of its 
fortunes.  Let them, after meditating on its needs, take 
counsel together and, through anxious and full deliberation, 
administer to a diseased and sorely-afflicted world the 
remedy it requires....  It is incumbent upon them who are 
in authority to exercise moderation in all things.  Whatsoever 
passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease to 
exert a beneficial influence.  Consider for instance such 
things as liberty, civilization and the like.  However much 
men of understanding may favourably regard them, they 
will, if carried to excess, exercise a pernicious influence 
upon men....  Please God, the peoples of the world may be 
led, as the result of the high endeavours exerted by their 
rulers and the wise and learned amongst men, to recognize 
their best interests.  How long will humanity persist in its 
waywardness?  How long will injustice continue?  How 
long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men?  How 
long will discord agitate the face of society?  The winds of 
despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the 
strife that divideth and afflicteth the human race is daily increasing. 
The signs of impending convulsions and chaos 
can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order 
appeareth to be lamentably defective.  I beseech God, exalted 
be His glory, that He may graciously awaken the 
peoples of the earth, may grant that the end of their conduct 
may be profitable unto them, and aid them to accomplish 
that which beseemeth their station. 
 
+P114 
     O CONTENDING peoples and kindreds of the earth!  Set 
your faces towards unity, and let the radiance of its light 
shine upon you.  Gather ye together, and for the sake of 
God resolve to root out whatever is the source of contention 
amongst you.  Then will the effulgence of the world's 
great Luminary envelop the whole earth, and its inhabitants 
become the citizens of one city, and the occupants of 
one and the same throne.  This wronged One hath, ever 
since the early days of His life, cherished none other desire 
but this, and will continue to entertain no wish except this 
wish.  There can be no doubt whatever that the peoples of 
the world, of whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration 
from one heavenly Source, and are the subjects of 
one God.  The difference between the ordinances under 
which they abide should be attributed to the varying requirements 
and exigencies of the age in which they were 
revealed.  All of them, except a few which are the outcome 
of human perversity, were ordained of God, and are a reflection 
of His Will and Purpose.  Arise and, armed with the 
power of faith, shatter to pieces the gods of your vain 
imaginings, the sowers of dissension amongst you.  Cleave 
unto that which draweth you together and uniteth you. 
This, verily, is the most exalted Word which the Mother 
Book hath sent down and revealed unto you.  To this beareth 
witness the Tongue of Grandeur from His habitation of 
glory. 
 
+P115 
     THE Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of 
the peace and tranquillity of the world and the advancement 
of its peoples, hath written:  The time must come 
when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an 
all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally realized. 
The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, 
and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such 
ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world's 
Great Peace amongst men.  Such a peace demandeth that 
the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the tranquillity 
of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled 
among themselves.  Should any king take up arms against 
another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him.  If this 
be done, the nations of the world will no longer require 
any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the 
security of their realms and of maintaining internal order 
within their territories.  This will ensure the peace and composure 
of every people, government and nation.  We fain 
would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth, the mirrors 
of the gracious and almighty name of God, may 
attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught 
of tyranny....  The day is approaching when all the 
peoples of the world will have adopted one universal language 
and one common script.  When this is achieved, to 
whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were 
entering his own home.  These things are obligatory and 
absolutely essential.  It is incumbent upon every man of insight 

+P116 
and understanding to strive to translate that which 
hath been written into reality and action....  That one indeed 
is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service 
of the entire human race.  The Great Being saith:  Blessed 
and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of 
the peoples and kindreds of the earth.  In another passage 
He hath proclaimed:  It is not for him to pride himself who 
loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the 
whole world.  The earth is but one country, and mankind 
its citizens. 
 

     THE All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the 
pulse of mankind.  He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, 
in His unerring wisdom, the remedy.  Every age hath 
its own problem, and every soul its particular aspiration. 
The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions 
can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may 
require.  Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age 
ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies 
and requirements. 
     We can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed 
with great, with incalculable afflictions.  We see 
it languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried and disillusioned. 
They that are intoxicated by self-conceit have 
interposed themselves between it and the Divine and infallible 

+P117 
Physician.  Witness how they have entangled all 
men, themselves included, in the mesh of their devices. 
They can neither discover the cause of the disease, nor have 
they any knowledge of the remedy.  They have conceived 
the straight to be crooked, and have imagined their friend 
an enemy. 
     Incline your ears to the sweet melody of this Prisoner. 
Arise, and lift up your voices, that haply they that are fast 
asleep may be awakened.  Say:  O ye who are as dead!  The 
Hand of Divine bounty proffereth unto you the Water of 
Life.  Hasten and drink your fill.  Whoso hath been re-born 
in this Day, shall never die; whoso remaineth dead, shall 
never live. 
 

     O PEOPLES of the earth!  God, the Eternal Truth, is My 
witness that streams of fresh and soft-flowing waters have 
gushed from the rocks, through the sweetness of the words 
uttered by your Lord, the Unconstrained; and still ye 
slumber.  Cast away that which ye possess, and, on the 
wings of detachment, soar beyond all created things.  Thus 
biddeth you the Lord of creation, the movement of Whose 
Pen hath revolutionized the soul of mankind. 
     Know ye from what heights your Lord, the All-Glorious 
is calling?  Think ye that ye have recognized the Pen wherewith 
your Lord, the Lord of all names, commandeth you? 

+P118 
Nay, by My life!  Did ye but know it, ye would renounce 
the world, and would hasten with your whole hearts to the 
presence of the Well-Beloved.  Your spirits would be so 
transported by His Word as to throw into commotion the 
Greater World--how much more this small and petty one! 
Thus have the showers of My bounty been poured down 
from the heaven of My loving-kindness, as a token of My 
grace; that ye may be of the thankful.... 
     Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination 
provoke divisions among you.  Be ye as the fingers 
of one hand, the members of one body.  Thus counselleth 
you the Pen of Revelation, if ye be of them that believe. 
     Consider the mercy of God and His gifts.  He enjoineth 
upon you that which shall profit you, though He Himself 
can well dispense with all creatures.  Your evil doings can 
never harm Us, neither can your good works profit Us. 
We summon you wholly for the sake of God.  To this every 
man of understanding and insight will testify. 
 

     THE world's equilibrium hath been upset through the 
vibrating influence of this most great, this new World 
Order.  Mankind's ordered life hath been revolutionized 
through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System 
--the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed. 
     Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye 

+P119 
may unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom 
that lie hid in its depths.  Take heed that ye do not 
vacillate in your determination to embrace the truth of this 
Cause--a Cause through which the potentialities of the 
might of God have been revealed, and His sovereignty 
established.  With faces beaming with joy, hasten ye unto 
Him.  This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, 
eternal in the future.  Let him that seeketh, attain it; and as 
to him that hath refused to seek it--verily, God is Self-Sufficient, 
above any need of His creatures. 
     Say:  This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of 
God is holding, in which all who are in the heavens and all 
who are on the earth are weighed, and their fate determined, 
if ye be of them that believe and recognize this 
truth.  Say:  Through it the poor have been enriched, the 
learned enlightened, and the seekers enabled to ascend unto 
the presence of God.  Beware, lest ye make it a cause of dissension 
amongst you.  Be ye as firmly settled as the immovable 
mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, 
the Loving. 
 

     O YE peoples of the world!  Know assuredly that My 
commandments are the lamps of My loving providence 
among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My 
creatures.  Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of 

+P120 
the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation.  Were any 
man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of 
the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though 
the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce 
them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even 
one of His commandments, shining above the Dayspring 
of His bountiful care and loving-kindness. 
     From My laws the sweet smelling savour of My garment 
can be smelled, and by their aid the standards of victory will 
be planted upon the highest peaks.  The Tongue of My 
power hath, from the heaven of My omnipotent glory, 
addressed to My creation these words:  `Observe My commandments, 
for the love of My beauty.'  Happy is the lover 
that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved 
from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which 
no tongue can describe.  By My life!  He who hath drunk 
the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful 
favour, will circle around My commandments that shine 
above the Dayspring of My creation. 
     Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code 
of laws.  Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine 
with the fingers of might and power.  To this beareth witness 
that which the Pen of Revelation hath revealed. 
Meditate upon this, O men of insight!... 
     Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of 
Mine utterance, they must be faithfully obeyed by all, 
though My decree be such as to cause the heaven of every 
religion to be cleft asunder.  He doth what He pleaseth.  He 

+P121 
chooseth; and none may question His choice.  Whatsoever 
He, the Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved. 
To this He Who is the Lord of all creation beareth 
Me witness.  Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the 
All-Merciful, and recognized the Source of this utterance, 
will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, 
that he may establish the truth of the laws of God amongst 
men.  Well is it with him that hath turned thereunto, and 
apprehended the meaning of His decisive decree. 
 

     THIS is the Day in which God's most excellent favours 
have been poured out upon men, the Day in which His 
most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things. 
It is incumbent upon all the peoples of the world to reconcile 
their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace, 
abide beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and 
loving-kindness.  It behoveth them to cleave to whatsoever 
will, in this Day, be conducive to the exaltation of 
their stations, and to the promotion of their best interests. 
Happy are those whom the all-glorious Pen was moved to 
remember, and blessed are those men whose names, by 
virtue of Our inscrutable decree, We have preferred to 
conceal. 
     Beseech ye the one true God to grant that all men may 
be graciously assisted to fulfil that which is acceptable in 

+P122 
Our sight.  Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, 
and a new one spread out in its stead.  Verily, thy Lord 
speaketh the truth, and is the Knower of things unseen.
