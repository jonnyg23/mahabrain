                    THE HIDDEN WORDS 


               Part I.--From the Arabic 


               HE IS THE GLORY OF GLORIES 

     This is that which hath descended from the realm of glory, 
uttered by the tongue of power and might, and revealed 
unto the Prophets of old.  We have taken the inner essence 
thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token of 
grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the 
Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in 
the realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue. 


1.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

My first counsel is this:  Possess a pure, kindly and 
radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient, 
imperishable and everlasting. 


2.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; 
turn not away therefrom if thou desirest 



+P4 

Me, and neglect it not that I may confide in thee. 
By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and 
not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of 
thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge 
of thy neighbor.  Ponder this in thy heart; 
how it behooveth thee to be.  Verily justice is My 
gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness.  Set 
it then before thine eyes. 


3.  O SON OF MAN! 

Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient 
eternity of My essence, I knew My love for thee; 
therefore I created thee, have engraved on thee 
Mine image and revealed to thee My beauty. 


4.  O SON OF MAN! 

I loved thy creation, hence I created thee.  Wherefore, 
do thou love Me, that I may name thy name 
and fill thy soul with the spirit of life. 


5.  O SON OF BEING! 

Love Me, that I may love thee.  If thou lovest Me 
not, My love can in no wise reach thee.  Know this, 
O servant. 



+P5 

6.  O SON OF BEING! 

Thy Paradise is My love; thy heavenly home, reunion 
with Me.  Enter therein and tarry not.  This 
is that which hath been destined for thee in Our 
kingdom above and Our exalted dominion. 


7.  O SON OF MAN! 

If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if 
thou seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; 
that thou mayest die in Me and I may eternally live 
in thee. 


8.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

There is no peace for thee save by renouncing 
thyself and turning unto Me; for it behooveth thee 
to glory in My name, not in thine own; to put thy 
trust in Me and not in thyself, since I desire to be 
loved alone and above all that is. 


9.  O SON OF BEING! 

My love is My stronghold; he that entereth therein 
is safe and secure, and he that turneth away shall 
surely stray and perish. 



+P6 

10.  O SON OF UTTERANCE! 
Thou art My stronghold; enter therein that 
thou mayest abide in safety.  My love is in thee, 
know it, that thou mayest find Me near unto 
thee. 


11.  O SON OF BEING! 

Thou art My lamp and My light is in thee. 
Get thou from it thy radiance and seek none 
other than Me.  For I have created thee rich 
and have bountifully shed My favor upon 
thee. 


12.  O SON OF BEING! 

With the hands of power I made thee and with 
the fingers of strength I created thee; and within 
thee have I placed the essence of My light. 
Be thou content with it and seek naught else, 
for My work is perfect and My command is 
binding.  Question it not, nor have a doubt 
thereof. 


13.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself 
down to poverty?  Noble I made thee, wherewith 



+P7 

dost thou abase thyself?  Out of the essence 
of knowledge I gave thee being, why seekest 
thou enlightenment from anyone beside Me? 
Out of the clay of love I molded thee, how dost 
thou busy thyself with another?  Turn thy sight 
unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me standing 
within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting. 


14.  O SON OF MAN! 

Thou art My dominion and My dominion perisheth 
not; wherefore fearest thou thy perishing? 
Thou art My light and My light shall 
never be extinguished; why dost thou dread 
extinction?  Thou art My glory and My glory 
fadeth not; thou art My robe and My robe 
shall never be outworn.  Abide then in thy love 
for Me, that thou mayest find Me in the realm 
of glory. 


15.  O SON OF UTTERANCE! 

Turn thy face unto Mine and renounce all save 
Me; for My sovereignty endureth and My dominion 
perisheth not.  If thou seekest another than 
Me, yea, if thou searchest the universe for evermore, 
thy quest will be in vain. 



+P8 

16.  O SON OF LIGHT! 

Forget all save Me and commune with My spirit. 
This is of the essence of My command, therefore 
turn unto it. 


17.  O SON OF MAN! 

Be thou content with Me and seek no other 
helper.  For none but Me can ever suffice thee. 


18.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

Ask not of Me that which We desire not for thee, 
then be content with what We have ordained for 
thy sake, for this is that which profiteth thee, if 
therewith thou dost content thyself. 


19.  O SON OF THE WONDROUS VISION! 

I have breathed within thee a breath of My own 
Spirit, that thou mayest be My lover.  Why hast 
thou forsaken Me and sought a beloved other 
than Me? 


20.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

My claim on thee is great, it cannot be forgotten. 
My grace to thee is plenteous, it cannot be 
veiled.  My love has made in thee its home, 



+P9 

it cannot be concealed.  My light is manifest to 
thee, it cannot be obscured. 


21.  O SON OF MAN! 

Upon the tree of effulgent glory I have hung for 
thee the choicest fruits, wherefore hast thou 
turned away and contented thyself with that which 
is less good?  Return then unto that which is better 
for thee in the realm on high. 


22.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased 
thyself.  Rise then unto that for which thou wast 
created. 


23.  O SON OF THE SUPREME! 

To the eternal I call thee, yet thou dost seek that 
which perisheth.  What hath made thee turn away 
from Our desire and seek thine own? 


24.  O SON OF MAN! 

Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which 
beseemeth thee not.  Prostrate thyself before the 
countenance of thy God, the Lord of might and 
power. 



+P10 

25.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

Vaunt not thyself over the poor, for I lead him on 
his way and behold thee in thy evil plight and 
confound thee for evermore. 


26.  O SON OF BEING! 

How couldst thou forget thine own faults and 
busy thyself with the faults of others?  Whoso 
doeth this is accursed of Me. 


27.  O SON OF MAN! 

Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art 
thyself a sinner.  Shouldst thou transgress this 
command, accursed wouldst thou be, and to this 
I bear witness. 


28.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

Know thou of a truth:  He that biddeth men be just 
and himself committeth iniquity is not of Me, even 
though he bear My name. 


29.  O SON OF BEING! 

Ascribe not to any soul that which thou wouldst 
not have ascribed to thee, and say not that which 
thou doest not.  This is My command unto thee, 
do thou observe it. 



+P11 

30.  O SON OF MAN! 

Deny not My servant should he ask anything from 
thee, for his face is My face; be then abashed 
before Me. 


31.  O SON OF BEING! 

Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art 
summoned to a reckoning; for death, unheralded, 
shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called to 
give account for thy deeds. 


32.  O SON OF THE SUPREME! 

I have made death a messenger of joy to thee. 
Wherefore dost thou grieve?  I made the light to 
shed on thee its splendor.  Why dost thou veil 
thyself therefrom? 


33.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

With the joyful tidings of light I hail thee:  rejoice! 
To the court of holiness I summon thee; abide 
therein that thou mayest live in peace for evermore. 


34.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

The spirit of holiness beareth unto thee the joyful 
tidings of reunion; wherefore dost thou 



+P12 

grieve?  The spirit of power confirmeth thee 
in His cause; why dost thou veil thyself?  The light 
of His countenance doth lead thee; how canst 
thou go astray? 


35.  O SON OF MAN! 

Sorrow not save that thou art far from Us.  Rejoice 
not save that thou art drawing near and returning 
unto Us. 


36.  O SON OF MAN! 

Rejoice in the gladness of thine heart, that thou 
mayest be worthy to meet Me and to mirror forth 
My beauty. 


37.  O SON OF MAN! 

Divest not thyself of My beauteous robe, and forfeit 
not thy portion from My wondrous fountain, 
lest thou shouldst thirst for evermore. 


38.  O SON OF BEING! 

Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny thyself 
that which thou desirest if thou seekest My 
pleasure. 



+P13 

39.  O SON OF MAN! 

Neglect not My commandments if thou lovest My 
beauty, and forget not My counsels if thou 
wouldst attain My good pleasure. 


40.  O SON OF MAN! 

Wert thou to speed through the immensity of 
space and traverse the expanse of heaven, yet 
thou wouldst find no rest save in submission to 
Our command and humbleness before Our Face. 


41.  O SON OF MAN! 

Magnify My cause that I may reveal unto thee the 
mysteries of My greatness and shine upon thee 
with the light of eternity. 


42.  O SON OF MAN! 

Humble thyself before Me, that I may graciously 
visit thee.  Arise for the triumph of My 
cause, that while yet on earth thou mayest obtain 
the victory. 


43.  O SON OF BEING! 

Make mention of Me on My earth, that in My 
heaven I may remember thee, thus shall Mine eyes 
and thine be solaced. 



+P14 

44.  O SON OF THE THRONE! 

Thy hearing is My hearing, hear thou therewith. 
Thy sight is My sight, do thou see therewith, 
that in thine inmost soul thou mayest 
testify unto My exalted sanctity, and I within 
Myself may bear witness unto an exalted station 
for thee. 


45.  O SON OF BEING! 

Seek a martyr's death in My path, content with 
My pleasure and thankful for that which I ordain, 
that thou mayest repose with Me beneath 
the canopy of majesty behind the tabernacle 
of glory. 


46.  O SON OF MAN! 

Ponder and reflect.  Is it thy wish to die upon thy 
bed, or to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a 
martyr in My path, and so become the manifestation 
of My command and the revealer of My light 
in the highest paradise?  Judge thou aright, O servant! 


47.  O SON OF MAN! 

By My beauty!  To tinge thy hair with thy blood 
is greater in My sight than the creation of the 



+P15 

universe and the light of both worlds.  Strive then 
to attain this, O servant! 


48.  O SON OF MAN! 

For everything there is a sign.  The sign of love 
is fortitude under My decree and patience under 
My trials. 


49.  O SON OF MAN! 

The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as 
doth the rebel for forgiveness and the sinful 
for mercy. 


50.  O SON OF MAN! 

If adversity befall thee not in My path, how 
canst thou walk in the ways of them that are 
content with My pleasure?  If trials afflict thee not 
in thy longing to meet Me, how wilt thou attain 
the light in thy love for My beauty? 


51.  O SON OF MAN! 

My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is 
fire and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and 
mercy.  Hasten thereunto that thou mayest 
become an eternal light and an immortal spirit. 
This is My command unto thee, do thou observe 
it. 



+P16 

52.  O SON OF MAN! 

Should prosperity befall thee, rejoice not, and 
should abasement come upon thee, grieve not, 
for both shall pass away and be no more. 


53.  O SON OF BEING! 

If poverty overtake thee, be not sad; for in 
time the Lord of wealth shall visit thee.  Fear 
not abasement, for glory shall one day rest on 
thee. 


54.  O SON OF BEING! 

If thine heart be set upon this eternal, imperishable 
dominion, and this ancient, everlasting 
life, forsake this mortal and fleeting sovereignty. 


55.  O SON OF BEING! 

Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We 
test the gold, and with gold We test Our servants. 


56.  O SON OF MAN! 

Thou dost wish for gold and I desire thy freedom 
from it.  Thou thinkest thyself rich in its possession, 
and I recognize thy wealth in thy sanctity 



+P17 

therefrom.  By My life!  This is My knowledge, and 
that is thy fancy; how can My way accord with 
thine? 


57.  O SON OF MAN! 

Bestow My wealth upon My poor, that in heaven 
thou mayest draw from stores of unfading 
splendor and treasures of imperishable glory. 
But by My life!  To offer up thy soul is a more 
glorious thing couldst thou but see with Mine 
eye. 


58.  O SON OF MAN! 

The temple of being is My throne; cleanse it of 
all things, that there I may be established and 
there I may abide. 


59.  O SON OF BEING! 

Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent. 
Thy spirit is My place of revelation; cleanse it for 
My manifestation. 


60.  O SON OF MAN! 

Put thy hand into My bosom, that I may rise above 
thee, radiant and resplendent. 



+P18 

61.  O SON OF MAN! 

Ascend unto My heaven, that thou mayest obtain 
the joy of reunion, and from the chalice of imperishable 
glory quaff the peerless wine. 


62.  O SON OF MAN! 

Many a day hath passed over thee whilst thou 
hast busied thyself with thy fancies and idle imaginings. 
How long art thou to slumber on thy bed? 
Lift up thy head from slumber, for the Sun hath 
risen to the zenith, haply it may shine upon thee 
with the light of beauty. 


63.  O SON OF MAN! 

The light hath shone on thee from the horizon of 
the sacred Mount and the spirit of enlightenment 
hath breathed in the Sinai of thy heart.  Wherefore, 
free thyself from the veils of idle fancies and 
enter into My court, that thou mayest be fit for 
everlasting life and worthy to meet Me.  Thus may 
death not come upon thee, neither weariness nor 
trouble. 


64.  O SON OF MAN! 

My eternity is My creation, I have created it for 
thee.  Make it the garment of thy temple.  My unity 



+P19 

is My handiwork; I have wrought it for thee; clothe 
thyself therewith, that thou mayest be to all eternity 
the revelation of My everlasting being. 


65.  O SON OF MAN! 

My majesty is My gift to thee, and My grandeur 
the token of My mercy unto thee.  That 
which beseemeth Me none shall understand, 
nor can anyone recount.  Verily, I have preserved 
it in My hidden storehouses and in the 
treasuries of My command, as a sign of My 
loving-kindness unto My servants and My mercy 
unto My people. 


66.  O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND 
INVISIBLE ESSENCE! 

Ye shall be hindered from loving Me and souls 
shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. 
For minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain 
Me. 


67.  O SON OF BEAUTY! 

By My spirit and by My favor!  By My mercy and 
by My beauty!  All that I have revealed unto thee 
with the tongue of power, and have written for 



+P20 

thee with the pen of might, hath been in accordance 
with thy capacity and understanding, not 
with My state and the melody of My voice. 


68.  O CHILDREN OF MEN! 

Know ye not why We created you all from the 
same dust?  That no one should exalt himself 
over the other.  Ponder at all times in your 
hearts how ye were created.  Since We have 
created you all from one same substance it is 
incumbent on you to be even as one soul, 
to walk with the same feet, eat with the same 
mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your 
inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs 
of oneness and the essence of detachment may be 
made manifest.  Such is My counsel to you, O concourse 
of light!  Heed ye this counsel that ye may 
obtain the fruit of holiness from the tree of wondrous 
glory. 


69.  O YE SONS OF SPIRIT! 

Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the 
pearls of My mysteries and the gems of My knowledge. 
Guard them from the strangers amidst My 
servants and from the ungodly amongst My people. 



+P21 

70.  O SON OF HIM THAT STOOD BY HIS OWN 
ENTITY IN THE KINGDOM OF HIS SELF! 

Know thou, that I have wafted unto thee all the 
fragrances of holiness, have fully revealed to thee 
My word, have perfected through thee My bounty 
and have desired for thee that which I have 
desired for My Self.  Be then content with My 
pleasure and thankful unto Me. 


71.  O SON OF MAN! 

Write all that We have revealed unto thee with the 
ink of light upon the tablet of thy spirit.  Should 
this not be in thy power, then make thine ink of 
the essence of thy heart.  If this thou canst not do, 
then write with that crimson ink that hath been 
shed in My path.  Sweeter indeed is this to Me than 
all else, that its light may endure for ever. 



+P22 

                    THE HIDDEN WORDS 


               Part II.--From the Persian 



     In the Name of the Lord of Utterance, The Mighty. 


1.  O YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW 
AND EARS TO HEAR! 

The first call of the Beloved is this:  O mystic nightingale! 
Abide not but in the rose-garden of the 
spirit.  O messenger of the Solomon of love!  Seek 
thou no shelter except in the Sheba of the well-beloved, 
and O immortal phoenix! dwell not save 
on the mount of faithfulness.  Therein is thy habitation, 
if on the wings of thy soul thou soarest to 
the realm of the infinite and seekest to attain thy 
goal. 


2.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

The bird seeketh its nest; the nightingale the 
charm of the rose; whilst those birds, the hearts 
of men, content with transient dust, have 



+P23 

strayed far from their eternal nest, and with 
eyes turned towards the slough of heedlessness 
are bereft of the glory of the divine presence.  Alas! 
How strange and pitiful; for a mere cupful, they 
have turned away from the billowing seas of the 
Most High, and remained far from the most effulgent 
horizon. 


3.  O FRIEND! 

In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the 
rose of love, and from the nightingale of affection 
and desire loosen not thy hold.  Treasure the companionship 
of the righteous and eschew all fellowship 
with the ungodly. 


4.  O SON OF JUSTICE! 

Whither can a lover go but to the land of his 
beloved? and what seeker findeth rest away from 
his heart's desire?  To the true lover reunion is life, 
and separation is death.  His breast is void of patience 
and his heart hath no peace.  A myriad lives 
he would forsake to hasten to the abode of his 
beloved. 


5.  O SON OF DUST! 

Verily I say unto thee:  Of all men the most negligent 
is he that disputeth idly and seeketh 



+P24 

to advance himself over his brother.  Say, O 
brethren!  Let deeds, not words, be your adorning. 


6.  O SON OF EARTH! 

Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant 
of envy yet lingers, shall never attain My everlasting 
dominion, nor inhale the sweet savors of holiness 
breathing from My kingdom of sanctity. 


7.  O SON OF LOVE! 

Thou art but one step away from the glorious 
heights above and from the celestial tree of 
love.  Take thou one pace and with the next 
advance into the immortal realm and enter 
the pavilion of eternity.  Give ear then to 
that which hath been revealed by the pen of 
glory. 


8.  O SON OF GLORY! 

Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the 
heaven of communion with Me.  Cleanse thy heart 
with the burnish of the spirit, and hasten to the 
court of the Most High. 



+P25

9.  O FLEETING SHADOW! 

Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to 
the exalted heights of certainty.  Open the eye of 
truth, that thou mayest behold the veilless Beauty 
and exclaim:  Hallowed be the Lord, the most excellent 
of all creators! 


10.  O SON OF DESIRE! 

Give ear unto this:  Never shall mortal eye recognize 
the everlasting Beauty, nor the lifeless heart 
delight in aught but in the withered bloom.  For 
like seeketh like, and taketh pleasure in the company 
of its kind. 


11.  O SON OF DUST! 

Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My 
beauty; stop thine ears, that thou mayest hearken 
unto the sweet melody of My voice; empty thyself 
of all learning, that thou mayest partake of 
My knowledge; and sanctify thyself from riches, 
that thou mayest obtain a lasting share from the 
ocean of My eternal wealth.  Blind thine eyes, 
that is, to all save My beauty; stop thine ears 
to all save My word; empty thyself of all learning 
save the knowledge of Me; that with a clear vision, a 
pure heart and an attentive ear thou mayest enter 
the court of My holiness. 



+P26 

12.  O MAN OF TWO VISIONS! 

Close one eye and open the other.  Close one to 
the world and all that is therein, and open the 
other to the hallowed beauty of the Beloved. 


13.  O MY CHILDREN! 

I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of 
heaven, ye will sink back to the shades of utter 
loss, and, never having gazed upon the beauty of 
the rose, return to water and clay. 


14.  O FRIENDS! 

Abandon not the everlasting beauty for a beauty 
that must die, and set not your affections on this 
mortal world of dust. 


15.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

The time cometh, when the nightingale of holiness 
will no longer unfold the inner mysteries and 
ye will all be bereft of the celestial melody and of 
the voice from on high. 


16.  O ESSENCE OF NEGLIGENCE! 

Myriads of mystic tongues find utterance in one 
speech, and myriads of hidden mysteries are revealed 



+P27 

in a single melody; yet, alas, there is no ear 
to hear, nor heart to understand. 


17.  O COMRADES! 

The gates that open on the Placeless stand wide 
and the habitation of the loved one is adorned 
with the lovers' blood, yet all but a few remain 
bereft of this celestial city, and even of these few, 
none but the smallest handful hath been found 
with a pure heart and sanctified spirit. 


18.  O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST 
PARADISE! 

Proclaim unto the children of assurance that 
within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial 
paradise, a new garden hath appeared, 
round which circle the denizens of the realm on 
high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted 
paradise.  Strive, then, that ye may attain that station, 
that ye may unravel the mysteries of love 
from its wind-flowers and learn the secret of divine 
and consummate wisdom from its eternal 
fruits.  Solaced are the eyes of them that enter and 
abide therein! 


19.  O MY FRIENDS! 

Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, 
when in those hallowed and blessed surroundings 



+P28 

ye were all gathered in My presence beneath the 
shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the 
all-glorious paradise?  Awe-struck ye listened as I 
gave utterance to these three most holy words:  O 
friends!  Prefer not your will to Mine, never desire 
that which I have not desired for you, and approach 
Me not with lifeless hearts, defiled with 
worldly desires and cravings.  Would ye but sanctify 
your souls, ye would at this present hour recall 
that place and those surroundings, and the truth 
of My utterance should be made evident unto all 
of you. 




In the eighth of the most holy lines, in the fifth Tablet of 
Paradise, He saith: 

20.  O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE 
COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS! 

Ages have passed and your precious lives are 
well-nigh ended, yet not a single breath of 
purity hath reached Our court of holiness from 
you.  Though immersed in the ocean of misbelief, 
yet with your lips ye profess the one true faith of 
God.  Him whom I abhor ye have loved, and of My 
foe ye have made a friend.  Notwithstanding, ye 
walk on My earth complacent and self-satisfied, 
heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything 



+P29 

within it shunneth you.  Were ye but to open 
your eyes, ye would, in truth, prefer a myriad 
griefs unto this joy, and would count death itself 
better than this life. 


21.  O MOVING FORM OF DUST! 

I desire communion with thee, but thou wouldst 
put no trust in Me.  The sword of thy rebellion 
hath felled the tree of thy hope.  At all times I am 
near unto thee, but thou art ever far from Me. 
Imperishable glory I have chosen for thee, yet 
boundless shame thou hast chosen for thyself. 
While there is yet time, return, and lose not thy 
chance. 


22.  O SON OF DESIRE! 

The learned and the wise have for long years 
striven and failed to attain the presence of the 
All-Glorious; they have spent their lives in 
search of Him, yet did not behold the beauty 
of His countenance.  Thou without the least effort 
didst attain thy goal, and without search 
hast obtained the object of thy quest.  Yet, 
notwithstanding, thou didst remain so wrapt 
in the veil of self, that thine eyes beheld not the 
beauty of the Beloved, nor did thy hand touch 
the hem of His robe.  Ye that have eyes, behold 
and wonder. 



+P30 

23.  O DWELLERS IN THE CITY OF LOVE! 

Mortal blasts have beset the everlasting candle, 
and the beauty of the celestial Youth is veiled in 
the darkness of dust.  The chief of the monarchs 
of love is wronged by the people of tyranny and 
the dove of holiness lies prisoned in the talons of 
owls.  The dwellers in the pavilion of glory and the 
celestial concourse bewail and lament, while ye 
repose in the realm of negligence, and esteem 
yourselves as of the true friends.  How vain are 
your imaginings! 


24.  O YE THAT ARE FOOLISH, YET HAVE A 
NAME TO BE WISE! 

Wherefore do ye wear the guise of shepherds, 
when inwardly ye have become wolves, intent 
upon My flock?  Ye are even as the star, which 
riseth ere the dawn, and which, though it seem 
radiant and luminous, leadeth the wayfarers of My 
city astray into the paths of perdition. 


25.  O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL! 

Ye are like clear but bitter water, which to outward 
seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested 
by the divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted.  Yea, 



+P31 

the sun beam falls alike upon the dust and the 
mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth 
the star from the earth:  nay, immeasurable is the 
difference! 


26.  O MY FRIEND IN WORD! 

Ponder awhile.  Hast thou ever heard that friend 
and foe should abide in one heart?  Cast out then 
the stranger, that the Friend may enter His home. 


27.  O SON OF DUST! 

All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained 
for thee, except the human heart, which I have 
made the habitation of My beauty and glory; yet 
thou didst give My home and dwelling to another 
than Me; and whenever the manifestation of My 
holiness sought His own abode, a stranger found 
He there, and, homeless, hastened unto the sanctuary 
of the Beloved.  Notwithstanding I have concealed 
thy secret and desired not thy shame. 


28.  O ESSENCE OF DESIRE! 

At many a dawn have I turned from the realms of 
the Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on 



+P32 

the bed of ease busied with others than Myself. 
Thereupon, even as the flash of the spirit, I returned 
to the realms of celestial glory and 
breathed it not in My retreats above unto the 
hosts of holiness. 


29.  O SON OF BOUNTY! 

Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay 
of My command I made thee to appear, and 
have ordained for thy training every atom in 
existence and the essence of all created things. 
Thus, ere thou didst issue from thy mother's 
womb, I destined for thee two founts of gleaming 
milk, eyes to watch over thee, and hearts to love 
thee.  Out of My loving-kindness, 'neath the shade 
of My mercy I nurtured thee, and guarded thee 
by the essence of My grace and favor.  And My 
purpose in all this was that thou mightest attain 
My everlasting dominion and become worthy of 
My invisible bestowals.  And yet heedless thou 
didst remain, and when fully grown, thou didst 
neglect all My bounties and occupied thyself with 
thine idle imaginings, in such wise that thou didst 
become wholly forgetful, and, turning away from 
the portals of the Friend didst abide within the 
courts of My enemy. 



+P33 

30.  O BOND SLAVE OF THE WORLD! 

Many a dawn hath the breeze of My loving-kindness 
wafted over thee and found thee upon 
the bed of heedlessness fast asleep.  Bewailing 
then thy plight it returned whence it came. 


31.  O SON OF EARTH! 

Wouldst thou have Me, seek none other than 
Me; and wouldst thou gaze upon My beauty, 
close thine eyes to the world and all that is 
therein; for My will and the will of another than 
Me, even as fire and water, cannot dwell together 
in one heart. 


32.  O BEFRIENDED STRANGER! 

The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand 
of My power, quench it not with the contrary 
winds of self and passion.  The healer of all thine 
ills is remembrance of Me, forget it not.  Make My 
love thy treasure and cherish it even as thy very 
sight and life. 


33.  O MY BROTHER! 

Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed 
tongue, and quaff the stream of mystic holiness 
from My sugar-shedding lips.  Sow the seeds of My 



+P34 

divine wisdom in the pure soil of thy heart, and 
water them with the water of certitude, that the 
hyacinths of My knowledge and wisdom may 
spring up fresh and green in the sacred city of thy 
heart. 


34.  O DWELLERS OF MY PARADISE! 

With the hands of loving-kindness I have 
planted in the holy garden of paradise the young 
tree of your love and friendship, and have watered 
it with the goodly showers of My tender grace; 
now that the hour of its fruiting is come, strive 
that it may be protected, and be not consumed 
with the flame of desire and passion. 


35.  O MY FRIENDS! 

Quench ye the lamp of error, and kindle within 
your hearts the everlasting torch of divine guidance. 
For ere long the assayers of mankind shall, 
in the holy presence of the Adored, accept naught 
but purest virtue and deeds of stainless holiness. 


36.  O SON OF DUST! 

The wise are they that speak not unless they 
obtain a hearing, even as the cup-bearer, who 



+P35 

proffereth not his cup till he findeth a seeker, 
and the lover who crieth not out from the depths 
of his heart until he gazeth upon the beauty of 
his beloved.  Wherefore sow the seeds of wisdom 
and knowledge in the pure soil of the heart, 
and keep them hidden, till the hyacinths of divine 
wisdom spring from the heart and not from mire 
and clay. 




In the first line of the Tablet it is recorded and written, 
and within the sanctuary of the tabernacle of God is 
hidden: 

37.  O MY SERVANT! 

Abandon not for that which perisheth an everlasting 
dominion, and cast not away celestial sovereignty 
for a worldly desire.  This is the river of 
everlasting life that hath flowed from the well-spring 
of the pen of the merciful; well is it with 
them that drink! 


38.  O SON OF SPIRIT! 

Burst thy cage asunder, and even as the phoenix 
of love soar into the firmament of holiness.  Renounce 
thyself and, filled with the spirit of mercy, 
abide in the realm of celestial sanctity. 



+P36 

39.  O OFFSPRING OF DUST! 

Be not content with the ease of a passing day, 
and deprive not thyself of everlasting rest. 
Barter not the garden of eternal delight for 
the dust-heap of a mortal world.  Up from thy 
prison ascend unto the glorious meads above, and 
from thy mortal cage wing thy flight unto the 
paradise of the Placeless. 


40.  O MY SERVANT! 

Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and 
loose thy soul from the prison of self.  Seize thy 
chance, for it will come to thee no more. 


41.  O SON OF MY HANDMAID! 

Didst thou behold immortal sovereignty, thou 
wouldst strive to pass from this fleeting world.  But 
to conceal the one from thee and to reveal the 
other is a mystery which none but the pure in 
heart can comprehend. 


42.  O MY SERVANT! 

Purge thy heart from malice and, innocent of 
envy, enter the divine court of holiness. 



+P37 

43.  O MY FRIENDS! 

Walk ye in the ways of the good pleasure of 
the Friend, and know that His pleasure is in 
the pleasure of His creatures.  That is:  no man 
should enter the house of his friend save at 
his friend's pleasure, nor lay hands upon his treasures 
nor prefer his own will to his friend's, and 
in no wise seek an advantage over him.  Ponder 
this, ye that have insight! 


44.  O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! 

Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not thyself, 
neither sigh and weep.  Speak no evil, that thou 
mayest not hear it spoken unto thee, and magnify 
not the faults of others that thine own faults may 
not appear great; and wish not the abasement of 
anyone, that thine own abasement be not exposed. 
Live then the days of thy life, that are less 
than a fleeting moment, with thy mind stainless, 
thy heart unsullied, thy thoughts pure, and thy 
nature sanctified, so that, free and content, thou 
mayest put away this mortal frame, and repair 
unto the mystic paradise and abide in the eternal 
kingdom for evermore. 



+P38 

45.  ALAS!  ALAS!  O LOVERS OF WORLDLY 
DESIRE! 

Even as the swiftness of lightning ye have passed 
by the Beloved One, and have set your hearts 
on satanic fancies.  Ye bow the knee before 
your vain imagining, and call it truth.  Ye 
turn your eyes towards the thorn, and name it a 
flower.  Not a pure breath have ye breathed, nor 
hath the breeze of detachment been wafted from 
the meadows of your hearts.  Ye have cast to the 
winds the loving counsels of the Beloved and have 
effaced them utterly from the tablet of your 
hearts, and even as the beasts of the field, ye move 
and have your being within the pastures of desire 
and passion. 


46.  O BRETHREN IN THE PATH! 

Wherefore have ye neglected the mention of the 
Loved One, and kept remote from His holy presence? 
The essence of beauty is within the peerless 
pavilion, set upon the throne of glory, whilst ye 
busy yourselves with idle contentions.  The sweet 
savors of holiness are breathing and the breath 
of bounty is wafted, yet ye are all sorely afflicted 
and deprived thereof.  Alas for you and for them 
that walk in your ways and follow in your footsteps! 



+P39 

47.  O CHILDREN OF DESIRE! 

Put away the garment of vainglory, and divest 
yourselves of the attire of haughtiness. 



In the third of the most holy lines writ and recorded in 
the Ruby Tablet by the pen of the unseen this is revealed: 

48.  O BRETHREN! 

Be forbearing one with another and set not your 
affections on things below.  Pride not yourselves 
in your glory, and be not ashamed of abasement. 
By My beauty!  I have created all things from dust, 
and to dust will I return them again. 


49.  O CHILDREN OF DUST! 

Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor, 
lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, 
and deprive them of the Tree of 
Wealth.  To give and to be generous are attributes 
of Mine; well is it with him that adorneth himself 
with My virtues. 


50.  O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION! 

Put away all covetousness and seek contentment; 
for the covetous hath ever been deprived, and the 
contented hath ever been loved and praised. 



+P40 

51.  O SON OF MY HANDMAID! 

Be not troubled in poverty nor confident in 
riches, for poverty is followed by riches, and 
riches are followed by poverty.  Yet to be poor 
in all save God is a wondrous gift, belittle not 
the value thereof, for in the end it will make 
thee rich in God, and thus thou shalt know the 
meaning of the utterance, "In truth ye are the 
poor," and the holy words, "God is the all-possessing," 
shall even as the true morn break 
forth gloriously resplendent upon the horizon 
of the lover's heart, and abide secure on the 
throne of wealth. 


52.  O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE AND 
PASSION! 

Ye have suffered My enemy to enter My house 
and have cast out My friend, for ye have enshrined 
the love of another than Me in your 
hearts.  Give ear to the sayings of the Friend 
and turn towards His paradise.  Worldly friends, 
seeking their own good, appear to love one the 
other, whereas the true Friend hath loved and 
doth love you for your own sakes; indeed He hath 
suffered for your guidance countless afflictions. 
Be not disloyal to such a Friend, nay rather hasten 
unto Him.  Such is the daystar of the word of truth 
and faithfulness, that hath dawned above the horizon 



+P41 

of the pen of the Lord of all names.  Open 
your ears that ye may hearken unto the word of 
God, the Help in peril, the Self-existent. 


53.  O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON 
MORTAL RICHES! 

Know ye in truth that wealth is a mighty barrier 
between the seeker and his desire, the lover and 
his beloved.  The rich, but for a few, shall in 
no wise attain the court of His presence nor 
enter the city of content and resignation.  Well 
is it then with him, who, being rich, is not hindered 
by his riches from the eternal kingdom, 
nor deprived by them of imperishable dominion. 
By the Most Great Name!  The splendor of such 
a wealthy man shall illuminate the dwellers of 
heaven even as the sun enlightens the people 
of the earth! 


54.  O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH! 

The poor in your midst are My trust; guard ye 
My trust, and be not intent only on your own 
ease. 


55.  O SON OF PASSION! 

Cleanse thyself from the defilement of riches 
and in perfect peace advance into the realm 



+P42 

of poverty; that from the well-spring of detachment 
thou mayest quaff the wine of immortal 
life. 


56.  O MY SON! 

The company of the ungodly increaseth sorrow, 
whilst fellowship with the righteous cleanseth 
the rust from off the heart.  He that seeketh to 
commune with God, let him betake himself to 
the companionship of His loved ones; and he 
that desireth to hearken unto the word of God, 
let him give ear to the words of His chosen 
ones. 


57.  O SON OF DUST! 

Beware!  Walk not with the ungodly and seek 
not fellowship with him, for such companionship 
turneth the radiance of the heart into infernal 
fire. 


58.  O SON OF MY HANDMAID! 

Wouldst thou seek the grace of the Holy Spirit, 
enter into fellowship with the righteous, for 
he hath drunk the cup of eternal life at the 
hands of the immortal Cup-bearer and even 
as the true morn doth quicken and illumine the 
hearts of the dead. 



+P43 

59.  O HEEDLESS ONES! 

Think not the secrets of hearts are hidden, nay, 
know ye of a certainty that in clear characters they 
are engraved and are openly manifest in the holy 
Presence. 


60.  O FRIENDS! 

Verily I say, whatsoever ye have concealed within 
your hearts is to Us open and manifest as the day; 
but that it is hidden is of Our grace and favor, and 
not of your deserving. 


61.  O SON OF MAN! 

A dewdrop out of the fathomless ocean of My 
mercy I have shed upon the peoples of the world, 
yet found none turn thereunto, inasmuch as every 
one hath turned away from the celestial wine of 
unity unto the foul dregs of impurity, and, content 
with mortal cup, hath put away the chalice of immortal 
beauty.  Vile is that wherewith he is contented. 


62.  O SON OF DUST! 

Turn not away thine eyes from the matchless wine 
of the immortal Beloved, and open them not to 
foul and mortal dregs.  Take from the hands of the 



+P44 

divine Cup-bearer the chalice of immortal life, 
that all wisdom may be thine, and that thou mayest 
hearken unto the mystic voice calling from the 
realm of the invisible.  Cry aloud, ye that are of low 
aim!  Wherefore have ye turned away from My 
holy and immortal wine unto evanescent water? 


63.  O YE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD! 

Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity followeth 
you, and grievous retribution awaiteth you. 
Think not that which ye have committed hath 
been effaced in My sight.  By My beauty!  All your 
doings hath My pen graven with open characters 
upon tablets of chrysolite. 


64.  O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! 

Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I have 
pledged Myself not to forgive any man's injustice. 
This is My covenant which I have irrevocably decreed 
in the preserved tablet and sealed with My 
seal. 


65.  O REBELLIOUS ONES! 

My forbearance hath emboldened you and My 
long-suffering hath made you negligent, in such 
wise that ye have spurred on the fiery charger of 



+P45 

passion into perilous ways that lead unto destruction. 
Have ye thought Me heedless or that I was 
unaware? 


66.  O EMIGRANTS! 

The tongue I have designed for the mention of 
Me, defile it not with detraction.  If the fire of self 
overcome you, remember your own faults and not 
the faults of My creatures, inasmuch as every one 
of you knoweth his own self better than he 
knoweth others. 


67.  O CHILDREN OF FANCY! 

Know, verily, that while the radiant dawn breaketh 
above the horizon of eternal holiness, the satanic 
secrets and deeds done in the gloom of night shall 
be laid bare and manifest before the peoples of 
the world. 


68.  O WEED THAT SPRINGETH OUT OF DUST! 

Wherefore have not these soiled hands of thine 
touched first thine own garment, and why with 
thine heart defiled with desire and passion dost 
thou seek to commune with Me and to enter My 
sacred realm?  Far, far are ye from that which ye 
desire. 



+P46 

69.  O CHILDREN OF ADAM! 

Holy words and pure and goodly deeds ascend 
unto the heaven of celestial glory.  Strive that 
your deeds may be cleansed from the dust of 
self and hypocrisy and find favor at the court 
of glory; for ere long the assayers of mankind 
shall, in the holy presence of the Adored One, 
accept naught but absolute virtue and deeds of 
stainless purity.  This is the daystar of wisdom 
and of divine mystery that hath shone above 
the horizon of the divine will.  Blessed are they 
that turn thereunto. 


70.  O SON OF WORLDLINESS! 

Pleasant is the realm of being, wert thou to attain 
thereto; glorious is the domain of eternity, 
shouldst thou pass beyond the world of mortality; 
sweet is the holy ecstasy if thou drinkest of 
the mystic chalice from the hands of the celestial 
Youth.  Shouldst thou attain this station, thou 
wouldst be freed from destruction and death, 
from toil and sin. 


71.  O MY FRIENDS! 

Call ye to mind that covenant ye have entered into 
with Me upon Mount Paran, situate within 
the hallowed precincts of Zaman.  I have taken 



+P47 

to witness the concourse on high and the dwellers 
in the city of eternity, yet now none do I 
find faithful unto the covenant.  Of a certainty 
pride and rebellion have effaced it from the 
hearts, in such wise that no trace thereof remaineth. 
Yet knowing this, I waited and disclosed it 
not. 


72.  O MY SERVANT! 

Thou art even as a finely tempered sword concealed 
in the darkness of its sheath and its value 
hidden from the artificer's knowledge.  Wherefore 
come forth from the sheath of self and 
desire that thy worth may be made resplendent 
and manifest unto all the world. 


73.  O MY FRIEND! 

Thou art the daystar of the heavens of My holiness, 
let not the defilement of the world eclipse 
thy splendor.  Rend asunder the veil of heedlessness, 
that from behind the clouds thou mayest 
emerge resplendent and array all things with the 
apparel of life. 


74.  O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY! 

For a fleeting sovereignty ye have abandoned My 
imperishable dominion, and have adorned yourselves 



+P48 

with the gay livery of the world and made 
of it your boast.  By My beauty!  All will I gather 
beneath the one-colored covering of the dust and 
efface all these diverse colors save them 
that choose My own, and that is purging from every 
color. 


75.  O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE! 

Set not your affections on mortal sovereignty 
and rejoice not therein.  Ye are even as the unwary 
bird that with full confidence warbleth 
upon the bough; till of a sudden the fowler 
Death throws it upon the dust, and the melody, 
the form and the color are gone, leaving 
not a trace.  Wherefore take heed, O bondslaves 
of desire! 


76.  O SON OF MY HANDMAID! 

Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now 
it is given by deeds.  Every one must show forth 
deeds that are pure and holy, for words are the 
property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these 
belong only to Our loved ones.  Strive then with 
heart and soul to distinguish yourselves by your 



+P49 

deeds.  In this wise We counsel you in this holy and 
resplendent tablet. 


77.  O SON OF JUSTICE! 

In the night-season the beauty of the immortal 
Being hath repaired from the emerald height of 
fidelity unto the &amp;Sadratu'l-Muntaha, and wept 
with such a weeping that the concourse on high 
and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at 
His lamenting.  Whereupon there was asked, 
Why the wailing and weeping?  He made reply: 
As bidden I waited expectant upon the hill 
of faithfulness, yet inhaled not from them that 
dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity.  Then 
summoned to return I beheld, and lo! certain 
doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws 
of the dogs of earth.  Thereupon the Maid of 
heaven hastened forth unveiled and resplendent 
from Her mystic mansion, and asked of their 
names, and all were told but one.  And when 
urged, the first letter thereof was uttered, whereupon 
the dwellers of the celestial chambers 
rushed forth out of their habitation of glory.  And 
whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell 
down, one and all, upon the dust.  At that moment 
a voice was heard from the inmost shrine: 
"Thus far and no farther."  Verily We bear witness 



+P50 

to that which they have done and now are 
doing. 


78.  O SON OF MY HANDMAID! 

Quaff from the tongue of the merciful the stream 
of divine mystery, and behold from the dayspring 
of divine utterance the unveiled splendor of the 
daystar of wisdom.  Sow the seeds of My divine 
wisdom in the pure soil of the heart, and water 
them with the waters of certitude, that the hyacinths 
of knowledge and wisdom may spring up 
fresh and green from the holy city of the heart. 


79.  O SON OF DESIRE! 

How long wilt thou soar in the realms of desire? 
Wings have I bestowed upon thee, that 
thou mayest fly to the realms of mystic holiness 
and not the regions of satanic fancy.  The 
comb, too, have I given thee that thou mayest 
dress My raven locks, and not lacerate My 
throat. 


80.  O MY SERVANTS! 

Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth 
goodly and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves 



+P51 

and others may profit therefrom.  Thus it is incumbent 
on every one to engage in crafts and professions, 
for therein lies the secret of wealth, O men 
of understanding!  For results depend upon 
means, and the grace of God shall be all-sufficient 
unto you.  Trees that yield no fruit have been and 
will ever be for the fire. 


81.  O MY SERVANT! 

The basest of men are they that yield no fruit 
on earth.  Such men are verily counted as 
among the dead, nay better are the dead in 
the sight of God than those idle and worthless 
souls. 


82.  O MY SERVANT! 

The best of men are they that earn a livelihood 
by their calling and spend upon themselves and 
upon their kindred for the love of God, the Lord 
of all worlds. 




The mystic and wondrous Bride, hidden ere this beneath the 
veiling of utterance, hath now, by the grace of God and His 
divine favor, been made manifest even as the resplendent light 
shed by the beauty of the Beloved.  I bear witness, O friends! 
that the favor is complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof 



+P52 

manifest and the evidence established.  Let it now be seen what 
your endeavors in the path of detachment will reveal.  In this 
wise hath the divine favor been fully vouchsafed unto you 
and unto them that are in heaven and on earth.  All praise 
to God, the Lord of all Worlds.</p></body>
