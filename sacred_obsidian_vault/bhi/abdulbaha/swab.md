                 SELECTIONS FROM THE WRITINGS OF 
                          &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA 
 
     1.  O peoples of the world!  The Sun of Truth hath 
risen to illumine the whole earth, and to spiritualize the 
community of man.  Laudable are the results and the fruits 
thereof, abundant the holy evidences deriving from this 
grace.  This is mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light 
for the world and all its peoples; it is harmony and fellowship, 
and love and solidarity; indeed it is compassion and 
unity, and the end of foreignness; it is the being at one, in 
complete dignity and freedom, with all on earth.  
     The Blessed Beauty saith:  `Ye are all the fruits of one 
tree, the leaves of one branch.'  Thus hath He likened this 
world of being to a single tree, and all its peoples to the 
leaves thereof, and the blossoms and fruits.  It is needful for 
the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to flourish, and 
upon the interconnection of all parts of the world-tree, 
dependeth the flourishing of leaf and blossom, and the 
sweetness of the fruit.  
     For this reason must all human beings powerfully sustain 
one another and seek for everlasting life; and for this reason 
must the lovers of God in this contingent world become the 
mercies and the blessings sent forth by that clement King of 
the seen and unseen realms.  Let them purify their sight and 
behold all humankind as leaves and blossoms and fruits of 
the tree of being.  Let them at all times concern themselves 
with doing a kindly thing for one of their fellows, offering 
to someone love, consideration, thoughtful help.  Let them 
 
+P2 
see no one as their enemy, or as wishing them ill, but 
think of all humankind as their friends; regarding the alien 
as an intimate, the stranger as a companion, staying free of 
prejudice, drawing no lines.  
     In this day, the one favoured at the Threshold of the 
Lord is he who handeth round the cup of faithfulness; who 
bestoweth, even upon his enemies, the jewel of bounty, 
and lendeth, even to his fallen oppressor, a helping hand; it 
is he who will, even to the fiercest of his foes, be a loving 
friend.  These are the Teachings of the Blessed Beauty, these 
the counsels of the Most Great Name.  
     O ye dear friends!  The world is at war and the human 
race is in travail and mortal combat.  The dark night of hate 
hath taken over, and the light of good faith is blotted out.  
The peoples and kindreds of the earth have sharpened their 
claws, and are hurling themselves one against the other.  It 
is the very foundation of the human race that is being 
destroyed.  It is thousands of households that are vagrant 
and dispossessed, and every year seeth thousands upon 
thousands of human beings weltering in their life-blood on 
dusty battlefields.  The tents of life and joy are down.  The 
generals practise their generalship, boasting of the blood 
they shed, competing one with the next in inciting to 
violence.  `With this sword,' saith one of them, `I beheaded 
a people!'  And another:  `I toppled a nation to the ground!'  
And yet another:  `I brought a government down!'  On such 
things do men pride themselves, in such do they glory!  
Love--righteousness--these are everywhere censured, while 
despised are harmony, and devotion to the truth.  
     The Faith of the Blessed Beauty is summoning mankind 
to safety and love, to amity and peace; it hath raised up its 
tabernacle on the heights of the earth, and directeth its call 
to all nations.  Wherefore, O ye who are God's lovers, know 
 
+P3 
ye the value of this precious Faith, obey its teachings, walk 
in this road that is drawn straight, and show ye this way to 
the people.  Lift up your voices and sing out the song of the 
Kingdom.  Spread far and wide the precepts and counsels of 
the loving Lord, so that this world will change into another 
world, and this darksome earth will be flooded with light, 
and the dead body of mankind will arise and live; so that 
every soul will ask for immortality, through the holy 
breaths of God.  
     Soon will your swiftly-passing days be over, and the fame 
and riches, the comforts, the joys provided by this rubbish-heap, 
the world, will be gone without a trace.  Summon ye, 
then, the people to God, and invite humanity to follow the 
example of the Company on high.  Be ye loving fathers to 
the orphan, and a refuge to the helpless, and a treasury for 
the poor, and a cure for the ailing.  Be ye the helpers of 
every victim of oppression, the patrons of the disadvantaged.  
Think ye at all times of rendering some service to 
every member of the human race.  Pay ye no heed to aversion 
and rejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice:  act ye in 
the opposite way.  Be ye sincerely kind, not in appearance 
only.  Let each one of God's loved ones centre his attention 
on this:  to be the Lord's mercy to man; to be the Lord's 
grace.  Let him do some good to every person whose path 
he crosseth, and be of some benefit to him.  Let him improve 
the character of each and all, and reorient the minds of men.  
In this way, the light of divine guidance will shine forth, 
and the blessings of God will cradle all mankind:  for love is 
light, no matter in what abode it dwelleth; and hate is 
darkness, no matter where it may make its nest.  O friends 
of God!  That the hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and 
the secret essence of all things may be disclosed, strive ye to 
banish that darkness for ever and ever.  
 
+P4 
     2.  O my Lord!  I have drawn nigh unto Thee, in the 
depths of this darksome night, confiding in Thee with the 
tongue of my heart, trembling with joy at the sweet scents 
that blow from Thy realm, the All-Glorious, calling unto 
Thee, saying:  
     O my Lord, no words do I find to glorify Thee; no way 
do I see for the bird of my mind to soar upward to Thy 
Kingdom of Holiness; for Thou, in Thy very essence, art 
sanctified above those tributes, and in Thy very being art 
beyond the reach of those praises which are offered Thee by 
the people that Thou hast created.  In the sanctity of Thine 
own being hast Thou ever been exalted above the understanding 
of the learned among the Company on high, and 
forever wilt Thou remain enwrapped within the holiness of 
Thine own reality, unreached by the knowledge of those 
dwellers in Thine exalted Kingdom who glorify Thy 
Name.  
     O God, my God!  How can I glorify or describe Thee 
inaccessible as Thou art; immeasurably high and sanctified 
art Thou above every description and praise.  
     O God, my God!  Have mercy then upon my helpless 
state, my poverty, my misery, my abasement!  Give me to 
drink from the generous cup of Thy grace and forgiveness, 
stir me with the sweet scents of Thy love, gladden my 
bosom with the light of Thy knowledge, purify my soul 
with the mysteries of Thy oneness, raise me to life with the 
gentle breeze that cometh from the gardens of Thy mercy
--till I sever myself from all else but Thee, and lay hold of 
the hem of Thy garment of grandeur, and consign to 
oblivion all that is not Thee, and be companioned by the 
sweet breathings that waft during these Thy days, and attain 
unto faithfulness at Thy Threshold of Holiness, and arise to 
serve Thy Cause, and to be humble before Thy loved ones, 
 
+P5 
and, in the presence of Thy favoured ones, to be nothingness 
itself.  
     Verily art Thou the Helper, the Sustainer, the Exalted, 
the Most Generous.  
     O God, my God!  I beg of Thee by the dawning of the 
light of Thy Beauty that hath illumined all the earth, and by 
the glance of Thy divine compassion's eye that considereth 
all things, and by the surging sea of Thy bestowals in which 
all things are immersed, and by Thy streaming clouds of 
bounty raining down gifts upon the essences of all created 
things, and by the splendours of Thy mercy that existed 
before ever the world was--to help Thy chosen ones to be 
faithful, and assist Thy loved ones to serve at Thine exalted 
Threshold, and cause them to gain the victory through the 
battalions of Thy might that overpowereth all things, and 
reinforce them with a great fighting host from out of the 
Concourse on high.  
     O my Lord!  They are weak souls standing at Thy door; 
they are paupers in Thy courtyard, desperate for Thy grace, 
in dire need of Thy succour, turning their faces toward the 
kingdom of Thy oneness, yearning for the bounties of Thy 
bestowals.  O my Lord!  Flood Thou their minds with Thy 
holy light; cleanse Thou their hearts with the grace of Thine 
assistance; gladden their bosoms with the fragrance of the 
joys that waft from Thy Company above; make bright 
their eyes by beholding the signs and tokens of Thy might; 
cause them to be the ensigns of purity, the banners of 
sanctity waving high above all creatures on the summits of 
the earth; make Thou their words to move hearts which are 
even as solid rock.  May they arise to serve Thee and dedicate 
themselves to the Kingdom of Thy divinity, and set 
their faces toward the realm of Thy Self-Subsistence, and 
spread far and wide Thy signs, and be illumined by Thy 
 
+P6 
streaming lights, and unfold Thy hidden mysteries.  May 
they guide Thy servants unto gentle waters and to the 
fountain of Thy mercy that welleth and leapeth in the 
midmost heart of the Heaven of Thy oneness.  May they 
hoist the sail of detachment upon the Ark of Salvation, and 
move over the seas of Thy knowledge; may they spread 
wide the pinions of unity and by their aid soar upward to 
the Kingdom of Thy singleness to become servants whom 
the Supreme Concourse will applaud, whose praises the 
dwellers in Thine all-glorious realm will utter; may they 
hear the heralds of the invisible world as they raise their cry 
of the Most Great Glad-Tidings; may they, in their longing 
to meet Thee, invoke and pray unto Thee, intoning wondrous 
orisons at the dawn of light--O my Lord Who disposest 
all things--shedding their tears at morningtide and 
even, yearning to pass into the shadow of Thy mercy that 
endeth never.  
     Help them, O my Lord, under all conditions, support 
them at all times with Thine angels of holiness, they who 
are Thine invisible hosts, Thy heavenly battalions who 
bring down to defeat the massed armies of this nether 
world.  
     Verily art Thou the Mighty, the Powerful, the Strong, 
the All-Encompassing, the One Who hath dominion over 
all that is.  
     O holy Lord!  O Lord of loving-kindness!  We stray 
about Thy dwelling, longing to behold Thy beauty, and 
loving all Thy ways.  We are hapless, lowly, and of small 
account.  We are paupers:  show us mercy, give us bounty; 
look not upon our failings, hide Thou our endless sins.  
Whatever we are, still are we Thine, and what we speak 
and hear is praise of Thee, and it is Thy face we seek, Thy 
path we follow.  Thou art the Lord of loving-kindness, we 
 
+P7 
are sinners and astray and far from home.  Wherefore, O 
Cloud of Mercy, grant us some drops of rain.  O Flowering 
Bed of grace, send forth a fragrant breeze.  O Sea of all 
bestowals, roll towards us a great wave.  O Sun of Bounty, 
send down a shaft of light.  Grant us pity, grant us grace.  By 
Thy beauty, we come with no provision but our sins, with 
no good deeds to tell of, only hopes.  Unless Thy concealing 
veil doth cover us, and Thy protection shield and cradle us, 
what power have these helpless souls to rise and serve Thee, 
what substance have these wretched ones to make a brave 
display?  Thou Who art the Mighty, the All-Powerful, help 
us, favour us; withered as we are, revive us with showers 
from Thy clouds of grace; lowly as we are, illumine us with 
bright rays from the Day-Star of Thy oneness.  Cast Thou 
these thirsty fish into the ocean of Thy mercy, guide Thou 
this lost caravan to the shelter of Thy singleness; to the 
wellspring of guidance lead Thou the ones who have 
wandered far astray, and grant to those who have missed 
the path a haven within the precincts of Thy might.  Lift 
Thou to these parched lips the bounteous and soft-flowing 
waters of heaven, raise up these dead to everlasting life.  
Grant Thou to the blind eyes that will see.  Make Thou the 
deaf to hear, the dumb to speak.  Set Thou the dispirited 
ablaze, make Thou the heedless mindful, warn Thou the 
proud, awaken those who sleep.  
     Thou art the Mighty, Thou art the Bestower, Thou art 
the Loving.  Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Most 
Exalted.  
     O ye loved ones of God, ye helpers of this evanescent 
Servant!  When the Sun of Reality shed its endless bounties 
from the Dawning-Point of all desires, and this world of 
being was lit with that sacred light from pole to pole, with 
such intensity did it cast down its rays that it blotted out the 
 
+P8 
Stygian dark forever, whereupon this earth of dust became 
the envy of the spheres of heaven, and this lowly place took 
on the state and panoply of the supernal realm.  The gentle 
breeze of holiness blew over it, scattering abroad sweet 
savours; the spring winds of heaven passed by it, and over it, 
from the Source of all bestowals, were wafted fruitful airs 
that carried boundless grace.  Then the bright dawn rose, 
and there came tidings of great joy.  The divine springtime 
was here, pitching its tents in this contingent world, so that 
all creation leapt and danced.  The withered earth brought 
forth immortal blooms, the dead dust woke to everlasting 
life.  Then came forth flowers of mystic learning, and, 
bespeaking the knowledge of God, fresh greenery from the 
ground.  The contingent world displayed God's bounteous 
gifts, the visible world reflecting the glories of realms that 
were hidden from sight.  God's summons was proclaimed, 
the table of the Eternal Covenant was readied, the cup of 
the Testament was passed from hand to hand, the universal 
invitation was sent forth.  Then some among the people 
were set afire with the wine of heaven, and some were left 
without a share of this greatest of bestowals.  The sight and 
insight of some were illumined by the light of grace, and 
there were some who, hearing the anthems of unity, leapt 
for joy.  There were birds that began to carol in the gardens 
of holiness, there were nightingales in the branches of the 
rose tree of heaven that raised their plaintive cries.  Then 
were decked and adorned both the Kingdom on high and 
the earth below, and this world became the envy of high 
heaven.  Yet alas, alas, the neglectful have stayed fast in their 
heedless sleep, and the foolish have spurned this most sacred 
of bestowals.  The blind remain shrouded in their veils, the 
deaf have no share in what hath come to pass, the dead have 
no hopes of attaining thereto, for even as He saith:  `They 
 
+P9 
despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair that the 
dwellers in the tombs will rise again.'+F1  
     As to you, O ye loved ones of God!  Loose your tongues 
and offer Him thanks; praise ye and glorify the Beauty of 
the Adored One, for ye have drunk from this purest of 
chalices, and ye are cheered and set aglow with this wine.  
Ye have detected the sweet scents of holiness, ye have 
smelled the musk of faithfulness from Joseph's raiment.  Ye 
have fed on the honey-dew of loyalty from the hands of 
Him Who is the one alone Beloved, ye have feasted on 
immortal dishes at the bounteous banquet table of the Lord.  
This plenty is a special favour bestowed by a loving God, 
these are blessings and rare gifts deriving from His grace.  In 
the Gospel He saith:  `For many are called, but few are 
chosen.'+F2  That is, to many is it offered, but rare is the soul 
who is singled out to receive the great bestowal of guidance.  
`Such is the bounty of God:  to whom He will He giveth it, 
and of immense bounty is God.'+F3  
     O ye loved ones of God!  From the peoples of the world, 
against the Candle of the Covenant discordant winds do 
beat and blow.  The Nightingale of faithfulness is beset 
by renegades who are even as ravens of hate.  The Dove 
of God's remembrance is hard pressed by mindless birds of 
night, and the Gazelle that dwelleth in the meadows of 
God's love is being hunted down by ravening beasts.  
Deadly is the peril, tormenting the pain.  
     The beloved of the Lord must stand fixed as the mountains, 
firm as impregnable walls.  Unmoved must they 
remain by even the direst adversities, ungrieved by the 
worst of disasters.  Let them cling to the hem of Almighty 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 60:13 
+F2 Matthew 22:14 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 57:21 
 
+P10 
God, and put their faith in the Beauty of the Most High; 
let them lean on the unfailing help that cometh from the 
Ancient Kingdom, and depend on the care and protection 
of the generous Lord.  Let them at all times refresh and 
restore themselves with the dews of heavenly grace, and 
with the breaths of the Holy Spirit revive and renew themselves 
from moment to moment.  Let them rise up to serve 
their Lord, and do all in their power to scatter His breathings 
of holiness far and wide.  Let them be a mighty fortress to 
defend His Faith, an impregnable citadel for the hosts of the 
Ancient Beauty.  Let them faithfully guard the edifice of the 
Cause of God from every side; let them become the bright 
stars of His luminous skies.  For the hordes of darkness are 
assailing this Cause from every direction, and the peoples of 
the earth are intent on extinguishing this evident Light.  
And since all the kindreds of the world are mounting their 
attack, how can our attention be diverted, even for a 
moment?  Assuredly be cognizant of these things, be watchful, 
and guard the Cause of God.  
     The most vital duty, in this day, is to purify your characters, 
to correct your manners, and improve your conduct.  The 
beloved of the Merciful must show forth such character and 
conduct among His creatures, that the fragrance of their 
holiness may be shed upon the whole world, and may quicken the 
dead, inasmuch as the purpose of the Manifestation of God and 
the dawning of the limitless lights of the Invisible is to 
educate the souls of men, and refine the character 
of every living man--so that blessed 
individuals, who have freed themselves from the murk of 
the animal world, shall rise up with those qualities which 
are the adornings of the reality of man.  The purpose is that 
earthlings should turn into the people of Heaven, and those 
 
+P11 
who walk in darkness should come into the light, and those 
who are excluded should join the inner circle of the Kingdom, 
and those who are as nothing should become intimates 
of the everlasting Glory.  It is that the portionless 
should gain their share of the boundless sea, and the 
ignorant drink their fill from the living fount of knowledge; 
that those who thirst for blood should forsake their 
savagery, and those who are barbed of claw should turn 
gentle and forbearing, and those who love war should seek 
instead for true conciliation; it is that the brutal, their talons 
razor-sharp, should enjoy the benefits of lasting peace; that 
the foul should learn that there is a realm of purity, and the 
tainted find their way to the rivers of holiness.  
     Unless these divine bestowals be revealed from the inner 
self of humankind, the bounty of the Manifestation will 
prove barren, and the dazzling rays of the Sun of Truth will 
have no effect whatever.  
     Wherefore, O beloved of the Lord, strive ye with heart 
and soul to receive a share of His holy attributes and take 
your portion of the bounties of His sanctity--that ye may 
become the tokens of unity, the standards of singleness, and 
seek out the meaning of oneness; that ye may, in this 
garden of God, lift up your voices and sing the blissful 
anthems of the spirit.  Become ye as the birds who offer 
Him their thanks, and in the blossoming bowers of life 
chant ye such melodies as will dazzle the minds of those 
who know.  Raise ye a banner on the highest peaks of the 
world, a flag of God's favour to ripple and wave in the 
winds of His grace; plant ye a tree in the field of life, amid 
the roses of this visible world, that will yield a fruitage 
fresh and sweet.  
     I swear by the true Teacher that if ye will act in accord 
with the admonitions of God, as revealed in His luminous 
 
+P12 
Tablets, this darksome dust will mirror forth the Kingdom of 
heaven, and this nether world the realm of the All-Glorious.  
     O ye loved ones of the Lord!  Praise be to Him, the 
unseen, welling bounties of the Sun of Truth encompass 
you on every side, and from every direction the portals of 
His mercy stand ajar.  Now is the time to take advantage of 
these bestowals, and benefit therefrom.  Know ye the value 
of this time, let not this chance escape you.  Stay ye entirely 
clear of this dark world's concerns, and become ye known 
by the attributes of those essences that make their home in 
the Kingdom.  Then shall ye see how intense is the glory of 
the heavenly Day-Star, and how blinding bright are the 
tokens of bounty coming out of the invisible realm.  
 
     3.  O ye beloved of God!  O ye children of His Kingdom!  
Verily, verily, the new heaven and the new earth are 
come.  The holy City, new Jerusalem, hath come down 
from on high in the form of a maid of heaven, veiled, 
beauteous, and unique, and prepared for reunion with her 
lovers on earth.  The angelic company of the Celestial 
Concourse hath joined in a call that hath run throughout 
the universe, all loudly and mightily acclaiming:  `This is the 
City of God and His abode, wherein shall dwell the pure 
and holy among His servants.  He shall live with them, for 
they are His people and He is their Lord.'  
     He hath wiped away their tears, kindled their light, 
rejoiced their hearts and enraptured their souls.  Death shall 
no more overtake them neither shall sorrow, weeping or 
tribulation afflict them.  The Lord God Omnipotent hath 
been enthroned in His Kingdom and hath made all things 
new.  This is the truth and what truth can be greater than 
that announced by the Revelation of St. John the Divine?  
 
+P13 
     He is Alpha and Omega.  He is the One that will give 
unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life 
and bestow upon the sick the remedy of true salvation.  He 
whom such grace aideth is verily he that receiveth the most 
glorious heritage from the Prophets of God and His holy 
ones.  The Lord will be his God, and he His dearly-beloved 
son.  
     Rejoice, then, O ye beloved of the Lord and His chosen 
ones, and ye the children of God and His people, raise your 
voices to laud and magnify the Lord, the Most High; for His 
light hath beamed forth, His signs have appeared and the 
billows of His rising ocean have scattered on every shore 
many a precious pearl.  
 
     4.  Praise be to Him Who hath made the world of being, 
and hath fashioned all that is, Him Who hath raised up the 
sincere to a station of honour+F1 and hath made the invisible 
world to appear on the plane of the visible--yet still, in their 
drunken stupor,+F2 do men wander and stray.  
     He hath laid down the foundations of the lofty Citadel, 
He hath inaugurated the Cycle of Glory, He hath brought 
forth a new creation on this day that is clearly Judgement 
Day--and still do the heedless stay fast in their drunken 
sleep.  
     The Bugle+F3 hath sounded, the Trumpet+F4 hath been 
blown, the Crier hath raised his call, and all upon the earth 
have swooned away--but still do the dead, in the tombs of 
their bodies, sleep on.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 17:81 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 15:72 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 39:68; Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 133 
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 74:8 
 
+P14 
     And the second clarion+F1 hath sounded, there hath followed 
the second blast after the first,+F2 and the dread woe 
hath come, and every nursing mother hath forgot the infant 
at her breast+F3--yet still the people, confused and distracted, 
heed it not.  
     And the Resurrection hath dawned, and the Hour hath 
struck, and the Path hath been drawn straight, and the 
Balance hath been set up, and all upon the earth have been 
gathered together+F4--but still the people see no sign of the 
way.  
     The light hath shone forth, and radiance floodeth Mount 
Sinai, and a gentle wind bloweth from over the gardens of 
the Ever-Forgiving Lord; the sweet breaths of the spirit are 
passing by, and those who lay buried in the grave are rising 
up--and still do the heedless slumber on in their tombs.  
     The flames of hell have been made to blaze, and heaven 
hath been brought nigh; the celestial gardens are in flower, 
and fresh pools are brimming over, and paradise gleameth 
in beauty--but the unaware are still mired down in their 
empty dreams.  
     The veil hath fallen away, the curtain is lifted, the clouds 
have parted, the Lord of Lords is in plain sight--yet all hath 
passed the sinners by.  
     It is He Who hath made for you the new creation,+F5 and 
brought on the woe+F6 that surpasseth all others, and gathered 
the holy together in the realm on high.  Verily in this are 
signs for those who have eyes to see.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 39:68 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 79:6 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 22:2 
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 34:39 
+F5 &amp;Qur'an 29:19 
+F6 &amp;Qur'an 79:34 
 
+P15 
     And among His signs is the appearance of omens and 
joyous prophecies, of hints and clues, the spreading of many 
and various tidings, and the anticipations of the righteous, 
they who have now attained their goal.  
     And among His signs are His splendours, rising above 
the horizon of oneness, His lights streaming out from the 
dayspring of might, and the announcement of the Most 
Great Glad-Tidings by His Herald, the One, the Incomparable.  
Verily in this is a brilliant proof for the company of 
those who know.  
     Among His signs is His being manifest, being seen by all, 
standing as His own proof, and His presence among witnesses 
in every region, among peoples who fell upon Him 
even as wolves, and compassed Him about from every side.  
     Among His signs is His withstanding powerful nations 
and all-conquering states, and a host of enemies thirsting for 
His blood, intent at every moment upon His ruin, wheresoever 
He might be.  Verily this is a matter deserving the 
scrutiny of those who ponder the signs and tokens of God.  
     Another of His signs is the marvel of His discourse, the 
eloquence of His utterance, the rapidity with which His 
Writings were revealed, His words of wisdom, His verses, 
His epistles, His communes, His unfolding of the &amp;Qur'an, 
both the abstruse verses thereof and the clear.  By thy very 
life!  This thing is plain as day to whoever will regard it 
with the eye of justice.  
     Again among His signs is the dawning sun of His 
knowledge, and the rising moon of His arts and skills, and 
His demonstrating perfection in all His ways, as testified by 
the learned and accomplished of many nations.  
     And again among His signs is the fact that His beauty 
stayed inviolate, and His human temple was protected as 
He revealed His splendours, despite the massed attacks of 
 
+P16 
all His foes, who came against Him in their thousands with 
their darting arrows, spears and swords.  Herein is verily a 
wonder and a warning to any fair judge.  
     And among His signs is His long-suffering, His tribulations 
and His woes, His agony in His chains and fetters, and 
His calling out at every moment:  `Come unto Me, come 
unto Me, ye righteous!  Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye 
lovers of the good!  Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye 
dawning points of light!'  Verily the gates of mystery are 
opened wide--but still do the wicked disport themselves 
with their vain cavillings!+F1  
     Yet another of His signs is the promulgation of His Book, 
His decisive Holy Text wherein He reproved the kings, and 
His dire warning to that one+F2 whose mighty rule was felt 
around the world--and whose great throne then toppled 
down in a matter of brief days--this being a fact clearly 
established and widely known.  
     And among His signs is the sublimity of His grandeur, 
His exalted state, His towering glory, and the shining out of 
His beauty above the horizon of the Prison:  so that heads 
were bowed before Him and voices lowered, and humble 
were the faces that turned His way.  This is a proof never 
witnessed in the ages gone before.  
     Again among His signs are the extraordinary things He 
continually did, the miracles He performed, the wonders 
appearing from Him without interruption like the streaming 
down of His clouds--and the acknowledgement, even 
by unbelievers, of His powerful light.  By His own life!  
This was clearly verified, it was demonstrated to those of 
every persuasion who came into the presence of the living, 
the self-subsisting Lord.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 6:91; 52:12 
+F2 Napoleon III 
 
+P17 
     And yet another of His signs is the wide-spreading rays 
of the sun of His era, the rising moon of His times in the 
heaven of all the ages:  His day, which standeth at the summit 
of all days, for its rank and power, its sciences and its 
arts, reaching far and wide, that have dazzled the world and 
astonished the minds of men.  
     Verily is this a matter settled and established for all 
time.  
 
     5.  The world's great Light, once resplendent upon all 
mankind, hath set, to shine everlastingly from the &amp;Abha 
Horizon, His Kingdom of fadeless glory, shedding splendour 
upon His loved ones from on high and breathing into 
their hearts and souls the breath of eternal life.  
     Ponder in your hearts that which He hath foretold in His 
Tablet of the Divine Vision that hath been spread throughout 
the world.  Therein He saith:  `Thereupon she wailed 
and exclaimed:  "May the world and all that is therein be a 
ransom for Thy woes.  O Sovereign of heaven and earth!  
Wherefore hast Thou left Thyself in the hands of the 
dwellers of this prison-city of &amp;Akka?  Hasten Thou to other 
dominions, to Thy retreats above, whereon the eyes of the 
people of names have never fallen."  We smiled and spake 
not.  Reflect upon these most exalted words, and comprehend 
the purpose of this hidden and sacred mystery.'  
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  Beware, beware lest ye 
hesitate and waver.  Let not fear fall upon you, neither be 
troubled nor dismayed.  Take ye good heed lest this calamitous 
day slacken the flames of your ardour, and quench your 
tender hopes.  Today is the day for steadfastness and constancy.  
Blessed are they that stand firm and immovable as 
the rock and brave the storm and stress of this tempestuous 
 
+P18 
hour.  They, verily, shall be the recipients of God's grace; 
they, verily, shall receive His divine assistance, and shall be 
truly victorious.  They shall shine amidst mankind with a 
radiance which the dwellers of the Pavilion of Glory laud 
and magnify.  To them is proclaimed this celestial call, 
revealed in His Most Holy Book:  `Let not your hearts be 
perturbed, O people, when the glory of My Presence is 
withdrawn, and the ocean of My utterance is stilled.  In My 
presence amongst you there is a wisdom, and in My absence 
there is yet another, inscrutable to all but God, the Incomparable, 
the All-Knowing.  Verily, We behold you from 
Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever will arise for 
the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse 
on high and a company of Our favoured angels.'  
     The Sun of Truth, that Most Great Light, hath set upon 
the horizon of the world to rise with deathless splendour 
over the Realm of the Limitless.  In His Most Holy Book 
He calleth the firm and steadfast of His friends:  `Be not 
dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day-star of 
My beauty is set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed 
from your eyes.  Arise to further My Cause, and to 
exalt My Word amongst men.'  
 
     6.  O ye peoples of the Kingdom!  How many a soul 
expended all its span of life in worship, endured the mortification 
of the flesh, longed to gain an entry into the Kingdom, 
and yet failed, while ye, with neither toil nor pain nor 
self-denial, have won the prize and entered in.  
     It is even as in the time of the Messiah, when the Pharisees 
and the pious were left without a portion, while Peter, 
John and Andrew, given neither to pious worship nor 
ascetic practice, won the day.  Wherefore, thank ye God for 
 
+P19 
setting upon your heads the crown of glory everlasting, for 
granting unto you this immeasurable grace.  
     The time hath come when, as a thank-offering for this 
bestowal, ye should grow in faith and constancy as day 
followeth day, and should draw ever nearer to the Lord, 
your God, becoming magnetized to such a degree, and so 
aflame, that your holy melodies in praise of the Beloved 
will reach upward to the Company on high; and that each 
one of you, even as a nightingale in this rose garden of God, 
will glorify the Lord of Hosts, and become the teacher of 
all who dwell on earth.  
 
     7.  O ye spiritual friends of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  A trusted 
messenger hath arrived and hath, in the world of the spirit, 
delivered a message from God's loved ones.  This auspicious 
courier bringeth fragrances of great ardour and wafteth the life-giving 
breezes of the love of God.  He maketh the heart to dance 
for joy and filleth up the soul with an ecstasy of love and 
rapture.  So intensely hath the glory of Divine Unity 
penetrated souls and hearts that all are now bound one to 
another with heavenly ties, and all are even as a single heart, 
a single soul.  Wherefore reflections of the spirit and impressions 
of the Divine are now mirrored clear and sharp in the 
deep heart's core.  I beg of God to strengthen these spiritual 
bonds as day followeth day, and make this mystic oneness 
to shine ever more brightly, until at last all shall be as troops 
marshalled together beneath the banner of the Covenant 
within the sheltering shade of the Word of God; that they 
may strive with all their might until universal fellowship, 
close and warm, and unalloyed love, and spiritual relationships, 
will connect all the hearts in the world.  Then will all 
humankind, because of this fresh and dazzling bounty, be 
 
+P20 
gathered in a single homeland.  Then will conflict and dissension 
vanish from the face of the earth, then will mankind 
be cradled in love for the beauty of the All-Glorious.  Discord 
will change to accord, dissension to unison.  The roots 
of malevolence will be torn out, the basis of aggression 
destroyed.  The bright rays of union will obliterate the 
darkness of limitations, and the splendours of heaven will 
make the human heart to be even as a mine veined richly 
with the love of God.  
     O ye loved ones of the Lord!  This is the hour when ye 
must associate with all the earth's peoples in extreme kindliness 
and love, and be to them the signs and tokens of God's 
great mercy.  Ye must become the very soul of the world, 
the living spirit in the body of the children of men.  In this 
wondrous Age, at this time when the Ancient Beauty, the 
Most Great Name, bearing unnumbered gifts, hath risen 
above the horizon of the world, the Word of God hath 
infused such awesome power into the inmost essence of 
humankind that He hath stripped men's human qualities of 
all effect, and hath, with His all-conquering might, unified 
the peoples in a vast sea of oneness.  
     Now is the time for the lovers of God to raise high the 
banners of unity, to intone, in the assemblages of the world, 
the verses of friendship and love and to demonstrate to all 
that the grace of God is one.  Thus will the tabernacles of 
holiness be upraised on the summits of the earth, gathering 
all peoples into the protective shadow of the Word of Oneness.  
This great bounty will dawn over the world at the 
time when the lovers of God shall arise to carry out His 
Teachings, and to scatter far and wide the fresh, sweet scents 
of universal love.  
     In every dispensation, there hath been the commandment 
of fellowship and love, but it was a commandment 
 
+P21 
limited to the community of those in mutual agreement, 
not to the dissident foe.  In this wondrous age, however, 
praised be God, the commandments of God are not delimited, 
not restricted to any one group of people, rather 
have all the friends been commanded to show forth fellowship 
and love, consideration and generosity and loving-kindness 
to every community on earth.  Now must the 
lovers of God arise to carry out these instructions of His:  
let them be kindly fathers to the children of the human race, 
and compassionate brothers to the youth, and self-denying 
offspring to those bent with years.  The meaning of this is 
that ye must show forth tenderness and love to every human 
being, even to your enemies, and welcome them all with 
unalloyed friendship, good cheer, and loving-kindness.  
When ye meet with cruelty and persecution at another's 
hands, keep faith with him; when malevolence is directed 
your way, respond with a friendly heart.  To the spears and 
arrows rained upon you, expose your breasts for a target 
mirror-bright; and in return for curses, taunts and wounding 
words, show forth abounding love.  Thus will all 
peoples witness the power of the Most Great Name, and 
every nation acknowledge the might of the Ancient Beauty, 
and see how He hath toppled down the walls of discord, 
and how surely He hath guided all the peoples of the earth 
to oneness; how He hath lit man's world, and made this 
earth of dust to send forth streams of light.  
     These human creatures are even as children, they are 
brash and unconcerned.  These children must be reared with 
infinite, loving care, and tenderly fostered in the embraces 
of mercy, so that they may taste the spiritual honey-sweetness 
of God's love; that they may become like unto 
candles shedding their beams across this darksome world, 
and may clearly perceive what blazing crowns of glory the 
 
+P22 
Most Great Name, the Ancient Beauty, hath set on the 
brows of His beloved, what bounties He hath bestowed on 
the hearts of those He holdeth dear, what a love He hath 
cast into the breasts of humankind, and what treasures of 
friendship He hath made to appear amongst all men.  
 
          O God, my God!  Aid Thou Thy trusted servants to 
     have loving and tender hearts.  Help them to spread, 
     amongst all the nations of the earth, the light of guidance 
     that cometh from the Company on high.  Verily Thou 
     art the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Subduing, 
     the Ever-Giving.  Verily Thou art the Generous, 
     the Gentle, the Tender, the Most Bountiful.  
 
     8.  O ye beloved of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and ye handmaids of 
the Merciful!  It is early morning, and the reviving winds of 
the &amp;Abha Paradise are blowing over all creation, but they 
can stir only the pure of heart, and only the pure sense can 
detect their fragrance.  Only the perceiving eye beholdeth 
the rays of the sun; only the listening ear can hear the singing 
of the Concourse on high.  Although the plentiful rains 
of spring, the bestowals of Heaven, pour down upon all 
things, they can only fructify good soil; they love not brackish 
ground, where no results of all the bounty can be shown.  
     Today the soft and holy breathings of the &amp;Abha Realm 
are passing over every land, but only the pure in heart draw 
nigh and derive a benefit therefrom.  It is the hope of this 
wronged soul that from the grace of the Self-Subsistent 
One and by the manifest power of the Word of God, the 
heads of the unmindful may be cleared, that they may 
perceive these sweet savours which blow from secret rosebeds 
of the spirit.  
 
+P23 
     O ye friends of God!  True friends are even as skilled 
physicians, and the Teachings of God are as healing balm, a 
medicine for the conscience of man.  They clear the head, so 
that a man can breathe them in and delight in their sweet 
fragrance.  They waken those who sleep.  They bring awareness 
to the unheeding, and a portion to the outcast, and to 
the hopeless, hope.  
     If in this day a soul shall act according to the precepts and 
the counsels of God, he will serve as a divine physician to 
mankind, and like the trump of &amp;Israfil,+F1 he will call the dead 
of this contingent world to life; for the confirmations of the 
&amp;Abha Realm are never interrupted, and such a virtuous soul 
hath, to befriend him, the unfailing help of the Company 
on high.  Thus shall a sorry gnat become an eagle in the 
fulness of his strength, and a feeble sparrow change to a 
royal falcon in the heights of ancient glory.  
     Wherefore, look not on the degree of your capacity, ask 
not if you are worthy of the task:  rest ye your hopes on the 
help and loving-kindness, the favours and bestowals of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah--may my soul be offered up for His friends!  
Urge on the steed of high endeavour over the field of 
sacrifice, and carry away from this wide arena the prize of 
divine grace.  
     O ye handmaids of the merciful Lord!  How many queens 
of this world laid down their heads on a pillow of dust and 
disappeared.  No fruit was left of them, no trace, no sign, 
not even their names.  For them, no more granting of 
bestowals; for them, no more living at all.  Not so the handmaids 
who ministered at the Threshold of God; these have 
shone forth like glittering stars in the skies of ancient glory, 
shedding their splendours across all the reaches of time.  
 
+F1 Believed to be the angel appointed to sound the trumpet on the 
+F1 Day of Resurrection to raise the dead at the bidding of the Lord.  
 
+P24 
These have fulfilled their dearest hopes in the &amp;Abha 
Paradise; they have tasted the honey of reunion in the congregation 
of the Lord.  Such souls as these profited from 
their existence here on earth:  they plucked the fruit of life.  
As for the rest, `There surely came upon them a time when 
they were a thing not spoken of.'  
     O ye lovers of this wronged one!  Cleanse ye your eyes, 
so that ye behold no man as different from yourselves.  See 
ye no strangers; rather see all men as friends, for love and 
unity come hard when ye fix your gaze on otherness.  And 
in this new and wondrous age, the Holy Writings say that 
we must be at one with every people; that we must see 
neither harshness nor injustice, neither malevolence, nor 
hostility, nor hate, but rather turn our eyes toward the 
heaven of ancient glory.  For each of the creatures is a sign of 
God, and it was by the grace of the Lord and His power 
that each did step into the world; therefore they are not 
strangers, but in the family; not aliens, but friends, and to 
be treated as such.  
     Wherefore must the loved ones of God associate in affectionate 
fellowship with stranger and friend alike, showing 
forth to all the utmost loving-kindness, disregarding the 
degree of their capacity, never asking whether they deserve 
to be loved.  In every instance let the friends be considerate 
and infinitely kind.  Let them never be defeated by the malice 
of the people, by their aggression and their hate, no matter 
how intense.  If others hurl their darts against you, offer 
them milk and honey in return; if they poison your lives, 
sweeten their souls; if they injure you, teach them how to 
be comforted; if they inflict a wound upon you, be a balm 
to their sores; if they sting you, hold to their lips a refreshing 
cup.  
     O God, my God!  These are Thy feeble servants; they are 
 
+P25 
Thy loyal bondsmen and Thy handmaidens, who have 
bowed themselves down before Thine exalted Utterance 
and humbled themselves at Thy Threshold of light, and 
borne witness to Thy oneness through which the Sun hath 
been made to shine in midday splendour.  They have listened 
to the summons Thou didst raise from out Thy hidden 
Realm, and with hearts quivering with love and rapture, 
they have responded to Thy call.  
     O Lord, shower upon them all the outpourings of Thy 
mercy, rain down upon them all the waters of Thy grace.  
Make them to grow as beauteous plants in the garden of 
heaven, and from the full and brimming clouds of Thy 
bestowals and out of the deep pools of Thine abounding 
grace make Thou this garden to flower and keep it ever 
green and lustrous, ever fresh and shimmering and fair.  
     Thou art verily the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, 
He Who alone, in the heavens and on the earth, abideth 
unchanged.  There is none other God save Thee, the Lord of 
manifest tokens and signs.  
 
     9.  O thou whose heart overfloweth with love for the 
Lord!  I address thee from this consecrated spot, to gladden 
thy bosom with mine epistle to thee, for this is such a letter 
as maketh the heart of him who believeth in God's oneness 
to wing its flight toward the summits of bliss.  
     Thank thou God for having enabled thee to enter into 
His Kingdom of might.  Erelong will thy Lord's bounties 
descend upon thee, one following the other, and He will 
make of thee a sign for every seeker after truth.  
     Hold thou fast to the Covenant of thy Lord, and as the 
days go by, increase thy store of love for His beloved 
ones.  Bend thou with tenderness over the servitors of the 
 
+P26 
All-Merciful, that thou mayest hoist the sail of love upon the 
ark of peace that moveth across the seas of life.  Let nothing 
grieve thee, and be thou angered at none.  It behoveth thee 
to be content with the Will of God, and a true and loving 
and trusted friend to all the peoples of the earth, without 
any exceptions whatever.  This is the quality of the sincere, 
the way of the saints, the emblem of those who believe in 
the unity of God, and the raiment of the people of &amp;Baha.  
     Thank thou and bless thou the Lord for He hath allowed 
thee to offer Him the Right of God.+F1  This is verily a special 
favour on His part, for thee; praise Him then for this commandment 
that is set forth in the Scriptures of thy Lord, of 
Him that is the Ancient of Days.  
     Verily is He the Loving, the Tender, the Ever-Bestowing.  
 
     10.  O thou dear handmaid of God!  Thy letter hath 
been received and its contents noted.  Thou didst ask for a 
rule whereby to guide thy life.  
     Believe thou in God, and keep thine eyes fixed upon the 
exalted Kingdom; be thou enamoured of the &amp;Abha Beauty; 
stand thou firm in the Covenant; yearn thou to ascend into 
the Heaven of the Universal Light.  Be thou severed from 
this world, and reborn through the sweet scents of holiness 
that blow from the realm of the All-Highest.  Be thou a summoner 
to love, and be thou kind to all the human race.  
Love thou the children of men and share in their sorrows.  
Be thou of those who foster peace.  Offer thy friendship, be 
worthy of trust.  Be thou a balm to every sore, be thou a 
medicine for every ill.  Bind thou the souls together.  Recite 
thou the verses of guidance.  Be engaged in the worship of 
thy Lord, and rise up to lead the people aright.  Loose thy 
 
+F1 &amp;Huququ'llah 
 
+P27 
tongue and teach, and let thy face be bright with the fire of 
God's love.  Rest thou not for a moment, seek thou to draw 
no easeful breath.  Thus mayest thou become a sign and 
symbol of God's love, and a banner of His grace.  
 
     11.  Service to the friends is service to the Kingdom of 
God, and consideration shown to the poor is one of the 
greatest teachings of God.  
 
     12.  Know thou of a certainty that Love is the secret of 
God's holy Dispensation, the manifestation of the All-Merciful, 
the fountain of spiritual outpourings.  Love is 
heaven's kindly light, the Holy Spirit's eternal breath that 
vivifieth the human soul.  Love is the cause of God's revelation 
unto man, the vital bond inherent, in accordance with 
the divine creation, in the realities of things.  Love is the one 
means that ensureth true felicity both in this world and the 
next.  Love is the light that guideth in darkness, the living 
link that uniteth God with man, that assureth the progress 
of every illumined soul.  Love is the most great law that 
ruleth this mighty and heavenly cycle, the unique power 
that bindeth together the divers elements of this material 
world, the supreme magnetic force that directeth the movements 
of the spheres in the celestial realms.  Love revealeth 
with unfailing and limitless power the mysteries latent in 
the universe.  Love is the spirit of life unto the adorned body 
of mankind, the establisher of true civilization in this mortal 
world, and the shedder of imperishable glory upon every 
high-aiming race and nation.  
     Whatsoever people is graciously favoured therewith by 
God, its name shall surely be magnified and extolled by the 
 
+P28 
Concourse from on high, by the company of angels, and 
the denizens of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  And whatsoever people 
turneth its heart away from this Divine Love--the revelation 
of the Merciful--shall err grievously, shall fall into 
despair, and be utterly destroyed.  That people shall be 
denied all refuge, shall become even as the vilest creatures of 
the earth, victims of degradation and shame.  
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  Strive to become the manifestations 
of the love of God, the lamps of divine guidance 
shining amongst the kindreds of the earth with the light of 
love and concord.  
     All hail to the revealers of this glorious light!  
 
     13.  O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  Thy letter dated 
5 December 1918 was received.  It contained the good news 
that the friends of God and the maidservants of the Merciful 
have gathered in summer at Green Acre, have been engaged 
day and night in the commemoration of God, have served 
the oneness of the world of humanity, have shown love to 
all religions, have remained aloof from every religious prejudice 
and have been kind to all people.  The divine religions 
must be the cause of oneness among men, and the means of 
unity and love; they must promulgate universal peace, free 
man from every prejudice, bestow joy and gladness, exercise 
kindness to all men and do away with every difference 
and distinction.  Just as &amp;Baha'u'llah addressing the world of 
humanity saith:  `O people!  Ye are the fruits of one tree 
and the leaves of one branch.'  At most it is this, that some 
souls are ignorant, they must be educated; some are sick, 
they must be healed; some are still of tender age, they must 
be helped to attain maturity, and the utmost kindness must be 
shown to them.  This is the conduct of the people of &amp;Baha.  
 
+P29 
     I hope that thy brothers and sisters will all become the 
well-wishers of the world of mankind.  
 
     14.  O ye two blessed souls!  Your letters were received.  
They showed that ye have investigated the truth and have 
been freed from imitations and superstitions, that ye observe 
with your own eyes and not with those of others, hearken 
with your own ears and not with the ears of others, and 
discover mysteries with the help of your own consciences 
and not with those of others.  For the imitator saith that such 
a man hath seen, such a man hath heard, and such a conscience 
hath discovered; in other words he dependeth upon 
the sight, the hearing and the conscience of others and hath 
no will of his own.  
     Now, praise be to God, ye have shown will-power and 
have turned to the Sun of Truth.  The plain of your hearts 
hath been illumined by the lights of the Lord of the Kingdom 
and ye have been led to the straight path, have marched 
along the road that leadeth to the Kingdom, have entered 
the &amp;Abha Paradise, and have secured a portion and share of 
the fruit of the Tree of Life.  
     Blessed are ye and a goodly home awaiteth you.  Upon 
you be greetings and praise.  
 
     15.  O captive of the love of God!  The letter which 
thou didst write at the time of thy departure hath been 
received.  It brought me joy; and it is my hope that thine 
inner eye may be opened wide, so that unto thee the very 
core of the divine mysteries may be disclosed.  
     Thou didst begin thy letter with a blessed phrase, saying:  
`I am a Christian.'  O would that all were truly Christian!  It 
 
+P30 
is easy to be a Christian on the tongue, but hard to be a true 
one.  Today some five hundred million souls are Christian, 
but the real Christian is very rare:  he is that soul from whose 
comely face there shineth the splendour of Christ, and who 
showeth forth the perfections of the Kingdom; this is a 
matter of great moment, for to be a Christian is to embody 
every excellence there is.  I hope that thou, too, shalt become 
a true Christian.  Praise thou God that at last, through the 
divine teachings, thou hast obtained both sight and insight 
to the highest degree, and hast become firmly rooted in 
certitude and faith.  It is my hope that others as well will 
achieve illumined eyes and hearing ears, and attain to everlasting 
life:  that these many rivers, each flowing along in 
diverse and separated beds, will find their way back to the 
circumambient sea, and merge together and rise up in a 
single wave of surging oneness; that the unity of truth, 
through the power of God, will make these illusory differences 
to vanish away.  This is the one essential:  for if unity 
be gained, all other problems will disappear of themselves.  
     O honoured lady!  In accordance with the divine teachings 
in this glorious dispensation we should not belittle anyone 
and call him ignorant, saying:  `You know not, but I 
know'.  Rather, we should look upon others with respect, 
and when attempting to explain and demonstrate, we 
should speak as if we are investigating the truth, saying:  
`Here these things are before us.  Let us investigate to determine 
where and in what form the truth can be found.'  The 
teacher should not consider himself as learned and others 
ignorant.  Such a thought breedeth pride, and pride is not 
conducive to influence.  The teacher should not see in himself 
any superiority; he should speak with the utmost kindliness, 
lowliness and humility, for such speech exerteth 
influence and educateth the souls.  
 
+P31 
     O honoured lady!  For a single purpose were the 
Prophets, each and all, sent down to earth; for this was 
Christ made manifest, for this did &amp;Baha'u'llah raise up the 
call of the Lord:  that the world of man should become the 
world of God, this nether realm the Kingdom, this darkness 
light, this satanic wickedness all the virtues of heaven--and 
unity, fellowship and love be won for the whole human 
race, that the organic unity should reappear and the bases of 
discord be destroyed and life everlasting and grace everlasting 
become the harvest of mankind.  
     O honoured lady!  Look about thee at the world:  here 
unity, mutual attraction, gathering together, engender life, 
but disunity and inharmony spell death.  When thou dost 
consider all phenomena, thou wilt see that every created 
thing hath come into being through the mingling of many 
elements, and once this collectivity of elements is dissolved, 
and this harmony of components is dissevered, the life form 
is wiped out.  
     O honoured lady!  In cycles gone by, though harmony 
was established, yet, owing to the absence of means, the 
unity of all mankind could not have been achieved.  Continents 
remained widely divided, nay even among the 
peoples of one and the same continent association and interchange 
of thought were wellnigh impossible.  Consequently 
intercourse, understanding and unity amongst all the 
peoples and kindreds of the earth were unattainable.  In this 
day, however, means of communication have multiplied, 
and the five continents of the earth have virtually merged 
into one.  And for everyone it is now easy to travel to any 
land, to associate and exchange views with its peoples, and 
to become familiar, through publications, with the conditions, 
the religious beliefs and the thoughts of all men.  In 
like manner all the members of the human family, whether 
 
+P32 
peoples or governments, cities or villages, have become 
increasingly interdependent.  For none is self-sufficiency any 
longer possible, inasmuch as political ties unite all peoples 
and nations, and the bonds of trade and industry, of agriculture 
and education, are being strengthened every day.  
Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day be achieved.  
Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this 
wondrous age, this glorious century.  Of this past ages have 
been deprived, for this century--the century of light--hath 
been endowed with unique and unprecedented glory, 
power and illumination.  Hence the miraculous unfolding of 
a fresh marvel every day.  Eventually it will be seen how 
bright its candles will burn in the assemblage of man.  
     Behold how its light is now dawning upon the world's 
darkened horizon.  The first candle is unity in the political 
realm, the early glimmerings of which can now be discerned.  
The second candle is unity of thought in world 
undertakings, the consummation of which will erelong be 
witnessed.  The third candle is unity in freedom which will 
surely come to pass.  The fourth candle is unity in religion 
which is the corner-stone of the foundation itself, and which, 
by the power of God, will be revealed in all its splendour.  
The fifth candle is the unity of nations--a unity which in 
this century will be securely established, causing all the 
peoples of the world to regard themselves as citizens of one 
common fatherland.  The sixth candle is unity of races, 
making of all that dwell on earth peoples and kindreds of 
one race.  The seventh candle is unity of language, i.e., the 
choice of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be 
instructed and converse.  Each and every one of these will 
inevitably come to pass, inasmuch as the power of the 
Kingdom of God will aid and assist in their realization.  
 
+P33 
     16.  O ye illumined loved ones and ye handmaids of the 
Merciful!  At a time when the sombre night of ignorance, 
of neglect of the divine world, of being veiled from God, 
had overspread the earth, a bright morning dawned and a 
rising light lit up the eastern sky.  Then rose the Sun of 
Truth and the splendours of the Kingdom were shed over 
east and west.  Those who had eyes to see rejoiced at the 
glad tidings and cried out:  `O blessed, blessed are we!', and 
they witnessed the inner reality of all things, and uncovered 
the mysteries of the Kingdom.  Delivered then from their 
fancies and their doubts, they beheld the light of truth, and 
so exhilarated did they become from draining the chalice of 
God's love, that they utterly forgot the world and their 
own selves.  Dancing for joy they hastened to the place of 
their own martyrdom and there, where men die for love, 
they flung away their heads and hearts.  
     But those with unseeing eyes were astonished at this 
tumult, and they cried, `Where is the light?' and again, `We 
see no light!  We see no rising sun!  Here is no truth.  This is 
but fantasy and nothing more.'  Bat-like they fled into the 
underground dark, and there, to their way of thinking, they 
found a measure of security and peace.  
     This, however, is but the beginning of the dawn, and the 
heat of the rising Orb of Truth is not yet at the fullness of 
its power.  Once the sun hath mounted to high noon, its 
fires will burn so hot as to stir even the creeping things 
beneath the earth; and although it is not for them to behold 
the light, yet will they all be set in frenzied motion by the 
impact of the heat.  
     Wherefore, O ye beloved of God, offer up thanks that ye 
have, in the day of the dawning, turned your faces unto the 
Light of the World and beheld its splendours.  Ye have 
received a share of the light of truth, ye have enjoyed a 
 
+P34 
portion of those blessings that endure forever; and therefore, 
as a returning of thanks for this bounty, rest ye not 
for a moment, sit ye not silent, carry to men's ears the glad 
tidings of the Kingdom, spread far and wide the Word of 
God.  
     Act in accordance with the counsels of the Lord:  that is, 
rise up in such wise, and with such qualities, as to endow 
the body of this world with a living soul, and to bring this 
young child, humanity, to the stage of adulthood.  So far as 
ye are able, ignite a candle of love in every meeting, and 
with tenderness rejoice and cheer ye every heart.  Care for 
the stranger as for one of your own; show to alien souls the 
same loving kindness ye bestow upon your faithful friends.  
Should any come to blows with you, seek to be friends 
with him; should any stab you to the heart, be ye a healing 
salve unto his sores; should any taunt and mock at you, 
meet him with love.  Should any heap his blame upon you, 
praise ye him; should he offer you a deadly poison, give him 
the choicest honey in exchange; and should he threaten 
your life, grant him a remedy that will heal him evermore.  
Should he be pain itself, be ye his medicine; should he be 
thorns, be ye his roses and sweet herbs.  Perchance such ways 
and words from you will make this darksome world turn 
bright at last; will make this dusty earth turn heavenly, this 
devilish prison place become a royal palace of the Lord--so 
that war and strife will pass and be no more, and love and 
trust will pitch their tents on the summits of the world.  
Such is the essence of God's admonitions; such in sum are 
the teachings for the Dispensation of &amp;Baha.  
 
+P35 
     17.  O ye who are the chosen ones of the &amp;Abha Kingdom!  
Praise ye the Lord of Hosts for He, riding upon the 
clouds, hath come down to this world out of the heaven of 
the invisible realm, so that East and West were lit by the 
glory of the Sun of Truth, and the call of the Kingdom was 
raised, and the heralds of the realm above, with melodies of 
the Concourse on high, sang out the glad tidings of the 
Coming.  Then the whole world of being did quiver for joy, 
and still the people, even as the Messiah saith, slept on:  for 
the day of the Manifestation, when the Lord of Hosts 
descended, found them wrapped in the slumber of unknowing.  
As He saith in the Gospel, My coming is even as 
when the thief is in the house, and the goodman of the 
house watcheth not.  
     From amongst all mankind hath He chosen you, and 
your eyes have been opened to the light of guidance and 
your ears attuned to the music of the Company above; and 
blessed by abounding grace, your hearts and souls have been 
born into new life.  Thank ye and praise ye God that the 
hand of infinite bestowals hath set upon your heads this 
gem-studded crown, this crown whose lustrous jewels will 
forever flash and sparkle down all the reaches of time.  
     To thank Him for this, make ye a mighty effort, and 
choose for yourselves a noble goal.  Through the power of 
faith, obey ye the teachings of God, and let all your actions 
conform to His laws.  Read ye The Hidden Words, ponder 
the inner meanings thereof, act in accord therewith.  Read, 
with close attention, the Tablets of &amp;Tarazat (Ornaments), 
&amp;Kalimat (Words of Paradise), &amp;Tajalliyyat (Effulgences), 
&amp;Ishraqat (Splendours), and &amp;Bisharat (Glad Tidings), and rise 
up as ye are bidden in the heavenly teachings.  Thus may 
each one of you be even as a candle casting its light, the 
centre of attraction wherever people come together; and 
 
+P36 
from you, as from a bed of flowers, may sweet scents be 
shed.  
     Raise ye a clamour like unto a roaring sea; like a prodigal 
cloud, rain down the grace of heaven.  Lift up your voices 
and sing out the songs of the &amp;Abha Realm.  Quench ye the 
fires of war, lift high the banners of peace, work for the 
oneness of humankind and remember that religion is the 
channel of love unto all peoples.  Be ye aware that the children 
of men are sheep of God and He their loving Shepherd, 
that He careth tenderly for all His sheep and maketh 
them to feed in His own green pastures of grace and giveth 
them to drink from the wellspring of life.  Such is the way 
of the Lord.  Such are His bestowals.  Such, from among 
His teachings, is His precept of the oneness of mankind.  
     The portals of His blessings are opened wide and His 
signs are published abroad and the glory of truth is blazing 
forth; inexhaustible are the blessings.  Know ye the value of 
this time.  Strive ye with all your hearts, raise up your voices 
and shout, until this dark world be filled with light, and this 
narrow place of shadows be widened out, and this dust heap 
of a fleeting moment be changed into a mirror for the 
eternal gardens of heaven, and this globe of earth receive 
its portion of celestial grace.  
     Then will aggression crumble away, and all that maketh 
for disunity be destroyed, and the structure of oneness be 
raised--that the Blessed Tree may cast its shade over east 
and west, and the Tabernacle of the singleness of man be 
set up on the high summits, and flags that betoken love and 
fellowship flutter from their staffs around the world until 
the sea of truth lift high its waves, and earth bring forth the 
roses and sweet herbs of blessings without end, and become 
from pole to pole the &amp;Abha Paradise.  
     These are the counsels of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  It is my hope 
 
+P37 
that out of the bestowals of the Lord of Hosts ye will 
become the spiritual essence and the very radiance of 
humankind, binding the hearts of all with bonds of love; 
that through the power of the Word of God ye will bring 
to life the dead now buried in the graves of their sensual 
desires; that ye will, with the rays of the Sun of Truth, 
restore the sight of those whose inner eye is blind; that ye 
will bring spiritual healing to the spiritually sick.  These 
things do I hope for, out of the bounties and the bestowals 
of the Beloved.  
     At all times do I speak of you and call you to mind.  I pray 
unto the Lord, and with tears I implore Him to rain down 
all these blessings upon you, and gladden your hearts, and 
make blissful your souls, and grant you exceeding joy and 
heavenly delights....  
 
          O Thou loving Provider!  These souls have hearkened 
     to the summons of the Kingdom, and have gazed 
     upon the glory of the Sun of Truth.  They have risen 
     upward to the refreshing skies of love; they are enamoured 
     of Thy nature, and they worship Thy beauty.  
     Unto Thee have they turned themselves, speaking 
     together of Thee, seeking out Thy dwelling, and 
     thirsting for the waterbrooks of Thy heavenly realm.  
          Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Ever-loving.  
 
     18.  O thou possessor of a seeing heart!  Although, 
materially speaking, thou art deprived of physical sight, 
yet, praise be to God, spiritual insight is thine.  Thy heart 
seeth and thy spirit heareth.  Bodily sight is subject to a 
thousand maladies and assuredly will ultimately be lost.  
Thus no importance should be attached to it.  But the sight 
 
+P38 
of the heart is illumined.  It discerneth and discovereth the 
divine Kingdom.  It is everlasting and eternal.  Praise God, 
therefore, that the sight of thy heart is illumined, and the 
hearing of thy mind responsive.  
     Each of the meetings ye have organized, wherein ye 
feel heavenly emotions and comprehend realities and 
significances, is like unto the firmament, and those souls 
are as resplendent stars shining with the light of guidance.  
     Happy is the soul that seeketh, in this brilliant era, 
heavenly teachings, and blessed is the heart which is 
stirred and attracted by the love of God.  
 
     19.  Praise be to Him through Whose splendours the 
earth and the heavens are aglow, through Whose fragrant 
breathings the gardens of holiness that adorn the hearts of 
the chosen are trembling for joy, to Him Who hath shed 
His light and brightened the face of the firmament.  Verily 
there appeared luminous and sparkling stars, glittering, 
shining out, and casting forth their rays upon the supreme 
horizon.  They derived their grace and brilliance from the 
bounties of the &amp;Abha Realm, then, stars of guidance, they 
poured down their lights upon this earth.  
     Praise be to Him Who hath fashioned this new era, this 
age of majesty, even as an unfolding pageant where the 
realities of all things can be exposed to view.  Now are 
clouds of bounty raining down and the gifts of the loving 
Lord are clearly manifest; for both the seen and the unseen 
worlds have been illumined, and the Promised One hath 
come to earth and the beauty of the Adored One hath 
shone forth.  
     Salutations, blessings, and welcome to that Universal 
Reality, that Perfect Word, that Manifest Book, that 
 
+P39 
Splendour which hath dawned in the highest heaven, that 
Guide of all nations, that Light of the world--the billowing 
ocean of Whose abounding grace hath flooded all creation, 
in such wise that the waves thereof have cast upon the sands 
of this visible world their shining pearls.  Now hath the 
Truth appeared, and falsehood fled away; now hath the day 
dawned and jubilation taken over, wherefore men's souls 
are sanctified, their spirits purged, their hearts rejoiced, 
their minds purified, their secret thoughts made wholesome, 
their consciences washed clean, their inmost selves 
made holy:  for the Day of Resurrection hath come to pass, 
and the bestowals of thy Lord, the Forgiving, have encompassed 
all things.  Salutations and praise be unto those 
luminous, resplendent stars that are shedding down their 
rays from the highest heaven, those celestial bodies of the 
girdling zodiac of the &amp;Abha Realm.  May glory rest upon 
them.  
     And now, O thou honoured man who hath hearkened 
unto the Great Announcement, rise up to serve the Cause of 
God with the resistless power of the &amp;Abha Kingdom and 
the breaths that blow from the spirit of the Company on 
high.  Grieve thou not over what the Pharisees, and the 
purveyors of false rumours among writers for the press, are 
saying of &amp;Baha.  Call thou to mind the days of Christ, and 
the afflictions heaped upon Him by the people, and all the 
torments and tribulations inflicted upon His disciples.  Since 
ye are lovers of the &amp;Abha Beauty, ye also must, for His 
love's sake, incur the peoples' blame, and all that befell 
those of a former age must likewise befall you.  Then will 
the faces of the chosen be alight with the splendours of the 
Kingdom of God, and will shine down the ages, yea, down 
all the cycles of time, while the deniers shall remain in 
their manifest loss.  It will be even as was said by the Lord 
 
+P40 
Christ:  they shall persecute you for My name's sake.  
     Remind them of these words and say unto them:  `Verily 
did the Pharisees rise up against Messiah, despite the bright 
beauty of His face and all His comeliness, and they cried out 
that He was not Messiah [&amp;Masih] but a monster [&amp;Masikh], 
because He had claimed to be Almighty God, the sovereign 
Lord of all, and told them, `I am God's Son, and verily in 
the inmost being of His only Son, His mighty Ward, 
clearly revealed with all His attributes, all His perfections, 
standeth the Father.'  This, they said, was open blasphemy 
and slander against the Lord according to the clear and 
irrefutable texts of the Old Testament.  Therefore they 
passed the sentence upon Him, decreeing that His blood be 
shed, and they hanged Him on the cross, where He cried 
out, `O My beloved Lord, how long wilt Thou abandon 
Me to them?  Lift Me up unto Thee, shelter Me close to 
Thee, make Me a dwelling by Thy throne of glory.  Verily 
art Thou the Answerer of prayers, and Thou art the 
Clement, the Merciful.  O My Lord!  Verily this world with 
all its vastness can no longer contain Me, and I love this 
cross, out of love for Thy beauty, and yearning for Thy 
realm on high, and because of this fire, fanned by the gusts 
of Thy holiness, aflame within My heart.  Help me, O Lord, 
to ascend unto Thee, sustain Me that I may reach unto Thy 
sacred Threshold, O My loving Lord!  Verily Thou art the 
Merciful, the Possessor of great bounty!  Verily Thou art 
the Generous!  Verily Thou art the Compassionate!  Verily 
Thou art the All-Knowing!  There is none other God save 
Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful!'  
     Never would the Pharisees have been emboldened to 
calumniate Him and charge Him with that grievous sin, but 
for their ignorance of the inner core of mysteries and the 
fact that they paid no heed to His splendours and regarded 
 
+P41 
not His proofs.  Else would they have acknowledged His 
words, and borne witness to the verses He revealed, confessed 
the truth of His utterances, sought shelter under the 
protective shadow of His banner, learned of His signs and 
tokens, and rejoiced in His blissful tidings.  
     Know thou that the Divine Essence, which is called the 
Invisible of the Invisibles, never to be described, beyond the 
reach of mind--is sanctified above any mention, any definition 
or hint or allusion, any acclamation or praise.  In the 
sense that It is that It is, the intellect can never grasp It, and 
the soul seeking knowledge of It is but a wanderer in the 
desert, and far astray.  `No vision taketh in Him, but He 
taketh in all vision:  He is the Subtile, the All-Informed.'+F1  
     When, however, thou dost contemplate the innermost 
essence of all things, and the individuality of each, thou wilt 
behold the signs of thy Lord's mercy in every created thing, 
and see the spreading rays of His Names and Attributes 
throughout all the realm of being, with evidences which 
none will deny save the froward and the unaware.  Then 
wilt thou observe that the universe is a scroll that discloseth 
His hidden secrets, which are preserved in the well-guarded 
Tablet.  And not an atom of all the atoms in existence, not a 
creature from amongst the creatures but speaketh His praise 
and telleth of His attributes and names, revealeth the glory 
of His might and guideth to His oneness and His mercy:  
and none will gainsay this who hath ears to hear, eyes to see, 
and a mind that is sound.  
     And whensoever thou dost gaze upon creation all entire, 
and dost observe the very atoms thereof, thou wilt note that 
the rays of the Sun of Truth are shed upon all things and 
shining within them, and telling of that Day-Star's 
splendours, Its mysteries, and the spreading of Its lights.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 6:103 
 
+P42 
Look thou upon the trees, upon the blossoms and fruits, 
even upon the stones.  Here too wilt thou behold the Sun's 
rays shed upon them, clearly visible within them, and 
manifested by them.  
     Shouldst thou, however, turn thy gaze unto a Mirror, 
brilliant, stainless, and pure, wherein the divine Beauty is 
reflected, therein wilt thou find the Sun shining with Its 
rays, Its heat, Its disc, Its fair form all entire.  For each 
separate entity possesseth its allotted portion of the solar 
light and telleth of the Sun, but that Universal Reality in all 
Its splendour, that stainless Mirror Whose qualities are 
appropriate to the qualities of the Sun revealed within It--
expresseth in their entirety the attributes of the Source of 
Glory.  And that Universal Reality is Man, the divine Being, 
the Essence that abideth forever.  `Say, Call upon God, or 
call upon the All-Merciful; whichsoever ye call upon, most 
beauteous are His Names.'+F1  
     This is the meaning of the Messiah's words, that the 
Father is in the Son.+F2  Dost thou not see that should a stainless 
mirror proclaim, `Verily is the sun ashine within me, 
together with all its qualities, tokens and signs', such an 
utterance by such a mirror would be neither deceptive nor 
false?  No, by the One Who created It, shaped It, fashioned 
It, and made It to be an entity conformable to the attributes of 
the glory within It!  Praised be He Who created It!  Praised be 
He Who fashioned It!  Praised be He Who made It manifest!  
     Such were the words uttered by Christ.  On account of 
these words they cavilled at and assailed Him when He said 
unto them, `Verily the Son is in the Father, and the Father 
is in the Son.'+F3  Be thou informed of this, and learn thou the 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 17:110 
+F2 John 14:11 
+F3 John 14:10 
 
+P43 
secrets of thy Lord.  As for the deniers, they are veiled from 
God:  they see not, they hear not, neither do they understand.  
`Leave them to entertain themselves with their 
cavillings.'+F1  Abandon them to their wanderings along river 
beds where no stream flows.  Like grazing beasts they cannot 
tell paste from pearl.  Are they not shut away from the 
mysteries of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful?  
     For thy part, rejoice at this best of all glad tidings, and 
rise up to exalt the Word of God and to spread abroad His 
sweet savours in all that vast and mighty land.  Know thou 
of a certainty that thy Lord will come to thine aid with a 
company of the Concourse on high and hosts of the &amp;Abha 
Kingdom.  These will mount the attack, and will furiously 
assail the forces of the ignorant, the blind.  Erelong wilt 
thou behold the flush of daybreak spreading from out the 
Most Exalted Realm, and the morn encompassing all 
regions.  It will put the dark to flight, and the gloom of 
night will fade and pass, and the bright brow of the Faith 
shine forth, and the Day-Star rise and overspread the world.  
On that day will the faithful rejoice, and the steadfast be 
blissful; then will the slanderers take themselves off, and the 
waverers be blotted out, even as deepest shadows fall away 
at the first light of the breaking dawn.  
     Greetings be unto thee, and praise.  
 
          O God, my God!  This is thy radiant servant, Thy 
     spiritual thrall, who hath drawn nigh unto Thee and 
     approached Thy presence.  He hath turned his face unto 
     Thine, acknowledging Thy oneness, confessing Thy 
     singleness, and he hath called out in Thy name among 
     the nations, and led the people to the streaming waters of 
     Thy mercy, O Thou Most generous Lord!  To those who 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 6:91 
 
+P44 
     asked He hath given to drink from the cup of guidance 
     that brimmeth over with the wine of Thy measureless 
     grace.  
          O Lord, assist him under all conditions, cause him 
     to learn Thy well-guarded mysteries, and shower down 
     upon him Thy hidden pearls.  Make of him a banner 
     rippling from castle summits in the winds of Thy 
     heavenly aid, make of him a wellspring of crystal waters.  
          O my forgiving Lord!  Light up the hearts with the 
     rays of a lamp that sheddeth abroad its beams, disclosing 
     to those among Thy people whom Thou hast bounteously 
     favoured, the realities of all things.  
          Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the 
     Protector, the Strong, the Beneficent!  Verily, Thou art 
     the Lord of all mercies!  
 
     20.+F1  When Christ appeared, twenty centuries ago, although 
the Jews were eagerly awaiting His Coming, and 
prayed every day, with tears, saying:  `O God, hasten the 
Revelation of the Messiah,' yet when the Sun of Truth 
dawned, they denied Him and rose against Him with the 
greatest enmity, and eventually crucified that divine Spirit, 
the Word of God, and named Him Beelzebub, the evil one, 
as is recorded in the Gospel.  The reason for this was that they 
said:  `The Revelation of Christ, according to the clear text 
of the Torah, will be attested by certain signs, and so long 
as these signs have not appeared, whoso layeth claim to be 
a Messiah is an impostor.  Among these signs is this, that the 
Messiah should come from an unknown place, yet we all 
know this man's house in Nazareth, and can any good thing 
 
+F1 Written especially for Dr. Esslemont's immortal work &amp;Baha'u'llah 
+F1 and the New Era.  
 
+P45 
come out of Nazareth?  The second sign is that He shall rule 
with a rod of iron, that is, He must act with the sword, but 
this Messiah has not even a wooden staff.  Another of the 
conditions and signs is this:  He must sit upon the throne of 
David and establish David's sovereignty.  Now, far from 
being enthroned, this man has not even a mat to sit on.  
Another of the conditions is this:  the promulgation of all 
the laws of the Torah; yet this man has abrogated these 
laws, and has even broken the sabbath day, although it is the 
clear text of the Torah that whosoever layeth claim to 
prophethood and revealeth miracles and breaketh the sabbath 
day, must be put to death.  Another of the signs is this, 
that in His reign justice will be so advanced that righteousness 
and well-doing will extend from the human even to the 
animal world--the snake and the mouse will share one hole, 
and the eagle and the partridge one nest, the lion and the 
gazelle shall dwell in one pasture, and the wolf and the kid 
shall drink from one fountain.  Yet now, injustice and 
tyranny have waxed so great in His time that they have 
crucified Him!  Another of the conditions is this, that in the 
days of the Messiah the Jews will prosper and triumph over 
all the peoples of the world, but now they are living in the 
utmost abasement and servitude in the empire of the Romans.  
Then how can this be the Messiah promised in the Torah?'  
     In this wise did they object to that Sun of Truth, although 
that Spirit of God was indeed the One promised in the 
Torah.  But as they did not understand the meaning of these 
signs, they crucified the Word of God.  Now the &amp;Baha'is 
hold that the recorded signs did come to pass in the Manifestation 
of Christ, although not in the sense which the 
Jews understood, the description in the Torah being 
allegorical.  For instance, among the signs is that of sovereignty.  
For &amp;Baha'is say that the sovereignty of Christ was a 
 
+P46 
heavenly, divine, everlasting sovereignty, not a Napoleonic 
sovereignty that vanisheth in a short time.  For well nigh 
two thousand years this sovereignty of Christ hath been 
established, and until now it endureth, and to all eternity 
that Holy Being will be exalted upon an everlasting throne.  
     In like manner all the other signs have been made manifest, 
but the Jews did not understand.  Although nearly 
twenty centuries have elapsed since Christ appeared with 
divine splendour, yet the Jews are still awaiting the coming 
of the Messiah and regard themselves as true and Christ as 
false.  
 
     21.  O thou distinguished personage, thou seeker after 
truth!  Thy letter of 4 April 1921, hath been read with love.  
     The existence of the Divine Being hath been clearly 
established, on the basis of logical proofs, but the reality of 
the Godhead is beyond the grasp of the mind.  When thou 
dost carefully consider this matter, thou wilt see that a 
lower plane can never comprehend a higher.  The mineral 
kingdom, for example, which is lower, is precluded from 
comprehending the vegetable kingdom; for the mineral, 
any such understanding would be utterly impossible.  In the 
same way, no matter how far the vegetable kingdom may 
develop, it will achieve no conception of the animal kingdom, 
and any such comprehension at its level would be 
unthinkable, for the animal occupieth a plane higher than 
that of the vegetable:  this tree cannot conceive of hearing 
and sight.  And the animal kingdom, no matter how far it 
may evolve, can never become aware of the reality of the 
intellect, which discovereth the inner essence of all things, 
and comprehendeth those realities which cannot be seen; 
for the human plane as compared with that of the animal is 
 
+P47 
very high.  And although these beings all co-exist in the 
contingent world, in each case the difference in their stations 
precludeth their grasp of the whole; for no lower degree 
can understand a higher, such comprehension being 
impossible.  
     The higher plane, however, understandeth the lower.  
The animal, for instance, comprehendeth the mineral and 
vegetable, the human understandeth the planes of the 
animal, vegetable and mineral.  But the mineral cannot possibly 
understand the realms of man.  And notwithstanding 
the fact that all these entities co-exist in the phenomenal 
world, even so, no lower degree can ever comprehend 
a higher.  
     Then how could it be possible for a contingent reality, 
that is, man, to understand the nature of that pre-existent 
Essence, the Divine Being?  The difference in station between 
man and the Divine Reality is thousands upon 
thousands of times greater than the difference between 
vegetable and animal.  And that which a human being 
would conjure up in his mind is but the fanciful image of 
his human condition, it doth not encompass God's reality 
but rather is encompassed by it.  That is, man graspeth his 
own illusory conceptions, but the Reality of Divinity can 
never be grasped:  It, Itself, encompasseth all created things, 
and all created things are in Its grasp.  That Divinity which 
man doth imagine for himself existeth only in his mind, not 
in truth.  Man, however, existeth both in his mind and in 
truth; thus man is greater than that fanciful reality which 
he is able to imagine.  
     The furthermost limits of this bird of clay are these:  he 
can flutter along for some short distance, into the endless 
vast; but he can never soar upward to the Sun in the high 
heavens.  We must, nevertheless, set forth reasoned or 
 
+P48 
inspired proofs as to the existence of the Divine Being, 
that is, proofs commensurate with the understanding of 
man.  
     It is obvious that all created things are connected one to 
another by a linkage complete and perfect, even, for 
example, as are the members of the human body.  Note how 
all the members and component parts of the human body 
are connected one to another.  In the same way, all the 
members of this endless universe are linked one to another.  
The foot and the step, for example, are connected to the ear 
and the eye; the eye must look ahead before the step is 
taken.  The ear must hear before the eye will carefully 
observe.  And whatever member of the human body is 
deficient, produceth a deficiency in the other members.  The 
brain is connected with the heart and stomach, the lungs are 
connected with all the members.  So is it with the other 
members of the body.  
     And each one of these members hath its own special 
function.  The mind force--whether we call it pre-existent 
or contingent--doth direct and co-ordinate all the members 
of the human body, seeing to it that each part or member 
duly performeth its own special function.  If, however, 
there be some interruption in the power of the mind, all the 
members will fail to carry out their essential functions, 
deficiencies will appear in the body and the functioning of 
its members, and the power will prove ineffective.  
     Likewise, look into this endless universe:  a universal 
power inevitably existeth, which encompasseth all, directing 
and regulating all the parts of this infinite creation; and 
were it not for this Director, this Co-ordinator, the universe 
would be flawed and deficient.  It would be even as a madman; 
whereas ye can see that this endless creation carrieth 
out its functions in perfect order, every separate part of it 
 
+P49 
performing its own task with complete reliability, nor is 
there any flaw to be found in all its workings.  Thus it is 
clear that a Universal Power existeth, directing and regulating 
this infinite universe.  Every rational mind can grasp this 
fact.  
     Furthermore, although all created things grow and develop, 
yet are they subjected to influences from without.  
For instance, the sun giveth heat, the rain nourisheth, the 
wind bringeth life, so that man can develop and grow.  
Thus it is clear that the human body is under influences 
from the outside, and that without those influences man 
could not grow.  And likewise, those outside influences are 
subjected to other influences in their turn.  For example, the 
growth and development of a human being is dependent 
upon the existence of water, and water is dependent upon 
the existence of rain, and rain is dependent upon the existence 
of clouds, and clouds are dependent upon the existence 
of the sun, which causeth land and sea to produce vapour, 
the condensation of vapour forming the clouds.  Thus each 
one of these entities exerteth its influence and is likewise 
influenced in its turn.  Inescapably then, the process leadeth 
to One Who influenceth all, and yet is influenced by none, 
thus severing the chain.  The inner reality of that Being, 
however, is not known, although His effects are clear and 
evident.  
     And further, all created beings are limited, and this very 
limitation of all beings proveth the reality of the Limitless; 
for the existence of a limited being denoteth the existence 
of a Limitless One.  
     To sum it up, there are many such proofs, establishing 
the existence of that Universal Reality.  And since that 
Reality is pre-existent, It is untouched by the conditions 
that govern phenomena; for whatever entity is subject to 
 
+P50 
circumstances and the play of events is contingent, not pre-existent.  
Know then:  that divinity which other communions 
and peoples have conjured up, falleth within the 
scope of their imagination, and not beyond it, whereas the 
reality of the Godhead is beyond all conceiving.  
     As to the Holy Manifestations of God, They are the focal 
points where the signs, tokens and perfections of that 
sacred, pre-existent Reality appear in all their splendour.  
They are an eternal grace, a heavenly glory, and on Them 
dependeth the everlasting life of humankind.  To illustrate:  
the Sun of Truth dwelleth in a sky to which no soul hath 
any access, and which no mind can reach, and He is far 
beyond the comprehension of all creatures.  Yet the Holy 
Manifestations of God are even as a looking-glass, burnished 
and without stain, which gathereth streams of light out of 
that Sun, and then scattereth the glory over the rest of 
creation.  In that polished surface, the Sun with all Its majesty 
standeth clearly revealed.  Thus, should the mirrored Sun 
proclaim, `I am the Sun!' this is but truth; and should It 
cry, `I am not the Sun!' this is the truth as well.  And 
although the Day-Star, with all Its glory, Its beauty, Its 
perfections, be clearly visible in that mirror without stain, 
still It hath not come down from Its own lofty station in the 
realms above, It hath not made Its way into the mirror; 
rather doth It continue to abide, as It will forever, in the 
supernal heights of Its own holiness.  
     And further, all the earth's creatures require the bounty 
of the sun, for their very existence is dependent upon solar 
light and heat.  Should they be deprived of the sun, they 
would be wiped out.  This is the being with God, as referred 
to in the Holy Books:  man must be with his Lord.  
     It is clear, then, that the essential reality of God is revealed 
in His perfections; and the sun, with its perfections, reflected 
 
+P51 
in a mirror, is a visible thing, an entity clearly 
expressing the bounty of God.  
     My hope is that thou wilt acquire a perceptive eye, a 
hearing ear, and that the veils will be removed from thy 
sight.  
 
     22.  O thou who art turning thy face towards God!  
Close thine eyes to all things else, and open them to the 
realm of the All-Glorious.  Ask whatsoever thou wishest of 
Him alone; seek whatsoever thou seekest from Him alone.  
With a look He granteth a hundred thousand hopes, with 
a glance He healeth a hundred thousand incurable ills, with 
a nod He layeth balm on every wound, with a glimpse He 
freeth the hearts from the shackles of grief.  He doeth as He 
doeth, and what recourse have we?  He carrieth out His 
Will, He ordaineth what He pleaseth.  Then better for thee 
to bow down thy head in submission, and put thy trust in 
the All-Merciful Lord.  
 
     23.  O thou who dost search after truth!  Thy letter of 
13 December 1920 hath come.  
     From the days of Adam until today, the religions of God 
have been made manifest, one following the other, and 
each one of them fulfilled its due function, revived mankind, 
and provided education and enlightenment.  They 
freed the people from the darkness of the world of nature 
and ushered them into the brightness of the Kingdom.  As 
each succeeding Faith and Law became revealed it remained 
for some centuries a richly fruitful tree and to it was committed 
the happiness of humankind.  However, as the 
centuries rolled by, it aged, it flourished no more and put 
 
+P52 
forth no fruit, wherefore was it then made young again.  
     The religion of God is one religion, but it must ever be 
renewed.  Moses, for example, was sent forth to man and 
He established a Law, and the Children of Israel, through 
that Mosaic Law, were delivered out of their ignorance and 
came into the light; they were lifted up from their abjectness 
and attained to a glory that fadeth not.  Still, as the long 
years wore on, that radiance passed by, that splendour set, 
that bright day turned to night; and once that night grew 
triply dark, the star of the Messiah dawned, so that again a 
glory lit the world.  
     Our meaning is this:  the religion of God is one, and it is 
the educator of humankind, but still, it needs must be made 
new.  When thou dost plant a tree, its height increaseth day 
by day.  It putteth forth blossoms and leaves and luscious 
fruits.  But after a long time, it doth grow old, yielding no 
fruitage any more.  Then doth the Husbandman of Truth 
take up the seed from that same tree, and plant it in a pure 
soil; and lo, there standeth the first tree, even as it was 
before.  
     Note thou carefully that in this world of being, all things 
must ever be made new.  Look at the material world about 
thee, see how it hath now been renewed.  The thoughts have 
changed, the ways of life have been revised, the sciences and 
arts show a new vigour, discoveries and inventions are new, 
perceptions are new.  How then could such a vital power as 
religion--the guarantor of mankind's great advances, the 
very means of attaining everlasting life, the fosterer of 
infinite excellence, the light of both worlds--not be made 
new?  This would be incompatible with the grace and 
loving-kindness of the Lord.  
     Religion, moreover, is not a series of beliefs, a set of 
customs; religion is the teachings of the Lord God, teachings 
 
+P53 
which constitute the very life of humankind, which urge 
high thoughts upon the mind, refine the character, and lay 
the groundwork for man's everlasting honour.  
     Note thou:  could these fevers in the world of the mind, 
these fires of war and hate, of resentment and malice among 
the nations, this aggression of peoples against peoples, 
which have destroyed the tranquillity of the whole world 
ever be made to abate, except through the living waters of 
the teachings of God?  No, never!  
     And this is clear:  a power above and beyond the powers 
of nature must needs be brought to bear, to change this 
black darkness into light, and these hatreds and resentments, 
grudges and spites, these endless wrangles and wars, into 
fellowship and love amongst all the peoples of the earth.  
This power is none other than the breathings of the Holy 
Spirit and the mighty inflow of the Word of God.  
 
     24.  O spiritual youth!  Praise thou God that thou hast 
found thy way into the Kingdom of Splendours, and hast 
rent asunder the veil of vain imaginings, and that the core of 
the inner mystery hath been made known unto thee.  
     This people, all of them, have pictured a god in the realm 
of the mind, and worship that image which they have made 
for themselves.  And yet that image is comprehended, the 
human mind being the comprehender thereof, and certainly 
the comprehender is greater than that which lieth within its 
grasp; for imagination is but the branch, while mind is the 
root; and certainly the root is greater than the branch.  Consider 
then, how all the peoples of the world are bowing the 
knee to a fancy of their own contriving, how they have 
created a creator within their own minds, and they call it 
 
+P54 
the Fashioner of all that is--whereas in truth it is but an 
illusion.  Thus are the people worshipping only an error of 
perception.  
     But that Essence of Essences, that Invisible of Invisibles, 
is sanctified above all human speculation, and never to be 
overtaken by the mind of man.  Never shall that immemorial 
Reality lodge within the compass of a contingent being.  
His is another realm, and of that realm no understanding 
can be won.  No access can be gained thereto; all entry is 
forbidden there.  The utmost one can say is that Its existence 
can be proved, but the conditions of Its existence are 
unknown.  
     That such an Essence doth exist, the philosophers and 
learned doctors one and all have understood; but whenever 
they tried to learn something of Its being, they were left 
bewildered and dismayed, and at the end, despairing, their 
hopes in ruins, they went their way, out of this life.  For to 
comprehend the state and the inner mystery of that Essence 
of Essences, that Most Secret of Secrets, one needs must 
have another power and other faculties; and such a power, 
such faculties would be more than humankind can bear, 
wherefore no word of Him can come to them.  
     If, for example, one be endowed with the senses of hearing, 
of taste, of smell, of touch--but be deprived of the 
sense of sight, it will not be possible for one to gaze about; 
for sight cannot be realized through hearing or tasting, or 
the sense of smell or touch.  In the same way, with the 
faculties at man's disposal it is beyond the realm of possibility 
for him to grasp that unseeable Reality, holy and 
sanctified above all the sceptics' doubts.  For this, other 
faculties are required, other senses; should such powers 
become available to him, then could a human being receive 
some knowledge of that world; otherwise, never.  
 
+P55 
     25.  O thou handmaid of God!  It is recorded in eastern 
histories that Socrates journeyed to Palestine and Syria and 
there, from men learned in the things of God, acquired 
certain spiritual truths; that when he returned to Greece, he 
promulgated two beliefs:  one, the unity of God, and the 
other, the immortality of the soul after its separation from 
the body; that these concepts, so foreign to their thought, 
raised a great commotion among the Greeks, until in the 
end they gave him poison and killed him.  
     And this is authentic; for the Greeks believed in many 
gods, and Socrates established the fact that God is one, 
which obviously was in conflict with Greek beliefs.  
     The Founder of monotheism was Abraham; it is to Him 
that this concept can be traced, and the belief was current 
among the Children of Israel, even in the days of Socrates.  
     The above, however, cannot be found in the Jewish 
histories; there are many facts which are not included in 
Jewish history.  Not all the events of the life of Christ are set 
forth in the history of Josephus, a Jew, although it was he 
who wrote the history of the times of Christ.  One may not, 
therefore, refuse to believe in events of Christ's day on the 
grounds that they are not to be found in the history of 
Josephus.  
     Eastern histories also state that Hippocrates sojourned for 
a long time in the town of Tyre, and this is a city in Syria.  
 
     26.  O thou who seekest the Kingdom of Heaven!  Thy 
letter hath been received and its contents noted.  
     The Holy Manifestations of God possess two stations:  
one is the physical station, and one the spiritual.  In other 
words, one station is that of a human being, and one, of the 
Divine Reality.  If the Manifestations are subjected to tests, 
 
+P56 
it is in Their human station only, not in the splendour of 
Their Divine Reality.  
     And further, these tests are such only from the viewpoint 
of mankind.  That is, to outward seeming, the human condition 
of the Holy Manifestations is subjected to tests, and 
when Their strength and endurance have by this means been 
revealed in the plenitude of power, other men receive 
instruction therefrom, and are made aware of how great 
must be their own steadfastness and endurance under tests 
and trials.  For the Divine Educator must teach by word and 
also by deed, thus revealing to all the straight pathway of 
truth.  
     As to my station, it is that of the servant of &amp;Baha; 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the visible expression of servitude to the 
Threshold of the &amp;Abha Beauty.  
 
     27.  In cycles gone by, each one of the Manifestations of 
God hath had His own rank in the world of existence, and 
each hath represented a stage in the development of humanity.  
But the Manifestation of the Most Great Name--may 
my life be a sacrifice for His loved ones--was an expression 
of the coming of age, the maturing of man's inmost reality 
in this world of being.  For the sun is the source and well-spring 
of light and heat, the focal point of splendours, and 
it compriseth all the perfections that are made manifest by 
the other stars which have dawned upon the world.  Make 
thou an effort that thou mayest take thy place under the sun 
and receive an abundant share of its dazzling light.  In truth 
do I tell thee, once thou hast attained this station, thou shalt 
behold the saints bowing down their heads in all humility 
before Him.  Haste thou to life before death cometh; haste 
thou to the spring season before autumn draweth in; and 
 
+P57 
before illness striketh, haste thou to healing--that thou 
mayest become a physician of the spirit who, with the 
breaths of the Holy Spirit, healeth all manner of sickness in 
this famed and glorious age.  
 
     28.  O leaf upon the Tree of Life!  The Tree of Life, of 
which mention is made in the Bible, is &amp;Baha'u'llah, and the 
daughters of the Kingdom are the leaves upon that blessed 
Tree.  Then thank thou God that thou hast become related 
to that Tree, and that thou art flourishing, tender and 
fresh.  
     The gates of the Kingdom are opened wide, and every 
favoured soul is seated at the banquet table of the Lord, 
receiving his portion of that heavenly feast.  Praised be God, 
thou too art present at this table, taking thy share of the 
bountiful food of heaven.  Thou art serving the Kingdom, 
and art well acquainted with the sweet savours of the &amp;Abha 
Paradise.  
     Then strive thou with all thy might to guide the people, 
and eat thou of the bread that hath come down from 
heaven.  For this is the meaning of Christ's words:  `I am the 
living bread which came down from heaven ... he that 
eateth of this bread shall live forever.'+F1  
 
     29.  O thou who art captivated by the truth and 
magnetized by the Heavenly Kingdom!  Thy long letter 
hath come and it brought great joy, as it clearly betokened 
thy strenuous efforts and high purposes.  Praised be God, 
thou wishest well to men, and yearnest after the Kingdom 
of &amp;Baha, and art longing to see the human race press 
 
+F1 John 6:51, 58 
 
+P58 
forward.  It is my hope that because of these high ideals, 
these noble intimations of the heart, and these tidings of 
heaven, thou shalt become so luminous that down all the 
ages the light of thy love for God will shed its glory.  
     Thou hast described thyself as a student in the school 
of spiritual progress.  Fortunate art thou!  If these schools of 
progress lead to the university of heaven, then branches of 
knowledge will be developed whereby humanity will look 
upon the tablet of existence as a scroll endlessly unfolding; 
and all created things will be seen upon that scroll as letters 
and words.  Then will the different planes of meaning be 
learned, and then within every atom of the universe will be 
witnessed the signs of the oneness of God.  Then will man 
hear the cry of the Lord of the Kingdom, and behold the 
confirmations of the Holy Spirit coming to succour him.  
Then will he feel such bliss, such ecstasy, that the wide 
world with its vastness will no longer contain him, and he 
will set out for the Kingdom of God, and hurry along to 
the realm of the spirit.  For once a bird hath grown its wings, 
it remaineth on the ground no more, but soareth upward 
into high heaven--except for those birds that are tied by the 
leg, or those whose wings are broken, or mired down.  
     O thou seeker after truth!  The world of the Kingdom is 
one world.  The only difference is that spring returneth over 
and over again, and setteth up a great new commotion 
throughout all created things.  Then plain and hillside come 
alive, and trees turn delicately green, and leaves, blossoms 
and fruits come forth in beauty, infinite and tender.  Wherefore 
the dispensations of past ages are intimately connected 
with those that follow them:  indeed, they are one and the 
same, but as the world groweth, so doth the light, so doth 
the downpour of heavenly grace, and then the Day-Star 
shineth out in noonday splendour.  
 
+P59 
     O thou seeker after the Kingdom!  Every divine Manifestation 
is the very life of the world, and the skilled 
physician of each ailing soul.  The world of man is sick, and 
that competent Physician knoweth the cure, arising as He 
doth with teachings, counsels and admonishments that are 
the remedy for every pain, the healing balm to every 
wound.  It is certain that the wise physician can diagnose his 
patient's needs at any season, and apply the cure.  Wherefore, 
relate thou the Teachings of the &amp;Abha Beauty to the 
urgent needs of this present day, and thou wilt see that they 
provide an instant remedy for the ailing body of the world.  
Indeed, they are the elixir that bringeth eternal health.  
     The treatment ordered by wise physicians of the past, and 
by those that follow after, is not one and the same, rather 
doth it depend on what aileth the patient; and although the 
remedy may change, the aim is always to bring the patient 
back to health.  In the dispensations gone before, the feeble 
body of the world could not withstand a rigorous or 
powerful cure.  For this reason did Christ say:  `I have yet 
many things to say unto you, matters needing to be told, 
but ye cannot bear to hear them now.  Howbeit when that 
Comforting Spirit, Whom the Father will send, shall come, 
He will make plain unto you the truth.'+F1  
     Therefore, in this age of splendours, teachings once 
limited to the few are made available to all, that the mercy 
of the Lord may embrace both east and west, that the oneness 
of the world of humanity may appear in its full beauty, 
and that the dazzling rays of reality may flood the realm of 
the mind with light.  
     The descent of the New Jerusalem denoteth a heavenly 
Law, that Law which is the guarantor of human happiness 
and the effulgence of the world of God.  
 
+F1 cf. John 15:26; 16:12-13 
 
+P60 
     Emmanuel+F1 was indeed the Herald of the Second Coming 
of Christ, and a Summoner to the pathway of the Kingdom.  
It is evident that the Letter is a member of the Word, and 
this membership in the Word signifieth that the Letter is 
dependent for its value on the Word, that is, it deriveth its 
grace from the Word; it has a spiritual kinship with the 
Word, and is accounted an integral part of the Word.  The 
Apostles were even as Letters, and Christ was the essence of 
the Word Itself; and the meaning of the Word, which is 
grace everlasting, cast a splendour on those Letters.  Again, 
since the Letter is a member of the Word, it therefore, in its 
inner meaning, is consonant with the Word.  
     It is our hope that thou wilt in this day arise to promote 
that which Emmanuel foretold.  Know thou for a certainty 
that thou wilt succeed in this, for the confirmations of the 
Holy Spirit are continually descending, and the power of 
the Word will exert such an influence that the Letter shall 
become the mirror in which the splendid Sun--the Word 
Itself--will be reflected, and the grace and glory of the 
Word will illumine the whole earth.  
     As for the heavenly Jerusalem that hath come to rest on 
the summits of the world, and God's Holy of Holies, Whose 
banner is now lifted high, this comprehendeth within itself 
all the perfections, all the knowledge of the dispensations 
gone before.  Beyond this, it heraldeth the oneness of the 
children of men.  It is the flag of universal peace, the spirit of 
eternal life; it is the glory of the perfections of God, the 
circumambient grace of all existence, the ornament bedecking 
all created things, the source of inner quietude for 
all humankind.  
 
+F1 Regarding this Tablet Shoghi Effendi's secretary wrote on his 
+F1 behalf, on 9 May 1938, `...this obviously refers to the &amp;Bab, as the 
+F1 text shows clearly, and is in no way a reference to Swedenborg.'  
 
+P61 
     Direct thine attention to the holy Tablets; read thou the 
&amp;Ishraqat, &amp;Tajalliyyat, the Words of Paradise, the Glad 
Tidings, the &amp;Tarazat, the Most Holy Book.  Then wilt thou 
see that today these heavenly Teachings are the remedy for 
a sick and suffering world, and a healing balm for the sores 
on the body of mankind.  They are the spirit of life, the ark 
of salvation, the magnet to draw down eternal glory, the 
dynamic power to motivate the inner self of man.  
 
     30.  Existence is of two kinds:  one is the existence of 
God which is beyond the comprehension of man.  He, the 
invisible, the lofty and the incomprehensible, is preceded by 
no cause but rather is the Originator of the cause of causes.  
He, the Ancient, hath had no beginning and is the all-independent.  
The second kind of existence is the human 
existence.  It is a common existence, comprehensible to the 
human mind, is not ancient, is dependent and hath a cause 
to it.  The mortal substance does not become eternal and 
vice versa; the human kind does not become a Creator and 
vice versa.  The transformation of the innate substance is 
impossible.  
     In the world of existence--that which is comprehensible
--there are stages of mortality:  the first stage is the mineral 
world, next is the vegetable world.  In the latter world the 
mineral doth exist but with a distinctive feature which is the 
vegetable characteristic.  Likewise in the animal world, the 
mineral and vegetable characteristics are present and in 
addition the characteristics of the animal world are to be 
found, which are the faculties of hearing and of sight.  In the 
human world the characteristics of the mineral, vegetable 
and animal worlds are found and in addition that of the 
human kind, namely the intellectual characteristic, which 
 
+P62 
discovereth the realities of things and comprehendeth 
universal principles.  
     Man, therefore, on the plane of the contingent world is 
the most perfect being.  By man is meant the perfect individual, 
who is like unto a mirror in which the divine perfections 
are manifested and reflected.  But the sun doth not 
descend from the height of its sanctity to enter into the 
mirror, but when the latter is purified and turned towards 
the Sun of Truth, the perfections of this Sun, consisting of 
light and heat, are reflected and manifested in that mirror.  
These souls are the Divine Manifestations of God.  
 
     31.  O thou who art dear, and wise!  Thy letter dated 
27 May 1906 hath been received and its contents are most 
pleasing and have brought great joy.  
     Thou didst ask whether this Cause, this new and living 
Cause, could take the place of the dead religious rites and 
ceremonials of England; whether it would be possible, now 
that various groups have appeared, whose members are 
highly placed divines and theologians, far superior in their 
attainments to those of the past, for this new Cause so to 
impress the members of such groups as to gather them and 
the rest into its all-protecting shade.  
     O thou dear friend!  Know thou that the distinguished 
Individual of every age is endowed according to the perfections 
of His age.  That Individual who in past ages was set 
above His fellows was gifted according to the virtues of His 
time.  But in this age of splendours, this era of God, the pre-eminent 
Personage, the luminous Orb, the chosen Individual 
will shine out with such perfections and such power 
as ultimately to dazzle the minds of every community and 
group.  And since such a Personage is superior to all others in 
 
+P63 
spiritual perfections and heavenly attainments, and is indeed 
the focal centre of divine blessings and the pivot of the 
circle of light, He will encompass all others, and there is no 
doubt whatsoever that He will shine out with such power 
as to gather every soul into His sheltering shade.  
     When ye consider this matter with care, it will become 
apparent that this is according to a universal law, which one 
can find at work in all things:  the whole attracteth the part, 
and in the circle, the centre is the pivot of the compasses.  
Ponder thou upon the Spirit+F1:  because He was the focal 
centre of spiritual power, the wellspring of divine bounties, 
although at the beginning He gathered unto Himself only a 
very few souls, later on He was able, because of that all-subduing 
power that He had, to unite within the sheltering 
Tabernacle of Christendom all the differing sects.  Compare 
the present with the past, and see how great is the difference; 
thus canst thou arrive at truth and certitude.  
     The differences among the religions of the world are due 
to the varying types of minds.  So long as the powers of the 
mind are various, it is certain that men's judgements and 
opinions will differ one from another.  If, however, one 
single, universal perceptive power be introduced--a power 
encompassing all the rest--those differing opinions will 
merge, and a spiritual harmony and oneness will become 
apparent.  For example, when the Christ was made manifest, 
the minds of the various contemporary peoples, their views, 
their emotional attitudes, whether they were Romans, 
Greeks, Syrians, Israelites, or others, were at variance with 
one another.  But once His universal power was brought to 
bear, it gradually succeeded, after the lapse of three hundred 
years, in gathering together all those divergent minds under 
the protection, and within the governance, of one central 
 
+F1 Jesus 
 
+P64 
Point, all sharing the same spiritual emotions in their 
hearts.  
     To use a metaphor, when an army is placed under various 
commanders, each with his own strategy, they will obviously 
differ as to battle lines and movements of the troops; 
but once the Supreme Commander, who is thoroughly 
versed in the arts of war, taketh over, those other plans will 
disappear, for the supremely gifted general will bring the 
whole army under his control.  This is intended only as a 
metaphor, not an exact comparison.  Now if you should say 
that each and every one of those other generals is highly 
skilled in the military art, is thoroughly proficient and 
experienced, and therefore will not subject himself to the 
rule of one individual, no matter how indescribably great, 
your statement is untenable, for the above situation is 
demonstrably what cometh to pass, and there is no doubt 
thereof whatever.  
     Such is the case with the holy Manifestations of God.  
Such in particular is the case with the divine reality of the 
Most Great Name, the &amp;Abha Beauty.  When once He 
standeth revealed unto the assembled peoples of the world 
and appeareth with such comeliness, such enchantments--
alluring as a Joseph in the Egypt of the spirit--He enslaveth 
all the lovers on earth.  
     As to those souls who are born into this life as ethereal 
and radiant entities and yet, on account of their handicaps 
and trials, are deprived of great and real advantages, and 
leave the world without having lived to the full--certainly 
this is a cause for grieving.  This is the reason why the 
universal Manifestations of God unveil Their countenances 
to man, and endure every calamity and sore affliction, and 
lay down Their lives as a ransom; it is to make these very 
people, the ready ones, the ones who have capacity, to 
 
+P65 
become dawning points of light, and to bestow upon them 
the life that fadeth never.  This is the true sacrifice:  the 
offering of oneself, even as did Christ, as a ransom for the 
life of the world.  
     As to the influence of holy Beings and the continuance of 
Their grace to mankind after They have put away Their 
human form, this is, to &amp;Baha'is, an indisputable fact.  Indeed, 
the flooding grace, the streaming splendours of the holy 
Manifestations appear after Their ascension from this world.  
The exaltation of the Word, the revelation of the power of 
God, the conversion of God-fearing souls, the bestowal of 
everlasting life--it was following the Messiah's martyrdom 
that all these were increased and intensified.  In the same 
way, ever since the ascension of the Blessed Beauty, the 
bestowals have been more abundant, the spreading light is 
brighter, the tokens of the Lord's might are more powerful, 
the influence of the Word is much stronger, and it will not 
be long before the motion, the heat, the brilliance, the 
blessings of the Sun of His reality will encompass all the 
earth.  
     Grieve thou not over the slow advance of the &amp;Baha'i 
Cause in that land.  This is but the early dawn.  Consider 
how, with the Cause of Christ, three hundred years had to 
go by, before its great influence was made manifest.  Today, 
not sixty years from its birth, the light of this Faith hath 
been shed around the planet.  
     Regarding the health society of which thou art a member, 
once it cometh under the shelter of this Faith its 
influence shall increase a hundredfold.  
     Thou dost observe that love among the &amp;Baha'is is very 
great, and that love is the main thing.  Just as love's power 
hath been developed to such a high degree among the 
&amp;Baha'is, and is far greater than among the people of other 
 
+P66 
religions, so is it with all else as well; for love is the ground 
of all things.  
     Regarding the translation of the Books and Tablets of the 
Blessed Beauty, erelong will translations be made into 
every tongue, with power, clarity and grace.  At such time 
as they are translated, conformably to the originals, and 
with power and grace of style, the splendours of their inner 
meanings will be shed abroad, and will illumine the eyes of 
all mankind.  Do thy very best to ensure that the translation 
is in conformity with the original.  
     The Blessed Beauty proceeded to Haifa on many occasions.  
Thou beheldest Him there, but thou didst not know 
Him at that time.  It is my hope that thou wilt attain unto 
the true meeting with Him, which is to behold Him with 
the inner, not the outer eye.  
     The essence of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Teaching is all-embracing 
love, for love includeth every excellence of humankind.  It 
causeth every soul to go forward.  It bestoweth on each one, 
for a heritage, immortal life.  Erelong shalt thou bear witness 
that His celestial Teachings, the very glory of reality 
itself, shall light up the skies of the world.  
     The brief prayer which thou didst write at the close of 
thy letter was indeed original, touching and beautiful.  
Recite thou this prayer at all times.  
 
     32.  O ye handmaids of the Lord!  In this century--the 
century of the Almighty Lord--the Day-Star of the Realms 
above, the Light of Truth, shineth in its meridian splendour 
and its rays illuminate all regions.  For this is the age of the 
Ancient Beauty, the day of the revelation of the might and 
power of the Most Great Name--may my life be offered up 
as a sacrifice for His loved ones.  
 
+P67 
     In the ages to come, though the Cause of God may rise 
and grow a hundredfold and the shade of the &amp;Sadratu'l-Muntaha 
shelter all mankind, yet this present century shall 
stand unrivalled, for it hath witnessed the breaking of that 
Morn and the rising of that Sun.  This century is, verily, the 
source of His Light and the dayspring of His Revelation.  
Future ages and generations shall behold the diffusion of its 
radiance and the manifestations of its signs.  
     Wherefore, exert yourselves, haply ye may obtain your 
full share and portion of His bestowals.  
 
     33.  O servant of God!  We have noted what thou didst 
write to &amp;Jinab-i-Ibn-Abhar, and thy question regarding the 
verse:  `Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from 
God, ere the expiration of a full thousand years, such a man 
is assuredly a lying impostor.'  
     The meaning of this is that any individual who, before 
the expiry of a full thousand years--years known and clearly 
established by common usage and requiring no interpretation--
should lay claim to a Revelation direct from God, 
even though he should reveal certain signs, that man is 
assuredly false and an impostor.  
     This is not a reference to the Universal Manifestation, for 
it is clearly set forth in the Holy Writings that centuries, 
nay thousands of years, must pass on to completion, before a 
Manifestation like unto this Manifestation shall appear again.  
     It is possible, however, that after the completion of a full 
thousand years, certain Holy Beings will be empowered to 
deliver a Revelation:  this, however, will not be through a 
Universal Manifestation.  Wherefore every day of the cycle 
of the Blessed Beauty is in reality equal to one year, and 
every year of it is equal to a thousand years.  
 
+P68 
     Consider, for example, the sun:  its transit from one 
zodiacal sign to the next occurreth within a short period of 
time, yet only after a long period doth it attain the plenitude 
of its resplendency, its heat and glory, in the sign of Leo.  It 
must first complete one full revolution through the other 
constellations before it will enter the sign of Leo again, to 
blaze out in its full splendour.  In its other stations, it 
revealeth not the fullness of its heat and light.  
     The substance is, that prior to the completion of a 
thousand years, no individual may presume to breathe a 
word.  All must consider themselves to be of the order of 
subjects, submissive and obedient to the commandments of 
God and the laws of the House of Justice.  Should any 
deviate by so much as a needle's point from the decrees of 
the Universal House of Justice, or falter in his compliance 
therewith, then is he of the outcast and rejected.  
     As to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty--the times of the 
Greatest Name--this is not limited to a thousand or two 
thousand years....  
     When it is said that the period of a thousand years 
beginneth with the Manifestation of the Blessed Beauty and 
every day thereof is a thousand years, the intent is a reference 
to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty, which in this context 
will extend over many ages into the unborn reaches of time.  
 
     34.  O thou who art serving the world of humanity!  
Thy letter was received and from its contents we felt 
exceedingly glad.  It was a decisive proof and a brilliant 
evidence.  It is appropriate and befitting that in this illumined 
age--the age of the progress of the world of humanity--we 
should be self-sacrificing and should serve the human race.  
Every universal cause is divine and every particular one is 
 
+P69 
temporal.  The principles of the divine Manifestations of 
God were, therefore, all-universal and all-inclusive.  
     Every imperfect soul is self-centred and thinketh only of 
his own good.  But as his thoughts expand a little he will 
begin to think of the welfare and comfort of his family.  If 
his ideas still more widen, his concern will be the felicity of 
his fellow citizens; and if still they widen, he will be 
thinking of the glory of his land and of his race.  But when 
ideas and views reach the utmost degree of expansion and 
attain the stage of perfection, then will he be interested in 
the exaltation of humankind.  He will then be the well-wisher 
of all men and the seeker of the weal and prosperity 
of all lands.  This is indicative of perfection.  
     Thus, the divine Manifestations of God had a universal 
and all-inclusive conception.  They endeavoured for the sake 
of everyone's life and engaged in the service of universal 
education.  The area of their aims was not limited--nay, 
rather, it was wide and all-inclusive.  
     Therefore, ye must also be thinking of everyone, so that 
mankind may be educated, character moderated and this 
world may turn into a Garden of Eden.  
     Love ye all religions and all races with a love that is true 
and sincere and show that love through deeds and not 
through the tongue; for the latter hath no importance, as 
the majority of men are, in speech, well-wishers, while 
action is the best.  
 
     35.  O army of God!  A letter signed jointly by all of 
you hath been received.  It was most eloquent and full of 
flavour, and reading it was a delight.  
     Ye had written of the fasting month.  Fortunate are ye to 
have obeyed the commandment of God, and kept this fast 
 
+P70 
during the holy season.  For this material fast is an outer 
token of the spiritual fast; it is a symbol of self-restraint, the 
withholding of oneself from all appetites of the self, taking 
on the characteristics of the spirit, being carried away by the 
breathings of heaven and catching fire from the love of God.  
     Your letter also betokened your unity and the closeness 
of your hearts.  It is my hope that the west, through the 
boundless grace that God is pouring down in this new era, 
will become the east, the dawning-point of the Sun of 
Truth, and western believers the daysprings of light, and 
manifestors of the signs of God; that they will be guarded 
from the doubts of the heedless and will stay firm and unmoveable 
in the Covenant and Testament; that they will 
toil by day and by night until they awaken those who 
sleep, and make mindful those who are unaware, and bring 
in the outcast to be intimates of the inner circle, and bestow 
upon the destitute their portion of eternal grace.  Let them 
be heralds of the Kingdom, and call out to the denizens of this 
nether world, and summon them to enter the realm on high.  
     O army of God!  Today, in this world, every people is 
wandering astray in its own desert, moving here and there 
according to the dictates of its fancies and whims, pursuing 
its own particular caprice.  Amongst all the teeming masses 
of the earth, only this community of the Most Great Name 
is free and clear of human schemes and hath no selfish 
purpose to promote.  Alone amongst them all, this people 
hath arisen with aims purified of self, following the Teachings 
of God, most eagerly toiling and striving toward a 
single goal:  to turn this nether dust into high heaven, to 
make of this world a mirror for the Kingdom, to change 
this world into a different world, and cause all humankind 
to adopt the ways of righteousness and a new manner of life.  
     O army of God!  Through the protection and help 
 
+P71 
vouchsafed by the Blessed Beauty--may my life be a 
sacrifice to His loved ones--ye must conduct yourselves 
in such a manner that ye may stand out distinguished and 
brilliant as the sun among other souls.  Should any one of 
you enter a city, he should become a centre of attraction 
by reason of his sincerity, his faithfulness and love, his 
honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and loving-kindness 
towards all the peoples of the world, so that the people of 
that city may cry out and say:  `This man is unquestionably 
a &amp;Baha'i, for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his 
morals, his nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of 
the &amp;Baha'is.'  Not until ye attain this station can ye be said 
to have been faithful to the Covenant and Testament of 
God.  For He hath, through irrefutable Texts, entered into 
a binding Covenant with us all, requiring us to act in 
accordance with His sacred instructions and counsels.  
     O army of God!  The time hath come for the effects and 
perfections of the Most Great Name to be made manifest in 
this excellent age, so as to establish, beyond any doubt, that 
this era is the era of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and this age is distinguished 
above all other ages.  
     O army of God!  Whensoever ye behold a person 
whose entire attention is directed toward the Cause of God; 
whose only aim is this, to make the Word of God to take 
effect; who, day and night, with pure intent, is rendering 
service to the Cause; from whose behaviour not the slightest 
trace of egotism or private motives is discerned--who, 
rather, wandereth distracted in the wilderness of the love of 
God, and drinketh only from the cup of the knowledge of 
God, and is utterly engrossed in spreading the sweet savours 
of God, and is enamoured of the holy verses of the Kingdom 
of God--know ye for a certainty that this individual will be 
supported and reinforced by heaven; that like unto the 
 
+P72 
morning star, he will forever gleam brightly out of the skies 
of eternal grace.  But if he show the slightest taint of selfish 
desires and self love, his efforts will lead to nothing and he 
will be destroyed and left hopeless at the last.  
     O army of God!  Praise be to God, &amp;Baha'u'llah hath 
lifted the chains from off the necks of humankind, and hath 
set man free from all that trammelled him, and told him:  
Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch; be 
ye compassionate and kind to all the human race.  Deal ye 
with strangers the same as with friends, cherish ye others 
just as ye would your own.  See foes as friends; see demons 
as angels; give to the tyrant the same great love ye show the 
loyal and true, and even as gazelles from the scented cities of 
&amp;Khata and &amp;Khutan+F1 offer up sweet musk to the ravening 
wolf.  Be ye a refuge to the fearful; bring ye rest and peace 
to the disturbed; make ye a provision for the destitute; be a 
treasury of riches for the poor; be a healing medicine for 
those who suffer pain; be ye doctor and nurse to the ailing; 
promote ye friendship, and honour, and conciliation, and 
devotion to God, in this world of non-existence.  
     O army of God!  Make ye a mighty effort:  perchance ye 
can flood this earth with light, that this mud hut, the world, 
may become the &amp;Abha Paradise.  The dark hath taken over, 
and the brute traits prevail.  This world of man is now an 
arena for wild beasts, a field where the ignorant, the heedless, 
seize their chance.  The souls of men are ravening wolves 
and animals with blinded eyes, they are either deadly poison 
or useless weeds--all except for a very few who indeed do 
nurture altruistic aims and plans for the well-being of their 
fellow men:  but ye must in this matter--that is, the serving 
of humankind--lay down your very lives, and as ye yield 
yourselves, rejoice.  
 
+F1 Cities in China celebrated for their musk-producing animals.  
 
+P73 
     O army of God!  The Exalted One, the &amp;Bab, gave up 
His life.  The Blessed Perfection gave up a hundred lives at 
every breath.  He bore calamities.  He suffered anguish.  He 
was imprisoned.  He was chained.  He was made homeless 
and was banished to distant lands.  Finally, then, He lived 
out His days in the Most Great Prison.  Likewise, a great 
multitude of the lovers of God who followed this path have 
tasted the honey of martyrdom and they gave up everything
--life, possessions, kindred--all they had.  How many 
homes were reduced to rubble; how many dwellings were 
broken into and pillaged; how many a noble building went 
to the ground; how many a palace was battered into a 
tomb.  And all this came about that humankind might be 
illumined, that ignorance might yield to knowledge, that 
men of earth might become men of heaven, that discord 
and dissension might be torn out by the roots, and the 
Kingdom of Peace become established over all the world.  
Strive ye now that this bounty become manifest, and this 
best-beloved of all hopes be realized in splendour throughout 
the community of man.  
     O army of God!  Beware lest ye harm any soul, or make 
any heart to sorrow; lest ye wound any man with your 
words, be he known to you or a stranger, be he friend or 
foe.  Pray ye for all; ask ye that all be blessed, all be forgiven.  
Beware, beware, lest any of you seek vengeance, even 
against one who is thirsting for your blood.  Beware, 
beware, lest ye offend the feelings of another, even though 
he be an evil-doer, and he wish you ill.  Look ye not upon 
the creatures, turn ye to their Creator.  See ye not the never-yielding 
people, see but the Lord of Hosts.  Gaze ye not 
down upon the dust, gaze upward at the shining sun, which 
hath caused every patch of darksome earth to glow with 
light.  
 
+P74 
     O army of God!  When calamity striketh, be ye patient 
and composed.  However afflictive your sufferings may be, 
stay ye undisturbed, and with perfect confidence in the 
abounding grace of God, brave ye the tempest of tribulations 
and fiery ordeals.  
     Last year a number of the unfaithful, both from within 
and from without, both known to us and strangers, took 
before the &amp;Sultan of Turkey slanderous charges against 
these homeless exiles, bringing against us grave accusations 
with no basis in fact.  The Government, conformably with 
prudence, determined to look into these charges, and dispatched 
a Commission of Investigation to this city.  It is 
obvious what an opportunity this afforded our ill-wishers, 
and what a storm they unleashed, all this beyond description 
by tongue or pen.  Only one who witnessed it could 
know what a turmoil they created and what an earthquake 
of anguish was the result.  And notwithstanding this, the 
response was to depend utterly upon God, and to remain 
composed, confident, long-suffering, undisturbed, to such a 
degree that a person knowing nothing of the situation 
would have thought us easy of heart and mind, perfectly 
happy, thriving and at peace.  
     Then it came about that the accusers themselves, those 
who had made the defamatory charges against us, joined 
with the members of the Commission to investigate the 
accusations, so that plaintiffs, witnesses and judge were all 
one and the same, and the conclusion was foregone.  Nevertheless, 
to be fair, it must be stated that up to now His 
Majesty the &amp;Sultan of Turkey hath paid no heed to these 
false charges, this defamation, these fables and traducements, 
and hath acted with justice....  
     O Thou Provider!  Thou hast breathed over the friends 
in the West the sweet fragrance of the Holy Spirit, and with 
 
+P75 
the light of divine guidance Thou hast lit up the western 
sky.  Thou hast made those who were once remote to draw 
near unto Thyself; Thou hast turned strangers into loving 
friends; Thou hast awakened those who slept; Thou hast 
made the heedless mindful.  
     O Thou Provider!  Assist Thou these noble friends to win 
Thy good pleasure, and make them well-wishers of stranger 
and friend alike.  Bring them into the world that abideth 
forever; grant them a portion of heavenly grace; cause 
them to be true &amp;Baha'is, sincerely of God; save them from 
outward semblances, and establish them firmly in the truth.  
Make them signs and tokens of the Kingdom, luminous 
stars above the horizons of this nether life.  Make them to be 
a comfort and a solace to humankind and servants to the 
peace of the world.  Exhilarate them with the wine of Thy 
counsel, and grant that all of them may tread the path of 
Thy commandments.  
     O Thou Provider!  The dearest wish of this servant of 
Thy Threshold is to behold the friends of east and west in 
close embrace; to see all the members of human society 
gathered with love in a single great assemblage, even as 
individual drops of water collected in one mighty sea; to 
behold them all as birds in one garden of roses, as pearls of 
one ocean, as leaves of one tree, as rays of one sun.  
     Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou art the 
God of strength, the Omnipotent, the All-Seeing.  
 
     36.  O ye two favoured handmaids of the Lord!  The 
letter from Mother Beecher hath been received, and truly 
it spoke for you both, wherefore I address the two of you 
together.  This seemeth very good to me, for ye two pure 
beings are even as a single precious gem, ye are two boughs 
 
+P76 
branched from a single tree; ye both adore the same 
Beloved, ye both are longing for the same resplendent Sun.  
     My hope is that all the handmaids of God in that region 
will unite like unto the waves of one unending sea; for 
although blown about as the wind listeth, these are separate 
in themselves, yet in truth are they all at one with the 
boundless deep.  
     How good it is if the friends be as close as sheaves of 
light, if they stand together side by side in a firm unbroken 
line.  For now have the rays of reality from the Sun of the 
world of existence, united in adoration all the worshippers 
of this light; and these rays have, through infinite grace, 
gathered all peoples together within this wide-spreading 
shelter; therefore must all souls become as one soul, and all 
hearts as one heart.  Let all be set free from the multiple 
identities that were born of passion and desire, and in the 
oneness of their love for God find a new way of life.  
     O ye two handmaids of God!  Now is the time for you to 
become as bounteous cups that are filled to overflowing, 
and even as the reviving gusts that blow from the &amp;Abha 
Paradise, to scatter the fragrance of musk across that land.  
Release yourselves from this world's life, and at every stage 
long ye for non-existence; for when the ray returneth to 
the sun, it is wiped out, and when the drop cometh to the 
sea, it vanisheth, and when the true lover findeth his 
Beloved, he yieldeth up his soul.  
     Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he 
is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of 
sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of 
the living God may then shine forth.  The martyr's field is 
the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of 
eternity may be upraised.  Do all ye can to become wholly 
weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of 
 
+P77 
Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of 
servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all 
created things.  This is boundless grace; this is the highest 
sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not.  All else save this is 
at the last but manifest perdition and great loss.  
     Praise be to God, the gate of boundless grace is opened 
wide, the heavenly table is set, the servants of the Merciful 
and His handmaids are present at the feast.  Strive ye to 
receive your share of this eternal food, so that ye shall be 
loved and cherished in this world and the next.  
 
     37.  O ye dear friends of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  A blessed letter 
hath been received from you, telling of the election of a 
Spiritual Assembly.  It hath rejoiced my heart to know that, 
God be praised, the friends in that area, with absolute unity, 
fellowship and love, have held this new election and were 
successful in voting for souls who are sanctified, are 
favoured at the Holy Threshold and are well known 
amongst the friends to be staunch and firm in the Covenant.  
     Now must those elected representatives arise to serve 
with spirituality and joy, with purity of intent, with strong 
attraction to the fragrances of the Almighty, and well 
supported by the Holy Spirit.  Let them raise up the banner 
of guidance, and as soldiers of the Company on high, let 
them exalt God's Word, spread abroad His sweet savours, 
educate the souls of men, and promote the Most Great 
Peace.  
     Truly, blessed souls have been elected.  The moment I 
read their names, I felt a thrill of spiritual joy to know that, 
praised be God, persons have been raised up in that country 
who are servants of the Kingdom, and ready to lay down 
their lives for Him Who hath neither likeness nor peer.  
 
+P78 
     O ye dear friends of mine!  Light up this Assembly with 
the splendour of God's love.  Make it ring out with the 
joyous music of the hallowed spheres, make it thrive on 
those foods that are served at the Lord's Supper, at the 
heavenly banquet table of God.  Come ye together in gladness 
unalloyed, and at the beginning of the meeting, recite 
ye this prayer:  
 
          O Thou Lord of the Kingdom!  Though our bodies 
     be gathered here together, yet our spellbound hearts are 
     carried away by Thy love, and yet are we transported by 
     the rays of Thy resplendent face.  Weak though we be, 
     we await the revelations of Thy might and power.  Poor 
     though we be, with neither goods nor means, still take 
     we riches from the treasures of Thy Kingdom.  Drops 
     though we be, still do we draw from out Thy ocean 
     deeps.  Motes though we be, still do we gleam in the 
     glory of Thy splendid Sun.  
          O Thou our Provider!  Send down Thine aid, that 
     each one gathered here may become a lighted candle, 
     each one a centre of attraction, each one a summoner to 
     Thy heavenly realms, till at last we make this nether 
     world the mirror image of Thy Paradise.  
 
     O ye dear friends of mine!  It is incumbent upon the 
assemblies of those regions to be connected one with 
another and to correspond with one another, and also to 
communicate with the assemblies of the east, thus to become 
agencies for union throughout the world.  
     O ye spiritual friends!  Such must be your constancy that 
should the evil-wishers put every believer to death and only 
one remain, that one, singly and alone, will withstand all 
the peoples of the earth, and will go on scattering far and 
 
+P79 
wide the sweet and holy fragrances of God.  Wherefore, 
should any fearsome news, any word of terrifying events, 
reach you from the Holy Land, see to it that ye waver not, 
be ye not stricken by grief, be ye not shaken.  Rather, rise ye 
up instantly, with iron resolve, and serve ye the Kingdom 
of God.  
     This Servant of the Lord's Threshold hath been in peril 
at all times.  He is in peril now.  At no time have I had any 
hope of safety, and my dearest wish is this:  to drink of the 
martyr's bounteous and brim-full cup, and die on the field 
of sacrifice, delighting in that wine which is the most 
precious of God's gifts.  This is my highest hope, this my 
most vehement desire.  
     We hear that the Tablets of &amp;Ishraqat (Splendours), 
&amp;Tarazat (Ornaments), &amp;Bisharat (Glad Tidings), &amp;Tajalliyyat 
(Effulgences), and &amp;Kalimat (Words of Paradise) have been 
translated and published in those regions.  In these Tablets 
will ye have a model of how to be and how to live.  
 
     38.  O handmaid of God, who tremblest even as a fresh 
and tender branch in the winds of the love of God!  I have 
read thy letter, which telleth of thine abundant love, thine 
intense devotion, and of thy being occupied with the 
remembrance of thy Lord.  
     Depend thou upon God.  Forsake thine own will and 
cling to His, set aside thine own desires and lay hold of His, 
that thou mayest become an example, holy, spiritual, and of 
the Kingdom, unto His handmaids.  
     Know thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of &amp;Baha, 
women are accounted the same as men, and God hath 
created all humankind in His own image, and after His own 
likeness.  That is, men and women alike are the revealers of 
 
+P80 
His names and attributes, and from the spiritual viewpoint 
there is no difference between them.  Whosoever draweth 
nearer to God, that one is the most favoured, whether man 
or woman.  How many a handmaid, ardent and devoted, 
hath, within the sheltering shade of &amp;Baha, proved superior 
to the men, and surpassed the famous of the earth.  
     The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit 
text of the Law of God, is confined to men; this for a 
wisdom of the Lord God's, which will erelong be made 
manifest as clearly as the sun at high noon.  
     As to you, O ye other handmaids who are enamoured of 
the heavenly fragrances, arrange ye holy gatherings, and 
found ye Spiritual Assemblies, for these are the basis for 
spreading the sweet savours of God, exalting His Word, 
uplifting the lamp of His grace, promulgating His religion 
and promoting His Teachings, and what bounty is there 
greater than this?  These Spiritual Assemblies are aided by 
the Spirit of God.  Their defender is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Over 
them He spreadeth His wings.  What bounty is there 
greater than this?  These Spiritual Assemblies are shining 
lamps and heavenly gardens, from which the fragrances of 
holiness are diffused over all regions, and the lights of 
knowledge are shed abroad over all created things.  From 
them the spirit of life streameth in every direction.  They, 
indeed, are the potent sources of the progress of man, at all 
times and under all conditions.  What bounty is there 
greater than this?  
 
     39.  O handmaid of God!  Thy letter hath been received, 
bringing its news that an Assembly hath been 
established in that city.  
     Look ye not upon the fewness of thy numbers, rather, 
 
+P81 
seek ye out hearts that are pure.  One consecrated soul is 
preferable to a thousand other souls.  If a small number of 
people gather lovingly together, with absolute purity and 
sanctity, with their hearts free of the world, experiencing 
the emotions of the Kingdom and the powerful magnetic 
forces of the Divine, and being at one in their happy fellowship, 
that gathering will exert its influence over all the earth.  
The nature of that band of people, the words they speak, 
the deeds they do, will unleash the bestowals of Heaven, 
and provide a foretaste of eternal bliss.  The hosts of the 
Company on high will defend them, and the angels of the 
&amp;Abha Paradise, in continuous succession, will come down 
to their aid.  
     The meaning of `angels' is the confirmations of God and 
His celestial powers.  Likewise angels are blessed beings who 
have severed all ties with this nether world, have been 
released from the chains of self and the desires of the flesh, 
and anchored their hearts to the heavenly realms of the 
Lord.  These are of the Kingdom, heavenly; these are of 
God, spiritual; these are revealers of God's abounding 
grace; these are dawning-points of His spiritual bestowals.  
     O handmaid of God!  Praise be to Him, thy dear husband 
hath perceived the sweet scents that blow from the gardens 
of heaven.  Now, as day followeth day, must thou, through 
the love of God, and thine own good actions, draw him 
ever closer to the Faith.  
     Those were indeed dire events in San Francisco.+F1  Disasters 
of this kind should serve to awaken the people, and 
diminish the love of their hearts for this inconstant world.  
It is in this nether world that such tragic things take place:  
this is the cup that yieldeth bitter wine.  
 
+F1 The earthquake of 1906 
 
+P82 
     40.  O ye whom &amp;Abdu'l-Baha loveth!  I have read your 
reports with great joy; they are of a nature to cheer and 
refresh the heart and gladden the soul.  If this Assembly, 
through the holy breathings of the All-Merciful and His 
divine confirmations, endure and remain fixed and firm, it 
shall produce notable results and it shall succeed in enterprises 
of great moment.  
     The Spiritual Assemblies to be established in this Age of 
God, this holy century, have, it is indisputable, had neither 
peer nor likeness in the cycles gone before.  For those 
assemblages that wielded power were based on the support 
of mighty leaders of men, while these Assemblies are based 
on the support of the Beauty of &amp;Abha.  The defenders and 
patrons of those other assemblages were either a prince, or a 
king, or a chief priest, or the mass of the people.  But these 
Spiritual Assemblies have for their defender, their supporter, 
their helper, their inspirer, the omnipotent Lord.  
     Look ye not upon the present, fix your gaze upon the 
times to come.  In the beginning, how small is the seed, yet 
in the end it is a mighty tree.  Look ye not upon the seed, 
look ye upon the tree, and its blossoms, and its leaves and 
its fruits.  Consider the days of Christ, when none but a 
small band followed Him; then observe what a mighty tree 
that seed became, behold ye its fruitage.  And now shall 
come to pass even greater things than these, for this is the 
summons of the Lord of Hosts, this is the trumpet-call of 
the living Lord, this is the anthem of world peace, this is the 
standard of righteousness and trust and understanding 
raised up among all the variegated peoples of the globe; this 
is the splendour of the Sun of Truth, this is the holiness of 
the spirit of God Himself.  This most powerful of dispensations 
will encompass all the earth, and beneath its banner 
will all peoples gather and be sheltered together.  Know 
 
+P83 
then the vital import of this tiny seed that the true Husbandman 
hath, with the hands of His mercy, sown in the 
ploughed fields of the Lord, and watered with the rain of 
bestowals and bounties and is now nurturing in the heat and 
light of the Day-Star of Truth.  
     Wherefore, O ye loved ones of God, offer up thanks unto 
Him, since He hath made you the object of such bounties, 
and the recipients of such gifts.  Blessed are ye, glad tidings 
to you, for this abounding grace.  
 
     41.  O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant, and 
staunch!  The letter which thou didst write ... hath been 
shown to me, and the opinions expressed therein were most 
commendable.  It is incumbent upon the Spiritual Consultative 
Assembly of New York to be in complete agreement 
with that of Chicago, and for these two assemblies of 
consultation jointly to approve whatever they consider 
suitable for publication and distribution.  Following that, 
let them send one copy to &amp;Akka, so that it may also be 
approved from here, after which the material will be 
returned to be published and circulated.  
     The question of co-ordinating and unifying the two 
Spiritual Assemblies, that of Chicago and of New York, is 
of the utmost importance, and once a Spiritual Assembly is 
duly formed in Washington, these two Assemblies should 
also establish ties of unity with that Assembly.  To sum it up, 
it is the desire of the Lord God that the loved ones of God 
and the handmaids of the Merciful in the West should come 
closer together in harmony and unity as day followeth day, 
and until this is accomplished, the work will never go 
forward.  The Spiritual Assemblies are collectively the most 
effective of all instruments for establishing unity and 
 
+P84 
harmony.  This matter is of the utmost importance; this is the 
magnet that draweth down the confirmations of God.  If 
once the beauty of the unity of the friends--this Divine 
Beloved--be decked in the adornments of the &amp;Abha Kingdom, 
it is certain that within a very short time those countries 
will become the Paradise of the All-Glorious, and that 
out of the west the splendours of unity will cast their 
bright rays over all the earth.  
     We are striving with heart and soul, resting neither day 
nor night, seeking not a moment's ease, to make this world 
of man the mirror of the unity of God.  Then how much 
more must the beloved of the Lord reflect that unity?  And 
this cherished hope, this yearning wish of ours will be 
visibly fulfilled only on the day when the true friends of 
God arise to carry out the Teachings of the &amp;Abha Beauty--
may my life be a ransom for His lovers!  One amongst His 
Teachings is this, that love and good faith must so dominate 
the human heart that men will regard the stranger as a 
familiar friend, the malefactor as one of their own, the alien 
even as a loved one, the enemy as a companion dear and 
close.  Who killeth them, him will they call a bestower of 
life; who turneth away from them, him will they regard as 
turning towards them; who denieth their message, him will 
they consider as one acknowledging its truth.  The meaning 
is that they must treat all humankind even as they treat 
their sympathizers, their fellow-believers, their loved ones 
and familiar friends.  
     Should such a torch light up the world community, ye 
will find that the whole earth is sending forth a fragrance, 
that it hath become a delightsome paradise, and the face of 
it the image of high heaven.  Then will the whole world be 
one native land, its diverse peoples one single kind, the 
nations of both east and west one household.  
 
+P85 
     It is my hope that such a day will come, that such a 
splendour will shine forth, that such a vision will be unveiled 
in its full beauty.  
 
     42.  O ye co-workers who are supported by armies 
from the realm of the All-Glorious!  Blessed are ye, for ye 
have come together in the sheltering shade of the Word of 
God, and have found a refuge in the cave of His Covenant; 
ye have brought peace to your hearts by making your home 
in the &amp;Abha Paradise, and are lulled by the gentle winds that 
blow from their source in His loving-kindness; ye have 
arisen to serve the Cause of God and to spread His religion 
far and wide, to promote His Word and to raise high the 
banners of holiness throughout all those regions.  
     By the life of &amp;Baha!  Verily will the consummate power 
of the Divine Reality breathe into you the bounties of the 
Holy Spirit, and aid you to perform an exploit whose like 
the eye of creation hath never looked upon.  
     O ye League of the Covenant!  Verily the &amp;Abha Beauty 
made a promise to the beloved who are steadfast in the 
Covenant, that He would reinforce their strivings with the 
strongest of supports, and succour them with His triumphant 
might.  Erelong shall ye see that your illumined assemblage 
hath left conspicuous signs and tokens in the hearts and 
souls of men.  Hold ye fast to the hem of God's garment, 
and direct all your efforts toward furthering His Covenant, 
and burning ever more brightly with the fire of His love, 
that your hearts may leap for joy in the breathings of 
servitude which well out from the breast of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Rally your hearts, make firm your steps, trust in the everlasting 
bounties that will be shed upon you, one following 
another from the Kingdom of &amp;Abha.  Whensoever ye 
 
+P86 
gather in that radiant assemblage, know ye that the splendours 
of &amp;Baha are shining over you.  It behoveth you to seek 
agreement and to be united; it behoveth you to be in close 
communion one with the other, at one both in body and 
soul, till ye match the Pleiades or a string of lustrous pearls.  
Thus will ye be solidly established; thus will your words prevail, 
your star shine out, and your hearts be comforted....  
     Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this 
prayer with a heart throbbing with the love of God and a 
tongue purified from all but His remembrance, that the 
All-Powerful may graciously aid you to achieve supreme 
victory:  
 
          O God, my God!  We are servants of Thine that 
     have turned with devotion to Thy Holy Face, that have 
     detached ourselves from all besides Thee in this glorious 
     Day.  We have gathered in this Spiritual Assembly, united 
     in our views and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized 
     to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind.  O Lord, our God!  
     Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the Standards 
     of Thine exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy 
     mighty Covenant, O Thou our Lord Most High, manifestations 
     of Thy Divine Unity in Thine &amp;Abha Kingdom, 
     and resplendent stars shining upon all regions.  Lord!  Aid 
     us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous 
     Grace, streams flowing from Thine all-glorious 
     Heights, goodly fruits upon the Tree of Thy heavenly 
     Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty 
     in Thy celestial Vineyard.  O God!  Make our souls 
     dependent upon the Verses of Thy Divine Unity, our 
     hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace, that 
     we may unite even as the waves of one sea and become 
     merged together as the rays of Thine effulgent Light; 
 
+P87 
     that our thoughts, our views, our feelings may become 
     as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union throughout 
     the world.  Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the 
     Bestower, the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate.  
 
     43.  The prime requisites for them that take counsel 
together are purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment 
from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, 
humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience 
and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted 
Threshold.  Should they be graciously aided to acquire these 
attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of &amp;Baha shall 
be vouchsafed to them.  
 
     44.  The members thereof+F1 must take counsel together 
in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may 
arise.  This can be attained when every member expresseth 
with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth 
his argument.  Should anyone oppose, he must on no 
account feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can 
the right way be revealed.  The shining spark of truth 
cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions.  If 
after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously well and 
good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should 
arise, a majority of voices must prevail.  
 
     45.  The first condition is absolute love and harmony 
amongst the members of the assembly.  They must be 
 
+F1 Of a Spiritual Assembly 
 
+P88 
wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves 
the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, 
the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of 
one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden.  
Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, 
that gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly 
be brought to naught.  The second condition is that the members 
of the assembly should unitedly elect a chairman and lay 
down guide-lines and by-laws for their meetings and 
discussions.  The chairman should have charge of such rules 
and regulations and protect and enforce them; the other 
members should be submissive, and refrain from conversing 
on superfluous and extraneous matters.  They must, when 
coming together, turn their faces to the Kingdom on 
high and ask aid from the Realm of Glory.  They must then 
proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care 
and moderation to express their views.  They must in every 
matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own 
opinion, for stubbornness and persistence in one's views will 
lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will 
remain hidden.  The honoured members must with all 
freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise 
permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, 
he must with moderation set forth the truth, and should 
differences of opinion arise a majority of voices must prevail, 
and all must obey and submit to the majority.  It is 
again not permitted that any one of the honoured members 
object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any 
decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not 
right, for such criticism would prevent any decision from 
being enforced.  In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in 
harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is 
light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevail the 
result shall be darkness upon darkness....  If this be so 
regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it 
shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the 
Evil One....  Should they endeavour to fulfil these conditions 
the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed 
unto them, and that assembly shall become the centre of the 
 
+P89 
Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall 
come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new 
effusion of Spirit.  
 
     46.  O ye who are firm in the Covenant!  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
is constantly engaged in ideal communication with any 
Spiritual Assembly which is instituted through the divine 
bounty, and the members of which, in the utmost devotion, 
turn to the divine Kingdom and are firm in the Covenant.  
To them he is whole-heartedly attached and with them he is 
linked by everlasting ties.  Thus correspondence with that 
gathering is sincere, constant and uninterrupted.  
     At every instant, I beg for you assistance, bounty, and a 
fresh favour and blessing, so that the confirmations of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah may, like unto the sea, be constantly surging, the 
lights of the Sun of Truth may shine upon you all and that 
ye may be confirmed in service, may become the manifestations 
of bounty and that each one of you may, at dawn, 
turn unto the Holy Land and may experience spiritual 
emotions with all intensity.  
 
     47.  O ye true friends!  Your letter hath been received 
and it brought great joy.  God be praised, ye had made 
ready an entertainment and established the feast which is to 
be held every nineteen days.  Whatsoever gathering is 
arranged with the utmost love, and where those who attend 
are turning their faces toward the Kingdom of God, and 
where the discourse is of the Teachings of God, and the 
effect of which is to cause those present to advance--that 
gathering is the Lord's, and that festive table hath come 
down from heaven.  
 
+P90 
     It is my hope that this feast will be given on one day out 
of every nineteen, for it bringeth you closer together; it is 
the very well-spring of unity and loving-kindness.  
     Ye observe to what a degree the world is in continual 
turmoil and conflict, and to what a pass its nations have now 
come.  Perchance will the lovers of God succeed in upraising 
the banner of human unity, so that the one-coloured tabernacle 
of the Kingdom of Heaven will cast its sheltering 
shadow over all the earth; that misunderstandings among 
the world's peoples will vanish away; that all nations will 
mingle one with another, dealing with one another even as 
the lover with his beloved.  
     It is your duty to be exceedingly kind to every human 
being, and to wish him well; to work for the upliftment of 
society; to blow the breath of life into the dead; to act in 
accordance with the instructions of &amp;Baha'u'llah and walk 
His path--until ye change the world of man into the world 
of God.  
 
     48.  O ye loyal servants of the Ancient Beauty!  In every 
cycle and dispensation, the feast hath been favoured and 
loved, and the spreading of a table for the lovers of God 
hath been considered a praiseworthy act.  This is especially 
the case today, in this dispensation beyond compare, this 
most generous of ages, when it is highly acclaimed, for it is 
truly accounted among such gatherings as are held to 
worship and glorify God.  Here the holy verses, the heavenly 
odes and laudations are intoned, and the heart is quickened, 
and carried away from itself.  
     The primary intent is to kindle these stirrings of the 
spirit, but at the same time it follows quite naturally that 
those present should partake of food, so that the world of 
 
+P91 
the body may mirror the spirit's world, and flesh take on 
the qualities of soul; and just as the spiritual delights are here 
in profusion, so too the material delights.  
     Happy are ye, to be observing this rule, with all its mystic 
meanings, thus keeping the friends of God alert and heedful, 
and bringing them peace of mind, and joy.  
 
     49.  Thy letter hath been received.  Thou didst write of 
the Nineteen Day festivity, and this rejoiced my heart.  
These gatherings cause the divine table to descend from 
heaven, and draw down the confirmations of the All-Merciful.  
My hope is that the breathings of the Holy Spirit 
will be wafted over them, and that each one present shall, 
in great assemblies, with an eloquent tongue and a heart 
flooded with the love of God, set himself to acclaiming the 
rise of the Sun of Truth, the dawn of the Day-Star that 
lighteth all the world.  
 
     50.  You have asked as to the feast in every &amp;Baha'i 
month.  This feast is held to foster comradeship and love, to 
call God to mind and supplicate Him with contrite hearts, 
and to encourage benevolent pursuits.  
     That is, the friends should there dwell upon God and 
glorify Him, read the prayers and holy verses, and treat one 
another with the utmost affection and love.  
 
     51.  As to the Nineteen Day Feast, it rejoiceth mind and 
heart.  If this feast be held in the proper fashion, the friends 
will, once in nineteen days, find themselves spiritually 
restored, and endued with a power that is not of this world.  
 
+P92 
     52.  O servant of the One true God!  The Lord be 
praised, the loved ones of God are found in every land, and 
are, one and all, neath the shadow of the Tree of Life and 
under the protection of His good providence.  His care 
and loving-kindness surge even as the eternal billows of 
the sea, and His blessings are continually showered from His 
eternal Kingdom.  
     Ours should be the prayer that His blessings may be 
vouchsafed in still greater abundance, and ours to hold fast 
to such means as shall ensure a fuller outpouring of His 
grace and a greater measure of His divine assistance.  
     One of the greatest of these means is the spirit of true 
fellowship and loving communion amongst the friends.  
Remember the saying:  `Of all pilgrimages the greatest is to 
relieve the sorrow-laden heart.'  
 
     53.  Verily, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha inhaleth the fragrance of the 
love of God from every meeting place where the Word of 
God is uttered and proofs and arguments set forth that shed 
their rays across the world, and where they recount the 
tribulations of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at the evil hands of those who 
have violated the Covenant of God.  
     O handmaid of the Lord!  Speak thou no word of politics; 
thy task concerneth the life of the soul, for this verily leadeth 
to man's joy in the world of God.  Except to speak well of 
them, make thou no mention of the earth's kings, and the 
worldly governments thereof.  Rather, confine thine utterance 
to spreading the blissful tidings of the Kingdom of 
God, and demonstrating the influence of the Word of God, 
and the holiness of the Cause of God.  Tell thou of abiding 
joy and spiritual delights, and godlike qualities, and of how 
the Sun of Truth hath risen above the earth's horizons:  tell 
 
+P93 
of the blowing of the spirit of life into the body of the 
world.  
 
     54.  Ye have written as to the meetings of the friends, and 
how filled they are with peace and joy.  Of course this is so; 
for wherever the spiritually minded are gathered together, 
there in His beauty reigneth &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Thus it is certain 
that such reunions will yield boundless happiness and peace.  
     Today it behoveth one and all to forgo the mention of 
all else, and to disregard all things.  Let their speaking, let 
their inner state be summed up thus:  `Keep all my words of 
prayer and praise confined to one refrain; make all my life 
but servitude to Thee.'  That is, let them concentrate all 
their thoughts, all their words, on teaching the Cause of 
God and spreading the Faith of God, and inspiring all to 
characterize themselves with the characteristics of God; on 
loving mankind; on being pure and holy in all things, and 
spotless in their public and private life; on being upright 
and detached, and fervent, and afire.  All is to be yielded up, 
save only the remembrance of God; all is to be dispraised, 
except His praise.  Today, to this melody of the Company 
on high, the world will leap and dance:  `Glory be to my 
Lord, the All-Glorious!'  But know ye this:  save for this 
song of God, no song will stir the world, and save for this 
nightingale-cry of truth from the Garden of God, no 
melody will lure away the heart.  `Whence cometh this 
Singer Who speaketh the Beloved's name?'  
 
     55.  It befitteth the friends to hold a gathering, a 
meeting, where they shall glorify God and fix their hearts 
upon Him, and read and recite the Holy Writings of the 
 
+P94 
Blessed Beauty--may my soul be the ransom of His lovers!  
The lights of the All-Glorious Realm, the rays of the 
Supreme Horizon, will be cast upon such bright assemblages, 
for these are none other than the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars, 
the Dawning-Points of God's Remembrance, 
which must, at the direction of the Most Exalted Pen, be 
established in every hamlet and city...  These spiritual 
gatherings must be held with the utmost purity and consecration, 
so that from the site itself, and its earth and the 
air about it, one will inhale the fragrant breathings of the 
Holy Spirit.  
 
     56.  Whensoever a company of people shall gather in a 
meeting place, shall engage in glorifying God, and shall 
speak with one another of the mysteries of God, beyond 
any doubt the breathings of the Holy Spirit will blow 
gently over them, and each shall receive a share thereof.  
 
     57.  We hear that thou hast in mind to embellish thy 
house from time to time with a meeting of &amp;Baha'is, where 
some among them will engage in glorifying the All-Glorious 
Lord...  Know that shouldst thou bring this about, that 
house of earth will become a house of heaven, and that 
fabric of stone a congress of the spirit.  
 
     58.  Thou hast asked about places of worship and the 
underlying reason therefor.  The wisdom in raising up such 
buildings is that at a given hour, the people should know it 
is time to meet, and all should gather together, and, 
harmoniously attuned one to another, engage in prayer; 
 
+P95 
with the result that out of this coming together, unity and 
affection shall grow and flourish in the human heart.  
 
     59.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha hath long cherished the desire that a 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar be upraised in that region.  Praised be 
God, thanks to the strenuous efforts of the friends, in recent 
days the joyful news of this hath been announced.  This 
service is highly acceptable at the Threshold of God, for the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar inspiriteth the lovers of God and delighteth 
their hearts, and causeth them to become steadfast 
and firm.  
     This is a matter of the utmost significance.  If the erection 
of the House of Worship in a public place would arouse the 
hostility of evil-doers, then the meeting must, in every 
locality, be held in some hidden place.  Even in every 
hamlet, a place must be set aside as the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, 
and even though it be underground.  
     Now, praised be God, ye have succeeded in this.  Engage 
ye in the remembrance of God at dawn; rise ye up to praise 
and glorify Him.  Blessed are ye, and joy be yours, O ye the 
righteous, for having established the Dawning-Point of the 
Praises of God.  Verily I ask of the Lord that He make you 
standards of salvation and banners of redemption, rippling 
high over the valleys and hills.  
 
     60.  Although to outward seeming the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
is a material structure, yet it hath a spiritual effect.  
It forgeth bonds of unity from heart to heart; it is a collective 
centre for men's souls.  Every city in which, during the 
days of the Manifestation, a temple was raised up, hath 
created security and constancy and peace, for such buildings 
 
+P96 
were given over to the perpetual glorification of God, and 
only in the remembrance of God can the heart find rest.  
Gracious God!  The edifice of the House of Worship hath a 
powerful influence on every phase of life.  Experience hath, 
in the east, clearly shown this to be a fact.  Even if, in some 
small village, a house was designated as the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, 
it produced a marked effect; how much greater 
would be the impact of one especially raised up.  
 
     61.  O Lord, O Thou Who dost bless all those who 
stand firm in the Covenant by enabling them, out of their 
love for the Light of the World, to expend what they have 
as an offering to the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the dayspring of 
Thy wide-spread rays and the proclaimer of Thine 
evidences, help Thou, both in this world and the world to 
come, these righteous these upright and pious ones to draw 
ever nearer to Thy sacred Threshold, and make bright 
their faces with Thy dazzling splendours.  
     Verily art Thou the Generous, the Ever-Bestowing.  
 
     62.  O my well-beloved daughter of the Kingdom!  
The letter thou hadst written to Dr. Esslemont was forwarded 
by him to the Land of Desire [The Holy Land].  I 
read it all through with the greatest attention.  On the one 
hand, I was deeply touched, for thou hadst sheared off those 
fair tresses of thine with the shears of detachment from this 
world and of self-sacrifice in the path of the Kingdom of 
God.  And on the other, I was greatly pleased, for that 
dearly-beloved daughter hath evinced so great a spirit of 
self-sacrifice as to offer up so precious a part of her body in 
the pathway of the Cause of God.  Hadst thou sought my 
 
+P97 
opinion, I would in no wise have consented that thou 
shouldst shear off even a single thread of thy comely and 
wavy locks; nay, I myself would have contributed in thy 
name for the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  This deed of thine is, 
however, an eloquent testimony to thy noble spirit of self-sacrifice.  
Thou hast, verily, sacrificed thy life and great will 
be the spiritual results thou shalt obtain.  Rest thou confident 
that day by day thou shalt progress and wax greater in 
firmness and in constancy.  The bounties of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
shall compass thee about and the joyful tidings from on high 
shall time and again be imparted unto thee.  And though it 
be thine hair that thou hast sacrificed, yet thou shalt be filled 
with the Spirit, and though it be this perishable member of 
thy body which thou hast laid down in the path of God, yet 
thou shalt find the Divine Gift, shalt behold the Celestial 
Beauty, obtain imperishable glory and attain unto everlasting 
life.  
 
     63.  O ye blessed souls!+F1  The letter ye had written to 
&amp;Rahmatu'llah hath been perused.  Many and various were 
the joyful tidings it conveyed, namely, that through the 
power of faith and constancy in the Covenant, numerous 
gatherings have been convened, and the loved ones are 
everywhere astir and active.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ardent desire hath ever been that the soil 
of that hallowed spot, which in the earliest days of the 
Cause hath been refreshed and made verdant with the spring 
showers of grace, may so bloom and blossom as to fill every 
heart with joy.  
     Praised be the Lord, the Cause of God hath been proclaimed 
and promoted throughout the East and the West in 
 
+F1 The &amp;Baha'is of &amp;Najaf-Abad 
 
+P98 
such wise that no mind had ever conceived that the sweet 
savours of the Lord would so rapidly perfume all regions.  
This, verily, is only through the consummate bounties of 
the ever-blessed Beauty, Whose grace and Whose triumphing 
power are time and again abundantly received.  
     One of the wondrous events that has of late come to 
pass is this, that the edifice of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is 
being raised in the very heart of the American continent, 
and numerous souls from the surrounding regions are contributing 
for the erection of this holy Temple.  Among these 
is a highly esteemed lady of the city of Manchester, who 
hath been moved to offer her share.  
     Having no portion of goods and earthly riches, she 
sheared off with her own hands the fine, long and precious 
tresses that adorned her head so gracefully, and offered them 
for sale, that the price thereof might promote the cause of 
the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  
     Consider ye, that though in the eyes of women nothing 
is more precious than rich and flowing locks, yet notwithstanding 
this, that highly-honoured lady hath evinced so 
rare and beautiful a spirit of self-sacrifice.  
     And though this was uncalled for, and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
would not have consented to such a deed, yet as it doth 
reveal so high and noble a spirit of devotion, He was deeply 
touched thereby.  Precious though the hair be in the sight of 
western women, nay, more precious than life itself, yet she 
offered it up as a sacrifice for the cause of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar!  
     It is related that once in the days of the Apostle of God+F1 
He signified His desire that an army should advance in a 
certain direction, and leave was granted unto the faithful to 
raise contributions for the holy war.  Among many was one 
 
+F1 &amp;Muhammad 
 
+P99 
man who gave a thousand camels, each laden with corn, 
another who gave half his substance, and still another who 
offered all that he had.  But a woman stricken in years, 
whose sole possession was a handful of dates, came to the 
Apostle and laid at His feet her humble contribution.  
Thereupon the Prophet of God--may my life be offered up 
as a sacrifice unto Him--bade that this handful of dates be 
placed over and above all the contributions that had been 
gathered, thus asserting the merit and superiority thereof 
over all the rest.  This was done because that elderly woman 
had no other earthly possessions but these.  
     And in like manner this esteemed lady had nothing else 
to contribute but her precious locks, and these she gloriously 
sacrificed in the cause of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  
     Ponder and reflect how mighty and potent hath the 
Cause of God become!  A woman of the west hath given 
her hair for the glory of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  
     Nay, this is but a lesson unto them that perceive.  
     In conclusion I am greatly pleased with the loved ones in 
&amp;Najaf-Abad for, from the very early dawn of the Cause 
unto this day they have one and all under all conditions 
evinced a great spirit of self-sacrifice.  
     &amp;Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin hath throughout his lifetime prayed 
with all the sincerity of his stainless soul on behalf of the 
believers in &amp;Najaf-Abad and implored for them the grace of 
God and His divine confirmation.  
     The Lord be praised that the prayers of this gracious soul 
have been answered, for the effects thereof are everywhere 
manifest.  
 
     64.  The &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is one of the most vital 
institutions in the world, and it hath many subsidiary 
 
+P100 
branches.  Although it is a House of Worship, it is also connected 
with a hospital, a drug dispensary, a traveller's 
hospice, a school for orphans, and a university for advanced 
studies.  Every &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is connected with these 
five things.  My hope is that the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will 
now be established in America, and that gradually the 
hospital, the school, the university, the dispensary and the 
hospice, all functioning according to the most efficient and 
orderly procedures, will follow.  Make these matters known 
to the beloved of the Lord, so that they will understand how 
very great is the importance of this `Dawning-Point of the 
Remembrance of God.'  The Temple is not only a place 
for worship; rather, in every respect is it complete and 
whole.  
     O thou dear handmaid of God!  If only thou couldst 
know what a high station is destined for those souls who are 
severed from the world, are powerfully attracted to the 
Faith, and are teaching, under the sheltering shadow of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah!  How thou wouldst rejoice, how thou wouldst, 
in exultation and rapture, spread thy wings and soar 
heavenward--for being a follower of such a way, and a 
traveller toward such a Kingdom.  
     As to the terminology I used in my letter, bidding thee to 
consecrate thyself to service in the Cause of God, the 
meaning of it is this:  limit thy thoughts to teaching the 
Faith.  Act by day and night according to the teachings and 
counsels and admonitions of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  This doth not 
preclude marriage.  Thou canst take unto thyself a husband 
and at the same time serve the Cause of God; the one doth 
not preclude the other.  Know thou the value of these days; 
let not this chance escape thee.  Beg thou God to make thee 
a lighted candle, so that thou mayest guide a great multitude 
through this darksome world.  
 
+P101 
     65.  O thou favoured handmaid of the heavenly Kingdom!  
Thy letter hath been received.  It conveyeth high 
aspirations and noble goals, saying that thou hast in mind to 
make a journey to the Far East, and that thou art ready to 
endure extreme hardships, in order to guide the souls, and 
to spread far and wide the glad tidings of God's Kingdom.  
This purpose of thine betokeneth that thou, dear handmaid 
of God, dost cherish the very noblest of all aims.  
     When delivering the glad tidings, speak out and say:  the 
Promised One of all the world's peoples hath now been 
made manifest.  For each and every people, and every 
religion, await a Promised One, and &amp;Baha'u'llah is that One 
Who is awaited by all; and therefore the Cause of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah will bring about the oneness of mankind, and 
the tabernacle of unity will be upraised on the heights of the 
world, and the banners of the universality of all humankind 
will be unfurled on the peaks of the earth.  When thou dost 
loose thy tongue to deliver this great good news, this will 
become the means of teaching the people.  
     Thy projected journey, however, is to a very far-away 
land, and unless a group of persons be available, the glad 
tidings will not take much effect in that place.  If ye think 
best, travel instead to Persia, and on the way back, go 
through Japan and China.  This would appear to be much 
better, and far more enjoyable.  In any case, do whatever 
seemeth feasible, and it will be approved.  
 
     66.  O thou who hast sought illumination from the 
light of guidance!  Praise thou God that He hath directed 
thee to the light of truth and hath invited thee to enter the 
Kingdom of &amp;Abha.  Thy sight hath been illumined and thy 
 
+P102 
heart hath been turned into a rose garden.  I pray for thee 
that thou mayest ever grow in faith and assurance, shine 
like unto a torch in the assemblies and bestow upon them 
the light of guidance.  
     Whenever an illumined assembly of the friends of God is 
gathered, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, although bodily absent, is yet 
present in spirit and in soul.  I am always a traveller to 
America and am assuredly associating with spiritual and 
illumined friends.  Distance is annihilated and prevents not 
the close and intimate association of two souls that are 
closely attached in heart even though they may be in two 
different countries.  I am therefore thy close companion, 
attuned and in harmony with thy soul.  
 
     67.  O thou lady of the Kingdom!  Thy letter sent from 
New York hath been received.  Its contents imparted joy 
and gladness for they indicated that with a firm resolve and 
a pure intention thou hast determined to travel to Paris, 
that thou mayest in that silent city enkindle the fire of the 
love of God and in the midst of that darkness of nature 
shine like unto a resplendent candle.  This journey is highly 
praiseworthy and suitable.  When thou reachest Paris, thou 
must strive, no matter how small the number of the friends 
may be, to institute the assembly of the Covenant and to 
vivify the souls through the power of the Covenant.  
     Paris is exceedingly dispirited and is in a state of torpor 
and so far it hath not burst into flames although the French 
nation is an active and lively one.  But the world of nature 
hath fully stretched its pavilion over Paris and hath done 
away with religious sentiments.  But this power of the 
Covenant shall heat every freezing soul, shall bestow light 
 
+P103 
upon everything that is dark and shall secure for the captive 
in the hand of nature the true freedom of the Kingdom.  
     Arise thou at present in Paris with the power of the 
Kingdom, with a divine confirmation, with a genuine zeal 
and ardour and with a flame of the love of God.  Roar like 
unto a lion and exhibit such ecstasy and love among these 
few souls that praise and glorification may continuously 
reach thee from the divine Kingdom and mighty confirmations 
may descend upon thee.  Rest thou assured.  If 
thou dost act accordingly and hoist the standard of the 
Covenant, Paris shall burst into flame.  Be constantly 
attached to and seek always the confirmations of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
for these turn the drop into a sea and convert the gnat into 
an eagle.  
 
     68.  O ye who are firm in the Covenant and the Testament!  
Your letter was received and your blessed names 
were one by one perused.  The contents of the letter were 
divine inspirations and manifest bounties because they were 
indicative of the union of the friends and the harmony of 
all hearts.  
     Today the most remarkable favour of God centereth 
around union and harmony among the friends; so that this 
unity and concord may be the cause of the promulgation of 
the oneness of the world of humanity, may emancipate the 
world from this intense darkness of enmity and rancour, 
and that the Sun of Truth may shine in full and perfect 
effulgence.  
     Today, all the peoples of the world are indulging in self-interest 
and exert the utmost effort and endeavour to 
promote their own material interests.  They are worshipping 
 
+P104 
themselves and not the divine reality, nor the world of 
mankind.  They seek diligently their own benefit and not 
the common weal.  This is because they are captives of the 
world of nature and unaware of the divine teachings, of the 
bounty of the Kingdom and of the Sun of Truth.  But ye, 
praise be to God, are at present especially favoured with 
this bounty, have become of the chosen, have been informed 
of the heavenly instructions, have gained admittance into 
the Kingdom of God, have become the recipients of unbounded 
blessings and have been baptized with the Water 
of Life, with the fire of the love of God and with the Holy 
Spirit.  
     Strive, therefore, with heart and soul that ye become 
ignited candles in the assemblage of the world, glittering 
stars on the horizon of Truth and may become the cause of 
the propagation of the light of the Kingdom; in order that 
the world of humanity may be converted into a divine 
realm, the nether world may become the world on high, 
the love of God and the mercy of the Lord may raise their 
canopy upon the apex of the world, human souls may 
become the waves of the ocean of truth, the world of 
humanity may grow into one blessed tree, the verses of 
oneness may be chanted and the melodies of sanctity may 
reach the Supreme Concourse.  
     Day and night I entreat and supplicate to the Kingdom of 
God and beg for you infinite assistance and confirmation.  
Do not take into consideration your own aptitudes and 
capacities, but fix your gaze on the consummate bounty, 
the divine bestowal and the power of the Holy Spirit--the 
power that converteth the drop into a sea and the star into 
a sun.  
     Praise be to God, the hosts of the Supreme Concourse 
secure the victory and the power of the Kingdom is ready 
 
+P105 
to assist and to support.  Should ye at every instant unloosen 
the tongue in thanksgiving and gratitude, ye would not be 
able to discharge yourselves of the obligation of gratitude 
for these bestowals.  
     Consider:  eminent personages whose fame hath spread 
all over the world shall, erelong, fade into utter nothingness 
as the result of their deprivation of this heavenly 
bounty; no name and no fame shall they leave behind, and 
of them no fruit and trace shall survive.  But as the effulgences 
of the Sun of Truth have dawned forth upon you 
and ye have attained everlasting life, ye shall shine and 
sparkle forevermore from the horizon of existence.  
     Peter was a fisherman and Mary Magdalene a peasant, 
but as they were specially favoured with the blessings of 
Christ, the horizon of their faith became illumined, and 
down to the present day they are shining from the horizon 
of everlasting glory.  In this station, merit and capacity are 
not to be considered; nay rather, the resplendent rays of the 
Sun of Truth, which have illumined these mirrors, must be 
taken into account.  
     Ye are inviting me to America.  I am likewise longing to 
gaze upon those illumined faces and converse and associate 
with those true friends.  But the magnetic power which 
shall draw me to those shores is the union and harmony of 
the friends, their behaviour and conduct in accordance with 
the teachings of God and the firmness of all in the Covenant 
and the Testament.  
 
          O Divine Providence!  This assemblage is composed 
     of Thy friends who are attracted to Thy beauty and are 
     set ablaze by the fire of Thy love.  Turn these souls into 
     heavenly angels, resuscitate them through the breath of 
     Thy Holy Spirit, grant them eloquent tongues and 
 
+P106 
     resolute hearts, bestow upon them heavenly power and 
     merciful susceptibilities, cause them to become the promulgators 
     of the oneness of mankind and the cause of 
     love and concord in the world of humanity, so that the 
     perilous darkness of ignorant prejudice may vanish 
     through the light of the Sun of Truth, this dreary world 
     may become illumined, this material realm may absorb 
     the rays of the world of spirit, these different colours may 
     merge into one colour and the melody of praise may rise 
     to the kingdom of Thy sanctity.  
          Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent and the Almighty!  
 
     69.  Thou hast written concerning organization.  The 
divine teachings and the admonitions and exhortations of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah are manifestly evident.  These constitute the 
organization of the Kingdom and their enforcement is 
obligatory.  The least deviation from them is absolute error.  
     Thou hast written concerning my travel to America.  If 
thou couldst see how the waves of constant occupation are 
surging thou wouldst have considered that time for travel 
is absolutely lacking; in times of fixed residence partial rest 
is even impossible.  God willing, I trust, through the bounty 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, that as soon as means for the composure of 
mind and of heart are provided, I shall determine to journey 
and shall inform thee about it.  
 
     70.  O thou ignited candle!  Thy letter was received.  Its 
contents imparted spiritual gladness, for they were pervaded 
by spiritual sentiments and indicated the attraction of thy 
 
+P107 
heart, attachment to the Kingdom of God and love for His 
divine teachings.  
     Verily, thou showest a high endeavour, hast a pure and 
sanctified purpose, wishest naught save the good-pleasure of 
God, seekest nothing but the attainment of limitless 
bounties, and art engaged in the promulgation of divine 
teachings and the explanation of abstruse metaphysical 
problems.  It is my hope that, by the favour of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
thou and thy respected wife may daily increase in firmness 
and steadfastness, so that in that exalted land ye may become 
two upraised standards and two resplendent lights.  
     Extensive travel in October, to the north, south, east and 
west, accompanied by that candle of the love of God, Mrs.  
Maxwell, would be highly acceptable.  My hope is that she 
may entirely recover; this beloved handmaid of God is like 
a flame of fire and thinks day and night of nothing save 
service to God.  For the present, travel throughout the 
northern states, and in the winter season hasten to the states 
in the south.  Your service should consist of eloquent 
speeches delivered in gatherings wherein ye may promulgate 
the divine teachings.  If possible, undertake at some 
time a voyage to the Hawaiian Islands.  
     The events which have transpired were all recorded fifty 
years ago in the Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah--Tablets which have 
been printed, published and spread throughout the world.  
The teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah are the light of this age and the 
spirit of this century.  Expound each of them at every 
gathering.  
     The first is investigation of truth, 
     The second, the oneness of mankind, 
     The third, universal peace, 
     The fourth, conformity between science and divine 
     revelation, 
 
+P108 
     The fifth, abandonment of racial, religious, worldly and 
     political prejudices, prejudices which destroy the foundation 
     of mankind.  
     The sixth is righteousness and justice, 
     The seventh, the betterment of morals and heavenly 
     education, 
     The eighth, the equality of the two sexes, 
     The ninth, the diffusion of knowledge and education, 
     The tenth, economic questions, 
and so on and so forth.  Strive that souls may attain unto the 
light of guidance and hold fast unto the hem of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     The letter thou hast enclosed was perused.  When man's 
soul is rarified and cleansed, spiritual links are established, 
and from these bonds sensations felt by the heart are produced.  
The human heart resembleth a mirror.  When this is 
purified human hearts are attuned and reflect one another, 
and thus spiritual emotions are generated.  This is like the 
world of dreams when man is detached from things which 
are tangible and experienceth those of the spirit.  What 
amazing laws operate, and what remarkable discoveries are 
made!  And it may even be that detailed communications 
are registered...  
     Finally, I hope that in Chicago the friends may become 
united and may illumine that city, for therein the dawn of 
the Cause appeared, and in this lieth its preference over 
other cities.  Therefore it must be held in respect; perchance 
it may, God willing, be freed from all spiritual afflictions, 
and may attain unto perfect health and become a centre of 
the Covenant and Testament.  
 
+P109 
     71.  O thou beloved maidservant of God!  Thy letter 
was received and its contents revealed the fact that the 
friends, in perfect energy and vitality are engaged in the 
propagation of the heavenly teachings.  This news hath 
caused intense joy and gladness.  For every era hath a spirit; 
the spirit of this illumined era lieth in the teachings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  For these lay the foundation of the oneness of 
the world of humanity and promulgate universal brotherhood.  
They are founded upon the unity of science and 
religion and upon investigation of truth.  They uphold the 
principle that religion must be the cause of amity, union 
and harmony among men.  They establish the equality of 
both sexes and propound economic principles which are for 
the happiness of individuals.  They diffuse universal education, 
that every soul may as much as possible have a share of 
knowledge.  They abrogate and nullify religious, racial, 
political, patriotic and economic prejudices and the like.  
Those teachings that are scattered throughout the Epistles 
and Tablets are the cause of the illumination and the life of 
the world of humanity.  Whoever promulgateth them will 
verily be assisted by the Kingdom of God.  
     The President of the Republic, Dr. Wilson, is indeed 
serving the Kingdom of God for he is restless and strives 
day and night that the rights of all men may be preserved 
safe and secure, that even small nations, like greater ones, 
may dwell in peace and comfort, under the protection of 
Righteousness and Justice.  This purpose is indeed a lofty 
one.  I trust that the incomparable Providence will assist and 
confirm such souls under all conditions.  
 
+P110 
     72.  O thou true friend!  Read, in the school of God, the 
lessons of the spirit, and learn from love's Teacher the 
innermost truths.  Seek out the secrets of Heaven, and tell of 
the overflowing grace and favour of God.  
     Although to acquire the sciences and arts is the greatest 
glory of mankind, this is so only on condition that man's 
river flow into the mighty sea, and draw from God's ancient 
source His inspiration.  When this cometh to pass, then 
every teacher is as a shoreless ocean, every pupil a prodigal 
fountain of knowledge.  If, then, the pursuit of knowledge 
lead to the beauty of Him Who is the Object of all Knowledge, 
how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will 
perhaps shut a man off from flooding grace, for with 
learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on 
error and indifference to God.  
     The sciences of today are bridges to reality; if then they 
lead not to reality, naught remains but fruitless illusion.  By 
the one true God!  If learning be not a means of access to 
Him, the Most Manifest, it is nothing but evident loss.  
     It is incumbent upon thee to acquire the various branches 
of knowledge, and to turn thy face toward the beauty of 
the Manifest Beauty, that thou mayest be a sign of saving 
guidance amongst the peoples of the world, and a focal 
centre of understanding in this sphere from which the wise 
and their wisdom are shut out, except for those who set 
foot in the Kingdom of lights and become informed of the 
veiled and hidden mystery, the well-guarded secret.  
 
     73.  O daughter of the Kingdom!  Thy letter hath come 
and its contents make clear the fact that thou hast directed 
all thy thoughts toward acquiring light from the realms of 
mystery.  So long as the thoughts of an individual are 
 
+P111 
scattered he will achieve no results, but if his thinking be 
concentrated on a single point wonderful will be the fruits 
thereof.  
     One cannot obtain the full force of the sunlight when it 
is cast on a flat mirror, but once the sun shineth upon a concave 
mirror, or on a lens that is convex, all its heat will be 
concentrated on a single point, and that one point will burn 
the hottest.  Thus is it necessary to focus one's thinking on a 
single point so that it will become an effective force.  
     Thou didst wish to celebrate the Day of &amp;Ridvan with a 
feast, and to have those present on that day engage in 
reciting Tablets with delight and joy, and thou didst 
request me to send thee a letter to be read on that day.  My 
letter is this:  
     O ye beloved, and ye handmaids of the Merciful!  This is 
the day when the Day-Star of Truth rose over the horizon 
of life, and its glory spread, and its brightness shone out 
with such power that it clove the dense and high-piled 
clouds and mounted the skies of the world in all its splendour.  
Hence do ye witness a new stirring throughout all 
created things.  
     See how, in this day, the scope of sciences and arts hath 
widened out, and what wondrous technical advances have 
been made, and to what a high degree the mind's powers 
have increased, and what stupendous inventions have 
appeared.  
     This age is indeed as a hundred other ages:  should ye 
gather the yield of a hundred ages, and set that against the 
accumulated product of our times, the yield of this one era 
will prove greater than that of a hundred gone before.  Take 
ye, for an example, the sum total of all the books that were 
ever written in ages past, and compare that with the books 
and treatises that our era hath produced:  these books, 
 
+P112 
written in our day alone, far and away exceed the total 
number of volumes that have been written down the ages.  
See how powerful is the influence exerted by the Day-Star 
of the world upon the inner essence of all created things!  
     But alas, a thousand times alas!  The eyes see it not, the 
ears are deaf, and the hearts and minds are oblivious of this 
supreme bestowal.  Strive ye then, with all your hearts and 
souls, to awaken those who slumber, to cause the blind to 
see, and the dead to rise.  
 
     74.  O bird that singeth sweetly of the &amp;Abha Beauty!  In 
this new and wondrous dispensation the veils of superstition 
have been torn asunder and the prejudices of eastern 
peoples stand condemned.  Among certain nations of the 
East, music was considered reprehensible, but in this new 
age the Manifest Light hath, in His holy Tablets, specifically 
proclaimed that music, sung or played, is spiritual food for 
soul and heart.  
     The musician's art is among those arts worthy of the 
highest praise, and it moveth the hearts of all who grieve.  
Wherefore, O thou &amp;Shahnaz,+F1 play and sing out the holy 
words of God with wondrous tones in the gatherings of the 
friends, that the listener may be freed from chains of care 
and sorrow, and his soul may leap for joy and humble itself 
in prayer to the realm of Glory.  
 
     75.  Strive with heart and soul in order to bring about 
union and harmony among the white and the black and 
prove thereby the unity of the &amp;Baha'i world wherein distinction 
 
+F1 &amp;Shahnaz, the name given to the recipient of this Tablet, is also 
+F1 the name of a musical mode.  
 
+P113 
of colour findeth no place, but where hearts only 
are considered.  Praise be to God, the hearts of the friends 
are united and linked together, whether they be from the 
east or the west, from north or from south, whether they be 
German, French, Japanese, American, and whether they 
pertain to the white, the black, the red, the yellow or the 
brown race.  Variations of colour, of land and of race are of 
no importance in the &amp;Baha'i Faith; on the contrary, &amp;Baha'i 
unity overcometh them all and doeth away with all these 
fancies and imaginations.  
 
     76.  O thou who hast an illumined heart!  Thou art even 
as the pupil of the eye, the very wellspring of the light, for 
God's love hath cast its rays upon thine inmost being and 
thou hast turned thy face toward the Kingdom of thy Lord.  
     Intense is the hatred, in America, between black and 
white, but my hope is that the power of the Kingdom will 
bind these two in friendship, and serve them as a healing 
balm.  
     Let them look not upon a man's colour but upon his 
heart.  If the heart be filled with light, that man is nigh unto 
the threshold of his Lord; but if not, that man is careless of 
his Lord, be he white or be he black.  
 
     77.  O thou revered maidservant of God!  Thy letter 
from Los Angeles was received.  Thank divine Providence 
that thou hast been assisted in service and hast been the 
cause of the promulgation of the oneness of the world of 
humanity, so that the darkness of differences among men 
may be dissipated, and the pavilion of the unity of nations 
may cast its shadow over all regions.  Without such unity, 
 
+P114 
rest and comfort, peace and universal reconciliation are unachievable.  
This illumined century needeth and calleth for 
its fulfilment.  In every century a particular and central 
theme is, in accordance with the requirements of that 
century, confirmed by God.  In this illumined age that which 
is confirmed is the oneness of the world of humanity.  Every 
soul who serveth this oneness will undoubtedly be assisted 
and confirmed.  
     I hope that in the assemblies thou mayest sing praises 
with a sweet melody and thus become the cause of joy and 
gladness to all.  
 
     78.  O thou who art pure in heart, sanctified in spirit, 
peerless in character, beauteous in face!  Thy photograph 
hath been received revealing thy physical frame in the 
utmost grace and the best appearance.  Thou art dark in 
countenance and bright in character.  Thou art like unto the 
pupil of the eye which is dark in colour, yet it is the fount 
of light and the revealer of the contingent world.  
     I have not forgotten nor will I forget thee.  I beseech God 
that He may graciously make thee the sign of His bounty 
amidst mankind, illumine thy face with the light of such 
blessings as are vouchsafed by the merciful Lord, single thee 
out for His love in this age which is distinguished among 
all the past ages and centuries.  
 
     79.  O respected personage!  I have read your work, 
The Gospel of Wealth,+F1 and noted therein truly apposite 
 
+F1 An article from Andrew Carnegie's book The Gospel of Wealth 
+F1 was published in England in the Pall Mall Budget and called The 
+F1 Gospel of Wealth, cf. Andrew Carnegie's Autobiography 255n.  
 
+P115 
and sound recommendations for easing the lot of humankind.  
     To state the matter briefly, the Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
advocate voluntary sharing, and this is a greater thing than 
the equalization of wealth.  For equalization must be imposed 
from without, while sharing is a matter of free choice.  
     Man reacheth perfection through good deeds, voluntarily 
performed, not through good deeds the doing of which was 
forced upon him.  And sharing is a personally chosen 
righteous act:  that is, the rich should extend assistance to the 
poor, they should expend their substance for the poor, but 
of their own free will, and not because the poor have 
gained this end by force.  For the harvest of force is turmoil 
and the ruin of the social order.  On the other hand voluntary 
sharing, the freely-chosen expending of one's substance, 
leadeth to society's comfort and peace.  It lighteth up 
the world; it bestoweth honour upon humankind.  
     I have seen the good effects of your own philanthropy in 
America, in various universities, peace gatherings, and 
associations for the promotion of learning, as I travelled 
from city to city.  Wherefore do I pray on your behalf that 
you shall ever be encompassed by the bounties and blessings 
of heaven, and shall perform many philanthropic deeds in 
East and West.  Thus may you gleam as a lighted taper in 
the Kingdom of God, may attain honour and everlasting 
life, and shine out as a bright star on the horizon of eternity.  
 
     80.  O thou who art turning thy face to God!  Thy 
letter was received.  From its contents it became known 
that thy wish is to serve the poor.  What wish better than 
this!  Those souls who are of the Kingdom eagerly wish to 
be of service to the poor, to sympathize with them, to show 
 
+P116 
kindness to the miserable and to make their lives fruitful.  
Happy art thou that thou hast such a wish.  
     Convey on my behalf to thy two children the utmost 
kindness and love.  Their letters have been received but, as 
I have no time, separate letters cannot be written at present.  
Show them on my behalf the utmost kindness.  
 
     81.  Those souls who during the war have served the 
poor and have been in the Red Cross Mission work, their 
services are accepted at the Kingdom of God and are the 
cause of their everlasting life.  Convey to them these glad 
tidings.  
 
     82.  O thou who art firm in the Covenant, thy letter 
was received.  Thou hast exerted a great effort for that 
prisoner, perchance it may prove to be fruitful.  Tell him, 
however:  `The denizens of the world are confined in the 
prison of nature--a prison that is continuous and eternal.  If 
thou art at present restrained within the limits of a temporary 
prison, be not grieved at this; my hope is that thou 
mayest be emancipated from the prison of nature and may 
attain unto the court of everlasting life.  Pray to God day 
and night and beg forgiveness and pardon.  The omnipotence 
of God shall solve every difficulty.'  
 
     83.  Convey on behalf of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to thy respected 
wife my &amp;Abha greetings, and say:  `Kindness, training and 
education extended to prisoners is exceedingly important.  
Therefore as thou hast exerted an effort in this, hast 
awakened some of them, and hast been the cause of the 
 
+P117 
turning of their faces to the divine Kingdom, this praiseworthy 
deed is highly acceptable.  Assuredly persevere.  
Convey on my behalf to the two prisoners in San Quentin 
the utmost kindness, and tell them:  `That prison in the sight 
of wise souls is a school of training and development.  Ye 
must strive with heart and soul that ye may become 
renowned in character and knowledge.'  
 
     84.  O thou dear handmaid of God!  Thy letter hath 
been received, and its contents were noted.  
     Marriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical 
bond, and this union can only be temporary, since it is foredoomed 
to a physical separation at the close.  
     Among the people of &amp;Baha, however, marriage must be 
a union of the body and of the spirit as well, for here both 
husband and wife are aglow with the same wine, both are 
enamoured of the same matchless Face, both live and move 
through the same spirit, both are illumined by the same 
glory.  This connection between them is a spiritual one, 
hence it is a bond that will abide forever.  Likewise do they 
enjoy strong and lasting ties in the physical world as well, 
for if the marriage is based both on the spirit and the body, 
that union is a true one, hence it will endure.  If, however, 
the bond is physical and nothing more, it is sure to be only 
temporary, and must inexorably end in separation.  
     When, therefore, the people of &amp;Baha undertake to marry, 
the union must be a true relationship, a spiritual coming 
together as well as a physical one, so that throughout every 
phase of life, and in all the worlds of God, their union will 
endure; for this real oneness is a gleaming out of the love 
of God.  
     In the same way, when any souls grow to be true 
 
+P118 
believers, they will attain a spiritual relationship with one 
another, and show forth a tenderness which is not of this 
world.  They will, all of them, become elated from a draught 
of divine love, and that union of theirs, that connection, 
will also abide forever.  Souls, that is, who will consign 
their own selves to oblivion, strip from themselves the 
defects of humankind, and unchain themselves from human 
bondage, will beyond any doubt be illumined with the 
heavenly splendours of oneness, and will all attain unto real 
union in the world that dieth not.  
 
     85.  As for the question regarding marriage under the 
Law of God:  first thou must choose one who is pleasing to 
thee, and then the matter is subject to the consent of father 
and mother.  Before thou makest thy choice, they have no 
right to interfere.  
 
     86.  &amp;Baha'i marriage is the commitment of the two 
parties one to the other, and their mutual attachment of 
mind and heart.  Each must, however, exercise the utmost 
care to become thoroughly acquainted with the character 
of the other, that the binding covenant between them may 
be a tie that will endure forever.  Their purpose must be this:  
to become loving companions and comrades and at one 
with each other for time and eternity....  
     The true marriage of &amp;Baha'is is this, that husband and 
wife should be united both physically and spiritually, that 
they may ever improve the spiritual life of each other, and 
may enjoy everlasting unity throughout all the worlds of 
God.  This is &amp;Baha'i marriage.  
 
+P119 
     87.  O thou memento of him who died for the Blessed 
Beauty!  In recent days, the joyful news of thy marriage to 
that luminous leaf hath been received, and hath infinitely 
gladdened the hearts of the people of God.  With all 
humility, prayers of supplication have been offered at the 
Holy Threshold, that this marriage may be a harbinger of 
joy to the friends, that it may be a loving bond for all 
eternity, and yield everlasting benefits and fruits.  
     From separation doth every kind of hurt and harm 
proceed, but the union of created things doth ever yield 
most laudable results.  From the pairing of even the smallest 
particles in the world of being are the grace and bounty of 
God made manifest; and the higher the degree, the more 
momentous is the union.  `Glory be to Him Who hath 
created all the pairs, of such things as earth produceth, and 
out of men themselves, and of things beyond their ken.'+F1  
And above all other unions is that between human beings, 
especially when it cometh to pass in the love of God.  Thus 
is the primal oneness made to appear; thus is laid the foundation 
of love in the spirit.  It is certain that such a marriage 
as yours will cause the bestowals of God to be revealed.  
Wherefore do we offer you felicitations and call down 
blessings upon you and beg of the Blessed Beauty, through 
His aid and favour, to make that wedding feast a joy to all 
and adorn it with the harmony of Heaven.  
 
          O my Lord, O my Lord!  These two bright orbs 
     are wedded in Thy love, conjoined in servitude to Thy 
     Holy Threshold, united in ministering to Thy Cause.  
     Make Thou this marriage to be as threading lights of 
     Thine abounding grace, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, 
     and luminous rays of Thy bestowals, O Thou the 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 36:36, and cf. 51:49 
 
+P120 
     Beneficent, the Ever-Giving, that there may branch out 
     from this great tree boughs that will grow green and 
     flourishing through the gifts that rain down from Thy 
     clouds of grace.  
          Verily Thou art the Generous, verily Thou art the 
     Almighty, verily Thou art the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.  
 
     88.  O ye my two beloved children!  The news of your 
union, as soon as it reached me, imparted infinite joy and 
gratitude.  Praise be to God, those two faithful birds have 
sought shelter in one nest.  I beseech God that He may 
enable them to raise an honoured family, for the importance 
of marriage lieth in the bringing up of a richly blessed 
family, so that with entire gladness they may, even as 
candles, illuminate the world.  For the enlightenment of the 
world dependeth upon the existence of man.  If man did not 
exist in this world, it would have been like a tree without 
fruit.  My hope is that you both may become even as one 
tree, and may, through the outpourings of the cloud of 
loving-kindness, acquire freshness and charm, and may 
blossom and yield fruit, so that your line may eternally 
endure.  
     Upon ye be the Glory of the Most Glorious.  
 
     89.  O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  The letter 
thou hadst written on 2 May 1919 was received.  Praise thou 
God that in tests thou art firm and steadfast and art holding 
fast to the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  Thou art not shaken by any 
affliction or disturbed by any calamity.  Not until man is 
tried doth the pure gold distinctly separate from the dross.  
Torment is the fire of test wherein the pure gold shineth 
 
+P121 
resplendently and the impurity is burned and blackened.  At 
present thou art, praise be to God, firm and steadfast in tests 
and trials and art not shaken by them.  
     Thy wife is not in harmony with thee, but praise be to 
God, the Blessed Beauty is pleased with thee and is conferring 
upon thee the utmost bounty and blessings.  But still 
try to be patient with thy wife, perchance she may be 
transformed and her heart may be illumined.  The contribution 
thou hast made for teaching is highly acceptable 
and it shall be eternally mentioned in the divine Kingdom 
for it is the cause of the diffusion of fragrances and the 
exaltation of the Word of God.  
 
     90.  O God, my God!  This Thy handmaid is calling 
upon Thee, trusting in Thee, turning her face unto Thee, 
imploring Thee to shed Thy heavenly bounties upon her, 
and to disclose unto her Thy spiritual mysteries, and to cast 
upon her the lights of Thy Godhead.  
     O my Lord!  Make the eyes of my husband to see.  Rejoice 
Thou his heart with the light of the knowledge of Thee, 
draw Thou his mind unto Thy luminous beauty, cheer 
Thou his spirit by revealing unto him Thy manifest 
splendours.  
     O my Lord!  Lift Thou the veil from before his sight.  
Rain down Thy plenteous bounties upon him, intoxicate 
him with the wine of love for Thee, make him one of Thy 
angels whose feet walk upon this earth even as their souls 
are soaring through the high heavens.  Cause him to become 
a brilliant lamp, shining out with the light of Thy wisdom 
in the midst of Thy people.  
     Verily Thou art the Precious, the Ever-Bestowing, the 
Open of Hand.  
 
+P122 
     91.  O thou who hast bowed thyself down in prayer 
before the Kingdom of God!  Blessed art thou, for the 
beauty of the divine Countenance hath enraptured thy 
heart, and the light of inner wisdom hath filled it full, and 
within it shineth the brightness of the Kingdom.  Know 
thou that God is with thee under all conditions, and that He 
guardeth thee from the changes and chances of this world 
and hath made thee a handmaid in His mighty vineyard....  
     As to thy respected husband:  it is incumbent upon thee 
to treat him with great kindness, to consider his wishes and 
be conciliatory with him at all times, till he seeth that 
because thou hast directed thyself toward the Kingdom of 
God, thy tenderness for him and thy love for God have but 
increased, as well as thy concern for his wishes under all 
conditions.  
     I beg of the Almighty to keep thee firmly established in 
His love, and ever shedding abroad the sweet breaths of 
holiness in all those regions.  
 
     92.  O ye two believers in God!  The Lord, peerless is 
He, hath made woman and man to abide with each other in 
the closest companionship, and to be even as a single soul.  
They are two helpmates, two intimate friends, who should 
be concerned about the welfare of each other.  
     If they live thus, they will pass through this world with 
perfect contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become 
the object of divine grace and favour in the Kingdom of 
heaven.  But if they do other than this, they will live out 
their lives in great bitterness, longing at every moment for 
death, and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm.  
     Strive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as 
two doves in the nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.  
 
+P123 
     93.  O thou maidservant of God!  Every woman who 
becometh the maidservant of God outshineth in glory the 
empresses of the world, for she is related to God, and her 
sovereignty is everlasting, whereas a handful of dust will 
obliterate the name and fame of those empresses.  In other 
words, as soon as they go down to the grave they are 
reduced to naught.  The maidservants of God's Kingdom, 
on the other hand, enjoy eternal sovereignty unaffected by 
the passing of ages and generations.  
     Consider how many empresses have come and gone since 
the time of Christ.  Each was the ruler of a country but now 
all trace and name of them is lost, while Mary Magdalene, 
who was only a peasant and a maidservant of God, still 
shineth from the horizon of everlasting glory.  Strive thou, 
therefore, to remain the maidservant of God.  
     Thou hast praised the Convention.  This Convention 
shall acquire great importance in future, for it is serving the 
divine Kingdom and the world of mankind.  It promulgateth 
universal peace and layeth the basis of the oneness of 
mankind; it freeth the souls from religious, racial and 
worldly prejudices and gathereth them under the shade of 
the one-coloured pavilion of God.  Praise thou God, therefore, 
that thou hast attended such a Convention and hast 
listened to the divine Teachings.  
 
     94.  O handmaids of the beauty of &amp;Abha!  Your letter 
hath come, and its perusal brought great joy.  Praised be 
God, the women believers have organized meetings where 
they will learn how to teach the Faith, will spread the sweet 
savours of the Teachings and make plans for training the 
children.  
     This gathering must be completely spiritual.  That is, the 
 
+P124 
discussions must be confined to marshalling clear and conclusive 
proofs that the Sun of Truth hath indeed arisen.  
And further, those present should concern themselves with 
every means of training the girl children; with teaching the 
various branches of knowledge, good behaviour, a proper 
way of life, the cultivation of a good character, chastity and 
constancy, perseverance, strength, determination, firmness 
of purpose; with household management, the education of 
children, and whatever especially applieth to the needs of 
girls--to the end that these girls, reared in the stronghold 
of all perfections, and with the protection of a goodly 
character, will, when they themselves become mothers, 
bring up their children from earliest infancy to have a good 
character and conduct themselves well.  
     Let them also study whatever will nurture the health of 
the body and its physical soundness, and how to guard their 
children from disease.  
     When matters are thus well arranged, every child will 
become a peerless plant in the gardens of the &amp;Abha Paradise.  
 
     95.  O handmaids of the Lord!  The spiritual assemblage 
that ye established in that illumined city is most propitious.  
Ye have made great strides; ye have surpassed the others, 
have arisen to serve the Holy Threshold, and have won 
heavenly bestowals.  Now with all spiritual zeal must ye 
gather in that enlightened assemblage and recite the Holy 
Writings and engage in remembering the Lord.  Set ye 
forth His arguments and proofs.  Work ye for the guidance 
of the women in that land, teach the young girls and the 
children, so that the mothers may educate their little ones 
from their earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them to 
have a goodly character and good morals, guide them to all 
 
+P125 
the virtues of humankind, prevent the development of any 
behaviour that would be worthy of blame, and foster them 
in the embrace of &amp;Baha'i education.  Thus shall these tender 
infants be nurtured at the breast of the knowledge of God 
and His love.  Thus shall they grow and flourish, and be 
taught righteousness and the dignity of humankind, resolution 
and the will to strive and to endure.  Thus shall they 
learn perseverance in all things, the will to advance, high 
mindedness and high resolve, chastity and purity of life.  
Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a successful conclusion 
whatsoever they undertake.  
     Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the 
education of children is of the first importance.  Let them 
put forth every effort in this regard, for when the bough is 
green and tender it will grow in whatever way ye train it.  
Therefore is it incumbent upon the mothers to rear their 
little ones even as a gardener tendeth his young plants.  Let 
them strive by day and by night to establish within their 
children faith and certitude, the fear of God, the love of the 
Beloved of the worlds, and all good qualities and traits.  
Whensoever a mother seeth that her child hath done well, 
let her praise and applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the 
slightest undesirable trait should manifest itself, let her 
counsel the child and punish him, and use means based on 
reason, even a slight verbal chastisement should this be 
necessary.  It is not, however, permissible to strike a child, or 
vilify him, for the child's character will be totally perverted 
if he be subjected to blows or verbal abuse.  
 
     96.  O handmaids of the Merciful!  Render ye thanks 
unto the Ancient Beauty that ye have been raised up and 
gathered together in this mightiest of centuries, this most 
 
+P126 
illumined of ages.  As befitting thanks for such a bounty, 
stand ye staunch and strong in the Covenant and, following 
the precepts of God and the holy Law, suckle your children 
from their infancy with the milk of a universal education, 
and rear them so that from their earliest days, within their 
inmost heart, their very nature, a way of life will be firmly 
established that will conform to the divine Teachings in all 
things.  
     For mothers are the first educators, the first mentors; and 
truly it is the mothers who determine the happiness, the 
future greatness, the courteous ways and learning and judgement, 
the understanding and the faith of their little ones.  
 
     97.  There are certain pillars which have been established 
as the unshakeable supports of the Faith of God.  The 
mightiest of these is learning and the use of the mind, the 
expansion of consciousness, and insight into the realities of 
the universe and the hidden mysteries of Almighty God.  
     To promote knowledge is thus an inescapable duty 
imposed on every one of the friends of God.  It is incumbent 
upon that Spiritual Assembly, that assemblage of God, to 
exert every effort to educate the children, so that from 
infancy they will be trained in &amp;Baha'i conduct and the ways 
of God, and will, even as young plants, thrive and flourish 
in the soft-flowing waters that are the counsels and admonitions 
of the Blessed Beauty.  
 
     98.  Were there no educator, all souls would remain 
savage, and were it not for the teacher, the children would 
be ignorant creatures.  
     It is for this reason that, in this new cycle, education and 
 
+P127 
training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and 
not voluntary.  That is, it is enjoined upon the father and 
mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to train the 
daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of 
knowledge and to rear them in the bosom of sciences and 
arts.  Should they neglect this matter, they shall be held 
responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the 
stern Lord.  
 
     99.  Thou didst write as to the children:  from the very 
beginning, the children must receive divine education and 
must continually be reminded to remember their God.  Let 
the love of God pervade their inmost being, commingled 
with their mother's milk.  
 
     100.  My wish is that these children should receive a 
&amp;Baha'i education, so that they may progress both here and 
in the Kingdom, and rejoice thy heart.  
     In a time to come, morals will degenerate to an extreme 
degree.  It is essential that children be reared in the &amp;Baha'i 
way, that they may find happiness both in this world and 
the next.  If not, they shall be beset by sorrows and troubles, 
for human happiness is founded upon spiritual behaviour.  
 
     101.  O ye who have peace of soul!  Among the divine 
Texts as set forth in the Most Holy Book and also in other 
Tablets is this:  it is incumbent upon the father and mother 
to train their children both in good conduct and the study of 
books; study, that is, to the degree required, so that no child, 
whether girl or boy, will remain illiterate.  Should the father 
 
+P128 
fail in his duty he must be compelled to discharge his 
responsibility, and should he be unable to comply, let the 
House of Justice take over the education of the children; in 
no case is a child to be left without an education.  This is one 
of the stringent and inescapable commandments to neglect 
which would draw down the wrathful indignation of 
Almighty God.  
 
     102.  O true companions!  All humankind are as children 
in a school, and the Dawning-Points of Light, the 
Sources of divine revelation, are the teachers, wondrous 
and without peer.  In the school of realities they educate 
these sons and daughters, according to teachings from God, 
and foster them in the bosom of grace, so that they may 
develop along every line, show forth the excellent gifts and 
blessings of the Lord, and combine human perfections; that 
they may advance in all aspects of human endeavour, 
whether outward or inward, hidden or visible, material or 
spiritual, until they make of this mortal world a widespread 
mirror, to reflect that other world which dieth 
not.  
     O ye friends of God!  Because, in this most momentous of 
ages, the Sun of Truth hath risen at the highest point of the 
spring equinox, and cast its rays on every clime, it shall 
kindle such tremulous excitement, it shall release such 
vibrations in the world of being, it shall stimulate such 
growth and development, it shall stream out with such a 
glory of light, and clouds of grace shall pour down such 
plentiful waters, and fields and plains shall teem with such a 
galaxy of sweet-smelling plants and blooms, that this lowly 
earth will become the &amp;Abha Kingdom, and this nether world 
the world above.  Then will this fleck of dust be as the vast 
 
+P129 
circle of the skies, this human place the palace-court of God, 
this spot of clay the dayspring of the endless favours of the 
Lord of Lords.  
     Wherefore, O loved ones of God!  Make ye a mighty 
effort till you yourselves betoken this advancement and all 
these confirmations, and become focal centres of God's 
blessings, daysprings of the light of His unity, promoters of 
the gifts and graces of civilized life.  Be ye in that land 
vanguards of the perfections of humankind; carry forward 
the various branches of knowledge, be active and progressive 
in the field of inventions and the arts.  Endeavour to 
rectify the conduct of men, and seek to excel the whole 
world in moral character.  While the children are yet in 
their infancy feed them from the breast of heavenly grace, 
foster them in the cradle of all excellence, rear them in the 
embrace of bounty.  Give them the advantage of every useful 
kind of knowledge.  Let them share in every new and 
rare and wondrous craft and art.  Bring them up to work 
and strive, and accustom them to hardship.  Teach them to 
dedicate their lives to matters of great import, and inspire 
them to undertake studies that will benefit mankind.  
 
     103.  The education and training of children is among 
the most meritorious acts of humankind and draweth down 
the grace and favour of the All-Merciful, for education is 
the indispensable foundation of all human excellence and 
alloweth man to work his way to the heights of abiding 
glory.  If a child be trained from his infancy, he will, 
through the loving care of the Holy Gardener, drink in the 
crystal waters of the spirit and of knowledge, like a young 
tree amid the rilling brooks.  And certainly he will gather to 
himself the bright rays of the Sun of Truth, and through its 
 
+P130 
light and heat will grow ever fresh and fair in the garden of 
life.  
     Therefore must the mentor be a doctor as well:  that is, he 
must, in instructing the child, remedy its faults; must give 
him learning, and at the same time rear him to have a 
spiritual nature.  Let the teacher be a doctor to the character 
of the child, thus will he heal the spiritual ailments of the 
children of men.  
     If, in this momentous task, a mighty effort be exerted, 
the world of humanity will shine out with other adornings, 
and shed the fairest light.  Then will this darksome place 
grow luminous, and this abode of earth turn into Heaven.  
The very demons will change to angels then, and wolves to 
shepherds of the flock, and the wild-dog pack to gazelles 
that pasture on the plains of oneness, and ravening beasts to 
peaceful herds, and birds of prey, with talons sharp as 
knives, to songsters warbling their sweet native notes.  
     For the inner reality of man is a demarcation line between 
the shadow and the light, a place where the two seas 
meet;+F1 it is the lowest point on the arc of descent,+F2 and 
therefore is it capable of gaining all the grades above.  With 
education it can achieve all excellence; devoid of education 
it will stay on, at the lowest point of imperfection.  
     Every child is potentially the light of the world--and at 
the same time its darkness; wherefore must the question of 
education be accounted as of primary importance.  From his 
infancy, the child must be nursed at the breast of God's love, 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 25:55, 35:13, 55:19-25.  See also Marriage Prayer revealed 
+F1 by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha beginning `He is God!  O peerless Lord!  In Thine 
+F1 almighty wisdom Thou hast enjoined marriage upon the 
+F1 peoples...'  
+F2 See Some Answered Questions, pp. 328-9 for &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
+F2 comments on the arc of descent and ascent.  
 
+P131 
and nurtured in the embrace of His knowledge, that he may 
radiate light, grow in spirituality, be filled with wisdom 
and learning, and take on the characteristics of the angelic 
host.  
     Since ye have been assigned to this holy task, ye must 
therefore exert every effort to make that school famed in all 
respects throughout the world; to make it the cause of 
exalting the Word of the Lord.  
 
     104.  O loved ones of God and handmaids of the 
Merciful!  A large body of scholars is of the opinion that 
variations among minds and differing degrees of perception 
are due to differences in education, training and culture.  
That is, they believe that minds are equal to begin with, but 
that training and education will result in mental variations 
and differing levels of intelligence, and that such variations 
are not an inherent component of the individuality but are 
the result of education:  that no one hath any inborn 
superiority over another....  
     The Manifestations of God are likewise in agreement 
with the view that education exerteth the strongest possible 
influence on humankind.  They affirm, however, that differences 
in the level of intelligence are innate; and this fact 
is obvious, and not worth debating.  For we see that children 
of the same age, the same country, the same race, indeed of 
the same family, and trained by the same individual, still are 
different as to the degree of their comprehension and 
intelligence.  One will make rapid progress, one will receive 
instruction only gradually, one will remain at the lowest 
stage of all.  For no matter how much you may polish a 
shell, it will not turn into a gleaming pearl, nor can you 
change a dull pebble into a gem whose pure rays will light 
 
+P132 
the world.  Never, through training and cultivation, will 
the colocynth and the bitter tree+F1 change into the Tree of 
Blessedness.+F2  That is to say, education cannot alter the inner 
essence of a man, but it doth exert tremendous influence, 
and with this power it can bring forth from the individual 
whatever perfections and capacities are deposited within 
him.  A grain of wheat, when cultivated by the farmer, will 
yield a whole harvest, and a seed, through the gardener's 
care, will grow into a great tree.  Thanks to a teacher's 
loving efforts, the children of the primary school may reach 
the highest levels of achievement; indeed, his benefactions 
may lift some child of small account to an exalted throne.  
Thus is it clearly demonstrated that by their essential 
nature, minds vary as to their capacity, while education 
also playeth a great role and exerteth a powerful effect on 
their development.  
 
     105.  As to the difference between that material civilization 
now prevailing, and the divine civilization which 
will be one of the benefits to derive from the House of 
Justice, it is this:  material civilization, through the power of 
punitive and retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from 
criminal acts; and notwithstanding this, while laws to 
retaliate against and punish a man are continually proliferating, 
as ye can see, no laws exist to reward him.  In all 
the cities of Europe and America, vast buildings have been 
erected to serve as jails for the criminals.  
     Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member 
of society that no one, with the exception of a negligible 
few, will undertake to commit a crime.  There is thus a great 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 37:60 (The Tree of &amp;Zaqqum) 
+F2 cf. &amp;Qur'an 24:35 
 
+P133 
difference between the prevention of crime through 
measures that are violent and retaliatory, and so training the 
people, and enlightening them, and spiritualizing them, 
that without any fear of punishment or vengeance to come, 
they will shun all criminal acts.  They will, indeed, look 
upon the very commission of a crime as a great disgrace 
and in itself the harshest of punishments.  They will become 
enamoured of human perfections, and will consecrate their 
lives to whatever will bring light to the world and will 
further those qualities which are acceptable at the Holy 
Threshold of God.  
     See then how wide is the difference between material 
civilization and divine.  With force and punishments, 
material civilization seeketh to restrain the people from 
mischief, from inflicting harm on society and committing 
crimes.  But in a divine civilization, the individual is so conditioned 
that with no fear of punishment, he shunneth the 
perpetration of crimes, seeth the crime itself as the severest 
of torments, and with alacrity and joy, setteth himself to 
acquiring the virtues of humankind, to furthering human 
progress, and to spreading light across the world.  
 
     106.  Among the greatest of all services that can possibly 
be rendered by man to Almighty God is the education and 
training of children, young plants of the &amp;Abha Paradise, so 
that these children, fostered by grace in the way of salvation, 
growing like pearls of divine bounty in the shell of 
education, will one day bejewel the crown of abiding glory.  
     It is, however, very difficult to undertake this service, 
even harder to succeed in it.  I hope that thou wilt acquit 
thyself well in this most important of tasks, and successfully 
carry the day, and become an ensign of God's abounding 
 
+P134 
grace; that these children, reared one and all in the holy 
Teachings, will develop natures like unto the sweet airs that 
blow across the gardens of the All-Glorious, and will waft 
their fragrance around the world.  
 
     107.  It is the hope of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha that those youthful 
souls in the schoolroom of the deeper knowledge will be 
tended by one who traineth them to love.  May they all, 
throughout the reaches of the spirit, learn well of the hidden 
mysteries; so well that in the Kingdom of the All-Glorious, 
each one of them, even as a nightingale endowed with 
speech, will cry out the secrets of the Heavenly Realm, and 
like unto a longing lover pour forth his sore need and utter 
want of the Beloved.  
 
     108.  Ye should consider the question of goodly 
character as of the first importance.  It is incumbent upon 
every father and mother to counsel their children over a 
long period, and guide them unto those things which lead 
to everlasting honour.  
     Encourage ye the school children, from their earliest 
years, to deliver speeches of high quality, so that in their 
leisure time they will engage in giving cogent and effective 
talks, expressing themselves with clarity and eloquence.  
 
     109.  O ye recipients of the favours of God!  In this new 
and wondrous Age, the unshakeable foundation is the 
teaching of sciences and arts.  According to explicit Holy 
Texts, every child must be taught crafts and arts, to the 
degree that is needful.  Wherefore, in every city and village, 
 
+P135 
schools must be established and every child in that city or 
village is to engage in study to the necessary degree.  
     It followeth that whatever soul shall offer his aid to bring 
this about will assuredly be accepted at the heavenly 
Threshold, and extolled by the Company on high.  
     Since ye have striven hard toward this all-important end, 
it is my hope that ye will reap your reward from the Lord of 
clear tokens and signs, and that the glances of heavenly 
grace will turn your way.  
 
     110.  As to the organization of the schools:  if possible 
the children should all wear the same kind of clothing, even 
if the fabric is varied.  It is preferable that the fabric as well 
should be uniform; if, however, this is not possible, there is 
no harm done.  The more cleanly the pupils are, the better; 
they should be immaculate.  The school must be located in 
a place where the air is delicate and pure.  The children must 
be carefully trained to be most courteous and well-behaved.  
They must be constantly encouraged and made eager to 
gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that 
from their earliest years they will be taught to have high 
aims, to conduct themselves well, to be chaste, pure, and 
undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful resolve and firm 
of purpose in all things.  Let them not jest and trifle, but 
earnestly advance unto their goals, so that in every situation 
they will be found resolute and firm.  
     Training in morals and good conduct is far more important 
than book learning.  A child that is cleanly, agreeable, 
of good character, well-behaved--even though he be 
ignorant--is preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, 
ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the 
sciences and arts.  The reason for this is that the child who 
 
+P136 
conducts himself well, even though he be ignorant, is of 
benefit to others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved child is 
corrupted and harmful to others, even though he be 
learned.  If, however, the child be trained to be both learned 
and good, the result is light upon light.  
     Children are even as a branch that is fresh and green; 
they will grow up in whatever way ye train them.  Take the 
utmost care to give them high ideals and goals, so that once 
they come of age, they will cast their beams like brilliant 
candles on the world, and will not be defiled by lusts and 
passions in the way of animals, heedless and unaware, but 
instead will set their hearts on achieving everlasting honour 
and acquiring all the excellences of humankind.  
 
     111.  The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and 
we must therefore hold fast to the tools of perception and 
knowledge.  Good character must be taught.  Light must be 
spread afar, so that, in the school of humanity, all may 
acquire the heavenly characteristics of the spirit, and see for 
themselves beyond any doubt that there is no fiercer hell, 
no more fiery abyss, than to possess a character that is evil 
and unsound; no more darksome pit nor loathsome torment 
than to show forth qualities which deserve to be 
condemned.  
     The individual must be educated to such a high degree 
that he would rather have his throat cut than tell a lie, and 
would think it easier to be slashed with a sword or pierced 
with a spear than to utter calumny or be carried away by 
wrath.  
     Thus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and 
pride, to burn away the reapings of lustful appetites.  Then 
will each one of God's beloved shine out as a bright moon 
 
+P137 
with qualities of the spirit, and the relationship of each to 
the Sacred Threshold of his Lord will be not illusory but 
sound and real, will be as the very foundation of the 
building, not some embellishment on its &amp;facade.  
     It followeth that the children's school must be a place of 
utmost discipline and order, that instruction must be 
thorough, and provision must be made for the rectification 
and refinement of character; so that, in his earliest years, 
within the very essence of the child, the divine foundation 
will be laid and the structure of holiness raised up.  
     Know that this matter of instruction, of character rectification 
and refinement, of heartening and encouraging the 
child, is of the utmost importance, for such are basic 
principles of God.  
     Thus, if God will, out of these spiritual schools illumined 
children will arise, adorned with all the fairest virtues of 
humankind, and will shed their light not only across Persia, 
but around the world.  
     It is extremely difficult to teach the individual and refine 
his character once puberty is passed.  By then, as experience 
hath shown, even if every effort be exerted to modify some 
tendency of his, it all availeth nothing.  He may, perhaps, 
improve somewhat today; but let a few days pass and he 
forgetteth, and turneth backward to his habitual condition 
and accustomed ways.  Therefore it is in early childhood 
that a firm foundation must be laid.  While the branch is 
green and tender it can easily be made straight.  
     Our meaning is that qualities of the spirit are the basic 
and divine foundation, and adorn the true essence of man; 
and knowledge is the cause of human progress.  The beloved 
of God must attach great importance to this matter, and 
carry it forward with enthusiasm and zeal.  
 
+P138 
     112.  In this holy Cause the question of orphans hath 
the utmost importance.  The greatest consideration must be 
shown towards orphans; they must be taught, trained and 
educated.  The Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, especially, must by 
all means be given to them as far as is possible.  
     I supplicate God that thou mayest become a kind parent 
to orphaned children, quickening them with the fragrances 
of the Holy Spirit, so that they will attain the age of 
maturity as true servants of the world of humanity and as 
bright candles in the assemblage of mankind.  
 
     113.  O handmaid of God!...  To the mothers must be 
given the divine Teachings and effective counsel, and they 
must be encouraged and made eager to train their children, 
for the mother is the first educator of the child.  It is she who 
must, at the very beginning, suckle the newborn at the 
breast of God's Faith and God's Law, that divine love may 
enter into him even with his mother's milk, and be with 
him till his final breath.  
     So long as the mother faileth to train her children, and 
start them on a proper way of life, the training which they 
receive later on will not take its full effect.  It is incumbent 
upon the Spiritual Assemblies to provide the mothers with 
a well-planned programme for the education of children, 
showing how, from infancy, the child must be watched 
over and taught.  These instructions must be given to every 
mother to serve her as a guide, so that each will train and 
nurture her children in accordance with the Teachings.  
     Thus will these young plants in the garden of God's love 
grow and flourish under the warmth of the Sun of Truth, 
the gentle spring winds of Heaven, and their mother's 
guiding hand.  Thus, in the &amp;Abha Paradise, will each become 
 
+P139 
a tree, bearing his clustered fruit, and each one, in this new 
and wondrous season, out of the bounties of the spring, will 
become possessed of all beauty and grace.  
 
     114.  O ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, 
the best of all ways to worship Him is to educate the children 
and train them in all the perfections of humankind; 
and no nobler deed than this can be imagined.  
 
     115.  O ye two well-loved handmaids of God!  Whatever 
a man's tongue speaketh, that let him prove by his 
deeds.  If he claimeth to be a believer, then let him act in 
accordance with the precepts of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  
     Praised be God, ye two have demonstrated the truth of 
your words by your deeds, and have won the confirmations 
of the Lord God.  Every day at first light, ye gather the 
&amp;Baha'i children together and teach them the communes 
and prayers.  This is a most praiseworthy act, and bringeth 
joy to the children's hearts:  that they should, at every 
morn, turn their faces toward the Kingdom and make 
mention of the Lord and praise His Name, and in the 
sweetest of voices, chant and recite.  
     These children are even as young plants, and teaching 
them the prayers is as letting the rain pour down upon 
them, that they may wax tender and fresh, and the soft 
breezes of the love of God may blow over them, making 
them to tremble with joy.  
     Blessedness awaiteth you, and a fair haven.  
 
+P140 
     116.  O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  Thy letters 
were received.  Their contents indicated that thy mother 
hath ascended to the invisible realm and that thou hast been 
left alone.  Thy wish is to serve thy father, who is dear to 
thee, and also to serve the Kingdom of God, and thou art 
perplexed as to which of the two thou shouldst do.  
Assuredly engage in service to thy father, and as well, whenever 
thou findest time, diffuse the divine fragrances.  
 
     117.  O dear one of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  Be the son of thy 
father and be the fruit of that tree.  Be a son that hath been 
born of his soul and heart and not only of water and 
clay.  A real son is such a one as hath branched from the 
spiritual part of man.  I ask God that thou mayest be at all 
times confirmed and strengthened.  
 
     118.  O ye young &amp;Baha'i children, ye seekers after true 
understanding and knowledge!  A human being is distinguished 
from an animal in a number of ways.  First of all, 
he is made in the image of God, in the likeness of the Supernal 
Light, even as the Torah saith, `Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.'+F1  This divine image betokeneth 
all the qualities of perfection whose lights, emanating from 
the Sun of Truth, illumine the realities of men.  And 
among the greatest of these attributes of perfection are wisdom and 
knowledge.  Ye must therefore put forth a mighty effort, 
striving by night and day and resting not for a moment, to 
acquire an abundant share of all the sciences and arts, that 
the Divine Image, which shineth out from the Sun of 
Truth, may illumine the mirror of the hearts of men.  
 
+F1 Genesis 1:26 
 
+P141 
     It is the longing desire of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to see each one of 
you accounted as the foremost professor in the academies, 
and in the school of inner significances, each one becoming 
a leader in wisdom.  
 
     119.  It is incumbent upon &amp;Baha'i children to surpass 
other children in the acquisition of sciences and arts, for 
they have been cradled in the grace of God.  
     Whatever other children learn in a year, let &amp;Baha'i children 
learn in a month.  The heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha longeth, 
in its love, to find that &amp;Baha'i young people, each and all, 
are known throughout the world for their intellectual 
attainments.  There is no question but that they will exert all 
their efforts, their energies, their sense of pride, to acquire 
the sciences and arts.  
 
     120.  O my dear children!  Your letter was received.  A 
degree of joy was attained that is beyond words or writing 
that, praise be to God, the power of the Kingdom of God 
hath trained such children who, from their early childhood, 
eagerly wish to acquire &amp;Baha'i education that they may, 
from the period of their childhood, engage in service to the 
world of humanity.  
     My highest wish and desire is that ye who are my children 
may be educated according to the teachings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and may receive a &amp;Baha'i training; that ye may 
each become a lighted candle in the world of humanity, 
may be devoted to the service of all mankind, may give up 
your rest and comfort, so that ye may become the cause of 
the tranquillity of the world of creation.  
     Such is my hope for you and I trust that ye may become 
 
+P142 
the cause of my joy and gladness in the Kingdom of 
God.  
 
     121.  O thou whose years are few, yet whose mental 
gifts are many!  How many a child, though young in years, 
is yet mature and sound in judgement!  How many an aged 
person is ignorant and confused!  For growth and development 
depend on one's powers of intellect and reason, not on 
one's age or length of days.  
     Although still in the season of childhood, yet hast thou 
recognized thy Lord, while myriads of women are oblivious 
of Him and are shut away from His heavenly Kingdom and 
deprived of His bestowals.  Render thou thanks unto thy 
Lord for this wondrous gift.  
     I beg of God to heal thy mother, who is honoured in the 
Kingdom of heaven.  
 
     122.  As to thy question regarding the education of 
children:  it behoveth thee to nurture them at the breast of 
the love of God, and urge them onward to the things of 
the spirit, that they may turn their faces unto God; that 
their ways may conform to the rules of good conduct 
and their character be second to none; that they make 
their own all the graces and praiseworthy qualities of 
humankind; acquire a sound knowledge of the various 
branches of learning, so that from the very beginning of 
life they may become spiritual beings, dwellers in the 
Kingdom, enamoured of the sweet breaths of holiness, 
and may receive an education religious, spiritual, and of 
the Heavenly Realm.  Verily will I call upon God to grant 
them a happy outcome in this.  
 
+P143 
     123.  O thou who gazest upon the Kingdom of God!  
Thy letter was received and we note that thou art engaged 
in teaching the children of the believers, that these tender 
little ones have been learning The Hidden Words and the 
prayers and what it meaneth to be a &amp;Baha'i.  
     The instruction of these children is even as the work of a 
loving gardener who tendeth his young plants in the 
flowering fields of the All-Glorious.  There is no doubt that 
it will yield the desired results; especially is this true of 
instruction as to &amp;Baha'i obligations and &amp;Baha'i conduct, for 
the little children must needs be made aware in their very 
heart and soul that `&amp;Baha'i' is not just a name but a truth.  
Every child must be trained in the things of the spirit, so 
that he may embody all the virtues and become a source of 
glory to the Cause of God.  Otherwise, the mere word 
`&amp;Baha'i', if it yield no fruit, will come to nothing.  
     Strive then to the best of thine ability to let these children 
know that a &amp;Baha'i is one who embodieth all the perfections, 
that he must shine out like a lighted taper--not be darkness 
upon darkness and yet bear the name `&amp;Baha'i'.  
     Name thou this school the &amp;Baha'i Sunday School.+F1  
 
     124.  The Sunday school for the children in which the 
Tablets and Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah are read, and the 
Word of God is recited for the children is indeed a blessed 
thing.  Thou must certainly continue this organized activity 
without cessation, and attach importance to it, so that day 
by day it may grow and be quickened with the breaths of 
the Holy Spirit.  If this activity is well organized, rest thou 
assured that it will yield great results.  Firmness and steadfastness, 
however, are necessary, otherwise it will continue 
 
+F1 A &amp;Baha'i children's class in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  
 
+P144 
for some time, but later be gradually forgotten.  Perseverance 
is an essential condition.  In every project firmness and steadfastness 
will undoubtedly lead to good results; otherwise it 
will exist for some days, and then be discontinued.  
 
     125.  The changing of teachers should be neither too 
frequent nor too much delayed; moderation is preferable.  
Holding your meetings when it is the time of prayer in other 
churches is not advisable; it would lead to alienation, since 
the &amp;Baha'i children who have their own Sunday school 
would be deprived of it if they tried to attend other Sunday 
schools.  Moreover, the admission of children of &amp;non-Baha'i 
parents to the school for &amp;Baha'i children is permissible.  And 
if, in this school, an outline of the fundamental principles 
underlying all religions be set forth for the information of 
the children, it can do no harm.  
     As the children are few in number, it is not possible to 
have different classes and naturally only one is necessary.  
Concerning the last question regarding differences among 
children, act as ye deem advisable.  
 
     126.  Thy letter was received.  Praise be to God it 
imparted the good news of thy health and safety and indicated 
that thou art ready to enter an agricultural school.  
This is highly suitable.  Strive as much as possible to become 
proficient in the science of agriculture, for in accordance 
with the divine teachings the acquisition of sciences and the 
perfection of arts are considered acts of worship.  If a man 
engageth with all his power in the acquisition of a science 
or in the perfection of an art, it is as if he has been worshipping 
God in churches and temples.  Thus as thou enterest 
 
+P145 
a school of agriculture and strivest in the acquisition of that 
science thou art day and night engaged in acts of worship--
acts that are accepted at the threshold of the Almighty.  
What bounty greater than this that science should be considered 
as an act of worship and art as service to the Kingdom 
of God.  
 
     127.  O thou servant of the One true God!  In this 
universal dispensation man's wondrous craftsmanship is 
reckoned as worship of the Resplendent Beauty.  Consider 
what a bounty and blessing it is that craftsmanship is 
regarded as worship.  In former times, it was believed that 
such skills were tantamount to ignorance, if not a misfortune, 
hindering man from drawing nigh unto God.  Now 
consider how His infinite bestowals and abundant favours 
have changed hell-fire into blissful paradise, and a heap of 
dark dust into a luminous garden.  
     It behoveth the craftsmen of the world at each moment 
to offer a thousand tokens of gratitude at the Sacred 
Threshold, and to exert their highest endeavour and diligently 
pursue their professions so that their efforts may 
produce that which will manifest the greatest beauty and 
perfection before the eyes of all men.  
 
     128.  Thy letter was received.  I hope that thou mayest 
be protected and assisted under the providence of the True 
One, be occupied always in mentioning the Lord and display 
effort to complete thy profession.  Thou must endeavour 
greatly so that thou mayest become unique in thy 
profession and famous in those parts, because attaining 
perfection in one's profession in this merciful period is 
 
+P146 
considered to be worship of God.  And whilst thou art 
occupied with thy profession, thou canst remember the True 
One.  
 
     129.  O Friends of the Pure and Omnipotent God!  To 
be pure and holy in all things is an attribute of the consecrated 
soul and a necessary characteristic of the unenslaved 
mind.  The best of perfections is immaculacy and 
the freeing of oneself from every defect.  Once the individual 
is, in every respect, cleansed and purified, then will he 
become a focal centre reflecting the Manifest Light.  
     First in a human being's way of life must be purity, then 
freshness, cleanliness, and independence of spirit.  First must 
the stream bed be cleansed, then may the sweet river waters 
be led into it.  Chaste eyes enjoy the beatific vision of the 
Lord and know what this encounter meaneth; a pure sense 
inhaleth the fragrances that blow from the rose gardens of 
His grace; a burnished heart will mirror forth the comely 
face of truth.  
     This is why, in Holy Scriptures, the counsels of heaven 
are likened to water, even as the &amp;Qur'an saith:  `And pure 
water send We down from Heaven,'+F1 and the Gospel:  
`Except a man be baptized of water and of the spirit, he 
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.'+F2  Thus is it clear 
that the Teachings which come from God are heavenly 
outpourings of grace; they are rain-showers of divine 
mercy, and they cleanse the human heart.  
     My meaning is this, that in every aspect of life, purity 
and holiness, cleanliness and refinement, exalt the human 
condition and further the development of man's inner 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 25:50 
+F2 cf. John 3:5 
 
+P147 
reality.  Even in the physical realm, cleanliness will conduce 
to spirituality, as the Holy Writings clearly state.  And 
although bodily cleanliness is a physical thing, it hath, 
nevertheless, a powerful influence on the life of the spirit.  It 
is even as a voice wondrously sweet, or a melody played:  
although sounds are but vibrations in the air which affect 
the ear's auditory nerve, and these vibrations are but chance 
phenomena carried along through the air, even so, see how 
they move the heart.  A wondrous melody is wings for the 
spirit, and maketh the soul to tremble for joy.  The purport 
is that physical cleanliness doth also exert its effect upon the 
human soul.  
     Observe how pleasing is cleanliness in the sight of God, 
and how specifically it is emphasized in the Holy Books of 
the Prophets; for the Scriptures forbid the eating or the use 
of any unclean thing.  Some of these prohibitions were 
absolute, and binding upon all, and whoso transgressed the 
given law was abhorred of God and anathematized by the 
believers.  Such, for example, were things categorically forbidden, 
the perpetration of which was accounted a most 
grievous sin, among them actions so loathsome that it is 
shameful even to speak their name.  
     But there are other forbidden things which do not cause 
immediate harm, and the injurious effects of which are only 
gradually produced:  such acts are also repugnant to the 
Lord, and blameworthy in His sight, and repellent.  The 
absolute unlawfulness of these, however, hath not been 
expressly set forth in the Text, but their avoidance is necessary 
to purity, cleanliness, the preservation of health, and 
freedom from addiction.  
     Among these latter is smoking tobacco, which is dirty, 
smelly, offensive--an evil habit, and one the harmfulness of 
which gradually becometh apparent to all.  Every qualified 
 
+P148 
physician hath ruled--and this hath also been proven by 
tests--that one of the components of tobacco is a deadly 
poison, and that the smoker is vulnerable to many and 
various diseases.  This is why smoking hath been plainly set 
forth as repugnant from the standpoint of hygiene.  
     The &amp;Bab, at the outset of His mission, explicitly prohibited 
tobacco, and the friends one and all abandoned its 
use.  But since those were times when dissimulation was 
permitted, and every individual who abstained from 
smoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even death
--the friends, in order not to advertise their beliefs, would 
smoke.  Later on, the Book of Aqdas was revealed, and since 
smoking tobacco was not specifically forbidden there, the 
believers did not give it up.  The Blessed Beauty, however, 
always expressed repugnance for it, and although, in the 
early days, there were reasons why He would smoke a little 
tobacco, in time He completely renounced it, and those 
sanctified souls who followed Him in all things also 
abandoned its use.  
     My meaning is that in the sight of God, smoking tobacco 
is deprecated, abhorrent, filthy in the extreme; and, albeit 
by degrees, highly injurious to health.  It is also a waste of 
money and time, and maketh the user a prey to a noxious 
addiction.  To those who stand firm in the Covenant, this 
habit is therefore censured both by reason and experience, 
and renouncing it will bring relief and peace of mind to all 
men.  Furthermore, this will make it possible to have a fresh 
mouth and unstained fingers, and hair that is free of a foul 
and repellent smell.  On receipt of this missive, the friends 
will surely, by whatever means and even over a period of 
time, forsake this pernicious habit.  Such is my hope.  
     As to opium, it is foul and accursed.  God protect us from 
the punishment He inflicteth on the user.  According to the 
 
+P149 
explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and 
its use is utterly condemned.  Reason showeth that smoking 
opium is a kind of insanity, and experience attesteth that the 
user is completely cut off from the human kingdom.  May 
God protect all against the perpetration of an act so hideous 
as this, an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation of 
what it is to be human, and which causeth the user to be 
dispossessed for ever and ever.  For opium fasteneth on the 
soul, so that the user's conscience dieth, his mind is blotted 
away, his perceptions are eroded.  It turneth the living into 
the dead.  It quencheth the natural heat.  No greater harm 
can be conceived than that which opium inflicteth.  Fortunate 
are they who never even speak the name of it; then 
think how wretched is the user.  
     O ye lovers of God!  In this, the cycle of Almighty God, 
violence and force, constraint and oppression, are one and 
all condemned.  It is, however, mandatory that the use of 
opium be prevented by any means whatsoever, that perchance 
the human race may be delivered from this most 
powerful of plagues.  And otherwise, woe and misery to 
whoso falleth short of his duty to his Lord.+F1  
     O Divine Providence!  Bestow Thou in all things purity 
and cleanliness upon the people of &amp;Baha.  Grant that they be 
freed from all defilement, and released from all addictions.  
Save them from committing any repugnant act, unbind 
them from the chains of every evil habit, that they may live 
pure and free, wholesome and cleanly, worthy to serve at 
Thy Sacred Threshold and fit to be related to their Lord.  
Deliver them from intoxicating drinks and tobacco, save 
them, rescue them, from this opium that bringeth on madness, 
suffer them to enjoy the sweet savours of holiness, that 
they may drink deep of the mystic cup of heavenly love and 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 39:57 
 
+P150 
know the rapture of being drawn ever closer unto the 
Realm of the All-Glorious.  For it is even as Thou hast said:  
`All that thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the thirst of 
my love--bring me, O cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit 
a cup full as the sea!'  
     O ye, God's loved ones!  Experience hath shown how 
greatly the renouncing of smoking, of intoxicating drink, 
and of opium, conduceth to health and vigour, to the 
expansion and keenness of the mind and to bodily strength.  
There is today a people+F1 who strictly avoid tobacco, intoxicating 
liquor and opium.  This people is far and away 
superior to the others, for strength and physical courage, for 
health, beauty and comeliness.  A single one of their men 
can stand up to ten men of another tribe.  This hath proved 
true of the entire people:  that is, member for member, each 
individual of this community is in every respect superior to 
the individuals of other communities.  
     Make ye then a mighty effort, that the purity and 
sanctity which, above all else, are cherished by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
shall distinguish the people of &amp;Baha; that in every 
kind of excellence the people of God shall surpass all other 
human beings; that both outwardly and inwardly they 
shall prove superior to the rest; that for purity, immaculacy, 
refinement, and the preservation of health, they shall be 
leaders in the vanguard of those who know.  And that by their 
freedom from enslavement, their knowledge, their self-control, 
they shall be first among the pure, the free and the wise.  
 
     130.  O thou distinguished physician!...  Praise be 
to God that thou hast two powers:  one to undertake 
physical healing and the other spiritual healing.  Matters 
 
+F1 Possibly &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was referring to the Sikhs; the 
+F1 description appears to apply to them.  
 
+P151 
related to man's spirit have a great effect on his bodily 
condition.  For instance, thou shouldst impart gladness to 
thy patient, give him comfort and joy, and bring him to 
ecstasy and exultation.  How often hath it occurred that 
this hath caused early recovery.  Therefore, treat thou the 
sick with both powers.  Spiritual feelings have a surprising 
effect on healing nervous ailments.  
 
     131.  When giving medical treatment turn to the 
Blessed Beauty, then follow the dictates of thy heart.  
Remedy the sick by means of heavenly joy and spiritual 
exultation, cure the sorely afflicted by imparting to them 
blissful glad tidings and heal the wounded through His 
resplendent bestowals.  When at the bedside of a patient, 
cheer and gladden his heart and enrapture his spirit through 
celestial power.  Indeed, such a heavenly breath quickeneth 
every mouldering bone and reviveth the spirit of every sick 
and ailing one.  
 
     132.  Although ill health is one of the unavoidable conditions 
of man, truly it is hard to bear.  The bounty of good 
health is the greatest of all gifts.  
 
     133.  There are two ways of healing sickness, material 
means and spiritual means.  The first is by the treatment of 
physicians; the second consisteth in prayers offered by the 
spiritual ones to God and in turning to Him.  Both means 
should be used and practised.  
     Illnesses which occur by reason of physical causes 
should be treated by doctors with medical remedies; those 
 
+P152 
which are due to spiritual causes disappear through spiritual 
means.  Thus an illness caused by affliction, fear, nervous 
impressions, will be healed more effectively by spiritual 
rather than by physical treatment.  Hence, both kinds of 
treatment should be followed; they are not contradictory.  
Therefore thou shouldst also accept physical remedies 
inasmuch as these too have come from the mercy and 
favour of God, Who hath revealed and made manifest 
medical science so that His servants may profit from this 
kind of treatment also.  Thou shouldst give equal attention 
to spiritual treatments, for they produce marvellous effects.  
     Now, if thou wishest to know the true remedy which 
will heal man from all sickness and will give him the 
health of the divine kingdom, know that it is the precepts 
and teachings of God.  Focus thine attention upon them.  
 
     134.  O thou who art attracted to the fragrant breathings 
of God!  I have read thy letter addressed to Mrs. Lua 
Getsinger.  Thou hast indeed examined with great care the 
reasons for the incursion of disease into the human body.  It 
is certainly the case that sins are a potent cause of physical 
ailments.  If humankind were free from the defilements of 
sin and waywardness, and lived according to a natural, 
inborn equilibrium, without following wherever their 
passions led, it is undeniable that diseases would no longer 
take the ascendant, nor diversify with such intensity.  
     But man hath perversely continued to serve his lustful 
appetites, and he would not content himself with simple 
foods.  Rather, he prepared for himself food that was compounded 
of many ingredients, of substances differing one 
from the other.  With this, and with the perpetrating of vile 
and ignoble acts, his attention was engrossed, and he 
 
+P153 
abandoned the temperance and moderation of a natural 
way of life.  The result was the engendering of diseases both 
violent and diverse.  
     For the animal, as to its body, is made up of the same 
constituent elements as man.  Since, however, the animal 
contenteth itself with simple foods and striveth not to 
indulge its importunate urges to any great degree, and 
committeth no sins, its ailments relative to man's are few.  
We see clearly, therefore, how powerful are sin and contumacy 
as pathogenic factors.  And once engendered these 
diseases become compounded, multiply, and are transmitted 
to others.  Such are the spiritual, inner causes of sickness.  
     The outer, physical causal factor in disease, however, is a 
disturbance in the balance, the proportionate equilibrium of 
all those elements of which the human body is composed.  
To illustrate:  the body of man is a compound of many constituent 
substances, each component being present in a prescribed 
amount, contributing to the essential equilibrium of 
the whole.  So long as these constituents remain in their due 
proportion, according to the natural balance of the whole--
that is, no component suffereth a change in its natural proportionate 
degree and balance, no component being either 
augmented or decreased--there will be no physical cause 
for the incursion of disease.  
     For example, the starch component must be present to a 
given amount, and the sugar to a given amount.  So long as 
each remaineth in its natural proportion to the whole, there 
will be no cause for the onset of disease.  When, however, 
these constituents vary as to their natural and due amounts
--that is, when they are augmented or diminished--it is 
certain that this will provide for the inroads of disease.  
     This question requireth the most careful investigation.  
The &amp;Bab hath said that the people of &amp;Baha must develop the 
 
+P154 
science of medicine to such a high degree that they will heal 
illnesses by means of foods.  The basic reason for this is that 
if, in some component substance of the human body, an 
imbalance should occur, altering its correct, relative proportion 
to the whole, this fact will inevitably result in the 
onset of disease.  If, for example, the starch component 
should be unduly augmented, or the sugar component decreased, 
an illness will take control.  It is the function of a 
skilled physician to determine which constituent of his 
patient's body hath suffered diminution, which hath been 
augmented.  Once he hath discovered this, he must prescribe 
a food containing the diminished element in considerable 
amounts, to re-establish the body's essential 
equilibrium.  The patient, once his constitution is again in 
balance, will be rid of his disease.  
     The proof of this is that while other animals have never 
studied medical science, nor carried on researches into 
diseases or medicines, treatments or cures--even so, when 
one of them falleth a prey to sickness, nature leadeth it, in 
fields or desert places, to the very plant which, once eaten, 
will rid the animal of its disease.  The explanation is that if, 
as an example, the sugar component in the animal's body 
hath decreased, according to a natural law the animal 
hankereth after a herb that is rich in sugar.  Then, by a 
natural urge, which is the appetite, among a thousand 
different varieties of plants across the field, the animal will 
discover and consume that herb which containeth a sugar 
component in large amounts.  Thus the essential balance of 
the substances composing its body is re-established, and the 
animal is rid of its disease.  
     This question requireth the most careful investigation.  
When highly-skilled physicians shall fully examine this 
matter, thoroughly and perseveringly, it will be clearly seen 
 
+P155 
that the incursion of disease is due to a disturbance in the 
relative amounts of the body's component substances, and 
that treatment consisteth in adjusting these relative amounts, 
and that this can be apprehended and made possible by 
means of foods.  
     It is certain that in this wonderful new age the development 
of medical science will lead to the doctors' healing 
their patients with foods.  For the sense of sight, the sense of 
hearing, of taste, of smell, of touch--all these are discriminative 
faculties, their purpose being to separate the 
beneficial from whatever causeth harm.  Now, is it possible 
that man's sense of smell, the sense that differentiates odours, 
should find some odour repugnant, and that odour be 
beneficial to the human body?  Absurd!  Impossible!  In the 
same way, could the human body, through the faculty of 
sight--the differentiator among things visible--benefit from 
gazing upon a revolting mass of excrement?  Never!  Again, 
if the sense of taste, likewise a faculty that selecteth and 
rejecteth, be offended by something, that thing is certainly 
not beneficial; and if, at the outset, it may yield some 
advantage, in the long run its harmfulness will be established.  
     And likewise, when the constitution is in a state of 
equilibrium, there is no doubt that whatever is relished will 
be beneficial to health.  Observe how an animal will graze in 
a field where there are a hundred thousand kinds of herbs 
and grasses, and how, with its sense of smell, it snuffeth up 
the odours of the plants, and tasteth them with its sense of 
taste; then it consumeth whatever herb is pleasurable to 
these senses, and benefiteth therefrom.  Were it not for this 
power of selectivity, the animals would all be dead in a 
single day; for there are a great many poisonous plants, and 
animals know nothing of the pharmacopoeia.  And yet, 
 
+P156 
observe what a reliable set of scales they have, by means of 
which to differentiate the good from the injurious.  Whatever 
constituent of their body hath decreased, they can 
rehabilitate by seeking out and consuming some plant that 
hath an abundant store of that diminished element; and thus 
the equilibrium of their bodily components is re-established, 
and they are rid of their disease.  
     At whatever time highly-skilled physicians shall have 
developed the healing of illnesses by means of foods, and 
shall make provision for simple foods, and shall prohibit 
humankind from living as slaves to their lustful appetites, it 
is certain that the incidence of chronic and diversified illnesses 
will abate, and the general health of all mankind will 
be much improved.  This is destined to come about.  In the 
same way, in the character, the conduct and the manners of 
men, universal modifications will be made.  
 
     135.  According to the explicit decree of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
one must not turn aside from the advice of a competent 
doctor.  It is imperative to consult one even if the patient 
himself be a well-known and eminent physician.  In short, 
the point is that you should maintain your health by consulting 
a highly-skilled physician.  
 
     136.  It is incumbent upon everyone to seek medical 
treatment and to follow the doctor's instructions, for this is 
in compliance with the divine ordinance, but, in reality, He 
Who giveth healing is God.  
 
     137.  O thou who art voicing the praises of thy Lord!  
 
+P157 
I have read thy letter, wherein thou didst express astonishment 
at some of the laws of God, such as that concerning 
the hunting of innocent animals, creatures who are guilty of 
no wrong.  
     Be thou not surprised at this.  Reflect upon the inner 
realities of the universe, the secret wisdoms involved, the 
enigmas, the inter-relationships, the rules that govern all.  
For every part of the universe is connected with every other 
part by ties that are very powerful and admit of no imbalance, 
nor any slackening whatever.  In the physical realm 
of creation, all things are eaters and eaten:  the plant drinketh 
in the mineral, the animal doth crop and swallow down the 
plant, man doth feed upon the animal, and the mineral 
devoureth the body of man.  Physical bodies are transferred 
past one barrier after another, from one life to another, and 
all things are subject to transformation and change, save 
only the essence of existence itself--since it is constant and 
immutable, and upon it is founded the life of every species 
and kind, of every contingent reality throughout the 
whole of creation.  
     Whensoever thou dost examine, through a microscope, 
the water man drinketh, the air he doth breathe, thou wilt 
see that with every breath of air, man taketh in an abundance 
of animal life, and with every draught of water, he also 
swalloweth down a great variety of animals.  How could it 
ever be possible to put a stop to this process?  For all 
creatures are eaters and eaten, and the very fabric of life is 
reared upon this fact.  Were it not so, the ties that interlace 
all created things within the universe would be unravelled.  
     And further, whensoever a thing is destroyed, and decayeth, 
and is cut off from life, it is promoted into a world 
that is greater than the world it knew before.  It leaveth, for 
example, the life of the mineral and goeth forward into the 
 
+P158 
life of the plant; then it departeth out of the vegetable life 
and ascendeth into that of the animal, following which it 
forsaketh the life of the animal and riseth into the realm of 
human life, and this is out of the grace of thy Lord, the 
Merciful, the Compassionate.  
     I beg of God that He will assist thee to comprehend the 
mysteries that lie at the heart of creation, and will draw 
away the veil from before thine eyes and thy sister's, that 
the well-guarded secret may be disclosed unto thee, and the 
hidden mystery be revealed as clear as the sun at noonday; 
that He will aid thy sister and thy husband to enter the 
Kingdom of God, and will heal thee of every ill, whether 
physical or spiritual, that assaileth one in this life.  
 
     138.  O ye beloved of the Lord!  The Kingdom of God 
is founded upon equity and justice, and also upon mercy, 
compassion, and kindness to every living soul.  Strive ye 
then with all your heart to treat compassionately all humankind
--except for those who have some selfish, private 
motive, or some disease of the soul.  Kindness cannot be 
shown the tyrant, the deceiver, or the thief, because, far 
from awakening them to the error of their ways, it maketh 
them to continue in their perversity as before.  No matter 
how much kindliness ye may expend upon the liar, he will 
but lie the more, for he believeth you to be deceived, while 
ye understand him but too well, and only remain silent out 
of your extreme compassion.  
     Briefly, it is not only their fellow human beings that the 
beloved of God must treat with mercy and compassion, 
rather must they show forth the utmost loving-kindness to 
every living creature.  For in all physical respects, and where 
 
+P159 
the animal spirit is concerned, the selfsame feelings are 
shared by animal and man.  Man hath not grasped this truth, 
however, and he believeth that physical sensations are confined 
to human beings, wherefore is he unjust to the animals, 
and cruel.  
     And yet in truth, what difference is there when it cometh 
to physical sensations?  The feelings are one and the same, 
whether ye inflict pain on man or on beast.  There is no 
difference here whatever.  And indeed ye do worse to harm 
an animal, for man hath a language, he can lodge a complaint, 
he can cry out and moan; if injured he can have 
recourse to the authorities and these will protect him from 
his aggressor.  But the hapless beast is mute, able neither to 
express its hurt nor take its case to the authorities.  If a man 
inflict a thousand ills upon a beast, it can neither ward him 
off with speech nor hale him into court.  Therefore is it 
essential that ye show forth the utmost consideration to the 
animal, and that ye be even kinder to him than to your 
fellow man.  
     Train your children from their earliest days to be 
infinitely tender and loving to animals.  If an animal be sick, 
let the children try to heal it, if it be hungry, let them feed 
it, if thirsty, let them quench its thirst, if weary, let them see 
that it rests.  
     Most human beings are sinners, but the beasts are innocent.  
Surely those without sin should receive the most kindness 
and love--all except animals which are harmful, such 
as bloodthirsty wolves, such as poisonous snakes, and similar 
pernicious creatures, the reason being that kindness to these 
is an injustice to human beings and to other animals as well.  
If, for example, ye be tender-hearted toward a wolf, this is 
but tyranny to a sheep, for a wolf will destroy a whole flock 
of sheep.  A rabid dog, if given the chance, can kill a 
 
+P160 
thousand animals and men.  Therefore, compassion shown 
to wild and ravening beasts is cruelty to the peaceful ones--
and so the harmful must be dealt with.  But to blessed 
animals the utmost kindness must be shown, the more the 
better.  Tenderness and loving-kindness are basic principles 
of God's heavenly Kingdom.  Ye should most carefully bear 
this matter in mind.  
 
     139.  O thou handmaid of God!  The heavenly glad 
tidings must be delivered with the utmost dignity and 
magnanimity.  And until a soul ariseth with qualities which 
are essential for the bearer of these tidings, his words will 
take no effect.  
     O bondswoman of God!  The human spirit possesseth 
wondrous powers, but it should be reinforced by the Holy 
Spirit.  What thou hearest other than this is pure imagination.  
If, however, it be assisted by the bounty of the Holy 
Spirit, then will its strength be a thing to marvel at.  Then 
will that human spirit uncover realities, and unravel 
mysteries.  Turn thy heart fully to the Holy Spirit, and invite 
others to do the same; then shall ye witness wonderful 
results.  
     O handmaid of God!  The stars in the sky do not exert 
any spiritual influence on this world of dust; but all the 
members and parts of the universe are very strongly linked 
together in that limitless space, and this connection produceth 
a reciprocity of material effects.  Outside the bounty 
of the Holy Spirit, whatsoever thou hearest as to the effect 
of trances, or the mediums' trumpets, conveying the singing 
voices of the dead, is imagination pure and simple.  As to the 
bounty of the Holy Spirit, however, relate whatsoever thou 
wilt--it cannot be overstated; believe, therefore, whatsoever 
 
+P161 
thou hearest of this.  But the persons referred to, the 
trumpet-people, are entirely shut out from this bounty and 
receive no portion thereof; their way is an illusion.  
     O handmaid of God!  Prayers are granted through the 
universal Manifestations of God.  Nevertheless, where the 
wish is to obtain material things, even where the heedless 
are concerned, if they supplicate, humbly imploring God's 
help--even their prayer hath an effect.  
     O handmaid of God!  Although the reality of Divinity is 
sanctified and boundless, the aims and needs of the creatures 
are restricted.  God's grace is like the rain that cometh down 
from heaven:  the water is not bounded by the limitations of 
form, yet on whatever place it poureth down, it taketh on 
limitations--dimensions, appearance, shape--according to 
the characteristics of that place.  In a square pool, the water, 
previously unconfined, becometh a square; in a six-sided 
pool it becometh a hexagon, in an eight-sided pool an 
octagon, and so forth.  The rain itself hath no geometry, no 
limits, no form, but it taketh on one form or another, 
according to the restrictions of its vessel.  In the same way, 
the Holy Essence of the Lord God is boundless, immeasurable, 
but His graces and splendours become finite in the 
creatures, because of their limitations, wherefore the 
prayers of given persons will receive favourable answers in 
certain cases.  
     O handmaid of God!  It is with the Lord Christ even as 
with Adam.  Did the first human being who came into 
existence on this earth have a father or mother?  It is certain 
that he had neither.  But Christ lacked only a father.  
     O handmaid of God!  The prayers which were revealed 
to ask for healing apply both to physical and spiritual 
healing.  Recite them, then, to heal both the soul and the 
body.  If healing is right for the patient, it will certainly be 
 
+P162 
granted; but for some ailing persons, healing would only be 
the cause of other ills, and therefore wisdom doth not 
permit an affirmative answer to the prayer.  
     O handmaid of God!  The power of the Holy Spirit 
healeth both physical and spiritual ailments.  
     O handmaid of God!  It is recorded in the Torah:  And I 
will give you the valley of Achor for a door of hope.  This 
valley of Achor is the city of &amp;Akka, and whoso hath interpreted 
this otherwise is of those who know not.  
 
     140.  Thou didst ask as to the transfiguration of Jesus, 
with Moses and Elias and the Heavenly Father on Mount 
Tabor, as referred to in the Bible.  This occurrence was perceived 
by the disciples with their inner eye, wherefore it 
was a secret hidden away, and was a spiritual discovery of 
theirs.  Otherwise, if the intent be that they witnessed 
physical forms, that is, witnessed that transfiguration with 
their outward eyes, then there were many others at hand on 
that plain and mountain, and why did they fail to behold it?  
And why did the Lord charge them that they should tell no 
man?  It is clear that this was a spiritual vision and a scene of 
the Kingdom.  Wherefore did the Messiah bid them to keep 
this hidden, `till the Son of Man were risen from the dead,'+F1
--that is, until the Cause of God should be exalted, and the 
Word of God prevail, and the reality of Christ rise up.  
 
     141.  O thou yearning flame, thou who art afire with 
the love of God!  I have read thy letter, and its contents, 
well-expressed and eloquent, delighted my heart, showing 
as they did thy deep sincerity in the Cause of God, thy 
 
+F1 Matthew 17:1-19; Mark 9:2-9; Luke 9:28-36 
 
+P163 
persevering steps along the pathway of His Kingdom, and 
thy staunchness in His Faith--for of all great things, this is 
the greatest in His sight.  
     How many a soul hath turned itself unto the Lord and 
entered into the protective shadow of His Word, and 
become famed throughout the world--for example, Judas 
Iscariot.  And then, when the tests grew harsh and the 
violence thereof intensified, their feet slipped on the pathway 
and they turned backward from the Faith after having 
acknowledged its truth, and they denied it, and fell away 
from harmony and love into mischief and hate.  Thus 
became visible the power of tests, which maketh mighty 
pillars to tremble and shake.  
     Judas Iscariot was the greatest of the disciples, and he 
summoned the people to Christ.  Then it seemed to him that 
Jesus was showing increasing regard to the Apostle Peter, 
and when Jesus said, `Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I 
will build My church,' these words addressed to Peter, and 
this singling out of Peter for special honour, had a marked 
effect on the Apostle, and kindled envy within the heart of 
Judas.  For this reason he who had once drawn nigh did turn 
aside, and he who had believed in the Faith denied it, and 
his love changed to hate, until he became a cause of the 
crucifixion of that glorious Lord, that manifest Splendour.  
Such is the outcome of envy, the chief reason why men turn 
aside from the Straight Path.  So hath it occurred, and 
will occur, in this great Cause.  But it doth not matter, for it 
engendereth loyalty in the rest, and maketh souls to arise 
who waver not, who are fixed and unshakeable as the mountains 
in their love for the Manifest Light.  
     Convey thou unto the handmaids of the Merciful the 
message that when a test turneth violent they must stand 
unmoved, and faithful to their love for &amp;Baha.  In winter 
 
+P164 
come the storms, and the great winds blow, but then will 
follow spring in all its beauty, adorning hill and plain with 
perfumed plants and red anemones, fair to see.  Then will 
the birds trill out upon the branches their songs of joy, and 
sermonize in lilting tones from the pulpits of the trees.  Erelong 
shall ye bear witness that the lights are streaming forth, 
the banners of the realm above are waving, the sweet scents 
of the All-Merciful are wafted abroad, the hosts of the 
Kingdom are marching down, the angels of heaven are 
rushing forward, and the Holy Spirit is breathing upon all 
those regions.  On that day thou shalt behold the waverers, 
men and women alike, frustrated of their hopes and in manifest 
loss.  This is decreed by the Lord, the Revealer of Verses.  
     As to thee, blessed art thou, for thou art steadfast in the 
Cause of God, firm in His Covenant.  I beg of Him to bestow 
upon thee a spiritual soul, and the life of the Kingdom, and 
to make thee a leaf verdant and flourishing on the Tree of 
Life, that thou mayest serve the handmaids of the Merciful 
with spirituality and good cheer.  
     Thy generous Lord will assist thee to labour in His vineyard 
and will cause thee to be the means of spreading the 
spirit of unity among His handmaids.  He will make thine 
inner eye to see with the light of knowledge, He will forgive 
thy sins and transform them into goodly deeds.  Verily 
He is the Forgiving, the Compassionate, the Lord of 
immeasurable grace.  
 
     142.  O thou dear handmaid of God!  Praise thou God, 
because thou art favoured at His Holy Threshold, and 
cherished in the Kingdom of His might.  Thou art the head 
of an assembly which is the very imprint of the Company 
on high, the mirror-image of the all-glorious realm.  Strive 
 
+P165 
thou with heart and soul, in prayerful humility and self-effacement, 
to uphold the Law of God and spread His sweet 
savours abroad.  Endeavour thou to become the true president 
of the assemblies of spiritual souls, and a companion to 
the angels in the realm of the All-Merciful.  
     Thou didst ask as to the tenth to the seventeenth verses of 
the twenty-first chapter of Saint John the Divine's Revelation.  
Know thou that according to mathematical principles, 
the firmament of this earth's brilliant day-star hath been 
divided among twelve constellations, which they call the 
twelve zodiacal signs.  In the same way, the Sun of Truth 
shineth out from and sheddeth its bounties through twelve 
stations of holiness, and by these heavenly signs are meant 
those stainless and unsullied personages who are the very 
well-springs of sanctity, and the dawning-points proclaiming 
the oneness of God.  
     Consider how in the days of the Interlocutor (Moses), 
there were twelve holy beings who were leaders of the 
twelve tribes; and likewise in the dispensation of the Spirit 
(Christ), note that there were twelve Apostles gathered 
within the sheltering shade of that supernal Light, and from 
those splendid dawning-points the Sun of Truth shone 
forth even as the sun in the sky.  Again, in the days of 
&amp;Muhammad, observe that there were twelve dawning-points 
of holiness, the manifestors of God's confirming help.  
Such is the way of it.  
     Accordingly did Saint John the Divine tell of twelve 
gates in his vision, and twelve foundations.  By `that great 
city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from 
God' is meant the holy Law of God, and this is set forth in 
many Tablets and still to be read in the Scriptures of the 
Prophets of the past:  for instance, that Jerusalem was seen 
going out into the wilderness.  
 
+P166 
     The meaning of the passage is that this heavenly Jerusalem 
hath twelve gates, through which the blessed enter into the 
City of God.  These gates are souls who are as guiding stars, 
as portals of knowledge and grace; and within these gates 
there stand twelve angels.  By `angel' is meant the power of 
the confirmations of God--that the candle of God's confirming 
power shineth out from the lamp-niche of those 
souls--meaning that every one of those beings will be 
granted the most vehement confirming support.  
     These twelve gates surround the entire world, that is they 
are a shelter for all creatures.  And further, these twelve 
gates are the foundation of the City of God, the heavenly 
Jerusalem, and on each one of these foundations is written 
the name of one of the Apostles of Christ.  That is to say, 
each one maketh manifest the perfections, the joyous 
message, and the excellency of that holy Being.  
     In brief, the Scripture saith:  `And he that talked with me 
had a rod made out of gold, that is, a measure, wherewith 
he measured the city and the gates thereof and the towers 
thereof.'  The meaning is that certain personages guided the 
people with a staff grown out of the earth, and shepherded 
them with a rod, like unto the rod of Moses.  Others trained 
and shepherded the people with a rod of iron, as in the 
dispensation of &amp;Muhammad.  And in this present cycle, 
because it is the mightiest of Dispensations, that rod grown 
out of the vegetable kingdom and that rod of iron will be 
transformed into a rod of purest gold, taken from out the 
endless treasure houses in the Kingdom of the Lord.  By this 
rod will the people be trained.  
     Note well the difference:  at one time the Teachings of 
God were as a staff, and by this means the Holy Scriptures 
were spread abroad, the Law of God was promulgated and 
His Faith established.  Then followed a time when the staff 
 
+P167 
of the true Shepherd was as iron.  And today, in this new 
and splendid age, the rod is even as pure gold.  How wide is 
the difference here!  Know, then, how much ground hath 
been gained by the Law of God and His Teachings in this 
dispensation, how they have reached such heights that they 
far transcend the dispensations gone before:  truly this rod is 
purest gold, while those of other days were of iron and 
wood.  
     This is a brief answer that hath been written for thee, 
because there was no time for more.  It is certain that thou 
wilt forgive me.  The handmaids of God must rise to such a 
station that they will, by themselves and unaided, comprehend 
these inner meanings, and be able to expound at 
full length every single word; a station where, out of the 
truth of their inmost hearts, a spring of wisdom will well 
up, and jet forth even as a fountain that leapeth from its 
own original source.  
 
     143.  O thou who hast drawn nigh unto the spirit of 
Christ in the Kingdom of God!  Verily the body is composed 
of physical elements, and every composite must needs be 
decomposed.  The spirit, however, is a single essence, fine 
and delicate, incorporeal, everlasting, and of God.  For this 
reason whoso looketh for Christ in His physical body hath 
looked in vain, and will be shut away from Him as by a 
veil.  But whoso yearneth to find Him in the spirit will 
grow from day to day in joy and desire and burning love, 
in closeness to Him, and in beholding Him clear and plain.  
In this new and wondrous day, it behoveth thee to seek 
after the spirit of Christ.  
     Verily the heaven into which the Messiah rose up was not 
 
+P168 
this unending sky, rather was His heaven the Kingdom of 
His beneficent Lord.  Even as He Himself hath said, `I came 
down from heaven,'+F1 and again, `The Son of Man is in 
heaven.'+F2  Hence it is clear that His heaven is beyond all 
directional points; it encircleth all existence, and is raised up 
for those who worship God.  Beg and implore thy Lord to 
lift thee up into that heaven, and give thee to eat of its food, 
in this age of majesty and might.  
     Know thou that the people, even unto this day, have 
failed to unravel the hidden secrets of the Book.  They 
imagine that Christ was excluded from His heaven in the 
days when He walked the earth, that He fell from the heights 
of His sublimity, and afterwards mounted to those upper 
reaches of the sky, to the heaven which doth not exist at all, 
for it is but space.  And they are waiting for Him to come 
down from there again, riding upon a cloud, and they 
imagine that there are clouds in that infinite space and that 
He will ride thereon and by that means He will descend.  
Whereas the truth is that a cloud is but vapour that riseth 
out of the earth, and it doth not come down from heaven.  
Rather, the cloud referred to in the Gospel is the human 
body, so called because the body is as a veil to man, which, 
even as a cloud, preventeth him from beholding the Sun of 
Truth that shineth from the horizon of Christ.  
     I beg of God to open before thine eyes the gates of 
discoveries and perceptions, that thou mayest become informed 
of His mysteries in this most manifest of days.  
     I am most eager to meet thee, but the times are not 
propitious.  God willing, we shall let thee know of a better 
time, when thou canst come rejoicing.  
 
+F1 John 6:38 
+F2 John 3:13 
 
+P169 
     144.  O lover of humankind!  Thy letter hath been 
received, and it telleth, God be praised, of thy health and 
well-being.  It appeareth, from thine answer to a previous 
letter, that feelings of affection were being established 
between thyself and the friends.  
     One must see in every human being only that which is 
worthy of praise.  When this is done, one can be a friend to 
the whole human race.  If, however, we look at people from 
the standpoint of their faults, then being a friend to them is 
a formidable task.  
     It happened one day in the time of Christ--may the life 
of the world be a sacrifice unto Him--that He passed by the 
dead body of a dog, a carcass reeking, hideous, the limbs 
rotting away.  One of those present said:  `How foul its 
stench!'  And another said:  `How sickening!  How loathsome!'  
To be brief, each one of them had something to add 
to the list.  
     But then Christ Himself spoke, and He told them:  `Look 
at that dog's teeth!  How gleaming white!'  
     The Messiah's sin-covering gaze did not for a moment 
dwell upon the repulsiveness of that carrion.  The one 
element of that dead dog's carcass which was not abomination 
was the teeth:  and Jesus looked upon their brightness.  
     Thus is it incumbent upon us, when we direct our gaze toward 
other people, to see where they excel, not where they fail.  
     Praise be to God, thy goal is to promote the well-being 
of humankind and to help the souls to overcome their 
faults.  This good intention will produce laudable results.  
 
     145.  Thou didst write as to the question of spiritual 
discoveries.  The spirit of man is a circumambient power that 
encompasseth the realities of all things.  Whatsoever thou 
 
+P170 
dost see about thee--wondrous products of human workmanship, 
inventions, discoveries and like evidences--each 
one of these was once a secret hidden away in the realm of 
the unknown.  The human spirit laid that secret bare, and 
drew it forth from the unseen into the visible world.  There 
is, for example, the power of steam, and photography and 
the phonograph, and wireless telegraphy, and advances in 
mathematics:  each and every one of these was once a 
mystery, a closely guarded secret, yet the human spirit unravelled 
these secrets and brought them out of the invisible 
into the light of day.  Thus is it clear that the human spirit is 
an all-encompassing power that exerteth its dominion over 
the inner essences of all created things, uncovering the well 
kept mysteries of the phenomenal world.  
     The divine spirit, however, doth unveil divine realities 
and universal mysteries that lie within the spiritual world.  
It is my hope that thou wilt attain unto this divine spirit, so 
that thou mayest uncover the secrets of the other world, as 
well as the mysteries of the world below.  
     Thou didst ask as to chapter 14, verse 30 of the Gospel of 
John, where the Lord Christ saith, `Hereafter I will not 
talk much with you:  for the Prince of this world cometh, 
and hath nothing in Me.'  The Prince of this world is the 
Blessed Beauty; and `hath nothing in Me' signifieth:  after 
Me all will draw grace from Me, but He is independent of 
Me, and will draw no grace from Me.  That is, He is rich 
beyond any grace of Mine.  
     As to thy question regarding discoveries made by the 
soul after it hath put off its human form:  certainly, that 
world is a world of perceptions and discoveries, for the 
interposed veil will be lifted away and the human spirit will 
gaze upon souls that are above, below, and on a par with 
itself.  It is similar to the condition of a human being in the 
 
+P171 
womb, where his eyes are veiled, and all things are hidden 
away from him.  Once he is born out of the uterine world 
and entereth this life, he findeth it, with relation to that of 
the womb, to be a place of perceptions and discoveries, and 
he observeth all things through his outer eye.  In the same 
way, once he hath departed this life, he will behold, in that 
world whatsoever was hidden from him here:  but there 
he will look upon and comprehend all things with his inner 
eye.  There will he gaze on his fellows and his peers, and 
those in the ranks above him, and those below.  As for what 
is meant by the equality of souls in the all-highest realm, it 
is this:  the souls of the believers, at the time when they first 
become manifest in the world of the body, are equal, and 
each is sanctified and pure.  In this world, however, they 
will begin to differ one from another, some achieving the 
highest station, some a middle one, others remaining at the 
lowest stage of being.  Their equal status is at the beginning 
of their existence; the differentiation followeth their passing 
away.  
     Thou didst write as to Seir.  Seir is a locality near 
Nazareth in Galilee.  
     As to the statement of Job, chapter 19, verses 25-27, `I 
know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at 
the latter day upon the earth,' the meaning here is:  I shall 
not be abased, I have a Sustainer and a Guardian, and my 
Helper, my Defender will in the end be made manifest.  And 
although now my flesh be weak and clothed with worms, 
yet shall I be healed, and with these mine own eyes, that is, 
mine inner sight, I shall behold Him.  This did Job say after 
they had reproached him, and he himself had lamented the 
harms that his tribulations had wreaked upon him.  And 
even when, from the terrible inroads of the sickness, his 
body was covered with worms, he sought to tell those 
 
+P172 
about him that still he would be fully healed, and that in his 
very body, with his very eyes, he would gaze on his 
Redeemer.  
     As to the woman in the Revelation of Saint John, chapter 
12, who fled into the wilderness, and the great wonder 
appearing in the heavens--that woman clothed with the 
sun, with the moon under her feet:  what is meant by the 
woman is the Law of God.  For according to the terminology 
of the Holy Books, this reference is to the Law, the 
woman being its symbol here.  And the two luminaries, the 
sun and the moon, are the two thrones, the Turkish and the 
Persian, these two being under the rule of the Law of God.  
The sun is the symbol of the Persian Empire, and the moon, 
that is, the crescent, of the Turkish.  The twelve-fold crown 
is the twelve &amp;Imams, who, even as the Apostles, supported 
the Faith of God.  The newborn Child is the Beauty of the 
Adored One,+F1 come forth out of the Law of God.  He then 
saith that the woman fled into the wilderness, that is, the 
Law of God was carried out of Palestine to the desert of 
&amp;Hijaz, where it remained 1260 years--that is, until the 
advent of the promised Child.  And as is well known, in the 
Holy Books, every day is accounted as one year.  
 
     146.  O thou handmaid afire with the love of God!  I 
have considered thine excellent letter, and thanked God for 
thy safe arrival in that great city.  I beg of Him, through His 
unfailing aid, to cause this return of thine to exert a powerful 
effect.  Such a thing can only come about if thou dost 
divest thyself of all attachment to this world, and dost put 
on the vesture of holiness; if thou dost limit all thy thoughts 
and all thy words to the remembrance of God and His 
 
+F1 The &amp;Bab, cf. Some Answered Questions, chap. XIII.  
 
+P173 
praise; to spreading His sweet savours abroad, and performing 
righteous acts; and if thou dost devote thyself to 
awakening the heedless and restoring sight to the blind, 
hearing to the deaf, speech to the mute, and through the 
power of the spirit, giving life to the dead.  
     For even as Christ said of them in the Gospel, the people 
are blind, they are deaf, they are dumb; and He said:  `I will 
heal them.'  
     Be thou kind and compassionate to thine enfeebled 
mother, and speak to her of the Kingdom, that her heart 
may rejoice.  
     Give thou my greetings to Miss Ford.  Convey to her the 
glad tidings that these are the days of the Kingdom of God.  
Say unto her:  Blessed art thou for thy noble aims, blessed 
art thou for thy goodly deeds, blessed art thou for thy 
spiritual nature.  Verily do I love thee on account of these 
thine aims and qualities and deeds.  Tell her further:  
Remember the Messiah, and His days on earth, and His 
abasement, and His tribulations, and how the people paid 
Him no mind.  Remember how the Jews would hold Him 
up to ridicule, and mock at Him, and address Him with:  
`Peace be upon thee, King of the Jews!  Peace be upon thee, 
King of Kings!'  How they would say that He was mad, and 
would ask how the Cause of that crucified One could ever 
spread out to the easts of the world and the wests thereof.  
None followed Him then, save only a few souls who were 
fishermen, carpenters, and other plain folk.  Alas, alas, for 
such delusions!  
     And see what happened then:  how their mighty banners 
were reversed, and in their place His most exalted standard 
lifted up; how all the bright stars in that heaven of honour 
and pride did set; how they sank in the west of all that 
vanisheth--while His brilliant Orb still shineth down out of 
 
+P174 
skies of undying glory, as the centuries and the ages roll by.  
Be ye then admonished, ye that have eyes to see!  Erelong 
shall ye behold even greater things than this.  
     Know thou that all the powers combined have not the 
power to establish universal peace, nor to withstand the 
overmastering dominion, at every time and season, of these 
endless wars.  Erelong, however, shall the power of heaven, 
the dominion of the Holy Spirit, hoist on the high summits 
the banners of love and peace, and there above the castles of 
majesty and might shall those banners wave in the rushing 
winds that blow out of the tender mercy of God.  
     Convey thou my greetings to Mrs. Florence, and tell her:  
The diverse congregations have given up the ground of 
their belief, and adopted doctrines that are of no account in 
the sight of God.  They are even as the Pharisees who both 
prayed and fasted, and then did sentence Jesus Christ to 
death.  By the life of God!  This thing is passing strange!  
     As to thee, O handmaid of God, softly recite thou this 
commune to thy Lord, and say unto Him:  
 
          O God, my God!  Fill up for me the cup of detachment 
     from all things, and in the assembly of Thy 
     splendours and bestowals, rejoice me with the wine of 
     loving Thee.  Free me from the assaults of passion and 
     desire, break off from me the shackles of this nether 
     world, draw me with rapture unto Thy supernal realm, 
     and refresh me amongst the handmaids with the breathings 
     of Thy holiness.  
          O Lord, brighten Thou my face with the lights of 
     Thy bestowals, light Thou mine eyes with beholding the 
     signs of Thine all-subduing might; delight my heart 
     with the glory of Thy knowledge that encompasseth all 
     things, gladden Thou my soul with Thy soul-reviving 
 
+P175 
     tidings of great joy, O Thou King of this world and the 
     Kingdom above, O Thou Lord of dominion and might, 
     that I may spread abroad Thy signs and tokens, and 
     proclaim Thy Cause, and promote Thy Teachings, and 
     serve Thy Law, and exalt Thy Word.  
          Thou art verily the Powerful, the Ever-Giving, the 
     Able, the Omnipotent.  
 
     As to the fundamentals of teaching the Faith:  know thou 
that delivering the Message can be accomplished only 
through goodly deeds and spiritual attributes, an utterance 
that is crystal clear and the happiness reflected from the face 
of that one who is expounding the Teachings.  It is essential 
that the deeds of the teacher should attest the truth of his 
words.  Such is the state of whoso doth spread abroad the 
sweet savours of God and the quality of him who is sincere 
in his faith.  
     Once the Lord hath enabled thee to attain this condition, 
be thou assured that He will inspire thee with words of 
truth, and will cause thee to speak through the breathings of 
the Holy Spirit.  
 
     147.  Reflect upon the past events of the time of 
Christ, and the present events shall become clear and manifest.  
 
     148.  O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!  
Thankful, the birds of the spirit seek only to fly in the high 
heavens and to sing out their songs with wondrous art.  But 
the pitiable earthworms love only to tunnel into the ground, 
and what a mighty struggle they make to get themselves 
down into its depths!  Even so are the sons of earth.  Their 
 
+P176 
highest aim is to augment their means of continuing on, in 
this vanishing world, this death in life; and this despite the 
fact that they are bound hand and foot by a thousand cares 
and sorrows, and never safe from danger, not even for the 
twinkling of an eye; never at any time secure, even from 
sudden death.  Wherefore, after a brief span, are they 
utterly effaced, and no sign remaineth to tell of them, and 
no word of them is ever heard again.  
     Then let you engage in the praise of &amp;Baha'u'llah, for it is 
through His grace and succour that ye have become sons 
and daughters of the Kingdom; it is thanks to Him that ye 
are now songsters in the meadows of truth, and have soared 
upward to the heights of the glory that abideth forever.  Ye 
have found your place in the world that dieth not; the 
breaths of the Holy Spirit have blown upon you; ye have 
taken on another life, ye have gained access to the Threshold 
of God.  
     Wherefore, with great gladness, establish ye spiritual 
assemblies, and engage ye in uttering the praise and glorification 
of the Lord, and calling Him Holy and Most Great.  
Lift up to the realm of the All-Glorious your suppliant cries 
for help, and voice ye at every moment a myriad thanks for 
having won this abounding favour and exceeding grace.  
 
     149.  O thou who hast eyes to see!  That which thou 
didst witness is the very truth, and it pertaineth to the realm 
of vision.  
     The perfume is intimately commingled and blended with 
the bud, and once the bud hath opened the sweet scent of 
it is spread abroad.  The herb is not without its fruit, although 
it seemeth so, for in this garden of God every plant 
exerteth its own influence and hath its own properties, and 
 
+P177 
every plant can even match the laughing, hundred-petalled 
rose in rejoicing the sense with its fragrance.  Be thou 
assured of this.  Although the pages of a book know nothing 
of the words and the meanings traced upon them, even so, 
because of their connection with these words, friends pass 
them reverently from hand to hand.  This connection, 
furthermore, is purest bounty.  
     When the human soul soareth out of this transient heap 
of dust and riseth into the world of God, then veils will fall 
away, and verities will come to light, and all things unknown 
before will be made clear, and hidden truths be 
understood.  
     Consider how a being, in the world of the womb, was 
deaf of ear and blind of eye, and mute of tongue; how he 
was bereft of any perceptions at all.  But once, out of that 
world of darkness, he passed into this world of light, then 
his eye saw, his ear heard, his tongue spoke.  In the same way, 
once he hath hastened away from this mortal place into the 
Kingdom of God, then he will be born in the spirit; then 
the eye of his perception will open, the ear of his soul will 
hearken, and all the truths of which he was ignorant before 
will be made plain and clear.  
     An observant traveller passing along a way will certainly 
recall his discoveries to mind, unless some accident befall 
him and efface the memory.  
 
     150.  O thou handmaid aflame with the fire of God's 
love!  Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this 
nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, 
for both shall pass away.  This present life is even as a swelling 
wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows.  Could ever a distorted 
image on the desert serve as refreshing waters?  No, 
 
+P178 
by the Lord of Lords!  Never can reality and the mere 
semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference 
between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom 
thereof.  
     Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this 
nether place is only its shadow stretching out.  A shadow 
hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and 
nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming 
as pictures to the eye.  
     Rely upon God.  Trust in Him.  Praise Him, and call Him 
continually to mind.  He verily turneth trouble into ease, 
and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace.  He verily 
hath dominion over all things.  
     If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself 
from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass.  Nay rather, 
under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield 
up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth.  
This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world.  
 
     151.  O thou believer in the oneness of God!  Know 
thou that nothing profiteth a soul save the love of the All-Merciful, 
nothing lighteth up a heart save the splendour 
that shineth from the realm of the Lord.  
     Forsake thou every other concern, let oblivion overtake 
the memory of all else.  Confine thy thoughts to whatever 
will lift up the human soul to the Paradise of heavenly 
grace, and make every bird of the Kingdom wing its way 
unto the Supreme Horizon, the central point of everlasting 
honour in this contingent world.  
 
+P179 
     152.  As to the question regarding the soul of a murderer, 
and what his punishment would be, the answer given was 
that the murderer must expiate his crime:  that is, if they put 
the murderer to death, his death is his atonement for his 
crime, and following the death, God in His justice will 
impose no second penalty upon him, for divine justice 
would not allow this.  
 
     153.  O thou handmaid of God!  In this day, to thank 
God for His bounties consisteth in possessing a radiant 
heart, and a soul open to the promptings of the spirit.  This is 
the essence of thanksgiving.  
     As for offering thanks by speaking out or writing, although 
this is indeed acceptable, yet when compared with 
that other thanksgiving, it is only a semblance and unreal; 
for the essential thing is these intimations of the spirit, these 
emanations from the deep recess of the heart.  It is my hope 
that thou wilt be favoured therewith.  
     Regarding one's lack of capacity and one's undeserving 
on the Day of Resurrection, this does not cause one to be 
shut out from gifts and bounties; for this is not the Day of 
Justice but the Day of Grace, while justice is allotting to each 
whatever is his due.  Then look thou not at the degree of thy 
capacity, look thou at the boundless favour of &amp;Baha'u'llah; 
all-encompassing is His bounty, and consummate His grace.  
     I ask of God that with His assistance and strong support 
thou mayest teach the inner meanings of the Torah with 
eloquence, understanding, vigour and skill.  Turn thy face 
toward the Kingdom of God, ask for the bestowals of the 
Holy Spirit, speak, and the confirmations of the Spirit will 
come.  
     As for that mighty solar orb which thou didst behold in 
 
+P180 
thy dream, that was the Promised One, and its spreading rays 
were His bounties, and the translucent surface of the mass of 
water signifieth hearts that are undefiled and pure, while 
the surging waves denote the great excitement of those 
hearts and the fact that they were shaken and deeply moved, 
that is, the waves are the stirrings of the spirit and holy 
intimations of the soul.  Praise thou God that in the world of 
the dream thou hast witnessed such disclosures.  
     With reference to what is meant by an individual 
becoming entirely forgetful of self:  the intent is that he 
should rise up and sacrifice himself in the true sense, that is, 
he should obliterate the promptings of the human condition, 
and rid himself of such characteristics as are worthy of 
blame and constitute the gloomy darkness of this life on 
earth--not that he should allow his physical health to 
deteriorate and his body to become infirm.  
     I do earnestly and humbly supplicate at the Holy Threshold 
that heavenly blessings and divine forgiveness will 
encompass thy dear mother, as well as thy loving sisters and 
relatives.  Especially do I pray on behalf of thy betrothed, 
who hath suddenly hastened away from this world into the 
next.  
 
     154.  O thou son of the Kingdom!  Thy most agreeable 
letters, with their pleasing style, ever gladden our hearts.  
When the song is of the Kingdom, it rejoiceth the soul.  
     Praise thou God that thou hast travelled to that country+F1 
for the purpose of raising up His Word and spreading 
abroad the holy fragrance of His Kingdom, and that thou 
art serving as a gardener in the gardens of heaven.  Erelong 
shall thine efforts be crowned with success.  
 
+F1 Germany 
 
+P181 
     O thou son of the Kingdom!  All things are beneficial if 
joined with the love of God; and without His love all things 
are harmful, and act as a veil between man and the Lord of 
the Kingdom.  When His love is there, every bitterness 
turneth sweet, and every bounty rendereth a wholesome 
pleasure.  For example, a melody, sweet to the ear, bringeth 
the very spirit of life to a heart in love with God, yet 
staineth with lust a soul engrossed in sensual desires.  And 
every branch of learning, conjoined with the love of 
God, is approved and worthy of praise; but bereft of His 
love, learning is barren--indeed, it bringeth on madness.  
Every kind of knowledge, every science, is as a tree:  if the 
fruit of it be the love of God, then is it a blessed tree, but if 
not, that tree is but dried-up wood, and shall only feed the 
fire.  
     O thou loyal servant of God and thou spiritual healer of 
man!  Whensoever thou dost attend a patient, turn thy face 
toward the Lord of the heavenly Kingdom, ask the Holy 
Spirit to come to thine aid, then heal thou the sickness.  
 
     155.  O thou flame of God's love!  What thou hast 
written hath brought great joy, for thy letter was as a 
garden from which roses of inner meanings spread abroad 
the sweet exhalations of the love of God.  In the same way, 
my answers will serve as rainshowers and dew, to bestow 
on those spiritual plants that have blossomed in the garden 
of thy heart more freshness and delicate beauty than words 
can tell.  
     Thou didst write of afflictive tests that have assailed thee.  
To the loyal soul, a test is but God's grace and favour; for 
the valiant doth joyously press forward to furious battle on 
the field of anguish, when the coward, whimpering with 
 
+P182 
fright, will tremble and shake.  So too, the proficient 
student, who hath with great competence mastered his 
subjects and committed them to memory, will happily 
exhibit his skills before his examiners on the day of his tests.  
So too will solid gold wondrously gleam and shine out in 
the assayer's fire.  
     It is clear, then, that tests and trials are, for sanctified souls, 
but God's bounty and grace, while to the weak, they are a 
calamity, unexpected and sudden.  
     These tests, even as thou didst write, do but cleanse the 
spotting of self from off the mirror of the heart, till the Sun 
of Truth can cast its rays thereon; for there is no veil more 
obstructive than the self, and however tenuous that veil may 
be, at the last it will completely shut a person out, and 
deprive him of his portion of eternal grace.  
     O thou enraptured handmaid of the Lord!  When the 
believers, men and women, pass in thought before my eyes, 
I feel myself warmed at the fire of God's love, and I pray 
that the Almighty will succour those holy souls with His 
invisible hosts.  Praised be the Lord that the prophecies of all 
His Manifestations have now been clearly fulfilled, in this 
greatest of all days, this holy and blessed age.  
     O thou enraptured handmaid of God!  Nearness is verily 
of the soul, not of the body; and the help that is sought, and 
the help that cometh, is not material but of the spirit; 
nevertheless it is my hope that thou wilt attain to nearness 
in every sense.  The bounties of God will verily encompass a 
sanctified soul even as the sun's light doth the moon and 
stars:  be thou assured of this.  
     Waft thou to each one of the believers, men and women 
alike, fragrant breaths of holiness on behalf of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Inspire them all and urge them on to shed abroad the 
sweet savours of the Lord.  
 
+P183 
     156.  O thou servant of the Holy Threshold!  We have 
read what flowed out from thy pen in thy love for God, 
and found the contents of thy letter most pleasing.  My hope 
is that through the bounty of God, the breaths of the All-Merciful 
will at all times refresh and renew thee.  
     Thou didst write of reincarnation.  A belief in reincarnation 
goeth far back into the ancient history of almost all 
peoples, and was held even by the philosophers of Greece, 
the Roman sages, the ancient Egyptians, and the great 
Assyrians.  Nevertheless such superstitions and sayings are 
but absurdities in the sight of God.  
     The major argument of the reincarnationists was this, 
that according to the justice of God, each must receive his 
due:  whenever a man is afflicted with some calamity, for 
example, this is because of some wrong he hath committed.  
But take a child that is still in its mother's womb, the 
embryo but newly formed, and that child is blind, deaf, 
lame, defective--what sin hath such a child committed, to 
deserve its afflictions?  They answer that, although to outward 
seeming the child, still in the womb, is guilty of no 
sin--nevertheless he perpetrated some wrong when in his 
previous form, and thus he came to deserve his punishment.  
     These individuals, however, have overlooked the following 
point.  If creation went forward according to only one 
rule, how could the all-encompassing Power make Itself 
felt?  How could the Almighty be the One Who `doeth as 
He pleaseth and ordaineth as He willeth'?+F1  
     Briefly, a return is indeed referred to in the Holy Scriptures, 
but by this is meant the return of the qualities, conditions, 
effects, perfections, and inner realities of the lights 
which recur in every dispensation.  The reference is not to 
specific, individual souls and identities.  
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 3:35; 2:254 
 
+P184 
     It may be said, for instance, that this lamplight is last 
night's come back again, or that last year's rose hath returned 
to the garden this year.  Here the reference is not to 
the individual reality, the fixed identity, the specialized 
being of that other rose, rather doth it mean that the qualities, 
the distinctive characteristics of that other light, that 
other flower, are present now, in these.  Those perfections, 
that is, those graces and gifts of a former springtime are 
back again this year.  We say, for example, that this fruit is 
the same as last year's; but we are thinking only of the 
delicacy, bloom and freshness, and the sweet taste of it; for 
it is obvious that that impregnable centre of reality, that 
specific identity, can never return.  
     What peace, what ease and comfort did the Holy Ones 
of God ever discover during Their sojourn in this nether 
world, that They should continually seek to come back and 
live this life again?  Doth not a single turn at this anguish, 
these afflictions, these calamities, these body blows, these 
dire straits, suffice, that They should wish for repeated visits 
to the life of this world?  This cup was not so sweet that one 
would care to drink of it a second time.  
     Therefore do the lovers of the &amp;Abha Beauty wish for no 
other recompense but to reach that station where they may 
gaze upon Him in the Realm of Glory, and they walk no 
other path save over desert sands of longing for those 
exalted heights.  They seek that ease and solace which will 
abide forever, and those bestowals that are sanctified beyond 
the understanding of the worldly mind.  
     When thou lookest about thee with a perceptive eye, 
thou wilt note that on this dusty earth all humankind are 
suffering.  Here no man is at rest as a reward for what he 
hath performed in former lives; nor is there anyone so 
blissful as seemingly to pluck the fruit of bygone anguish.  
 
+P185 
And if a human life, with its spiritual being, were limited 
to this earthly span, then what would be the harvest of 
creation?  Indeed, what would be the effects and the outcomes 
of Divinity Itself?  Were such a notion true, then all 
created things, all contingent realities, and this whole 
world of being--all would be meaningless.  God forbid 
that one should hold to such a fiction and gross error.  
     For just as the effects and the fruitage of the uterine life 
are not to be found in that dark and narrow place, and only 
when the child is transferred to this wide earth do the 
benefits and uses of growth and development in that previous 
world become revealed--so likewise reward and 
punishment, heaven and hell, requital and retribution for 
actions done in this present life, will stand revealed in that 
other world beyond.  And just as, if human life in the womb 
were limited to that uterine world, existence there would 
be nonsensical, irrelevant--so too if the life of this world, 
the deeds here done and their fruitage, did not come forth 
in the world beyond, the whole process would be irrational 
and foolish.  
     Know then that the Lord God possesseth invisible realms 
which the human intellect can never hope to fathom nor 
the mind of man conceive.  When once thou hast cleansed 
the channel of thy spiritual sense from the pollution of this 
worldly life, then wilt thou breathe in the sweet scents of 
holiness that blow from the blissful bowers of that heavenly 
land.  
     The Glory rest upon thee, and upon whosoever turneth 
toward and gazeth on the Kingdom of the All-Glorious, 
which the Lord hath sanctified beyond the understanding of 
those who are neglectful of Him, and hath hid from the 
eyes of those who show Him pride.  
 
+P186 
     157.  O ye who are strongly attracted!  O ye who are 
mindful!  O ye who are advancing unto the Kingdom of 
God!  Verily with all my heart and soul and with all lowliness 
do I supplicate the Lord God to make of you ensigns of 
guidance, banners of righteousness, well-springs of understanding 
and knowledge, that through you He may lead the 
seekers unto the straight path and guide them to the broad 
way of truth in this mightiest of ages.  
     O ye loved ones of God!  Know ye that the world is even 
as a mirage rising over the sands, that the thirsty mistaketh 
for water.  The wine of this world is but a vapour in the 
desert, its pity and compassion but toil and trouble, the 
repose it proffereth only weariness and sorrow.  Abandon it 
to those who belong to it, and turn your faces unto the 
Kingdom of your Lord the All-Merciful, that His grace and 
bounty may cast their dawning splendours over you, and a 
heavenly table may be sent down for you, and your Lord 
may bless you, and shower His riches upon you to gladden 
your bosoms and fill your hearts with bliss, to attract your 
minds, and cleanse your souls, and console your eyes.  
     O ye loved ones of God!  Is there any giver save God?  He 
singleth out for His mercy whomsoever He willeth.  Erelong 
will He open before you the gates of His knowledge 
and fill up your hearts with His love.  He will cheer your 
souls with the gentle winds of His holiness and make bright 
your faces with the splendours of His lights, and exalt the 
memory of you amongst all peoples.  Your Lord is verily 
the Compassionate, the Merciful.  
     He will come to your aid with invisible hosts, and support 
you with armies of inspiration from the Concourse 
above; He will send unto you sweet perfumes from the 
highest Paradise, and waft over you the pure breathings 
that blow from the rose gardens of the Company on high.  
 
+P187 
He will breathe into your hearts the spirit of life, cause you 
to enter the Ark of salvation, and reveal unto you His clear 
tokens and signs.  Verily is this abounding grace.  Verily is 
this the victory that none can deny.  
 
     158.  Grieve thou not over the ascension of my beloved 
Breakwell, for he hath risen unto a rose garden of splendours 
within the &amp;Abha Paradise, sheltered by the mercy of 
his mighty Lord, and he is crying at the top of his voice:  
`O that my people could know how graciously my Lord 
hath forgiven me, and made me to be of those who have 
attained His Presence!'+F1  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Where now is thy fair face?  Where is thy fluent 
     tongue?  Where thy clear brow?  Where thy bright 
     comeliness?  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Where is thy fire, blazing with God's love?  Where 
     is thy rapture at His holy breaths?  Where are thy praises, 
     lifted unto Him?  Where is thy rising up to serve His 
     Cause?  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Where are thy beauteous eyes?  Thy smiling lips?  
     The princely cheek?  The graceful form?  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thou hast quit this earthly world and risen upward 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 36:25 
 
+P188 
     to the Kingdom, thou hast reached unto the grace of the 
     invisible realm, and offered thyself at the threshold of its 
     Lord.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thou hast left the lamp that was thy body here, the 
     glass that was thy human form, thy earthy elements, thy 
     way of life below.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thou hast lit a flame within the lamp of the 
     Company on high, thou hast set foot in the &amp;Abha 
     Paradise, thou hast found a shelter in the shadow of the 
     Blessed Tree, thou hast attained His meeting in the haven 
     of Heaven.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thou art now a bird of Heaven, thou hast quit thine 
     earthly nest, and soared away to a garden of holiness in 
     the kingdom of thy Lord.  Thou hast risen to a station 
     filled with light.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thy song is even as birdsong now, thou pourest 
     forth verses as to the mercy of thy Lord; of Him Who 
     forgiveth ever, thou wert a thankful servant, wherefore 
     hast thou entered into exceeding bliss.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thy Lord hath verily singled thee out for His love, 
     and hath led thee into His precincts of holiness, and made 
     thee to enter the garden of those who are His close companions, 
     and hath blessed thee with beholding His beauty.  
 
+P189 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thou hast won eternal life, and the bounty that 
     faileth never, and a life to please thee well, and plenteous 
     grace.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          Thou art become a star in the supernal sky, and a 
     lamp amid the angels of high Heaven; a living spirit in 
     the most exalted Kingdom, throned in eternity.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          I ask of God to draw thee ever closer, hold thee ever 
     faster; to rejoice thy heart with nearness to His presence, 
     to fill thee with light and still more light, to grant thee 
     still more beauty, and to bestow upon thee power and 
     great glory.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
          At all times do I call thee to mind.  I shall never 
     forget thee.  I pray for thee by day, by night; I see thee 
     plain before me, as if in open day.  
 
          O Breakwell, O my dear one!  
 
     159.  As to thy question, doth every soul without 
exception achieve life everlasting?  Know thou that immortality 
belongeth to those souls in whom hath been breathed 
the spirit of life from God.  All save these are lifeless--they 
are the dead, even as Christ hath explained in the Gospel 
text.  He whose eyes the Lord hath opened will see the souls 
of men in the stations they will occupy after their release 
from the body.  He will find the living ones thriving within 
 
+P190 
the precincts of their Lord, and the dead sunk down in the 
lowest abyss of perdition.  
     Know thou that every soul is fashioned after the nature 
of God, each being pure and holy at his birth.  Afterwards, 
however, the individuals will vary according to what they 
acquire of virtues or vices in this world.  Although all existent 
beings are in their very nature created in ranks or 
degrees, for capacities are various, nevertheless every individual 
is born holy and pure, and only thereafter may he 
become defiled.  
     And further, although the degrees of being are various, 
yet all are good.  Observe the human body, its limbs, its 
members, the eye, the ear, the organs of smell, of taste, the 
hands, the fingernails.  Notwithstanding the differences 
among all these parts, each one within the limitations of its 
own being participateth in a coherent whole.  If one of them 
faileth it must be healed, and should no remedy avail, that 
part must be removed.  
 
     160.  O thou sincere and loyal handmaid of the Lord!  
I have read thy letter.  Thou art truly attached to the Kingdom 
and devoted to the All-Glorious Horizon.  I beg of God 
in His bounty to make thee to burn ever more brightly in 
the fire of His love, as each day passeth by.  
     Thou wert, it appeareth, in doubt as to whether to write, 
or to teach the Faith.  Teaching the Faith is essential, and for 
the present teaching is preferable for thee.  Whensoever thou 
dost find an opportunity, loose thy tongue and guide the 
human race.  
     Thou didst ask as to acquiring knowledge:  read thou the 
Books and Tablets of God, and the articles written to 
demonstrate the truth of this Faith.  Included among them 
 
+P191 
are the &amp;Iqan, which hath been translated into English, the 
works of &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Fadl, and those of some others among 
the believers.  In the days to come a great number of holy 
Tablets and other sacred writings will be translated, and 
thou shouldst read these as well.  Likewise, ask thou of God 
that the magnet of His love should draw unto thee the 
knowledge of Him.  Once a soul becometh holy in all things, 
purified, sanctified, the gates of the knowledge of God will 
open wide before his eyes.  
     Thou hast written of the dear handmaid of God, Mrs.  
Goodall.  That soul enraptured of God is truly serving the 
Faith at all times, and doing whatever she can to scatter 
abroad the heavenly splendours.  If she continue in this same 
way, very great results will follow in a time to come.  The 
main thing is to remain staunch and firmly rooted, and 
persevere to the end.  It is my hope that through the high 
endeavours of the handmaids of the Lord, those foothills 
and that ocean+F1 shore will grow so bright with the love of 
God as to cast their beams to the ends of the earth.  
     Thou didst ask whether, at the advent of the Kingdom of 
God, every soul was saved.  The Sun of Truth hath shone 
forth in splendour over all the world, and its luminous 
rising is man's salvation and his eternal life--but only he is 
of the saved who hath opened wide the eye of his discernment 
and beheld that glory.  
     Likewise didst thou ask whether, in this &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, 
the spiritual will ultimately prevail.  It is certain that 
spirituality will defeat materialism, that the heavenly will 
subdue the human, and that through divine education the 
masses of mankind generally will take great steps forward 
in all degrees of life--except for those who are blind and 
deaf and mute and dead.  How can such as they understand 
 
+F1 The Pacific 
 
+P192 
the light?  Though the sun's rays illumine every darkest 
corner of the globe, still the blind can have no share in the 
glory, and though the rain of heavenly mercy come down 
in torrents over all the earth, no shrub or flower will bloom 
from a barren land.  
 
     161.  O thou who seekest the Kingdom of heaven!  
This world is even as the body of man, and the Kingdom of 
God is as the spirit of life.  See how dark and narrow is the 
physical world of man's body, and what a prey it is to 
diseases and ills.  On the other hand, how fresh and bright is 
the realm of the human spirit.  Judge thou from this metaphor 
how the world of the Kingdom hath shone down, and 
how its laws have been made to work in this nether realm.  
Although the spirit is hidden from view, still its commandments 
shine out like rays of light upon the world of the 
human body.  In the same way, although the Kingdom of 
heaven is hidden from the sight of this unwitting people, 
still, to him who seeth with the inner eye, it is plain as day.  
     Wherefore dwell thou ever in the Kingdom, and be thou 
oblivious of this world below.  Be thou so wholly absorbed 
in the emanations of the spirit that nothing in the world of 
man will distract thee.  
 
     162.  O ye dear friends of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  At all times 
do I await your good news, longing as I do to hear that ye 
are making progress from day to day, and are becoming 
ever more illumined by the light of guidance.  
     The blessings of &amp;Baha'u'llah are a shoreless sea, and even 
life everlasting is only a dewdrop therefrom.  The waves of 
that sea are continually lapping against the hearts of the 
 
+P193 
friends, and from those waves there come intimations of the 
spirit and ardent pulsings of the soul, until the heart giveth 
way, and willing or not, turneth humbly in prayer unto the 
Kingdom of the Lord.  Wherefore do all ye can to disengage 
your inner selves, that ye may at every moment 
reflect new splendours from the Sun of Truth.  
     Ye live, all of you, within the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
and with every breath do I turn my face toward the 
Threshold of Oneness and call down blessings upon you, 
each and all.  
 
     163.  O ye two seekers after truth!  Your letter was 
received and its contents noted.  As for the letters ye had 
previously sent, not all were received, while some reached 
here at a time when the cruelty of the oppressors had so 
intensified that it was not possible to send a reply.  Now this 
present letter is here, and we are able to answer it, and I 
have therefore set about writing, in spite of much pressing 
business, so that ye will know that ye are loved amongst 
us, and also accepted in the Kingdom of God.  
     Your questions, however, can be answered only briefly, 
since there is no time for a detailed reply.  The answer to the 
first question:  the souls of the children of the Kingdom, 
after their separation from the body, ascend unto the 
realm of everlasting life.  But if ye ask as to the place, know 
ye that the world of existence is a single world, although 
its stations are various and distinct.  For example, the 
mineral life occupieth its own plane, but a mineral entity is 
without any awareness at all of the vegetable kingdom, 
and indeed, with its inner tongue denieth that there is any 
such kingdom.  In the same way, a vegetable entity knoweth 
nothing of the animal world, remaining completely 
 
+P194 
heedless and ignorant thereof, for the stage of the animal is 
higher than that of the vegetable, and the vegetable is 
veiled from the animal world and inwardly denieth the 
existence of that world--all this while animal, vegetable 
and mineral dwell together in the one world.  In the same 
way the animal remaineth totally unaware of that power 
of the human mind which graspeth universal ideas and 
layeth bare the secrets of creation--so that a man who 
liveth in the east can make plans and arrangements for the 
west; can unravel mysteries; although located on the 
continent of Europe can discover America; although sited 
on the earth can lay hold of the inner realities of the stars 
of heaven.  Of this power of discovery which belongeth to 
the human mind, this power which can grasp abstract and 
universal ideas, the animal remaineth totally ignorant, and 
indeed denieth its existence.  
     In the same way, the denizens of this earth are completely 
unaware of the world of the Kingdom and deny the 
existence thereof.  They ask, for example:  `Where is the 
Kingdom?  Where is the Lord of the Kingdom?'  These 
people are even as the mineral and the vegetable, who 
know nothing whatever of the animal and the human 
realm; they see it not; they find it not.  Yet the mineral and 
vegetable, the animal and man, are all living here together 
in this world of existence.  
     As to the second question:  the tests and trials of God take 
place in this world, not in the world of the Kingdom.  
     The answer to the third question is this, that in the other 
world the human reality doth not assume a physical form, 
rather doth it take on a heavenly form, made up of 
elements of that heavenly realm.  
     And the answer to the fourth question:  the centre of the 
Sun of Truth is in the supernal world--the Kingdom of 
 
+P195 
God.  Those souls who are pure and unsullied, upon the 
dissolution of their elemental frames, hasten away to the 
world of God, and that world is within this world.  The 
people of this world, however, are unaware of that world, 
and are even as the mineral and the vegetable that know 
nothing of the world of the animal and the world of man.  
     The answer to the fifth question is this:  &amp;Baha'u'llah hath 
raised up the tabernacle of the oneness of mankind.  Whoso 
seeketh shelter under this roof will certainly come forth 
from other dwellings.  
     And to the sixth question:  if on some point or other a 
difference ariseth among two conflicting groups, let them 
refer to the Centre of the Covenant for a solution to the 
problem.  
     And the seventh question:  &amp;Baha'u'llah hath been made 
manifest to all mankind and He hath invited all to the 
table of God, the banquet of Divine bounty.  Today, 
however, most of those who sit at that table are the poor, 
and this is why Christ hath said blessed are the poor, for 
riches do prevent the rich from entering the Kingdom; 
and again, He saith, `It is easier for a camel to go through 
the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the 
Kingdom of God.'+F1  If, however, the wealth of this world, 
and worldly glory and repute, do not block his entry 
therein, that rich man will be favoured at the Holy Threshold 
and accepted by the Lord of the Kingdom.  
     In brief, &amp;Baha'u'llah hath become manifest to educate 
all the peoples of the world.  He is the Universal Educator, 
whether of the rich or the poor, whether of black or white, 
or of peoples from east or west, or north or south.  
     Among those who visit &amp;Akka, some have made great 
forward strides.  Lightless candles, they were set alight; 
 
+F1 Matthew 19:24; Mark 10:25 
 
+P196 
withered, they began to bloom; dead, they were recalled 
to life and went home with tidings of great joy.  But 
others, in truth, have simply passed through; they have 
only taken a tour.  
     O ye twain who are strongly attracted to the Kingdom, 
thank ye God that ye have made your home a &amp;Baha'i 
centre and a gathering place for the friends.  
 
     164.  O ye two faithful and assured souls!  The letter 
was received.  Praise be to God, it imparted good tidings.  
California is ready for the promulgation of the Teachings 
of God.  My hope is that ye may strive with heart and soul 
that the sweet scent may perfume the nostrils....  
     Convey on my behalf to Mrs. Chase respectful greetings 
and say:  `Mr. Chase is a twinkling star above the horizon of 
Truth, but at present it is still behind the clouds; soon these 
shall be dispersed and the radiance of that star shall illumine 
the state of California.  Appreciate thou this bounty that 
thou hast been his wife and companion in life.'  
     Every year on the anniversary of the ascension+F1 of that 
blessed soul the friends must visit his tomb on behalf of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha and in the utmost lowliness and humility 
should with all respect lay on his grave wreaths of flowers 
and spend all the day in quiet prayer, while turning their 
faces toward the Kingdom of Signs and mentioning and 
praising the attributes of that illustrious person.  
 
     165.  O my God!  O my God!  Verily Thy servant, 
     humble before the majesty of Thy divine supremacy, 
     lowly at the door of Thy oneness, hath believed in Thee 
 
+F1 30 September 1912 
 
+P197 
     and in Thy verses, hath testified to Thy word, hath been 
     enkindled with the fire of Thy love, hath been immersed 
     in the depths of the ocean of Thy knowledge, hath been 
     attracted by Thy breezes, hath relied upon Thee, hath 
     turned his face to Thee, hath offered his supplications to 
     Thee, and hath been assured of Thy pardon and forgiveness.  
     He hath abandoned this mortal life and hath flown 
     to the kingdom of immortality, yearning for the favour 
     of meeting Thee.  
          O Lord, glorify his station, shelter him under the 
     pavilion of Thy supreme mercy, cause him to enter Thy 
     glorious paradise, and perpetuate his existence in Thine 
     exalted rose garden, that he may plunge into the sea of 
     light in the world of mysteries.  
          Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Powerful, the 
     Forgiver and the Bestower.  
 
     O thou assured soul, thou maidservant of God...!  
Be not grieved at the death of thy respected husband.  He 
hath, verily, attained the meeting of his Lord at the seat of 
Truth in the presence of the potent King.  Do not suppose 
that thou hast lost him.  The veil shall be lifted and thou 
shalt behold his face illumined in the Supreme Concourse.  
Just as God, the Exalted, hath said, `Him will we surely 
quicken to a happy life.'  Supreme importance should be 
attached, therefore, not to this first creation but rather to 
the future life.  
 
     166.  O servant of &amp;Baha!  Be self-sacrificing in the path 
of God, and wing thy flight unto the heavens of the love of 
the &amp;Abha Beauty, for any movement animated by love 
moveth from the periphery to the centre, from space to the 
 
+P198 
Day-Star of the universe.  Perchance thou deemest this to be 
difficult, but I tell thee that such cannot be the case, for 
when the motivating and guiding power is the divine force 
of magnetism it is possible, by its aid, to traverse time and 
space easily and swiftly.  Glory be upon the people of 
&amp;Baha.  
 
     167.  Thou hadst asked about fate, predestination and 
will.  Fate and predestination consist in the necessary and 
indispensable relationships which exist in the realities of 
things.  These relationships have been placed in the realities 
of existent beings through the power of creation and every 
incident is a consequence of the necessary relationship.  
For example, God hath created a relation between the sun 
and the terrestrial globe that the rays of the sun should 
shine and the soil should yield.  These relationships constitute 
predestination, and the manifestation thereof in the 
plane of existence is fate.  Will is that active force which 
controlleth these relationships and these incidents.  Such is 
the epitome of the explanation of fate and predestination.  
I have no time for a detailed explanation.  Ponder over this; 
the reality of fate, predestination and will shall be made 
manifest.  
 
     168.  O thou lady of the Kingdom!  Praise thou God 
that in this age, the age of the dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
thou hast been awakened, hast been made aware of the 
Manifestation of the Lord of Hosts.  All the people of the 
world are buried in the graves of nature, or are slumbering, 
heedless and unaware.  Just as Christ saith:  `I may come 
when you are not aware.  The coming of the Son of Man is 
 
+P199 
like the coming of a thief into a house, the owner of which 
is utterly unaware.'  
     In brief, my hope is that from the bounties of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
thou mayest daily advance in the Kingdom, that thou 
mayest become a heavenly angel, confirmed by the 
breaths of the Holy Spirit, and mayest erect a structure 
that shall eternally remain firm and unshakeable....  
     These days are very precious; grasp the present opportunity 
and ignite a candle that shall never be extinguished, 
and which shall pour out its light eternally illuminating the 
world of mankind!  
 
     169.  O ye two patient souls!  Your letter was received.  
The death of that beloved youth and his separation from 
you have caused the utmost sorrow and grief; for he 
winged his flight in the flower of his age and the bloom of 
his youth to the heavenly nest.  But he hath been freed from 
this sorrow-stricken shelter and hath turned his face toward 
the everlasting nest of the Kingdom, and, being delivered 
from a dark and narrow world, hath hastened to the 
sanctified realm of light; therein lieth the consolation of our 
hearts.  
     The inscrutable divine wisdom underlieth such heart-rending 
occurrences.  It is as if a kind gardener transferreth 
a fresh and tender shrub from a confined place to a wide 
open area.  This transfer is not the cause of the withering, 
the lessening or the destruction of that shrub; nay, on the 
contrary, it maketh it to grow and thrive, acquire freshness 
and delicacy, become green and bear fruit.  This hidden 
secret is well known to the gardener, but those souls who 
are unaware of this bounty suppose that the gardener, in his 
anger and wrath, hath uprooted the shrub.  Yet to those 
 
+P200 
who are aware, this concealed fact is manifest, and this 
predestined decree is considered a bounty.  Do not feel 
grieved or disconsolate, therefore, at the ascension of that 
bird of faithfulness; nay, under all circumstances pray for 
that youth, supplicating for him forgiveness and the 
elevation of his station.  
     I hope that ye will attain the utmost patience, composure 
and resignation, and I entreat and implore at the 
Threshold of Oneness, begging for forgiveness and pardon.  
My hope from the infinite bounties of God is that He may 
shelter this dove of the garden of faith, and cause him to 
abide on the branch of the Supreme Concourse, that he 
may sing in the best of melodies the praise and glorification 
of the Lord of Names and Attributes.  
 
     170.  O thou seeker of the Kingdom!  Thy letter was 
received.  Thou hast written of the severe calamity that hath 
befallen thee--the death of thy respected husband.  That 
honourable man hath been so subjected to the stress and 
strain of this world that his greatest wish was for deliverance 
from it.  Such is this mortal abode:  a storehouse of 
afflictions and suffering.  It is ignorance that binds man to 
it, for no comfort can be secured by any soul in this world, 
from monarch down to the most humble commoner.  If 
once this life should offer a man a sweet cup, a hundred 
bitter ones will follow; such is the condition of this world.  
The wise man, therefore, doth not attach himself to this 
mortal life and doth not depend upon it; at some moments, 
even, he eagerly wisheth for death that he may thereby be 
freed from these sorrows and afflictions.  Thus it is seen 
that some, under extreme pressure of anguish, have 
committed suicide.  
 
+P201 
     As to thy husband, rest assured.  He will be immersed in 
the ocean of pardon and forgiveness and will become the 
recipient of bounty and favour.  Strive thine utmost to give 
his child a &amp;Baha'i training so that when he attaineth 
maturity he may be merciful, illumined and heavenly.  
 
     171.  O thou beloved maidservant of God, although 
the loss of a son is indeed heart-breaking and beyond the 
limits of human endurance, yet one who knoweth and 
understandeth is assured that the son hath not been lost but, 
rather, hath stepped from this world into another, and she 
will find him in the divine realm.  That reunion shall be for 
eternity, while in this world separation is inevitable and 
bringeth with it a burning grief.  
     Praise be unto God that thou hast faith, art turning thy 
face toward the everlasting Kingdom and believest in the 
existence of a heavenly world.  Therefore be thou not 
disconsolate, do not languish, do not sigh, neither wail nor 
weep; for agitation and mourning deeply affect his soul in 
the divine realm.  
     That beloved child addresseth thee from the hidden 
world:  `O thou kind Mother, thank divine Providence 
that I have been freed from a small and gloomy cage and, 
like the birds of the meadows, have soared to the divine 
world--a world which is spacious, illumined, and ever gay 
and jubilant.  Therefore, lament not, O Mother, and be not 
grieved; I am not of the lost, nor have I been obliterated 
and destroyed.  I have shaken off the mortal form and have 
raised my banner in this spiritual world.  Following this 
separation is everlasting companionship.  Thou shalt find 
me in the heaven of the Lord, immersed in an ocean of 
light.'  
 
+P202 
     172.  Praise be to God, thy heart is engaged in the 
commemoration of God, thy soul is gladdened by the glad 
tidings of God and thou art absorbed in prayer.  The state of 
prayer is the best of conditions, for man is then associating 
with God.  Prayer verily bestoweth life, particularly when 
offered in private and at times, such as midnight, when 
freed from daily cares.  
 
     173.  Those souls that, in this day, enter the divine 
kingdom and attain everlasting life, although materially 
dwelling on earth, yet in reality soar in the realm of 
heaven.  Their bodies may linger on earth but their spirits 
travel in the immensity of space.  For as thoughts widen and 
become illumined, they acquire the power of flight and 
transport man to the kingdom of God.  
 
     174.  O ye spiritual friends of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  The letter 
ye had written hath been noted; its contents were most 
pleasing and bespoke your firmness and steadfastness in 
the Cause of God.  
     That Assembly resteth in the sheltering shade of the 
Lord of all bounties, and it is my hope that, as beseemeth 
that body, it will be favoured and invigorated by the 
breathings of the Holy Spirit, and that day by day ye will 
love God in ever greater measure, and become more 
tightly bound to the Beauty that abideth forever, to Him 
Who is the Light of the world.  For love of God and spiritual 
attraction do cleanse and purify the human heart and dress 
and adorn it with the spotless garment of holiness; and 
once the heart is entirely attached to the Lord, and bound 
 
+P203 
over to the Blessed Perfection, then will the grace of God 
be revealed.  
     This love is not of the body but completely of the soul.  
And those souls whose inner being is lit by the love of God 
are even as spreading rays of light, and they shine out like 
stars of holiness in a pure and crystalline sky.  For true love, 
real love, is the love for God, and this is sanctified beyond 
the notions and imaginings of men.  
     Let God's beloved, each and every one, be the essence 
of purity, the very life of holiness, so that in every country 
they may become famed for their sanctity, independence 
of spirit, and meekness.  Let them be cheered by draughts 
from the eternal cup of love for God, and make merry as 
they drink from the wine-vaults of Heaven.  Let them 
behold the Blessed Beauty, and feel the flame and rapture 
of that meeting, and be struck dumb with awe and wonder.  
This is the station of the sincere; this is the way of the 
loyal; this is the brightness that shineth on the faces of 
those nigh unto God.  
     Wherefore must the friends of God, with utter sanctity, 
with one accord, rise up in the spirit, in unity with one 
another, to such a degree that they will become even as one 
being and one soul.  On such a plane as this, physical 
bodies play no part, rather doth the spirit take over and 
rule; and when its power encompasseth all then is spiritual 
union achieved.  Strive ye by day and night to cultivate 
your unity to the fullest degree.  Let your thoughts dwell 
on your own spiritual development, and close your eyes 
to the deficiencies of other souls.  Act ye in such wise, 
showing forth pure and goodly deeds, and modesty and 
humility, that ye will cause others to be awakened.  
     Never is it the wish of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to see any being 
hurt, nor will He make anyone to grieve; for man can 
 
+P204 
receive no greater gift than this, that he rejoice another's 
heart.  I beg of God that ye will be bringers of joy, even as 
are the angels in Heaven.  
 
     175.  Mortal charm shall fade away, roses shall give 
way to thorns, and beauty and youth shall live their day 
and be no more.  But that which eternally endureth is the 
Beauty of the True One, for its splendour perisheth not 
and its glory lasteth for ever; its charm is all-powerful and 
its attraction infinite.  Well is it then with that countenance 
that reflecteth the splendour of the Light of the Beloved 
One!  The Lord be praised, thou hast been illumined with 
this Light, hast acquired the pearl of true knowledge, and 
hast spoken the Word of Truth.  
 
     176.  O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of 
God!  Every soul seeketh an object and cherisheth a desire, 
and day and night striveth to attain his aim.  One craveth 
riches, another thirsteth for glory and still another yearneth 
for fame, for art, for prosperity and the like.  Yet finally all 
are doomed to loss and disappointment.  One and all they 
leave behind them all that is theirs and empty-handed 
hasten to the realm beyond, and all their labours shall be 
in vain.  To dust they shall all return, denuded, depressed, 
disheartened and in utter despair.  
     But, praised be the Lord, thou art engaged in that 
which secureth for thee a gain that shall eternally endure; 
and that is naught but thine attraction to the Kingdom of 
God, thy faith, and thy knowledge, the enlightenment of 
thine heart, and thine earnest endeavour to promote the 
Divine Teachings.  
 
+P205 
     Verily this gift is imperishable and this wealth is a 
treasure from on high!  
 
     177.  O living flame of heavenly love!  Thine heart 
hath been so fired with the love of God that from ten 
thousand leagues afar its warmth and radiance may be felt 
and seen.  The fire lit by mortal hand imparteth light and 
warmth to but a little space, whereas that sacred flame 
which the Hand of God hath kindled, though burning in 
the east, will set aflame the west and give warmth to both 
the north and the south; nay, it shall rise from this world 
to glow with the hottest flame in the realms on high, 
flooding with light the Kingdom of eternal glory.  
     Happy art thou to have obtained so heavenly a gift.  
Blessed art thou to be favoured with His divine bestowals.  
     The glory of God rest upon thee and upon them that 
hold fast unto the sure handle of His Will and holy 
Covenant.  
 
     178.  O maidservant of God!  Thy letter dated 9 
December 1918 was received.  Its contents were noted.  
Never lose thy trust in God.  Be thou ever hopeful, for the 
bounties of God never cease to flow upon man.  If viewed 
from one perspective they seem to decrease, but from 
another they are full and complete.  Man is under all conditions 
immersed in a sea of God's blessings.  Therefore, be 
thou not hopeless under any circumstances, but rather be 
firm in thy hope.  
     Attendance at the gatherings of the friends is specifically 
to keep them alert, vigilant, loving and attracted to the 
divine Kingdom.  
 
+P206 
     If thou hast a full and eager desire to travel to Phillsburg, 
Montana, thou art permitted, perchance thou mayest be 
able to ignite a candle amid that group of miners and may 
make them awake and vigilant so that they may turn to 
God and may acquire a share from the Bounty of the divine 
Kingdom.  
 
     179.  Strive as much as ye can to turn wholly toward 
the Kingdom, that ye may acquire innate courage and 
ideal power.  
 
     180.  I hope that in this nether world thou shalt attain 
unto heavenly light, thou wilt free the souls from the 
gloom of nature, which is the animal kingdom, and cause 
them to reach lofty stations in the human kingdom.  Today 
all people are immersed in the world of nature.  That is why 
thou dost see jealousy, greed, the struggle for survival, 
deception, hypocrisy, tyranny, oppression, disputes, strife, 
bloodshed, looting and pillaging, which all emanate from 
the world of nature.  Few are those who have been freed 
from this darkness, who have ascended from the world of 
nature to the world of man, who have followed the divine 
Teachings, have served the world of humanity, are 
resplendent, merciful, illumined and like unto a rose 
garden.  Strive thine utmost to become godlike, characterized 
with His attributes, illumined and merciful, that thou 
mayest be freed from every bond and become attached at 
heart to the Kingdom of the incomparable Lord.  This is 
&amp;Baha'i bounty, and this is heavenly light.  
 
+P207 
     181.  Regarding the statement in The Hidden Words, 
that man must renounce his own self, the meaning is that 
he must renounce his inordinate desires, his selfish purposes 
and the promptings of his human self, and seek out the holy 
breathings of the spirit, and follow the yearnings of his 
higher self, and immerse himself in the sea of sacrifice, with 
his heart fixed upon the beauty of the All-Glorious.  
     As for the reference in The Hidden Words regarding the 
Covenant entered into on Mount &amp;Paran, this signifieth that 
in the sight of God the past, the present and the future are 
all one and the same--whereas, relative to man, the past is 
gone and forgotten, the present is fleeting, and the future is 
within the realm of hope.  And it is a basic principle of the 
Law of God that in every Prophetic Mission, He entereth 
into a Covenant with all believers--a Covenant that 
endureth until the end of that Mission, until the promised 
day when the Personage stipulated at the outset of the 
Mission is made manifest.  Consider Moses, He Who conversed 
with God.  Verily, upon Mount Sinai, Moses entered 
into a Covenant regarding the Messiah, with all those souls 
who would live in the day of the Messiah.  And those souls, 
although they appeared many centuries after Moses, were 
nevertheless--so far as the Covenant, which is outside time, 
was concerned--present there with Moses.  The Jews, 
however, were heedless of this and remembered it not, and 
thus they suffered a great and clear loss.  
     As to the reference in the Arabic Hidden Words that the 
human being must become detached from self, here too the 
meaning is that he should not seek out anything whatever 
for his own self in this swiftly-passing life, but that he 
should cut the self away, that is, he should yield up the self 
and all its concerns on the field of martyrdom, at the time 
of the coming of the Lord.  
 
+P208 
     182.  O ye who are holding fast unto the Covenant and 
Testament!  This day, from the realms of the All-Glorious, 
from the Kingdom of Holiness where hosannas of glorification 
and praise rise up, the Company on high direct their 
gaze upon you.  Whensoever their gaze lighteth upon 
gatherings of those who are steadfast in the Covenant and 
Testament, then do they utter their cry, `Glad tidings!  Glad 
tidings!'  Then, exulting, do they lift up their voices, and 
shout, `O ye spiritual communion!  O ye gathering of God!  
Blessed are ye!  Glad tidings be unto you!  Bright be your 
faces, and be ye of good cheer, for ye cling to the Covenant 
of the Beloved of all the worlds, ye are on fire with the 
wine of His Testament.  Ye have plighted your troth to the 
Ancient of Days, ye have drunk deep from the chalice of 
loyalty.  Ye have guarded and defended the Cause of God; 
ye have not been a cause of dividing up His Word; ye have 
not brought His Faith low, but have striven to glorify His 
Holy Name; ye have not allowed the Blessed Cause to be 
exposed to the derision of the people.  Ye have not permitted 
the Designated Station to be humbled, nor been 
willing to see the Centre of Authority discredited or 
exposed to mockery and persecution.  Ye have striven to 
keep the Word whole and one.  Ye have passed through the 
portals of mercy.  Ye have not let the Blessed Beauty slip 
from your minds, to fade unremembered.'  
     The Glory rest upon you.  
 
     183.  O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  Thy letter was 
received.  It was like the melody of the divine nightingale, 
whose song delighteth the hearts.  This is because its 
contents indicated faith, assurance and firmness in the 
Covenant and the Testament.  Today the dynamic power 
 
+P209 
of the world of existence is the power of the Covenant 
which like unto an artery pulsateth in the body of the 
contingent world and protecteth &amp;Baha'i unity.  
     The &amp;Baha'is are commanded to establish the oneness of 
mankind; if they cannot unite around one point how will 
they be able to bring about the unity of mankind?  
     The purpose of the Blessed Beauty in entering into this 
Covenant and Testament was to gather all existent beings 
around one point so that the thoughtless souls, who in every 
cycle and generation have been the cause of dissension, may 
not undermine the Cause.  He hath, therefore, commanded 
that whatever emanateth from the Centre of the Covenant 
is right and is under His protection and favour, while all 
else is error.  
     Praise be to God, thou art firm in the Covenant and the 
Testament.  
 
     184.  O ye blessed souls!  Although ye are undergoing 
crucial tests in view of the repeated and assiduous attempts 
of some people to shake the faith of the friends in Los 
Angeles, yet ye are under the guarding eye of the bounty 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah and are assisted by legions of angels.  
     Walk, therefore, with a sure step and engage with the 
utmost assurance and confidence in the promulgation of the 
divine fragrances, the glorification of the Word of God and 
firmness in the Covenant.  Rest ye assured that if a soul 
ariseth in the utmost perseverance and raiseth the Call of 
the Kingdom and resolutely promulgateth the Covenant, 
be he an insignificant ant he shall be enabled to drive away 
the formidable elephant from the arena, and if he be a 
feeble moth he shall cut to pieces the plumage of the 
rapacious vulture.  
 
+P210 
     Endeavour, therefore, that ye may scatter and disperse 
the army of doubt and of error with the power of the holy 
utterances.  This is my exhortation and this is my counsel.  
Do not quarrel with anybody, and shun every form of 
dispute.  Utter the Word of God.  If he accepteth it the 
desired purpose is attained, and if he turneth away leave 
him to himself and trust to God.  
     Such is the attribute of those who are firm in the Covenant.  
 
     185.  O ye friends and maidservants of the Merciful!  
From the Spiritual Assembly of Los Angeles a letter hath 
been received.  It was indicative of the fact that the blessed 
souls in California, like unto an immovable mountain, are 
withstanding the gale of violation, have, like unto blessed 
trees, been planted in the soil of the Covenant and are 
most firm and steadfast.  The hope is entertained, therefore, 
that through the blessings of the Sun of Truth they 
may daily increase in their firmness and steadfastness.  The 
tests of every dispensation are in direct proportion to the 
greatness of the Cause, and as heretofore such a manifest 
Covenant, written by the Supreme Pen, hath not been 
entered upon, the tests are proportionately more severe.  
These trials cause the feeble souls to waver while those who 
are firm are not affected.  These agitations of the violators 
are no more than the foam of the ocean, which is one of 
its inseparable features; but the ocean of the Covenant shall 
surge and shall cast ashore the bodies of the dead, for it 
cannot retain them.  Thus it is seen that the ocean of the 
Covenant hath surged and surged until it hath thrown out 
the dead bodies--souls that are deprived of the Spirit of 
God and are lost in passion and self and are seeking leadership.  
This foam of the ocean shall not endure and shall 
 
+P211 
soon disperse and vanish, while the ocean of the Covenant 
shall eternally surge and roar....  
     From the early days of creation down to the present 
time, throughout all the divine dispensations, such a firm 
and explicit Covenant hath not been entered upon.  In view 
of this fact is it possible for this foam to remain on the 
surface of the ocean of the Covenant?  No, by God!  The 
violators are trampling upon their own dignity, are 
uprooting their own foundations and are proud at being 
upheld by flatterers who exert a great effort to shake the 
faith of feeble souls.  But this action of theirs is of no consequence; 
it is a mirage and not water, foam and not the 
sea, mist and not a cloud, illusion and not reality.  All this 
ye shall soon see.  
     Praise be to God, ye are firm and steadfast; be ye thankful 
that like unto blessed trees ye are firmly planted in the 
soil of the Covenant.  It is sure that every firm one will 
grow, will yield new fruits and will increase daily in freshness 
and grace.  Reflect upon all the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
whether epistles or prayers, and ye shall surely come across 
a thousand passages wherein &amp;Baha'u'llah prays:  `O God!  
Bring to naught the violators of the Covenant and defeat 
the oppressors of the Testament.'  `He who denieth the 
Covenant and the Testament is rejected by God, and he 
who remaineth firm and steadfast therein is favoured at the 
Threshold of Oneness.'  Such sayings and prayers abound, 
refer to them and ye shall know.  
     Never be depressed.  The more ye are stirred by violation, 
the more deepen ye in firmness and steadfastness, and be 
assured that the divine hosts shall conquer, for they are 
assured of the victory of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  Throughout 
all regions the standard of firmness and steadfastness is 
upraised and the flag of violation is debased, for only a few 
 
+P212 
weak souls have been led away by the flattery and the 
specious arguments of the violators who are outwardly 
with the greatest care exhibiting firmness but inwardly are 
engaged in agitating souls.  Only a few who are the leaders 
of those who stir and agitate are outwardly known as 
violators while the rest, through subtle means, deceive the 
souls, for outwardly they assert their firmness and steadfastness 
in the Covenant but when they come across 
responsive ears they secretly sow the seeds of suspicion.  
The case of all of them resembleth the violation of the 
Covenant by Judas Iscariot and his followers.  Consider:  
hath any result or trace remained after them?  Not even a 
name hath been left by his followers and although a 
number of Jews sided with him it was as if he had no 
followers at all.  This Judas Iscariot who was the leader of 
the apostles betrayed Christ for thirty pieces of silver.  Take 
heed, O ye people of perception!  
     At this time these insignificant violators will surely 
betray the Centre of the Covenant for the large sum which 
by every subtle means they have begged.  It is now thirty 
years since &amp;Baha'u'llah ascended, and in that time these 
violators have striven with might and main.  What have 
they achieved?  Under all conditions those who have 
remained firm in the Covenant have conquered, while the 
violators have met defeat, disappointment and dejection.  
After the ascension of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, no trace of them shall 
remain.  These souls are ignorant of what will happen and 
are proud of their own fancies.  
     In short, O ye friends of God and maidservants of the 
Merciful!  The hand of divine bounty hath placed upon 
your heads a jewelled crown, the precious gems of which 
shall shine eternally over all regions.  Appreciate this 
bounty, loose your tongues in praise and thanksgiving, and 
 
+P213 
engage in the promulgation of the divine teachings, for 
this is the spirit of life and the means of salvation.  
 
     186.  O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  Three 
consecutive letters have been received from thee.  From 
their contents it became known that in Cleveland the 
hearts are afflicted by the murky breaths of the Covenant-breakers 
and harmony hath decreased among the friends.  
Gracious God!  A hundred times it hath been foretold that 
the violators are lying in ambush and by every means 
desire to cause dissension among the friends so that this 
dissension may end in violation of the Covenant.  How is it 
that, notwithstanding this warning, the friends have 
neglected this explicit statement?  
     The point at issue is clear, direct and of utmost brevity.  
Either &amp;Baha'u'llah was wise, omniscient and aware of 
what would ensue, or was ignorant and in error.  He 
entered, by His supreme pen, into such a firm Covenant 
and Testament with all the &amp;Baha'is, first with the &amp;Aghsan, 
the &amp;Afnan and His kindred, and commanded them to obey 
and turn toward Him.  By His supreme pen He hath 
explicitly declared that the object of the following verse of 
the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas is the Most Great Branch:  
     `When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the 
Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward 
Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from 
this Ancient Root.'  Its meaning briefly is this:  that after 
My ascension it is incumbent upon the &amp;Aghsan, the &amp;Afnan 
and the kindred, and all the friends of God, to turn their 
faces to Him Who hath branched from the Ancient Root.  
     He also plainly saith in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas:  `O ye people 
of the world!  When the Mystic Dove will have winged its 
 
+P214 
flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off 
goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever ye understand 
not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from 
this mighty Stock.'  Addressing all the people of the world 
He saith:  When the Mystic Dove flieth away from the 
orchard of praise to the Most Supreme and Invisible 
Station--that is, when the Blessed Beauty turneth away 
from the contingent world towards the invisible realm--
refer whatever ye do not understand in the Book to Him 
Who hath branched from the Ancient Root.  That is, 
whatever He saith is the very truth.  
     And in the Book of the Covenant He explicitly saith 
that the object of this verse `Who hath branched from this 
Ancient Root' is the Most Mighty Branch.  And He 
commandeth all the &amp;Aghsan, the &amp;Afnan, the kindred and 
the &amp;Baha'is to turn toward Him.  Now, either one must say 
that the Blessed Beauty hath made a mistake, or He must 
be obeyed.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha hath no command for the people 
to obey save the diffusion of the fragrances of God, the 
exaltation of His Word, the promulgation of the oneness 
of the world of humanity, the establishment of universal 
peace, and other of the commands of God.  These are divine 
commands and have nothing to do with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Whoever wisheth may accept them, and anyone who 
rejecteth them may do as he pleaseth.  
     Now some of the mischief-makers, with many stratagems, 
are seeking leadership, and in order to reach this 
position they instil doubts among the friends that they may 
cause differences, and that these differences may result in 
their drawing a party to themselves.  But the friends of God 
must be awake and must know that the scattering of these 
doubts hath as its motive personal desires and the achievement 
of leadership.  
 
+P215 
     Do not disrupt &amp;Baha'i unity, and know that this unity 
cannot be maintained save through faith in the Covenant 
of God.  
     Thou hast the desire to travel that thou mayest spread the 
fragrances of God.  This is highly suitable.  Assuredly divine 
confirmations will assist thee and the power of the Covenant 
and Testament will secure for thee triumph and 
victory.  
 
     187.  O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  Thy letter 
was received.  Thou hast expressed satisfaction with the 
Convention, that this gathering hath been the means of the 
elevation of the Cause of God and the demonstration of 
the power of His Word.  The greatness of the Cause will 
clear away these differences and may be compared to 
health in the body of man which, when established, cureth 
all disease and weakness.  Our hope is that no trace of 
opposition may remain; but some of the friends in America 
are restless in their fresh ambitions and strive and seek under 
the ground and in the air to discover anything that breedeth 
dissension.  
     Praise be to God, all such doors are closed in the Cause of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah for a special authoritative Centre hath been 
appointed--a Centre that solveth all difficulties and wardeth 
off all differences.  The Universal House of Justice, likewise, 
wardeth off all differences and whatever it prescribeth must 
be accepted and he who transgresseth is rejected.  But this 
Universal House of Justice which is the Legislature hath 
not yet been instituted.  
     Thus it is seen that no means for dissension hath been left, 
but carnal desires are the cause of difference as it is the case 
with the violators.  These do not doubt the validity of the 
 
+P216 
Covenant but selfish motives have dragged them to this 
condition.  It is not that they do not know what they do--
they are perfectly aware and still they exhibit opposition.  
     In short, the ocean of the Covenant is tumultuous and 
wide.  It casteth ashore the foam of violation and thus rest 
ye assured.  Be engaged in the furtherance of the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and prepare the means for the diffusion 
of the divine fragrances.  Be not engaged in anything but 
this, for otherwise thou shalt dissipate thine attention and 
the work will not advance.  
 
     188.  O ye the cherished loved ones of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  
It is a long time now since my inward ear hath heard any 
sweet melodies out of certain regions, or my heart been 
gladdened; and this despite the fact that ye are ever present 
in my thoughts and standing clearly visible before my sight.  
Filled to overflowing is the goblet of my heart with the 
wine of the love I bear you, and my yearning to set eyes 
upon you streameth like the spirit through my arteries and 
veins.  From this it is clear how great is my affliction.  At this 
time and throughout this tempest of calamities now tossing 
its waves to high heaven, cruel and incessant darts are being 
hurled against me from every point of the compass, and at 
every moment, here in the Holy Land, terrifying news is 
received, and every day bringeth its quota of horror.  The 
Centre of Sedition had imagined that it needed but his 
arrogant rebellion to bring down the Covenant and Testament 
in ruins; it needed but this, so he thought, to turn the 
righteous away from the Holy Will.  Wherefore he sent out 
far and wide his leaflets of doubt, devising many a secret 
scheme.  Now he would cry out that God's edifice had been 
subverted and His divine commands annulled, and that 
 
+P217 
accordingly, the Covenant and Testament was abolished.  
Again he would set himself to sighing and groaning that he 
was being held a prisoner and was kept hungry and thirsty 
day and night.  Another day he would raise an uproar, 
saying that the oneness of God had been denied, since 
another Manifestation had been proclaimed, prior to the 
expiration of a thousand years.  
     When he saw that his calumnies had no effect, he 
gradually formed a plan to incite a disturbance.  He began 
stirring up mischief, and went knocking at every door.  He 
started making false accusations to the officials of the 
Government.  He approached some of the foreigners, made 
himself their intimate, and together with them prepared a 
document and presented it to the Seat of the Sultanate, 
bringing consternation to the authorities.  Among the many 
slanderous charges was this, that this hapless one had raised 
up a standard of revolt, a flag bearing the words &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha; 
that I had paraded this throughout the countryside, 
to every city, town and village, and even among the desert 
tribes, and had summoned all the inhabitants to unite under 
this flag.  
     O my Lord, verily I seek refuge with Thee from the very 
thought of such an act, which is contrary to all the commandments 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and which would indeed be a 
mighty wrong that none but a grievous sinner would ever 
perpetrate.  For Thou hast made it incumbent upon us to 
obey the rulers and kings.  
     Another of his slanders was that the Shrine on Mount 
Carmel was a fortress that I had built strong and impregnable
--this when the building under construction compriseth 
six rooms--and that I had named it Medina the 
Resplendent, while I had named the Holy Tomb+F1 Mecca 
 
+F1 at &amp;Bahji 
 
+P218 
the Glorified.  Yet another of his calumnies was that I had 
established an independent sovereignty, and that--God 
forbid!  God forbid!  God forbid!--I had summoned all the 
believers to join me in this massive wrongdoing.  How dire, 
O my Lord, is his slander!  
     Yet again, he claimeth that since the Holy Shrine hath 
become a point visited by pilgrims from all over the world, 
great damage will accrue to this Government and people.  
He, the Centre of Sedition, averreth that he himself hath 
had no hand in all these matters, that he is a &amp;Sunni of the 
Sunnites and a devoted follower of &amp;Abu-Bakr and &amp;Umar, 
and regardeth &amp;Baha'u'llah as only a pious man and a mystic; 
all these things, he saith, were set afoot by this wronged one.  
     To be brief, a Commission of Investigation was appointed 
by the &amp;Sultan, may the glory of his reign endure.  The Commission 
journeyed hither and immediately upon arrival 
betook themselves to the house of one of the accusers.  They 
then summoned the group who, working with my brother, 
had prepared the accusatory document and asked them 
whether it was true.  The group explained the contents of 
the document, stated that everything they had reported 
therein was nothing but the truth, and added further 
accusations.  Thus they functioned at one and the same time 
as plaintiffs, witnesses, and judge.  
     The Commission hath now returned to the seat of the 
Caliphate, and reports of a most frightful nature are coming 
in daily from that city.  However, praised be God, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
remaineth composed and unperturbed.  To none do I 
bear ill will because of this defamation.  I have made all my 
affairs conditioned upon His irresistible Will and I am 
waiting, indeed in perfect happiness, to offer my life and 
prepared for whatever dire affliction may be in store.  Praise 
be to God, the loving believers also accept and remain 
 
+P219 
submissive to God's Will, content with it, radiantly 
acquiescent, offering thanks.  
     The Centre of Sedition hath imagined that once the 
blood of this wronged one is spilled out, once I have been 
cast away on the wide desert sands or drowned in the 
Mediterranean Sea--nameless, gone without trace, with 
none to tell of me--then would he at last have a field where 
he could urge his steed ahead, and with his mallet of lies and 
doubts, hit hard at the polo ball of his ambitions, and carry 
off the prize.  
     Far from it!  For even if the sweet musk-scent of faithfulness 
should pass, and leave no trace behind, who would be 
drawn by the stench of perfidy?  And even if some gazelle of 
heaven were to be ripped apart by dogs and wolves, who 
would go running to seek out a ravening wolf?  Even should 
the day of the Mystic Nightingale draw to its close, who 
would ever lend his ear to the raven's croak, or the cawing 
of the crow?  What an empty supposition is his!  What a 
foolish presumption!  `Their works are like the vapour in a 
desert which the thirsty dreameth to be water, until when 
he cometh unto it, he findeth nothing.'+F1  
     O ye loved ones of God!  Be ye firm of foot, and fixed of 
heart, and through the power of the Blessed Beauty's help, 
stand ye committed to your purpose.  Serve ye the Cause of 
God.  Face ye all nations of the world with the constancy 
and the endurance of the people of &amp;Baha, that all men may 
be astounded and ask how this could be, that your hearts 
are as well-springs of confidence and faith, and as mines so 
rich in the love of God.  Be ye so, that ye shall neither fail 
nor falter on account of these tragedies in the Holy Land; 
let not these dread events make you despondent.  And if all 
the believers be put to the sword, and only one be left, let 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 24:39 
 
+P220 
that one cry out in the name of the Lord and tell the joyous 
tidings; let that one rise up and confront all the peoples of 
the earth.  
     Gaze ye not upon the dire happenings at this Illumined 
Spot.  The Holy Land is in danger at all times, and here, the 
tide of calamities is ever at the flood; for this upraised call 
hath now been heard around the world, and the fame of it 
hath gone forth to the ends of the earth.  It is because of this 
that foes, both from within and from without, have turned 
themselves with subtlety and craft to spreading slander.  It is 
clear that such a place as this would be exposed to danger, 
for there is no defender here, none to arise and take our side 
in the face of calumny:  here are only a few souls that are 
homeless, hapless, held captive in this stronghold.  No 
champion have they; there is none to succour them, none 
to ward off the arrows of lies, the darts of defamation that 
are hurled against them:  none except God.  
     It behoveth you to ponder on all those well-beloved ones 
who hastened to the holy field of sacrifice, those precious 
souls who offered up their lives.  Bear ye in mind what 
streams of sacred blood were poured away, how many a 
righteous heart was commingled with its gore, how many a 
breast was the target of tyranny's spear, how many a chaste 
body was ripped to shreds.  How then could it be right for 
us even to think of saving ourselves!  To curry favour with 
stranger or kin, and make a show of compromise!  Should 
we not, rather, take the pathway of the righteous, and 
follow in the footsteps of those great ones gone before?  
     These few brief days shall pass away, this present life 
shall vanish from our sight; the roses of this world shall be 
fresh and fair no more, the garden of this earth's triumphs 
and delights shall droop and fade.  The spring season of life 
shall turn into the autumn of death, the bright joy of palace 
 
+P221 
halls give way to moonless dark within the tomb.  And 
therefore is none of this worth loving at all, and to this the 
wise will not anchor his heart.  
     He who hath knowledge and power will rather seek out 
the glory of heaven, and spiritual distinction, and the life 
that dieth not.  And such a one longeth to approach the 
sacred Threshold of God; for in the tavern of this swiftly-passing 
world the man of God will not lie drunken, nor will 
he even for a moment take his ease, nor stain himself with 
any fondness for this earthly life.  
     Nay rather, the friends are stars in the high heavens of 
guidance, celestial bodies in the skies of divine grace, who 
with all their powers put the dark to flight.  They break 
down the foundations of malevolence and hate.  They 
cherish but one desire for the world and all its peoples:  well-being 
and peace.  By them, the ramparts of warfare and 
aggression are battered down.  They have truthfulness and 
honest dealing and friendship for their goal, and kindness 
even toward a vicious foe; until at last they change this 
prison of treachery, the world, into a mansion of utmost 
trust, and turn this gaol-house of hatred and malevolence 
and spite, into God's Paradise.  
     O ye loving friends!  Strive ye with heart and soul to 
make this world the mirror-image of the Kingdom, that 
this nether world may teem with the blessings of the world 
of God, that the voices of the Company on high may be 
raised in acclamation, and signs and tokens of the bounties 
and bestowals of &amp;Baha'u'llah may encompass all the earth.  
     &amp;Jinab-i-Amin hath expressed the greatest admiration for 
you honoured men and enlightened women, naming and 
commending you each by each, telling at length of the 
firmness and constancy ye all have shown, saying that, God 
be praised, in all Persia the men and women are standing 
 
+P222 
together, straight, strong, unmoveable--a mighty edifice 
solidly raised up; and that ye are engaged with love and joy 
in spreading abroad the sweet savours of the Lord.  
     These were tidings of great joy, especially as they have 
reached me in these days of extreme peril.  For the dearest 
wish of this wronged one is that the friends be spiritual of 
heart and illumined of mind, and once this grace is granted 
me, calamity, however afflictive, is but bounty pouring 
down upon me, like copious rain.  
     O God, my God!  Thou seest me plunged in an ocean of 
anguish, held fast to the fires of tyranny, and weeping in the 
darkness of the night.  Sleepless I toss and turn upon my bed, 
mine eyes straining to behold the morning light of faithfulness 
and trust.  I agonize even as a fish, its inward parts afire 
as it leapeth about in terror upon the sand, yet I ever look 
for Thy bestowals to appear from every side.  
     O God, my God!  Make thou the believers in other lands 
to partake of Thine abounding grace, deliver Thou, by 
Thine unfailing help and bounty, whoso among Thy loved 
ones in the farthermost climes sigheth over the bitter cruelty 
of his foe.  O Lord, they are the captives of Thy love, the 
prisoners taken by Thy troops.  They are the birds that fly in 
the heavens of Thy guidance, the whales that swim in the 
ocean of Thy bestowals, the stars that sparkle on the horizon 
of Thy gifts.  They are the defenders of the fortress of Thy 
law.  They are the banners of Thy remembrance amongst 
men.  They are the deep wells of Thy divine compassion, 
the fountains of Thy favours, the well-springs of Thy grace.  
     Keep them ever in safety beneath Thine all-protecting 
eye.  Assist them to exalt Thy Word; make Thou their 
hearts to be constant in Thy love; strengthen Thou their 
backs that they may serve Thee well; in servitude, strengthen 
Thou their powers.  
 
+P223 
     Spread Thou through them Thy sweet savours far and 
wide; expound through them Thy Holy Writ; make 
known through them Thine Utterance; fulfil through them 
Thy Words; through them pour out Thy mercy.  
     Thou art verily the Mighty, the Powerful.  Thou art 
verily the Clement, the Compassionate.  
 
     189.  Today, every wise, vigilant and foresighted person 
is awakened, and to him are unveiled the mysteries of 
the future which show that nothing save the power of the 
Covenant is able to stir and move the heart of humanity, 
just as the New and Old Testaments propounded throughout 
all regions the Cause of Christ and were the pulsating 
power in the body of the human world.  A tree that hath a 
root shall bear fruit, while the tree that hath none, no 
matter how high and hardy it may be, will eventually 
wither, perish and become but a log fit for the fire.  
     The Covenant of God is like unto a vast and fathomless 
ocean.  A billow shall rise and surge therefrom and shall cast 
ashore all accumulated foam.  
     Praise be to God that the highest wish entertained by 
heedful souls is the exaltation of the Word of God and the 
propagation of divine fragrances.  This is, verily, the secure 
and firm foundation.  
     Now, like unto the morn, the light of the Sun of Truth 
hath been shed abroad.  Effort must be made that slumbering 
souls may be awakened, the heedless become vigilant, and 
that the divine teachings, which constitute the spirit of this 
age, may reach the ears of the people of the world, may be 
propagated in the press and set forth with brilliance and 
eloquence in the assemblages of men.  
     One's conduct must be like the conduct of Paul, and one's 
 
+P224 
faith similar to that of Peter.  This musk-scented breeze shall 
perfume the nostrils of the people of the world, and this 
spirit shall resuscitate the dead.  
     The offensive odour of violation hath temporarily arrested 
the onward movement of the Cause, for otherwise the 
divine teachings, like unto the rays of the sun, would immediately 
spread and permeate all regions.  
     Thou intendest to print and publish the addresses of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha which thou hast compiled.  This is indeed very 
advisable.  This service shall cause thee to acquire an effulgent 
face in the &amp;Abha Kingdom, and shall make thee the 
object of the praise and gratitude of the friends in the East as 
well as in the West.  But it is to be undertaken with the 
utmost care, so that the exact text may be reproduced and 
will exclude all deviations and corruptions committed by 
former translators.  
 
     190.  Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in lowliness, 
humbling myself before Thy commandments, submitting 
to Thy sovereignty, trembling at the might of Thy 
dominion, fleeing from Thy wrath, entreating Thy grace, 
relying upon Thy forgiveness, shaking with awe at Thy 
fury.  I implore Thee with a throbbing heart, with streaming 
tears and a yearning soul, and in complete detachment from 
all things, to make Thy lovers as rays of light across Thy 
realms, and to aid Thy chosen servants to exalt Thy Word, 
that their faces may turn beauteous and bright with splendour, 
that their hearts may be filled with mysteries, and that 
every soul may lay down its burden of sin.  Guard them 
then from the aggressor, from him who hath become a 
shameless and blasphemous doer of wrong.  
     Verily Thy lovers thirst, O my Lord; lead them to the 
 
+P225 
wellspring of bounty and grace.  Verily, they hunger; send 
down unto them Thy heavenly table.  Verily, they are 
naked; robe them in the garments of learning and knowledge.  
     Heroes are they, O my Lord, lead them to the field of 
battle.  Guides are they, make them to speak out with 
arguments and proofs.  Ministering servants are they, cause 
them to pass round the cup that brimmeth with the wine of 
certitude.  O my God, make them to be songsters that carol 
in fair gardens, make them lions that couch in the thickets, 
whales that plunge in the vasty deep.  
     Verily Thou art He of abounding grace.  There is none 
other God save Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ever-Bestowing.  
     O ye my spiritual friends!  For some time now the 
pressures have been severe, the restrictions as shackles of 
iron.  This hapless wronged one was left single and alone, 
for all the ways were barred.  Friends were forbidden access 
to me, the trusted were shut away, the foe compassed me 
about, the evil watchers were fierce and bold.  At every 
instant, fresh affliction.  At every breath, new anguish.  Both 
kin and stranger on the attack; indeed, one-time lovers, 
faithless and unpitying, were worse than foes as they rose up 
to harass me.  None was there to defend &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, no 
helper, no protector, no ally, no champion.  I was drowning 
in a shoreless sea, and ever beating upon my ears were the 
raven-croaking voices of the disloyal.  
     At every daybreak, triple darkness.  At eventide, stone-hearted 
tyranny.  And never a moment's peace, and never 
any balm for the spear's red wounds.  From moment to 
moment, word would come of my exile to the Fezzan 
sands; from hour to hour, I was to be cast into the endless 
sea.  Now they would say that these homeless wanderers 
 
+P226 
were ruined at last; again that the cross would soon be put 
to use.  This wasted frame of mine was to be made the 
target for bullet or arrow; or again, this failing body was to 
be cut to ribbons by the sword.  
     Our alien acquaintances could not contain themselves for 
joy, and our treacherous friends exulted.  `Praise be to God,' 
one would exclaim, `Here is our dream come true.'  And 
another, `God be thanked, our spear-head found the heart.'  
     Affliction beat upon this captive like the heavy rains of 
spring, and the victories of the malevolent swept down in a 
relentless flood, and still &amp;Abdu'l-Baha remained happy and 
serene, and relied on the grace of the All-Merciful.  That 
pain, that anguish, was a paradise of all delights; those 
chains were the necklace of a king on a throne in heaven.  
Content with God's will, utterly resigned, my heart surrendered 
to whatever fate had in store, I was happy.  For a 
boon companion, I had great joy.  
     Finally a time came when the friends turned inconsolable, 
and abandoned all hope.  It was then the morning dawned, 
and flooded all with unending light.  The towering clouds 
were scattered, the dismal shadows fled.  In that instant the 
fetters fell away, the chains were lifted off the neck of this 
homeless one and hung round the neck of the foe.  Those 
dire straits were changed to ease, and on the horizon of 
God's bounties the sun of hope rose up.  All this was out of 
God's grace and His bestowals.  
     And yet, from one point of view, this wanderer was 
saddened and despondent.  For what pain, in the time to 
come, could I seek comfort?  At the news of what granted 
wish could I rejoice?  There was no more tyranny, no more 
affliction, no tragical events, no tribulations.  My only joy in 
this swiftly-passing world was to tread the stony path of 
God and to endure hard tests and all material griefs.  For 
 
+P227 
otherwise, this earthly life would prove barren and vain, 
and better would be death.  The tree of being would produce 
no fruit; the sown field of this existence would yield no 
harvest.  Thus it is my hope that once again some circumstance 
will make my cup of anguish to brim over, and that 
beauteous Love, that Slayer of souls, will dazzle the beholders 
again.  Then will this heart be blissful, this soul be 
blessed.  
 
          O Divine Providence!  Lift to Thy lovers' lips 
     a cup brimful of anguish.  To the yearners on Thy pathway, 
     make sweetness but a sting, and poison honey-sweet.  
     Set Thou our heads for ornaments on the points of 
     spears.  Make Thou our hearts the targets for pitiless 
     arrows and darts.  Raise Thou this withered soul to life on 
     the martyr's field, make Thou his faded heart to drink 
     the draught of tyranny, and thus grow fresh and fair once 
     more.  Make him to be drunk with the wine of Thine 
     Eternal Covenant, make him a reveller holding high his 
     cup.  Help him to fling away his life; grant that for Thy 
     sake, he be offered up.  
          Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.  Thou art the 
     Knower, the Seer, the Hearer.  
 
     191.  O thou who hast been sore afflicted on the pathway 
of the Covenant!  Anguish and torment, when suffered 
on the pathway of the Lord, Him of manifest signs, is only 
favour and grace; affliction is but mercy, and grief a gift 
from God.  Poison is sugar on the tongue, and wrath is 
kindness, nourishing the soul.  
     Then praise thou Him, the loving Provider, for having 
ordained this dire affliction, which is but bounty unalloyed.  
 
+P228 
     If I, like Abraham, through flames must go, 
     Or yet like John+F1 a bloodstained road must run; 
     If, Joseph-like, Thou'd cast me in a well, 
     Or shut me up within a prison cell--
     Or make me e'en as poor as Mary's Son--
     I will not go from Thee, 
     But ever stand 
     My soul and body bowed to Thy command.  
 
     192.  Today, the Lord of Hosts is the defender of the 
Covenant, the forces of the Kingdom protect it, heavenly 
souls tender their services, and heavenly angels promulgate 
and spread it broadcast.  If it is considered with insight, it 
will be seen that all the forces of the universe, in the last 
analysis serve the Covenant.  In the future it shall be made 
evident and manifest.  In view of this fact, what can these 
weak and feeble souls achieve?  Hardy plants that are destitute 
of roots and are deprived of the outpourings of the 
cloud of mercy will not last.  What then may be expected 
from feeble weeds?...  
 
     193.  It is daybreak, and from the rising-point of the 
invisible realms of God, the light of unity is dawning; and 
streaming and beating down from the hidden world of the 
Kingdom of oneness there cometh a flood of abounding 
grace.  Glad tidings of the Kingdom are sounding from 
every side, and wafting in from every direction are the first 
morning signs of the exalting of God's Word and the upraising 
of His Cause.  The word of unity is spreading, the 
verses of oneness are being sung, the sea of God's bestowals 
 
+F1 John the Baptist 
 
+P229 
is tossing high its waves, and in plunging cataracts His 
blessings are pouring down.  
     The confirmations of Him Who is the Ever-Forgiving 
have wrapped every clime in light, the armies of the Company 
on high are rushing forward to do battle at the side of 
the friends of the Lord and carry the day, the fame of the 
Ancient Beauty--may my life be offered up for His loved 
ones--resoundeth from pole to pole and word of the Holy 
Cause hath spread to east and west.  
     All these things bring joy to the heart, and yet &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
is sunk deep in an ocean of grief, and pain and anguish 
have so affected my limbs and members that utter weakness 
hath overtaken my whole body.  Note ye that when, singly 
and alone, with none to second me, I upraised the call of 
God around the world, the peoples thereof rose up to 
oppose, to dispute, to deny.  On one side, it is clear how the 
religionists of the past have mounted their attack at all 
points; again, there cometh word of the lying mockers and 
the extreme limits to which they are going to pull out the 
Divine Tree by the roots.  What malicious and slanderous 
charges they bring against the Ancient Beauty, what pamphlets 
filled with wicked and depraved allegations they are 
busily writing and spreading against the Most Great Name!  
And now, in deepest secrecy, they are straining every nerve 
to deal this Faith a fearsome blow.  
     Again have the prideful devised all manner of plots and 
schemes to completely disable the Cause of God and to erase 
the name of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha from the Book of Life.  
     And now, added to all these tribulations, these miseries, 
these enemy attacks, there hath arisen a dust cloud of ill will 
amongst the believers themselves.  This in spite of the fact 
that the Cause of the Ancient Beauty is the very essence of 
love, the very channel of oneness, existing only that all may 
 
+P230 
become the waves of one sea, and bright stars of the same 
endless sky, and pearls within the shell of singleness, and 
gleaming jewels quarried from the mines of unity; that they 
may become servants one to another, adore one another, 
bless one another, praise one another; that each one may 
loose his tongue and extol the rest without exception, each 
one voice his gratitude to all the rest; that all should lift up 
their eyes to the horizon of glory, and remember that they are 
linked to the Holy Threshold; that they should see nothing 
but good in one another, hear nothing but praise of one 
another, and speak no word of one another save only to praise.  
     There are indeed certain ones who tread this way of 
righteousness, and God be thanked, these are strengthened 
and supported by heavenly power in every land.  But others 
have not arisen as they ought to this gloried and exalted 
station, and this doth lay upon the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha a 
heavy burden of grief, of inconceivable grief.  For no 
tempest more perilous than this could ever assail the Cause 
of God, nor could anything else so diminish the influence of 
His Word.  
     It behoveth all the beloved of God to become as one, to 
gather together under the protection of a single flag, to 
stand for a uniform body of opinion, to follow one and the 
same pathway, to hold fast to a single resolve.  Let them 
forget their divergent theories and put aside their conflicting 
views since, God be praised, our purpose is one, our 
goal is one.  We are the servants of one Threshold, we all 
draw our nourishment from the same one Source, we all 
are gathered in the shade of the same high Tabernacle, we 
all are sheltered under the one celestial Tree.  
     O beloved of the Lord!  If any soul speak ill of an absent 
one, the only result will clearly be this:  he will dampen the 
zeal of the friends and tend to make them indifferent.  For 
 
+P231 
backbiting is divisive, it is the leading cause among the 
friends of a disposition to withdraw.  If any individual should 
speak ill of one who is absent, it is incumbent on his 
hearers, in a spiritual and friendly manner, to stop him, and 
say in effect:  would this detraction serve any useful purpose?  
Would it please the Blessed Beauty, contribute to the lasting 
honour of the friends, promote the holy Faith, support the 
Covenant, or be of any possible benefit to any soul?  No, 
never!  On the contrary, it would make the dust to settle so 
thickly on the heart that the ears would hear no more, and 
the eyes would no longer behold the light of truth.  
     If, however, a person setteth about speaking well of 
another, opening his lips to praise another, he will touch an 
answering chord in his hearers and they will be stirred up 
by the breathings of God.  Their hearts and souls will rejoice 
to know that, God be thanked, here is a soul in the Faith 
who is a focus of human perfections, a very embodiment of 
the bounties of the Lord, one whose tongue is eloquent, and 
whose face shineth, in whatever gathering he may be, one 
who hath victory upon his brow, and who is a being sustained 
by the sweet savours of God.  
     Now which is the better way?  I swear this by the beauty 
of the Lord:  whensoever I hear good of the friends, my 
heart filleth up with joy; but whensoever I find even a hint 
that they are on bad terms one with another, I am overwhelmed 
by grief.  Such is the condition of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Then judge from this where your duty lieth.  
     God be praised, wherever we turn, the Ancient Beauty 
hath opened wide the gates of grace, and hath in unmistakable 
words announced glad tidings of victory through the 
Lord's sustaining help.  Through love hath He carried off 
the hearts of the believers, and He hath entrusted their 
triumph to the armies of the Concourse on high.  
 
+P232 
     Now amidst all the peoples of the world must the beloved 
arise, with a heart even as the day-star, a strong inward urge, 
a shining brow, a musk-scented breath, a tongue speaking 
ever of God, an exposition crystal-clear, a high resolve, a 
power born of heaven, a spiritual character, a confirmation 
nothing short of the divine.  Let them one and all become 
as a splendour on the horizon of heaven, and in the skies of 
the world a dazzling star.  Let them be fruitful trees in the 
celestial bowers, sweet-scented blooms in the divine gardens; 
let them be verses of perfection on the page of the 
universe, words of oneness in the Book of Life.  This is the 
first age, and the early beginnings of the dispensation of the 
Most Great Light, wherefore, within this century, virtues 
must be acquired, goodly qualities must be perfected within 
this span of time.  In these very days the &amp;Abha Paradise must 
pitch its pavilions on the plains of the world.  The lights of 
reality must now be revealed, and the secrets of God's 
bestowals must now be made known, and now must the 
olden grace shine forth and this world change into the 
pleasure-ground of heaven, the garden of God.  And out of 
pure hearts, and through heavenly bounties, all the perfections, 
qualities and attributes of the divine must now be 
made manifest.  
     At all times doth &amp;Abdu'l-Baha supplicate and with tears 
entreat the Almighty at the sacred Threshold, and crieth out:  
 
          O Thou kind Lord!  We are servants of Thy 
     Threshold, taking shelter at Thy holy Door.  We seek no 
     refuge save only this strong pillar, turn nowhere for a 
     haven but unto Thy safekeeping.  Protect us, bless us, 
     support us, make us such that we shall love but Thy good 
     pleasure, utter only Thy praise, follow only the pathway 
     of truth, that we may become rich enough to dispense 
 
+P233 
     with all save Thee, and receive our gifts from the sea of 
     Thy beneficence, that we may ever strive to exalt Thy 
     Cause and to spread Thy sweet savours far and wide, that 
     we may become oblivious of self and occupied only with 
     Thee, and disown all else and be caught up in Thee.  
          O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver!  Grant us Thy 
     grace and loving-kindness, Thy gifts and Thy bestowals, 
     and sustain us, that we may attain our goal.  Thou art the 
     Powerful, the Able, the Knower, the Seer; and verily 
     Thou art the Generous, and verily Thou art the All-Merciful, 
     and verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, He to 
     Whom repentance is due, He Who forgiveth even the 
     most grievous of sins.  
 
     194.  O ye the sincere loved ones of the &amp;Abha Beauty!  
In these days the Cause of God, the world over, is fast 
growing in power and, day by day, is spreading further and 
further to the utmost bounds of the earth.  Its enemies, 
therefore, from all the kindreds and peoples of the world, 
are growing aggressive, malevolent, envious and bitterly 
hostile.  It is incumbent upon the loved ones of God to 
exercise the greatest care and prudence in all things, whether 
great or small, to take counsel together and unitedly resist 
the onslaught of the stirrers up of strife and the movers of 
mischief.  They must endeavour to consort in a friendly 
spirit with everyone, must follow moderation in their conduct, 
must have respect and consideration one for another 
and show loving-kindness and tender regard to all the 
peoples of the world.  They must be patient and long-suffering, 
that they may grow to become the divine magnets 
of the &amp;Abha Kingdom and acquire the dynamic power 
of the hosts of the realm on high.  
 
+P234 
     The fleeting hours of man's life on earth pass swiftly by 
and the little that still remaineth shall come to an end, but 
that which endureth and lasteth for evermore is the fruit 
that man reapeth from his servitude at the Divine Threshold.  
Behold the truth of this saying, how abundant and glorious 
are the proofs thereof in the world of being!  
     The glory of glories rest upon the people of &amp;Baha!  
 
     195.  O thou exalted bough of the divine Lote-Tree!  
...When thou art disdained and rejected by the wicked 
doers be not cast down; and at the power and stiffneckedness 
of the presumptuous be neither vexed nor sick at heart; 
for such is the way of heedless souls, from time out of mind.  
`O the misery of men!  No Messenger cometh unto them 
but they laugh Him to scorn!'+F1  
     Indeed, the attacks and the obstructiveness of the ignorant 
but cause the Word of God to be exalted, and spread His 
signs and tokens far and wide.  Were it not for this opposition 
by the disdainful, this obduracy of the slanderers, this 
shouting from the pulpits, this crying and wailing of great 
and small alike, these accusations of unbelief levelled by the 
ignorant, this uproar from the foolish--how could news of 
the advent of the Primal Point and the bright dawning of 
the Day-Star of &amp;Baha ever have reached to east and west?  
How else could the planet have been rocked from pole to 
pole?  How else could Persia have become the focal point of 
scattering splendours, and Asia Minor the radiating heart 
of the beauty of the Lord?  However else could the flame 
of the Manifestation have spread into the south?  By what 
means could the cries of God have been heard in the far 
north?  How else could His summons have been heard in 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 36:29 
 
+P235 
the continents of America and of Africa the dark?  How else 
could the cock-crow of Heaven have penetrated those ears?  
How else could the sweet parrots of India have come upon 
this sugar, or nightingales have lifted up their warblings out 
of the land of &amp;Iraq?  What else could set the east and west 
to dancing, how else could this Consecrated Spot become 
the throne of the Beauty of God?  How else could Sinai 
behold this burning brightness, how could the Advent's 
flame adorn that mount?  How else could the Holy Land be 
made the footstool of God's beauty, and the holy vale of 
Towa+F1 become the site of excellence and grace, the sacred 
spot where Moses put off His shoes?  How could the breaths 
of heaven be carried across the Vale of Holiness, how could 
the sweet-scented, airy streams that blow out of the &amp;Abha 
gardens ever be perceived by those that dwell on the 
Verdant Isle?  How else could the pledges of the Prophets, 
the joyous tidings of the holy Seers of old, the stirring 
promises given unto this Sacred Place by the Manifestations 
of God, ever have been fulfilled?  
     How else could the Tree of &amp;Anisa have been planted here, 
the flag of the Testament be flown, the intoxicating cup of 
the Covenant be lifted to these lips?  All these blessings and 
bestowals, the very means of proclaiming the Faith, have 
come about through the scorn of the ignorant, the opposition 
of the foolish, the stubbornness of the dull-witted, the 
violence of the aggressor.  Had it not been for these things, 
the news of the &amp;Bab's advent would not, to this day, have 
reached even into lands hard by.  Wherefore we should 
never grieve over the blindness of the unwitting, the attacks 
of the foolish, the hostility of the low and base, the heedlessness 
of the divines, the charges of infidelity brought 
against us by the empty of mind.  Such too was their way in 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 20:12.  Also referred to as the `Sacred Vale'.  
 
+P236 
ages past, nor would it be thus if they were of those who 
know; but they are benighted, and they come not close to 
understanding what is told them.+F1  
     Wherefore doth it befit thyself, an offshoot of the Holy 
Tree of God, branched out from that mighty Trunk--and 
it behoveth ourselves as well--so to burn, through the 
sustaining grace of the Ancient Beauty--may my life be 
offered up for His Most Holy Shrine--with this kindled 
flame out of heaven, that we will light the fire of God's love 
from pole to pole.  Let us take for our example the great and 
sacred Tree of the exalted &amp;Bab--may my life be offered up 
for Him.  Like Him let us bare our breasts to the shafts of 
agony, like Him make our hearts to be targets for the spears 
decreed by God.  Let us, like candles, burn away; as moths, 
let us scorch our wings; as the field larks, vent our plaintive 
cries; as the nightingales, burst forth in lamentations.  
     Even as the clouds let us shed down tears, and as the 
lightning flashes let us laugh at our coursings through east 
and west.  By day, by night, let us think but of spreading 
the sweet savours of God.  Let us not keep on forever with 
our fancies and illusions, with our analysing and interpreting 
and circulating of complex dubieties.  Let us put aside all 
thoughts of self; let us close our eyes to all on earth, let us 
neither make known our sufferings nor complain of our 
wrongs.  Rather let us become oblivious of our own selves, 
and drinking down the wine of heavenly grace, let us cry 
out our joy, and lose ourselves in the beauty of the All-Glorious.  
     O thou &amp;Afnan of the divine Lote-Tree!  We must strive, 
each one of us, to become as fecund boughs and to yield an 
ever sweeter and more wholesome fruit, that the branch 
may prove itself to be a continuation of the root, and the 
 
+F1 cf. &amp;Qur'an 4:80 
 
+P237 
part be in harmony with the whole.  It is my hope that out 
of the bounty of the Greatest Name and the loving-kindness 
of the Primal Point--may my soul be offered up for Them 
both--we shall become the means of exalting the Word of 
God around the world; that we may ever render services 
unto the Source of our Cause and spread over all the canopy 
of the true and holy zeal of the Lord.  That from over the 
fields of grace, we may make zephyrs to blow, bringing to 
man the sweet scents that come from the gardens of God.  
That we may make of this world the &amp;Abha Paradise, and 
change this nether place into the Kingdom of Heaven.  
     It is true that every one of God's servants, and in particular 
those who are on fire with the Faith, have been 
allotted this task of servitude to Almighty God; still, the 
duty imposed upon us is greater than that which hath been 
laid upon the rest.  To Him do we look for grace and favour 
and strength.  
     All praise and thanksgiving be unto the Blessed Beauty, 
for calling into action the armies of His &amp;Abha Kingdom, and 
sending forth to us His never-interrupted aid, dependable as 
the rising stars.  In every region of the earth hath He supported 
this single, lonely servant, at every moment hath He 
made known to me the signs and tokens of His love.  He 
hath cast into a stupor all those who are clinging to their 
vain illusions, and made them infamous in the sight of high 
and low.  He hath caused those who run after their fads and 
fancies to become objects of general reproach, and hath 
exposed the arrogant to public view; He hath made those 
of the friends who proved infirm of faith to serve as a 
warning to every beholder, and hath caused the leaders of 
those who waver to love but themselves and sink down in 
self-conceit.  Meanwhile, by the power of His might, He 
hath made this broken-winged bird to rise up before all 
 
+P238 
who dwell on earth.  He hath shattered the serried ranks of 
the rebellious, and hath given the victory to the hosts of 
salvation, and breathed into the hearts of those who stand 
firm in the Covenant and Testament the breath of everlasting 
life.  
     Convey thou the greetings of &amp;Abha to each one of the 
&amp;Afnan, branched from the Holy Tree.  The glory rest upon 
thee and upon all the &amp;Afnan who remain faithful and true to 
the Covenant.  
 
     196.  O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant!  Thy 
letter of 9 September 1909 hath been received.  Be thou 
neither grieved nor despondent over what hath come to 
pass.  This trouble overtook thee as thou didst walk the path 
of God, wherefore it should bring thee joy.  We addressed 
the friends in writing ere this, and made a verbal statement 
as well, to the effect that the friends in the West will unquestionably 
have their share of the calamities befalling the 
friends in the East.  It is inevitable that, walking the pathway 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, they too will become targets for persecution 
by the oppressors.  
     Consider how at the beginning of the Christian era the 
Apostles were afflicted, and what torments they endured in 
the pathway of Christ.  Every day of their lives they were 
targets for the Pharisees' darts of mockery, vilification and 
abuse.  They bore great hardship; they saw prison; and 
most of them carried to their lips the sweet cup of martyrdom.  
     Now ye, as well, must certainly become my partners to 
some slight degree, and accept your share of tests and 
sorrows.  But these episodes shall pass away, while that 
 
+P239 
abiding glory and eternal life shall remain unchanged forever.  
Moreover, these afflictions shall be the cause of great 
advancement.  
     I ask of God that thou, His husbandman, shalt plough the 
hard and stony ground, and water it, and scatter seeds 
therein--for this will show how skilful is the farmer, while 
any man can sow and till where the ground is soft, and 
clear of brambles and thorns.  
 
     197.  O thou servant of God!  Do not grieve at the 
afflictions and calamities that have befallen thee.  All calamities 
and afflictions have been created for man so that he 
may spurn this mortal world--a world to which he is much 
attached.  When he experienceth severe trials and hardships, 
then his nature will recoil and he will desire the eternal 
realm--a realm which is sanctified from all afflictions and 
calamities.  Such is the case with the man who is wise.  He 
shall never drink from a cup which is at the end distasteful, 
but, on the contrary, he will seek the cup of pure and limpid 
water.  He will not taste of the honey that is mixed with 
poison.  
     Praise thou God, that thou hast been tried and hast 
experienced such a test.  Be patient and grateful.  Turn thy 
face to the divine Kingdom and strive that thou mayest 
acquire merciful characteristics, mayest become illumined 
and acquire the attributes of the Kingdom and of the Lord.  
Endeavour to become indifferent to the pleasures of this 
world and to its comfort, to remain firm and steadfast in the 
Covenant and to promulgate the Cause of God.  
     This is the cause of the exaltation of man, the cause of his 
glory and of his salvation.  
 
+P240 
     198.  O thou who art enamoured of the breaths of God!  
I have read thy letter, which cried out with thy love for 
God and thine irresistible attraction to His Beauty, and its 
wondrous theme did cheer my heart.  
     The intent of what I wrote to thee in my previous letter 
was this, that when exalting the Word of God, there are 
trials to be met with, and calamities; and that in loving 
Him, at every moment there are hardships, torments, 
afflictions.  
     It behoveth the individual first to value these ordeals, 
willingly accept them, and eagerly welcome them; only 
then should he proceed with teaching the Faith and exalting 
the Word of God.  
     In such a state, no matter what may befall him in his love 
for God--harassment, reproach, vilification, curses, beatings, 
imprisonment, death--he will never be cast down, 
and his passion for the Divine Beauty will but gain in 
strength.  This was what I meant.  
     Otherwise, woe and misery to the soul that seeketh after 
comforts, riches, and earthly delights while neglecting to 
call God to mind!  Because calamities encountered in God's 
pathway are, to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, but favour and grace, and in 
one of His Tablets the all-glorious Beauty hath declared:  `I 
never passed a tree but Mine heart addressed it saying:  "O 
would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body 
crucified upon thee!"'  These were the words of the Most 
Great Name.  This is His path.  This is the way to His Realm 
of Might.  
 
     199.  O ye sincere ones, ye longing ones, ye who are 
drawn as if magnetized, ye who have risen up to serve the 
Cause of God, to exalt His Word and scatter His sweet 
 
+P241 
savours far and wide!  I have read your excellent letter, 
beautiful as to style, eloquent as to words, profound as to 
meaning, and I praised God and thanked Him for having 
come to your aid and enabled you to serve Him in His 
widespreading vineyard.  
     Erelong shall your faces be bright with the radiance of 
your supplications and your worship of God, your prayers 
unto Him, and your humility and selflessness in the presence 
of the friends.  He will make of your assemblage a magnet 
that will draw unto you the bright rays of divine confirmations 
that shine out from His kingdom of glory.  
     It is incumbent upon you to ponder in your hearts and 
meditate upon His words, and humbly to call upon Him, 
and to put away self in His heavenly Cause.  These are the 
things that will make of you signs of guidance unto all 
mankind, and brilliant stars shining down from the all-highest 
horizon, and towering trees in the &amp;Abha Paradise.  
     Know ye that &amp;Abdu'l-Baha dwelleth in continual delight.  
To have been lodged in this faraway prison is for me 
exceeding joy.  By the life of &amp;Baha!  This prison is my supernal 
paradise; it is my cherished goal, the comfort of my 
bosom, the bliss of my heart; it is my refuge, my shelter, 
my asylum, my safe haven, and within it do I exult amid 
the hosts of heaven and the Company on high.  
     Rejoice in my bondage, O ye friends of God, for it 
soweth the seeds of freedom; rejoice at my imprisonment, 
for it is the well-spring of salvation; be ye glad on account 
of my travail, for it leadeth to eternal ease.  By the Lord 
God!  I would not exchange this prison for the throne of the 
whole world, nor give up this confinement for pleasures 
and pastimes in all the fair gardens on earth.  My hope is that 
out of the Lord's abundant grace, His munificence and 
loving-kindness, I may, in His pathway, be hanged against 
 
+P242 
the sky, that my heart may become the target for a thousand 
bullets, or that I may be cast into the depths of the sea, or be 
left to perish on desert sands.  This is what I long for most; 
this is my supreme desire; it refresheth my soul, it is balm 
for my breast, it is the very solace of mine eyes.  
     As for you, O ye lovers of God, make firm your steps in 
His Cause, with such resolve that ye shall not be shaken 
though the direst of calamities assail the world.  By nothing, 
under no conditions, be ye perturbed.  Be ye anchored fast 
as the high mountains, be stars that dawn over the horizon 
of life, be bright lamps in the gatherings of unity, be souls 
humble and lowly in the presence of the friends, be innocent 
in heart.  Be ye symbols of guidance and lights of godliness, 
severed from the world, clinging to the handhold that is 
sure and strong, spreading abroad the spirit of life, riding 
the Ark of salvation.  Be ye daysprings of generosity, 
dawning-points of the mysteries of existence, sites where 
inspiration alighteth, rising-places of splendours, souls that 
are sustained by the Holy Spirit, enamoured of the Lord, 
detached from all save Him, holy above the characteristics 
of humankind, clothed in the attributes of the angels of 
heaven, that ye may win for yourselves the highest bestowal 
of all, in this new time, this wondrous age.  
     By the life of &amp;Baha!  Only he who is severed from the 
world shall achieve this ultimate grace, he who is a captive 
of divine love, empty of passion and self, from every aspect 
true unto his God, humble, lowly, supplicating, in tears, 
submissive in the presence of the Lord.  
 
     200.  O my spiritual loved ones!  At a time when an 
ocean of trials and tribulations was surging up and flinging 
its waves to the heavens, when multitudes were assailing us 
 
+P243 
and the tyrannical were inflicting upon us crushing wrongs
--at such a time a band of individuals, intent on defaming 
us, allied themselves with our unkind brother, brought out 
a treatise that was filled with slanderous charges, and 
levelled accusations and calumnies against us.  
     In this way they alarmed and confused the government 
authorities, and it is obvious what the condition of this 
captive then became, in this dilapidated fortress, and what 
terrible harm and mischief was done, far worse than words 
can tell.  In spite of everything, this homeless prisoner remained 
inwardly tranquil and secure, trusting in the peerless 
Lord, yearning for whatever afflictions might have to 
be encountered in the pathway of God's love.  For bolts of 
hate are, in our sight, but a gift of pearls from Him, and 
mortal poison but a healing draught.  
     Such was our state when a letter came to us from the 
American friends.+F1  They had covenanted together, so they 
wrote, to remain at one in all things, and the signatories one 
and all had pledged themselves to make sacrifices in the 
pathway of the love of God, thus to achieve eternal life.  At 
the very moment when this letter was read, together with 
the signatures at its close, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha experienced a joy so 
vehement that no pen can describe it, and thanked God that 
friends have been raised up in that country who will live 
together in perfect harmony, in the best of fellowship, in 
full agreement, closely knit, united in their efforts.  
     The more this compact is reinforced, the happier and the 
better shall all things be, for it will draw unto itself the confirmations 
of God.  If the lovers of the Lord are hoping for 
grace to win as their friends the Company on high, they 
must do all they can to strengthen this compact, for such an 
 
+F1 This letter was signed by four hundred and twenty-two believers 
+F1 in America, and sent on 4 July 1905.  
 
+P244 
alliance for brotherhood and unity is even as watering the 
Tree of Life:  it is life everlasting.  
     O ye lovers of God!  Make firm your steps; fulfil your 
pledge to one another; go forth in harmony to scatter 
abroad the sweet savours of God's love, and to establish His 
Teachings, until ye breathe a soul into the dead body of this 
world, and bring true healing in the physical and spiritual 
realms to everyone who aileth.  
     O ye lovers of God!  The world is even as a human being 
who is diseased and impotent, whose eyes can see no longer, 
whose ears have gone deaf, all of whose powers are corroded 
and used up.  Wherefore must the friends of God be competent 
physicians who, following the holy Teachings, will 
nurse this patient back to health.  Perhaps, God willing, the 
world will mend, and become permanently whole, and its 
exhausted faculties will be restored, and its person will take 
on such vigour, freshness and verdancy that it will shine out 
with comeliness and grace.  
     The first remedy of all is to guide the people aright, so 
that they will turn themselves unto God, and listen to His 
counsellings, and go forth with hearing ears and seeing eyes.  
Once this speedily effective draught is given them, then, in 
accordance with the Teachings, they must be led to acquire 
the characteristics and the behaviour of the Concourse on 
high, and encouraged to seek out all the bounties of the 
&amp;Abha Realm.  They must cleanse their hearts from even the 
slightest trace of hatred and spite, and they must set about 
being truthful and honest, conciliatory and loving to all 
humankind--so that East and West will, even as two lovers, 
hold each other close; that hatred and hostility will perish 
from the earth, and universal peace be firmly rooted in 
their place.  
     O ye lovers of God!  Be kind to all peoples; care for every 
 
+P245 
person; do all ye can to purify the hearts and minds of men; 
strive ye to gladden every soul.  To every meadow be a 
shower of grace, to every tree the water of life; be as sweet 
musk to the sense of humankind, and to the ailing be a 
fresh, restoring breeze.  Be pleasing waters to all those who 
thirst, a careful guide to all who have lost their way; be 
father and mother to the orphan, be loving sons and 
daughters to the old, be an abundant treasure to the poor.  
Think ye of love and good fellowship as the delights of 
heaven, think ye of hostility and hatred as the torments of 
hell.  
     Indulge not your bodies with rest, but work with all 
your souls, and with all your hearts cry out and beg of God 
to grant you His succour and grace.  Thus may ye make this 
world the &amp;Abha Paradise, and this globe of earth the parade 
ground of the realm on high.  If only ye exert the effort, it is 
certain that these splendours will shine out, these clouds of 
mercy will shed down their rain, these life-giving winds will 
rise and blow, this sweet-smelling musk will be scattered 
far and wide.  
     O ye lovers of God!  Do not dwell on what is coming to 
pass in this holy place, and be ye in no wise alarmed.  Whatsoever 
may happen is for the best, because affliction is but 
the essence of bounty, and sorrow and toil are mercy unalloyed, 
and anguish is peace of mind, and to make a 
sacrifice is to receive a gift, and whatsoever may come to 
pass hath issued from God's grace.  
     See ye, therefore, to your own tasks:  guide ye the people 
and educate them in the ways of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Deliver to 
mankind this joyous message from the &amp;Abha Realm.  Rest 
not, by day or night; seek ye no moment's peace.  Strive ye 
with all your might to bring to men's ears these happy 
tidings.  In your love for God and your attachment to 
 
+P246 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, accept ye every tribulation, every sorrow.  
Endure the aggressor's taunts, put up with the enemy's 
reproaches.  Follow in the footsteps of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and in 
the pathway of the &amp;Abha Beauty, long at every moment to 
give up your lives.  Shine out like the day-star, be unresting 
as the sea; even as the clouds of heaven, shed ye life upon field 
and hill, and like unto April winds, blow freshness through 
those human trees, and bring them to their blossoming.  
 
     201.  O thou who art carried away by the love of God!  
The Sun of Truth hath risen above the horizon of this 
world and cast down its beams of guidance.  Eternal grace 
is never interrupted, and a fruit of that everlasting grace is 
universal peace.  Rest thou assured that in this era of the 
spirit, the Kingdom of Peace will raise up its tabernacle on 
the summits of the world, and the commandments of the 
Prince of Peace will so dominate the arteries and nerves of 
every people as to draw into His sheltering shade all the 
nations on earth.  From springs of love and truth and unity 
will the true Shepherd give His sheep to drink.  
     O handmaid of God, peace must first be established 
among individuals, until it leadeth in the end to peace 
among nations.  Wherefore, O ye &amp;Baha'is, strive ye with all 
your might to create, through the power of the Word of 
God, genuine love, spiritual communion and durable bonds 
among individuals.  This is your task.  
 
     202.  O ye lovers of truth, ye servants of humankind!  
Out of the flowering of your thoughts and hopes, fragrant 
emanations have come my way, wherefore an inner sense of 
obligation compelleth me to pen these words.  
 
+P247 
     Ye observe how the world is divided against itself, how 
many a land is red with blood and its very dust is caked with 
human gore.  The fires of conflict have blazed so high that 
never in early times, not in the Middle Ages, not in recent 
centuries hath there ever been such a hideous war, a war 
that is even as millstones, taking for grain the skulls of men.  
Nay, even worse, for flourishing countries have been reduced 
to rubble, cities have been levelled with the ground, 
and many a once prosperous village hath been turned into 
ruin.  Fathers have lost their sons, and sons their fathers.  
Mothers have wept away their hearts over dead children.  
Children have been orphaned, women left to wander, 
vagrants without a home.  From every aspect, humankind 
hath sunken low.  Loud are the piercing cries of fatherless 
children; loud the mothers' anguished voices, reaching to 
the skies.  
     And the breeding-ground of all these tragedies is prejudice:  
prejudice of race and nation, of religion, of political 
opinion; and the root cause of prejudice is blind imitation 
of the past--imitation in religion, in racial attitudes, in 
national bias, in politics.  So long as this aping of the past 
persisteth, just so long will the foundations of the social 
order be blown to the four winds, just so long will humanity 
be continually exposed to direst peril.  
     Now, in such an illumined age as ours, when realities 
previously unknown to man have been laid bare, and the 
secrets of created things have been disclosed, and the Morn 
of Truth hath broken and lit up the world--is it admissible 
that men should be waging a frightful war that is bringing 
humanity down to ruin?  No, by the Lord God!  
     Christ Jesus summoned all mankind to amity and peace.  
Unto Peter He said:  `Put up thy sword into the sheath.'+F1  
 
+F1 John 18:11 
 
+P248 
Such was the bidding and counsel of the Lord Christ; and 
yet today the Christians one and all have drawn their 
swords from out the scabbard.  How wide is the discrepancy 
between such acts and the clear Gospel text!  
     Sixty years ago &amp;Baha'u'llah rose up, even as the Day-Star, 
over Persia.  He declared that the skies of the world 
were dark, that this darkness boded evil, and that terrible 
wars would come.  From the prison at &amp;Akka, He addressed 
the German Emperor in the clearest of terms, telling him 
that a great war was on the way and that his city of Berlin 
would break forth in lamentation and wailing.  Likewise did 
He write to the Turkish sovereign, although He was that 
&amp;Sultan's victim and a captive in his prison--that is, He was 
being held prisoner in the Fortress at &amp;Akka--and clearly 
stated that Constantinople would be overtaken by a sudden 
and radical change, so great that the women and children of 
that city would mourn and cry aloud.  In brief, He addressed 
such words to all the monarchs and the presidents, and 
everything came to pass, exactly as He had foretold.  
     There have issued, from His mighty Pen, various teachings 
for the prevention of war, and these have been scattered 
far and wide.  
     The first is the independent investigation of truth; for 
blind imitation of the past will stunt the mind.  But once 
every soul inquireth into truth, society will be freed from 
the darkness of continually repeating the past.  
     His second principle is the oneness of mankind:  that all 
men are the sheep of God, and God is their loving Shepherd, 
caring most tenderly for all without favouring one or 
another.  `No difference canst thou see in the creation of the 
God of mercy';+F1 all are His servants, all implore His grace.  
     His third teaching is that religion is a mighty stronghold, 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 67:3 
 
+P249 
but that it must engender love, not malevolence and hate.  
Should it lead to malice, spite, and hate, it is of no value at 
all.  For religion is a remedy, and if the remedy bring on 
disease, then put it aside.  Again, as to religious, racial, 
national and political bias:  all these prejudices strike at the 
very root of human life; one and all they beget bloodshed, 
and the ruination of the world.  So long as these prejudices 
survive, there will be continuous and fearsome wars.  
     To remedy this condition there must be universal peace.  
To bring this about, a Supreme Tribunal must be established, 
representative of all governments and peoples; 
questions both national and international must be referred 
thereto, and all must carry out the decrees of this Tribunal.  
Should any government or people disobey, let the whole 
world arise against that government or people.  
     Yet another of the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the equality 
of men and women and their equal sharing in all rights.  And 
there are many similar principles.  It hath now become 
evident that these teachings are the very life and soul of the 
world.  
     Ye who are servants of the human race, strive ye with all 
your heart to deliver mankind out of this darkness and these 
prejudices that belong to the human condition and the 
world of nature, so that humanity may find its way into the 
light of the world of God.  
     Praise be to Him, ye are acquainted with the various laws, 
institutions and principles of the world; today nothing 
short of these divine teachings can assure peace and tranquillity 
to mankind.  But for these teachings, this darkness 
shall never vanish, these chronic diseases shall never be 
healed; nay, they shall grow fiercer from day to day.  The 
Balkans will remain discontented.  Its restlessness will 
increase.  The vanquished Powers will continue to agitate.  
 
+P250 
They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the 
flame of war.  Movements, newly-born and world-wide in 
their range, will exert their utmost effort for the advancement 
of their designs.  The Movement of the Left will 
acquire great importance.  Its influence will spread.  
     Strive ye, therefore, with the help of God, with illumined 
minds and hearts and a strength born of heaven, to become 
a bestowal from God to man, and to call into being for all 
humankind, comfort and peace.  
 
     203.  O thou who art enamoured of the Covenant!  
The Blessed Beauty hath promised this servant that souls 
would be raised up who would be the very embodiments of 
guidance, and banners of the Concourse on high, torches of 
God's oneness, and stars of His pure truth, shining in the 
heavens where God reigneth alone.  They would give sight 
to the blind, and would make the deaf to hear; they would 
raise the dead to life.  They would confront all the peoples of 
the earth, pleading their Cause with proofs of the Lord of 
the seven spheres.  
     It is my hope that in His bounty He will soon raise up 
these souls, that His Cause may be exalted.  The lodestone 
which will attract this grace is staunchness in the Covenant.  
Render thou thanks unto God that thou art firmest of the 
firm.  
     O my God, aid Thou Thy servant to raise up the Word, 
and to refute what is vain and false, to establish the truth, to 
spread the sacred verses abroad, reveal the splendours, and 
make the morning's light to dawn in the hearts of the 
righteous.  
     Thou art verily the Generous, the Forgiving.  
 
+P251 
     204.  O phoenix of that immortal flame kindled in the 
sacred Tree!  &amp;Baha'u'llah--may my life, my soul, my spirit 
be offered up as a sacrifice unto His lowly servants--hath, 
during His last days on earth, given the most emphatic 
promise that, through the outpourings of the grace of God 
and the aid and assistance vouchsafed from His Kingdom on 
high, souls will arise and holy beings appear who, as stars, 
would adorn the firmament of divine guidance; illumine 
the dayspring of loving-kindness and bounty; manifest the 
signs of the unity of God; shine with the light of sanctity 
and purity; receive their full measure of divine inspiration; 
raise high the sacred torch of faith; stand firm as the rock 
and immoveable as the mountain; and grow to become 
luminaries in the heavens of His Revelation, mighty channels 
of His grace, means for the bestowal of God's bountiful 
care, heralds calling forth the name of the One true God, 
and establishers of the world's supreme foundation.  
     These shall labour ceaselessly, by day and by night, shall 
heed neither trials nor woe, shall suffer no respite in their 
efforts, shall seek no repose, shall disregard all ease and comfort, 
and, detached and unsullied, shall consecrate every 
fleeting moment of their lives to the diffusion of the divine 
fragrance and the exaltation of God's holy Word.  Their 
faces will radiate heavenly gladness, and their hearts be filled 
with joy.  Their souls will be inspired, and their foundation 
stand secure.  They shall scatter in the world, and travel 
throughout all regions.  They shall raise their voices in every 
assembly, and adorn and revive every gathering.  They shall 
speak in every tongue, and interpret every hidden meaning.  
They shall reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom, and manifest 
unto everyone the signs of God.  They shall burn 
brightly even as a candle in the heart of every assembly, and 
beam forth as a star upon every horizon.  The gentle breezes 
 
+P252 
wafted from the garden of their hearts shall perfume and 
revive the souls of men, and the revelations of their minds, 
even as showers, will reinvigorate the peoples and nations 
of the world.  
     I am waiting, eagerly waiting for these holy ones to 
appear; and yet, how long will they delay their coming?  
My prayer and ardent supplication, at eventide and at dawn, 
is that these shining stars may soon shed their radiance upon 
the world, that their sacred countenances may be unveiled to 
mortal eyes, that the hosts of divine assistance may achieve 
their victory, and the billows of grace, rising from His 
oceans above, may flow upon all mankind.  Pray ye also and 
supplicate unto Him that through the bountiful aid of the 
Ancient Beauty these souls may be unveiled to the eyes of 
the world.  
     The glory of God rest upon thee, and upon him whose 
face is illumined with that everlasting light that shineth 
from His Kingdom of Glory.  
 
     205.  O ye respected souls!  From the continual imitation 
of ancient and worn-out ways, the world had grown 
dark as darksome night.  The fundamentals of the divine 
Teachings had passed from memory; their pith and heart 
had been totally forgotten, and the people were holding on 
to husks.  The nations had, like tattered garments long outworn, 
fallen into a pitiful condition.  
     Out of this pitch blackness there dawned the morning 
splendour of the Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He hath dressed 
the world with a garment new and fair, and that new garment 
is the principles which have come down from God.  
     Now the new age is here and creation is reborn.  Humanity 
hath taken on new life.  The autumn hath gone by, and the 
 
+P253 
reviving spring is here.  All things are now made new.  Arts 
and industries have been reborn, there are new discoveries in 
science, and there are new inventions; even the details of 
human affairs, such as dress and personal effects--even 
weapons--all these have likewise been renewed.  The laws 
and procedures of every government have been revised.  
Renewal is the order of the day.  
     And all this newness hath its source in the fresh outpourings 
of wondrous grace and favour from the Lord of 
the Kingdom, which have renewed the world.  The people, 
therefore, must be set completely free from their old 
patterns of thought, that all their attention may be focused 
upon these new principles, for these are the light of this 
time and the very spirit of this age.  
     Unless these Teachings are effectively spread among the 
people, until the old ways, the old concepts, are gone and 
forgotten, this world of being will find no peace, nor will it 
reflect the perfections of the Heavenly Kingdom.  Strive ye 
with all your hearts to make the heedless conscious, to 
waken those who sleep, to bring knowledge to the ignorant, 
to make the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and restore the 
dead to life.  
     It behoveth you to show forth such power, such endurance, 
as to astonish all beholders.  The confirmations of the 
Kingdom are with you.  Upon you be the glory of the All-Glorious.  
 
     206.  Praise be to Him Who hath rent the dark asunder, 
hath blotted out the night, hath drawn aside the coverings 
and torn away the veils; Whose light thereupon shone out, 
Whose signs and tokens were spread abroad, and His 
mysteries laid bare.  Then did His clouds part and loaded 
 
+P254 
down the earth with His bounties and bestowals, and made 
all things sweet with rain, and caused the fresh greenery of 
knowledge and the hyacinths of certitude to spring forth 
and to shake and tremble for joy, till the whole world was 
scented with the fragrance of His holiness.  
     Salutations and praise, blessings and glory be upon those 
divine realities, those sacred windflowers that have come 
forth out of this supreme bestowal, this flooding grace that 
hath roared like a clashing sea of gifts and bounties, tossing 
its waves to the high heavens.  
 
          O God, my God!  Praise be unto Thee for kindling 
     the fire of divine love in the Holy Tree on the summit of 
     the loftiest mount:  that Tree which is `neither of the east 
     nor of the west,'+F1 that fire which blazed out till the 
     flame of it soared upward to the Concourse on high, and 
     from it those realities caught the light of guidance, and 
     cried out:  `Verily have we perceived a fire on the slope of 
     Mount Sinai.'+F2  
          O God, my God!  Increase Thou this fire, as day 
     followeth day, till the blast of it setteth in motion all the 
     earth.  O Thou, my Lord!  Kindle the light of Thy love 
     in every heart, breathe into men's souls the spirit of Thy 
     knowledge, gladden their breasts with the verses of Thy 
     oneness.  Call Thou to life those who dwell in their 
     tombs, warn Thou the prideful, make happiness world-wide, 
     send down Thy crystal waters, and in the assemblage 
     of manifest splendours, pass round that cup which is 
     `tempered at the camphor fountain.'+F3  
          Verily art Thou the Giving, the Forgiving, the 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 24:35 
+F2 cf. &amp;Qur'an 28:29 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 76:5 
 
+P255 
     Ever-Bestowing.  Verily art Thou the Merciful, the 
     Compassionate.  
 
     O ye loved ones of God!  The wine-cup of Heaven overfloweth, 
the banquet of God's Covenant is bright with 
festive lights, the dawn of all bestowals is breaking, the 
gentle winds of grace are blowing, and out of the invisible 
world come good tidings of bounties and gifts.  In flower-spangled 
meadows hath the divine springtime pitched its 
tents, and the spiritual are inhaling sweet scents from the 
Sheba of the spirit, carried their way by the east wind.  Now 
doth the mystic nightingale carol its odes, and buds of inner 
meaning are bursting into blossoms delicate and fair.  The 
field larks are become the festival's musicians, and lifting 
wondrous voices they cry and sing to the melodies of the 
Company on high, `Blessed are ye!  Glad Tidings!  Glad 
Tidings!'  And they urge on the revellers of the &amp;Abha 
Paradise to drink their fill, and they eloquently hold forth 
upon the celestial tree, and utter their sacred cries.  All this, 
that withered souls who tread the desert of the heedless, and 
faded ones lost in the sands of unconcern, may come to 
throbbing life again, and present themselves at the feasts and 
revels of the Lord God.  
     Praise be to Him!  The renown of His Cause hath reached 
to east and west, and word of the power of the &amp;Abha 
Beauty hath quickened north and south.  That cry from 
the American continent is a choir of holiness, that shout 
from far and near that riseth even to the Company on high 
is `&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!'  Now is the east lit up with a glory, 
and the west rose-sweet, and all the earth is fragrant with 
ambergris, and the winds that blow over the Holy Shrine 
are laden with musk.  Erelong shall ye see that even the 
darkest lands are bright, and the continents of Europe and 
 
+P256 
Africa have turned into gardens of flowers, and forests of 
blossoming trees.  
     But since the dawning of this Day-Star was in Persia, and 
since from that orient the sun shone upon the west, it is 
our fondest hope that the flames of love's fire should blaze 
ever more vehemently in that land, and that there the 
splendour of this Holy Faith should grow ever more 
intense.  May the tumult of God's Cause so shake that land 
to its foundations, may the spiritual force of His Word so 
manifest itself, as to make &amp;Iran the core and focus of well-being 
and peace.  May rectitude and conciliation, and love 
and trust, issuing forth from &amp;Iran, bring immortality to all 
on earth.  May she raise on the highest summits the banner 
of public order, of purest spirituality, of universal peace.  
     O ye loved ones of God!  In this, the &amp;Baha'i dispensation, 
God's Cause is spirit unalloyed.  His Cause belongeth not to 
the material world.  It cometh neither for strife nor war, nor 
for acts of mischief or of shame; it is neither for quarrelling 
with other Faiths, nor for conflicts with the nations.  Its only 
army is the love of God, its only joy the clear wine of His 
knowledge, its only battle the expounding of the Truth; its 
one crusade is against the insistent self, the evil promptings 
of the human heart.  Its victory is to submit and yield, and to 
be selfless is its everlasting glory.  In brief, it is spirit upon 
spirit:  
 
          Unless ye must, 
          Bruise not the serpent in the dust, 
          How much less wound a man.  
          And if ye can, 
          No ant should ye alarm, 
          Much less a brother harm.  
 
     Let all your striving be for this, to become the source of 
life and immortality, and peace and comfort and joy, to 
 
+P257 
every human soul, whether one known to you or a stranger, 
one opposed to you or on your side.  Look ye not upon the 
purity or impurity of his nature:  look ye upon the all-embracing 
mercy of the Lord, the light of Whose grace 
hath embosomed the whole earth and all who dwell 
thereon, and in the plenitude of Whose bounty are immersed 
both the wise and the ignorant.  Stranger and friend 
alike are seated at the table of His favour.  Even as the 
believer, the denier who turneth away from God doth at 
the same time cup his hands and drink from the sea of His 
bestowals.  
     It behoveth the loved ones of the Lord to be the signs and 
tokens of His universal mercy and the embodiments of His 
own excelling grace.  Like the sun, let them cast their rays 
upon garden and rubbish heap alike, and even as clouds in 
spring, let them shed down their rain upon flower and thorn.  
Let them seek but love and faithfulness, let them not follow 
the ways of unkindness, let their talk be confined to the 
secrets of friendship and of peace.  Such are the attributes of 
the righteous, such is the distinguishing mark of those who 
serve His Threshold.  
     The &amp;Abha Beauty endured the most afflictive of calamities.  
He bore countless agonies and ills.  He enjoyed not a 
moment's peace, drew not an easeful breath.  He wandered, 
homeless, over desert sands and mountain slopes; He was 
shut in a fortress, and a prison cell.  But to Him, His pauper's 
mat of straw was an eternal throne of glory, and His heavy 
chains a sovereign's carcanet.  By day, by night, He lived 
under a whirring sword, and He was ready from moment 
to moment for death on the cross.  He bore all this that He 
might purify the world, and deck it out with the tender 
mercies of the Lord God; that He might set it at rest; that 
conflict and aggression might be put to flight, the lance and 
 
+P258 
the keen blade be exchanged for loving fellowship, malevolence 
and war turn into safety and gentleness and love, 
that battlefields of hate and wrath should become gardens of 
delight, and places where once the blood-drenched armies 
clashed, be fragrant pleasure grounds; that warfare should 
be seen as shame, and the resort to arms, even as a loathsome 
sickness, be shunned by every people; that universal peace 
raise its pavilions on the loftiest mounts, and war be made to 
perish forever from the earth.  
     Wherefore must the loved ones of God, laboriously, 
with the waters of their striving, tend and nourish and 
foster this tree of hope.  In whatsoever land they dwell, let 
them with a whole heart befriend and be companions to 
those who are either close to them, or far removed.  Let 
them, with qualities like unto those of heaven, promote the 
institutions and the religion of God.  Let them never lose 
heart, never be despondent, never feel afflicted.  The more 
antagonism they meet, the more let them show their own 
good faith; the more torments and calamities they have to 
face, the more generously let them pass round the bounteous 
cup.  Such is the spirit which will become the life of the 
world, such is the spreading light at its heart:  and he who 
may be and do other than this is not worthy to serve at the 
Holy Threshold of the Lord.  
     O ye loved ones of God!  The Sun of Truth is shining 
down from invisible skies; know ye the value of these days.  
Lift up your heads, and grow ye cypress-tall in these swift-running 
streams.  Take ye joy in the beauty of the narcissus 
of Najd, for night will fall and it will be no more....  
     O ye loved ones of God!  Praise be to Him, the bright 
banner of the Covenant is flying higher every day, while 
the flag of perfidy hath been reversed, and hangeth at half-mast.  
The benighted attackers have been shaken to their 
 
+P259 
core; they are now as ruined sepulchres, and even as blind 
creatures that dwell beneath the earth they creep and crawl 
about a corner of the tomb, and out of that hole, from time 
to time, like unto savage beasts, do they jibber and howl.  
Glory be to God!  How can the darkness hope to overcome 
the light, how can a magician's cords hold fast `a serpent 
plain for all to see'?  `Then lo!  It swallowed up their lying 
wonders.'+F1  Alas for them!  They have deluded themselves 
with a fable, and to indulge their appetites they have done 
away with their own selves.  They gave up everlasting glory 
in exchange for human pride, and they sacrificed greatness 
in both worlds to the demands of the insistent self.  This is 
that of which We have forewarned you.  Erelong shall ye 
behold the foolish in manifest loss.  
 
          O my Lord and my Hope!  Help Thou Thy loved 
     ones to be steadfast in Thy mighty Covenant, to remain 
     faithful to Thy manifest Cause, and to carry out the 
     commandments Thou didst set down for them in Thy 
     Book of Splendours; that they may become banners of 
     guidance and lamps of the Company above, wellsprings 
     of Thine infinite wisdom, and stars that lead aright, as 
     they shine down from the supernal sky.  
          Verily art Thou the Invincible, the Almighty, the 
     All-Powerful.  
 
     207.  O ye who have turned your faces toward the 
Exalted Beauty!  By night, by day, at morningtide and sunset, 
when darkness draweth on, and at early light I remember, 
and ever have remembered, in the realms of my mind 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 26:31; 26:44; the reference is to Moses' rod, and the 
+F1 enchanters.  
 
+P260 
and heart, the loved ones of the Lord.  I beg of Him to 
bestow His confirmations upon those loved ones, dwellers 
in that pure and holy land, and to grant them successful 
outcomes in all things:  that in their character, their behaviour, 
their words, their way of life, in all they are and 
do, He will make them to achieve distinction among men; 
that He will gather them into the world community, their 
hearts filled with ecstasy and fervour and yearning love, 
with knowledge and certitude, with steadfastness and unity, 
their faces beauteous and bright.  
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  This day is the day of union, 
the day of the ingathering of all mankind.  `Verily God 
loveth those who, as though they were a solid wall, do 
battle for His Cause in serried lines!'+F1  Note that He saith `in 
serried lines'--meaning crowded and pressed together, one 
locked to the next, each supporting his fellows.  To do 
battle, as stated in the sacred verse, doth not, in this greatest 
of all dispensations, mean to go forth with sword and spear, 
with lance and piercing arrow--but rather weaponed with 
pure intent, with righteous motives, with counsels helpful 
and effective, with godly attributes, with deeds pleasing to 
the Almighty, with the qualities of heaven.  It signifieth 
education for all mankind, guidance for all men, the 
spreading far and wide of the sweet savours of the spirit, the 
promulgation of God's proofs, the setting forth of arguments 
conclusive and divine, the doing of charitable deeds.  
     Whensoever holy souls, drawing on the powers of 
heaven, shall arise with such qualities of the spirit, and 
march in unison, rank on rank, every one of those souls will 
be even as one thousand, and the surging waves of that 
mighty ocean will be even as the battalions of the Concourse 
on high.  What a blessing that will be--when all shall come 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 61:4 
 
+P261 
together, even as once separate torrents, rivers and streams, 
running brooks and single drops, when collected together 
in one place will form a mighty sea.  And to such a degree 
will the inherent unity of all prevail, that the traditions, 
rules, customs and distinctions in the fanciful life of these 
populations will be effaced and vanish away like isolated 
drops, once the great sea of oneness doth leap and surge and 
roll.  
     I swear by the Ancient Beauty, that at such a time overwhelming 
grace will so encircle all, and the sea of grandeur 
will so overflow its shores, that the narrowest strip of water 
will grow wide as an endless sea, and every merest drop will 
be even as the shoreless deep.  
     O ye loved ones of God!  Struggle and strive to reach that 
high station, and to make a splendour so to shine across 
these realms of earth that the rays of it will be reflected back 
from a dawning-point on the horizon of eternity.  This is the 
very foundation of the Cause of God.  This is the very pith 
of the Law of God.  This is the mighty structure raised up by 
the Manifestations of God.  This is why the orb of God's 
world dawneth.  This is why the Lord establisheth Himself 
on the throne of His human body.  
     O ye loved ones of God!  See how the Exalted One+F1--
may the souls of all on earth be a ransom for Him--for this 
high purpose made His blessed heart the target for affliction's 
spears; and because the real intent of the Ancient 
Beauty--for Him may the souls of the Concourse on high 
be offered up--was to win this same supernal goal, the 
Exalted One bared His holy breast for a target to a myriad 
bullets fired by the people of malice and hate, and with 
utter meekness died the martyr's death.  On the dust of this 
pathway the holy blood of thousands upon thousands of 
 
+F1 The &amp;Bab 
 
+P262 
sacred souls gushed out, and many a time the blessed body 
of a loyal lover of God was hanged to the gallows tree.  
     The &amp;Abha Beauty Himself--may the spirit of all existence 
be offered up for His loved ones--bore all manner of 
ordeals, and willingly accepted for Himself intense afflictions.  
No torment was there left that His sacred form was 
not subjected to, no suffering that did not descend upon 
Him.  How many a night, when He was chained, did He go 
sleepless because of the weight of His iron collar; how many 
a day the burning pain of the stocks and fetters gave Him 
no moment's peace.  From &amp;Niyavaran to &amp;Tihran they made 
Him run--He, that embodied spirit, He Who had been 
accustomed to repose against cushions of ornamented silk--
chained, shoeless, His head bared; and down under the 
earth, in the thick darkness of that narrow dungeon, they 
shut Him up with murderers, rebels and thieves.  Ever and 
again they assailed Him with a new torment, and all were 
certain that from one moment to the next He would suffer 
a martyr's death.  After some time they banished Him from 
His native land, and sent Him to countries alien and far 
away.  During many a year in &amp;Iraq, no moment passed but 
the arrow of a new anguish struck His holy heart; with 
every breath a sword came down upon that sacred body, 
and He could hope for no moment of security and rest.  
From every side His enemies mounted their attack with unrelenting 
hate; and singly and alone He withstood them all.  
After all these tribulations, these body blows, they flung 
Him out of &amp;Iraq in the continent of Asia, to the continent of 
Europe, and in that place of bitter exile, of wretched hardships, 
to the wrongs that were heaped upon Him by the 
people of the &amp;Qur'an were now added the virulent persecutions, 
the powerful attacks, the plottings, the slanders, the 
continual hostilities, the hate and malice, of the people of 
 
+P263 
the &amp;Bayan.  My pen is powerless to tell it all; but ye have 
surely been informed of it.  Then, after twenty-four years in 
this, the Most Great Prison, in agony and sore affliction, 
His days drew to a close.  
     To sum it up, the Ancient Beauty was ever, during His 
sojourn in this transitory world, either a captive bound with 
chains, or living under a sword, or subjected to extreme 
suffering and torment, or held in the Most Great Prison.  
Because of His physical weakness, brought on by His 
afflictions, His blessed body was worn away to a breath; it 
was light as a cobweb from long grieving.  And His reason 
for shouldering this heavy load and enduring all this 
anguish, which was even as an ocean that hurleth its waves 
to high heaven--His reason for putting on the heavy iron 
chains and for becoming the very embodiment of utter 
resignation and meekness, was to lead every soul on earth to 
concord, to fellow-feeling, to oneness; to make known 
amongst all peoples the sign of the singleness of God, so 
that at last the primal oneness deposited at the heart of all 
created things would bear its destined fruit, and the splendour 
of `No difference canst thou see in the creation of the 
God of Mercy,'+F1 would cast abroad its rays.  
     Now is the time, O ye beloved of the Lord, for ardent 
endeavour.  Struggle ye, and strive.  And since the Ancient 
Beauty was exposed by day and night on the field of 
martyrdom, let us in our turn labour hard, and hear and 
ponder the counsels of God; let us fling away our lives, and 
renounce our brief and numbered days.  Let us turn our 
eyes away from empty fantasies of this world's divergent 
forms, and serve instead this pre-eminent purpose, this 
grand design.  Let us not, because of our own imaginings, 
cut down this tree that the hand of heavenly grace hath 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 67:3 
 
+P264 
planted; let us not, with the dark clouds of our illusions, 
our selfish interests, blot out the glory that streameth from 
the &amp;Abha Realm.  Let us not be as barriers that wall out 
the rolling ocean of Almighty God.  Let us not prevent the 
pure, sweet scents from the garden of the All-Glorious 
Beauty from blowing far and wide.  Let us not, on this day 
of reunion, shut out the vernal downpour of blessings from 
on high.  Let us not consent that the splendours of the Sun of 
Truth should ever fade and disappear.  These are the admonitions 
of God, as set forth in His Holy Books, His Scriptures, 
His Tablets that tell out His counsellings to the sincere.  
     The glory rest upon you, and God's mercy, and God's 
blessings.  
 
     208.  O ye servants of the Sacred Threshold!  The 
triumphant hosts of the Celestial Concourse, arrayed and 
marshalled in the Realms above, stand ready and expectant 
to assist and assure victory to that valiant horseman who 
with confidence spurs on his charger into the arena of 
service.  Well is it with that fearless warrior, who armed 
with the power of true Knowledge, hastens unto the field, 
disperses the armies of ignorance, and scatters the hosts of 
error, who holds aloft the Standard of Divine Guidance, 
and sounds the Clarion of Victory.  By the righteousness 
of the Lord!  He hath achieved a glorious triumph and 
obtained the true victory.  
 
     209.  O ye servants of the Blessed Beauty!...  It is clear 
that in this day, confirmations from the unseen world are 
encompassing all those who deliver the divine Message.  
Should the work of teaching lapse, these confirmations 
 
+P265 
would be entirely cut off, since it is impossible for the loved 
ones of God to receive assistance unless they teach.  
     Under all conditions, the teaching must be carried forward, 
but with wisdom.  If the work cannot proceed openly, 
then let them teach in private, and thus engender spirituality 
and fellowship among the children of men.  If, for example, 
each and every one of the believers would become a true 
friend to one of the unheeding, and, conducting himself 
with absolute rectitude, associate with this soul, treat him 
with the utmost kindness, himself exemplify the divine 
instructions he hath received, the good qualities and behaviour 
patterns, and at all times act in accord with the 
admonitions of God--it is certain that little by little he will 
succeed in awakening that previously heedless individual, 
and in changing his ignorance to knowledge of the truth.  
     Souls are inclined toward estrangement.  Steps should 
first be taken to do away with this estrangement, for only 
then will the Word take effect.  If a believer showeth kindness 
to one of the neglectful, and, with great love, gradually 
leadeth him to an understanding of the validity of the Holy 
Cause, so that he may come to know the fundamentals of 
God's Faith and the implications thereof--such a one will 
certainly be transformed, excepting only those seldom-encountered 
individuals who are even as ashes, whose hearts 
are `hard as rocks, or harder still.'+F1  
     If every one of the friends should strive in this way to 
guide one soul aright, the number of believers will double 
every year; and this can be accomplished with prudence and 
wisdom, and no harm whatever would result therefrom.  
     Furthermore, the teachers must travel about, and if 
spreading the Message openly should cause a disturbance, 
then instead, let them stimulate and train the believers, 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 2:69 
 
+P266 
inspire them, delight them, rejoice their hearts, revive and 
refresh them with the sweet savours of holiness.  
 
     210.  O ye roses in the garden of God's love!  O ye 
bright lamps in the assemblage of His knowledge!  May the 
soft breathings of God pass over you, may the Glory of God 
illumine the horizon of your hearts.  Ye are the waves of the 
deep sea of knowledge, ye are the massed armies on the 
plains of certitude, ye are the stars in the skies of God's 
compassion, ye are the stones that put the people of perdition 
to flight, ye are clouds of divine pity over the gardens 
of life, ye are the abundant grace of God's oneness that is 
shed upon the essences of all created things.  
     On the outspread tablet of this world, ye are the verses 
of His singleness; and atop lofty palace towers, ye are the 
banners of the Lord.  In His bowers are ye the blossoms and 
sweet-smelling herbs, in the rose garden of the spirit the 
nightingales that utter plaintive cries.  Ye are the birds that 
soar upward into the firmament of knowledge, the royal 
falcons on the wrist of God.  
     Why then are ye quenched, why silent, why leaden and 
dull?  Ye must shine forth like the lightning, and raise up a 
clamouring like unto the great sea.  Like a candle must ye 
shed your light, and even as the soft breezes of God must ye 
blow across the world.  Even as sweet breaths from heavenly 
bowers, as musk-laden winds from the gardens of the Lord, 
must ye perfume the air for the people of knowledge, and 
even as the splendours shed by the true Sun, must ye 
illumine the hearts of humankind.  For ye are the life-laden 
winds, ye are the jessamine-scents from the gardens of the 
saved.  Bring then life to the dead, and awaken those who 
slumber.  In the darkness of the world be ye radiant flames; 
 
+P267 
in the sands of perdition, be ye well-springs of the water of 
life, be ye guidance from the Lord God.  Now is the time to 
serve, now is the time to be on fire.  Know ye the value of 
this chance, this favourable juncture that is limitless grace, 
ere it slip from your hands.  
     Soon will our handful of days, our vanishing life, be 
gone, and we shall pass, empty-handed, into the hollow 
that is dug for those who speak no more; wherefore must 
we bind our hearts to the manifest Beauty, and cling to the 
lifeline that faileth never.  We must gird ourselves for service, 
kindle love's flame, and burn away in its heat.  We 
must loose our tongues till we set the wide world's heart 
afire, and with bright rays of guidance blot out the armies 
of the night, and then, for His sake, on the field of sacrifice, 
fling down our lives.  
     Thus let us scatter over every people the treasured gems 
of the recognition of God, and with the decisive blade of the 
tongue, and the sure arrows of knowledge, let us defeat the 
hosts of self and passion, and hasten onward to the site of 
martyrdom, to the place where we die for the Lord.  And 
then, with flying flags, and to the beat of drums, let us pass 
into the realm of the All-Glorious, and join the Company 
on high.  
     Well is it with the doers of great deeds.  
 
     211.  When the friends do not endeavour to spread the 
message, they fail to remember God befittingly, and will 
not witness the tokens of assistance and confirmation from 
the &amp;Abha Kingdom nor comprehend the divine mysteries.  
However, when the tongue of the teacher is engaged in 
teaching, he will naturally himself be stimulated, will 
become a magnet attracting the divine aid and bounty of 
 
+P268 
the Kingdom, and will be like unto the bird at the hour of 
dawn, which itself becometh exhilarated by its own singing, 
its warbling and its melody.  
 
     212.  It is at such times that the friends of God avail 
themselves of the occasion, seize the opportunity, rush 
forth and win the prize.  If their task is to be confined to 
good conduct and advice, nothing will be accomplished.  
They must speak out, expound the proofs, set forth clear 
arguments, draw irrefutable conclusions establishing the 
truth of the manifestation of the Sun of Reality.  
 
     213.  The teaching work should under all conditions be 
actively pursued by the believers because divine confirmations 
are dependent upon it.  Should a &amp;Baha'i refrain from 
being fully, vigorously and wholeheartedly involved in the 
teaching work he will undoubtedly be deprived of the 
blessings of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  Even so, this activity 
should be tempered with wisdom--not that wisdom which 
requireth one to be silent and forgetful of such an obligation, 
but rather that which requireth one to display divine 
tolerance, love, kindness, patience, a goodly character, and 
holy deeds.  In brief, encourage the friends individually to 
teach the Cause of God and draw their attention to this 
meaning of wisdom mentioned in the Writings, which is 
itself the essence of teaching the Faith--but all this to be 
done with the greatest tolerance, so that heavenly assistance 
and divine confirmation may aid the friends.  
 
     214.  Follow thou the way of thy Lord, and say not 
that which the ears cannot bear to hear, for such speech is 
 
+P269 
like luscious food given to small children.  However palatable, 
rare and rich the food may be, it cannot be assimilated 
by the digestive organs of a suckling child.  Therefore unto 
every one who hath a right, let his settled measure be 
given.  
     `Not everything that a man knoweth can be disclosed, 
nor can everything that he can disclose be regarded as 
timely, nor can every timely utterance be considered as 
suited to the capacity of those who hear it.'  Such is the consummate 
wisdom to be observed in thy pursuits.  Be not 
oblivious thereof, if thou wishest to be a man of action 
under all conditions.  First diagnose the disease and identify 
the malady, then prescribe the remedy, for such is the perfect 
method of the skilful physician.  
 
     215.  My hope from the grace of the One true Lord 
is that thou wilt be enabled to spread the fragrances of 
God among the tribes.  This is extremely important....  
     If thou succeedest in rendering this service thou shalt 
excel and be the leader in the field.  
 
     216.  Rest assured that the breathings of the Holy Spirit 
will loosen thy tongue.  Speak, therefore; speak out with 
great courage at every meeting.  When thou art about to 
begin thine address, turn first to &amp;Baha'u'llah, and ask for the 
confirmations of the Holy Spirit, then open thy lips and say 
whatever is suggested to thy heart; this, however, with the 
utmost courage, dignity and conviction.  It is my hope that 
from day to day your gatherings will grow and flourish, 
and that those who are seeking after truth will hearken 
 
+P270 
therein to reasoned arguments and conclusive proofs.  I am 
with you heart and soul at every meeting; be sure of this.  
 
     217.  The teacher, when teaching, must be himself 
fully enkindled, so that his utterance, like unto a flame of 
fire, may exert influence and consume the veil of self and 
passion.  He must also be utterly humble and lowly so that 
others may be edified, and be totally self-effaced and evanescent 
so that he may teach with the melody of the Concourse 
on high--otherwise his teaching will have no effect.  
 
     218.  O ye close and dear friends of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  
               In the Orient scatter perfumes, 
               And shed splendours on the West.  
               Carry light unto the Bulgar, 
               And the Slav with life invest.  
     One year after the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah, there came 
this verse from the lips of the Centre of the Covenant.  The 
Covenant-breakers found it strange indeed, and they treated 
it with scorn.  Yet, praised be God, its effects are now manifest, 
its power revealed, its import clear; for by God's grace, 
today both East and West are trembling for joy, and now, 
from sweet waftings of holiness, the whole earth is scented 
with musk.  
     The Blessed Beauty, in unmistakable language, hath 
made this promise in His Book:  `We behold you from Our 
realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever will arise for the 
triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on 
high and a company of Our favoured angels.'+F1  
     God be thanked, that promised aid hath been vouchsafed, 
 
+F1 Gleanings from the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, LXXII 
 
+P271 
as is plain for all to see, and it shineth forth as clear as the sun 
in the heavens.  
     Wherefore, O ye friends of God, redouble your efforts, 
strain every nerve, till ye triumph in your servitude to the 
Ancient Beauty, the Manifest Light, and become the cause 
of spreading far and wide the rays of the Day-Star of Truth.  
Breathe ye into the world's worn and wasted body the fresh 
breath of life, and in the furrows of every region sow ye 
holy seed.  Rise up to champion this Cause; open your lips 
and teach.  In the meeting place of life be ye a guiding 
candle; in the skies of this world be dazzling stars; in the 
gardens of unity be birds of the spirit, singing of inner 
truths and mysteries.  
     Expend your every breath of life in this great Cause and 
dedicate all your days to the service of &amp;Baha, so that in the 
end, safe from loss and deprivation, ye will inherit the 
heaped-up treasures of the realms above.  For the days of a 
man are full of peril and he cannot rely on so much as a 
moment more of life; and still the people, who are even as 
a wavering mirage of illusions, tell themselves that in the 
end they shall reach the heights.  Alas for them!  The men of 
bygone times hugged these same fancies to their breasts, 
until a wave flicked over them and they returned to dust, 
and they found themselves excluded and bereft--all save 
those souls who had freed themselves from self and had 
flung away their lives in the pathway of God.  Their bright 
star shone out in the skies of ancient glory, and the handed-down 
memories of all the ages are the proof of what I say.  
     Wherefore, rest ye neither day nor night and seek no 
ease.  Tell ye the secrets of servitude, follow the pathway of 
service, till ye attain the promised succour that cometh 
from the realms of God.  
     O friends!  Black clouds have shrouded all this earth, and 
 
+P272 
the darkness of hatred and malice, of cruelty and aggression 
and defilement is spreading far and wide.  The people, one 
and all, live out their lives in a heedless stupor and the chief 
virtues of man are held to be his rapacity and his thirst for 
blood.  Out of all the mass of humankind God hath chosen 
the friends, and He hath favoured them with His guidance 
and boundless grace.  His purpose is this, that we, all of us, 
should strive with our whole hearts to offer ourselves up, 
guide others to His path, and train the souls of men--until 
these frenzied beasts change to gazelles in the meadows of 
oneness, and these wolves to lambs of God, and these 
brutish creatures to angelic hosts; till the fires of hatred are 
quenched, and the flame coming out of the sheltered vale of 
the Holy Shrine doth shed its splendours; till the foul odour 
of the tyrant's dunghill is blown away, and yieldeth to the 
pure, sweet scents that stream from the rosebeds of faith and 
trust.  On that day will the weak of intellect draw on the 
bounty of the divine, Universal Mind, and they whose life is 
but abomination will seek out these cleansing, holy breaths.  
     But there needs must be souls who will manifest such 
bestowals, there needs must be husbandmen to till these 
fields, gardeners for these gardens, there needs must be fish 
to swim in this sea, stars to gleam in these heavens.  These 
ailing ones must be tended by spiritual physicians, these 
who are the lost need gentle guides--so that from such souls 
the bereft may receive their portion, and the deprived 
obtain their share, and the poor discover in such as they 
unmeasured wealth, and the seekers hear from them unanswerable 
proofs.  
     O my Lord, my Defender, my Help in peril!  Lowly do I 
entreat Thee, ailing do I come unto Thee to be healed, 
humbly do I cry out to Thee with my tongue, my soul, my 
spirit:  
 
+P273 
     O God, my God!  The gloom of night hath shrouded 
every region, and all the earth is shut away behind thick 
clouds.  The peoples of the world are sunk in the black 
depths of vain illusions, while their tyrants wallow in 
cruelty and hate.  I see nothing but the glare of searing fires 
that blaze upward from the nethermost abyss, I hear nothing 
save the thunderous roar that belloweth out from thousands 
upon thousands of fiery weapons of assault, while every 
land is crying aloud in its secret tongue:  `My riches avail me 
nothing, and my sovereignty hath perished!'  
     O my Lord, the lamps of guidance have gone out.  The 
flames of passion are mounting high, and malevolence is 
ever gaining on the world.  Malice and hate have overspread 
the face of the whole earth, and I find no souls except Thine 
own oppressed small band who are raising up this cry:  
     Make haste to love!  Make haste to trust!  Make haste to 
give!  To guidance come!  
     Come ye for harmony!  To behold the Star of Day!  
Come here for kindliness, for ease!  Come here for amity 
and peace!  
     Come and cast down your weapons of wrath, till unity 
is won!  Come and in the Lord's true path each one help 
each one.  
     Verily with exceeding joy, with heart and soul, do these 
oppressed of Thine offer themselves up for all mankind in 
every land.  Thou seest them, O my Lord, weeping over the 
tears Thy people shed, mourning the grief of Thy children, 
condoling with humankind, suffering because of the 
calamities that beset all the denizens of the earth.  
     O my Lord, wing them with victory that they may soar 
upward to salvation, strengthen their loins in service to Thy 
people, and their backs in servitude to Thy Threshold of 
Holiness.  
 
+P274 
     Verily Thou art the Generous, verily Thou art the 
Merciful!  There is none other God save Thee, the Clement, 
the Pitiful, the Ancient of Days!  
 
     219.  O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!  Your 
letter, which was surely inspired of heaven, hath been 
received.  Its contents were most pleasing, its sentiments 
arising out of luminous hearts.  
     The believers in London are indeed steadfast and true, 
they are resolute, they are constant in service; when put to 
the test, they do not falter, nor doth their fire abate with the 
passage of time; rather, they are &amp;Baha'is.  They are of 
heaven, they are filled with light, they are of God.  Without 
any doubt they will become the cause of raising high the 
Word of God, and advancing the oneness of the world of 
man; of promoting the teachings of God, and spreading far 
and near the equality of every member of the human race.  
     It is easy to approach the Kingdom of Heaven, but hard 
to stand firm and staunch within it, for the tests are rigorous, 
and heavy to bear.  But the English remain steadfast under 
all conditions, neither at the first sign of trouble do their 
footsteps slip.  They are not changeable, playing fast and 
loose with some project and soon giving it up.  They do not, 
for some trivial reason, fail in enthusiasm and zeal, their 
interest gone.  No, in all they do, they are stable, rock-solid 
and staunch.  
     Although ye dwell in western lands, still, praise be to 
God, ye did hear His call from out the east and, even as 
Moses, did warm your hands at the fire kindled in the Asian 
Tree.  Ye did find the true path, were lit like unto lamps, 
and have come into the Kingdom of God.  And now have 
ye arisen, out of gratitude for these blessings, and ye are 
 
+P275 
asking God's help for all the peoples of the earth, that their 
eyes as well may behold the splendours of the &amp;Abha Realm, 
and their hearts, even as mirrors, reflect the bright rays of 
the Sun of Truth.  
     It is my hope that the breaths of the Holy Spirit will so 
be breathed into your hearts that your tongues will disclose 
the mysteries, and set forth and expound the inner meanings 
of the Holy Books; that the friends will become physicians, 
and will, through the potent medicine of the heavenly 
Teachings, heal the long-standing diseases that afflict the 
body of this world; that they will make the blind to see, the 
deaf to hear, the dead to come alive; that they will awaken 
those who are sound asleep.  
     Rest ye assured that the confirmations of the Holy Spirit 
will descend upon you, and that the armies of the &amp;Abha 
Kingdom will grant you the victory.  
 
     220.  The Lord of all mankind hath fashioned this 
human realm to be a Garden of Eden, an earthly paradise.  
If, as it must, it findeth the way to harmony and peace, to 
love and mutual trust, it will become a true abode of bliss, a 
place of manifold blessings and unending delights.  Therein 
shall be revealed the excellence of humankind, therein shall 
the rays of the Sun of Truth shine forth on every hand.  
     Remember how Adam and the others once dwelt together 
in Eden.  No sooner, however, did a quarrel break 
out between Adam and Satan than they were, one and all, 
banished from the Garden, and this was meant as a warning 
to the human race, a means of telling humankind that 
dissension--even with the Devil--is the way to bitter loss.  
This is why, in our illumined age, God teacheth that conflicts 
and disputes are not allowable, not even with Satan himself.  
 
+P276 
     Gracious God!  Even with such a lesson before him, how 
heedless is man!  Still do we see his world at war from pole 
to pole.  There is war among the religions; war among the 
nations; war among the peoples; war among the rulers.  
What a welcome change would it be, if only these black 
clouds would lift from off the skies of the world, so that the 
light of reality could be shed abroad!  If only the darksome 
dust of this continual fighting and killing could settle forever, 
and the sweet winds of God's loving-kindness could 
blow from out the well-spring of peace.  Then would this 
world become another world, and the earth would shine 
with the light of her Lord.  
     If there is any hope, it is solely in the bounties of God:  
that His strengthening grace will come, and the struggling 
and contending will cease, and the acid bite of blood-dripping 
steel will be turned into the honey-dew of friendship 
and probity and trust.  How sweet would that day be in 
the mouth, how fragrant as musk the scent thereof.  
     God grant that the new year will bring a promise of the 
new peace.  May He enable this distinguished assemblage to 
conclude a fair treaty and establish a just covenant, that you 
may be blessed forever, across the unborn reaches of time.  
 
     [Addressed to the readers of The Christian Commonwealth, 1 
     January 1913] 
 
     221.  O ye who are steadfast in the Covenant!  The 
pilgrim hath made mention of each one of you, and hath 
asked for a separate letter addressed to each, but this wanderer 
in the wilderness of God's love is withheld from correspondence 
by a thousand preoccupations and concerns; and 
since out of the easts and the wests of the earth there 
 
+P277 
poureth a mounting flood of letters upon him, it would be 
impossible to send a separate letter to each one, wherefore 
this one letter is addressed to each of you, that it may, as 
sealed wine, rejoice your souls and warm your hearts.  
     O ye steadfast loved ones!  The grace of God is beating 
down upon mankind, even as the rains in spring, and the 
rays of the manifest Light have made this earth to be the 
envy of heaven.  But alas, the blind are deprived of this 
bounty, the heedless are closed off from it, the withered 
despair of it, the faded are dying away--so that even as 
flooding waters, this endless stream of grace passeth back 
into its primal source in a hidden sea.  Only a few receive 
this grace and take their share of it.  Wherefore, let us put 
our hopes in whatever the strong arm of the Beloved can 
bring about.  
     We trust that in a time to come the slumberers will 
waken, and the heedless will be made aware, and the 
excluded will become initiates in the mysteries.  Now must 
the friends work on with heart and soul and put forth a 
mighty effort, until the ramparts of dissension are toppled 
down and the glories of the oneness of humanity lead all to 
unity.  
     Today the one overriding need is unity and harmony 
among the beloved of the Lord, for they should have among 
them but one heart and soul and should, so far as in them 
lieth, unitedly withstand the hostility of all the peoples of 
the world; they must bring to an end the benighted prejudices 
of all nations and religions and must make known to 
every member of the human race that all are the leaves of 
one branch, the fruits of one bough.  
     Until such time, however, as the friends establish perfect 
unity among themselves, how can they summon others to 
harmony and peace?  
 
+P278 
          That soul which hath itself not come alive, 
          Can it then hope another to revive?  
     Reflect ye as to other than human forms of life and be ye 
admonished thereby:  those clouds that drift apart cannot 
produce the bounty of the rain, and are soon lost; a flock 
of sheep, once scattered, falleth prey to the wolf, and birds 
that fly alone will be caught fast in the claws of the hawk.  
What greater demonstration could there be that unity 
leadeth to flourishing life, while dissension and withdrawing 
from the others, will lead only to misery; for 
these are the sure ways to bitter disappointment and 
ruin.  
     The holy Manifestations of God were sent down to make 
visible the oneness of humanity.  For this did They endure 
unnumbered ills and tribulations, that a community from 
amongst mankind's divergent peoples could gather within 
the shadow of the Word of God and live as one, and could, 
with delight and grace, demonstrate on earth the unity of 
humankind.  Therefore must the desire of the friends be this, 
to bring together and unify all peoples, that all may receive 
a generous drink of this pure wine from this cup that is 
`tempered at the camphor fountain.'+F1  Let them make the 
differing populations to be as one and induce the hostile and 
murderous kindreds of the earth to love one another 
instead.  Let them loose from their shackles the captives of 
sensual desires and cause the excluded to become intimates 
of the mysteries.  Let them give to the bereft a share of the 
blessings of these days; let them guide the portionless to 
inexhaustible treasure.  This grace can come about through 
words and ways and deeds that are of the Unseen Kingdom 
but, lacking such, it can never be.  
     The confirmations of God are the surety for these 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 76:5 
 
+P279 
blessings; the sacred bounty of God bestoweth these great 
gifts.  The friends of God are supported by the Kingdom on 
high and they win their victories through the massed 
armies of the most great guidance.  Thus for them every 
difficulty will be made smooth, every problem will most 
easily be solved.  
     Note ye how easily, where unity existeth in a given 
family, the affairs of that family are conducted; what progress 
the members of that family make, how they prosper 
in the world.  Their concerns are in order, they enjoy comfort 
and tranquillity, they are secure, their position is assured, 
they come to be envied by all.  Such a family but addeth to 
its stature and its lasting honour, as day succeedeth day.  And 
if we widen out the sphere of unity a little to include the 
inhabitants of a village who seek to be loving and united, 
who associate with and are kind to one another, what great 
advances they will be seen to make, how secure and protected 
they will be.  Then let us widen out the sphere a little 
more, let us take the inhabitants of a city, all of them 
together:  if they establish the strongest bonds of unity 
among themselves, how far they will progress, even in a 
brief period and what power they will exert.  And if the 
sphere of unity be still further widened out, that is, if the 
inhabitants of a whole country develop peaceable hearts, 
and if with all their hearts and souls they yearn to cooperate 
with one another and to live in unity, and if they 
become kind and loving to one another, that country will 
achieve undying joy and lasting glory.  Peace will it have, 
and plenty, and vast wealth.  
     Note then:  if every clan, tribe, community, every 
nation, country, territory on earth should come together 
under the single-hued pavilion of the oneness of mankind, 
and by the dazzling rays of the Sun of Truth should 
 
+P280 
proclaim the universality of man; if they should cause all 
nations and all creeds to open wide their arms to one 
another, establish a World Council, and proceed to bind 
the members of society one to another by strong mutual 
ties, what would happen then?  There is no doubt whatsoever 
that the divine Beloved, in all His endearing beauty, 
and with Him a massive host of heavenly confirmations and 
human blessings and bestowals, would appear in His full 
glory before the assemblage of the world.  
     Wherefore, O ye beloved of the Lord, bestir yourselves, 
do all in your power to be as one, to live in peace, each with 
the others:  for ye are all the drops from but one ocean, the 
foliage of one tree, the pearls from a single shell, the flowers 
and sweet herbs from the same one garden.  And achieving 
that, strive ye to unite the hearts of those who follow other 
faiths.  
     For one another must ye give up even life itself.  To every 
human being must ye be infinitely kind.  Call none a 
stranger; think none to be your foe.  Be ye as if all men were 
your close kin and honoured friends.  Walk ye in such wise 
that this fleeting world will change into a splendour and 
this dismal heap of dust become a palace of delights.  Such is 
the counsel of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, this hapless servant.  
 
     222.  O ye homeless and wanderers in the Path of God!  
Prosperity, contentment, and freedom, however much 
desired and conducive to the gladness of the human heart, 
can in no wise compare with the trials of homelessness and 
adversity in the pathway of God; for such exile and banishment 
are blessed by the divine favour, and are surely followed 
by the mercy of Providence.  The joy of tranquillity 
in one's home, and the sweetness of freedom from all cares 
 
+P281 
shall pass away, whilst the blessing of homelessness shall 
endure forever, and its far-reaching results shall be made 
manifest.  
     Abraham's migration from His native land caused the 
bountiful gifts of the All-Glorious to be made manifest, and 
the setting of Canaan's brightest star unfolded to the eyes 
the radiance of Joseph.  The flight of Moses, the Prophet of 
Sinai, revealed the Flame of the Lord's burning Fire, and 
the rise of Jesus breathed the breaths of the Holy Spirit into 
the world.  The departure of &amp;Muhammad, the Beloved of 
God, from the city of His birth was the cause of the exaltation 
of God's Holy Word, and the banishment of the 
Sacred Beauty led to the diffusion of the light of His divine 
Revelation throughout all regions.  
     Take ye good heed, O people of insight!  
 
     223.  O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!  Your 
letter was received.  From its contents it was known that, 
praise be to God, your hearts are in the utmost purity and 
your souls rejoice in the glad tidings of God.  The mass of 
the people are occupied with self and worldly desire, are 
immersed in the ocean of the nether world and are captives 
of the world of nature, save those souls who have been freed 
from the chains and fetters of the material world and, like 
unto swift-flying birds, are soaring in this unbounded 
realm.  They are awake and vigilant, they shun the obscurity 
of the world of nature, their highest wish centereth on the 
eradication from among men of the struggle for existence, 
the shining forth of the spirituality and the love of the realm 
on high, the exercise of utmost kindness among peoples, 
the realization of an intimate and close connection between 
religions and the practice of the ideal of self-sacrifice.  Then 
 
+P282 
will the world of humanity be transformed into the Kingdom 
of God.  
     O ye friends, exert ye an effort!  Every expenditure is in 
need of an income.  This day, in the world of humanity, men 
are all the time expending, for war is nothing but the consumption 
of men and of wealth.  At least engage ye in a 
deed of profit to the world of humanity that ye may 
partially compensate for that loss.  Perchance, through the 
divine confirmations, ye may be assisted in promulgating 
amity and concord among men, in substituting love for 
enmity, in causing universal peace to result from universal 
war and in converting loss and rancour into profit and love.  
This wish will be realized through the power of the 
Kingdom.  
 
     224.  O thou servant of God!  Thy letter was received.  
Its contents were lofty and sublime, and its aim high and 
far-reaching.  The world of humanity is in need of great 
improvement, for it is a material jungle wherein trees without 
fruit flourish and useless weeds abound.  If at all there is 
a tree that beareth fruit it is overshadowed by the fruitless 
ones, and if a flower groweth in this jungle it is hidden and 
concealed.  The world of mankind is in need of expert 
gardeners who may convert these forests into delectable 
rose gardens, may substitute for these barren trees ones that 
yield fruit, and may replace these useless weeds with roses 
and fragrant herbs.  Thus active souls and vigilant people 
rest neither by day nor by night; they strive to be closely 
linked to the divine Kingdom and thereby become the 
manifestations of infinite bounty and ideal gardeners for 
these forests.  Thus the world of humanity will be wholly 
transformed and the merciful bounties become manifest.  
 
+P283 
     225.  O ye concourse of the Kingdom of &amp;Abha!  Two 
calls to success and prosperity are being raised from the 
heights of the happiness of mankind, awakening the slumbering, 
granting sight to the blind, causing the heedless to 
become mindful, bestowing hearing upon the deaf, unloosing 
the tongue of the mute and resuscitating the dead.  
     The one is the call of civilization, of the progress of the 
material world.  This pertaineth to the world of phenomena, 
promoteth the principles of material achievement, and is 
the trainer for the physical accomplishments of mankind.  It 
compriseth the laws, regulations, arts and sciences through 
which the world of humanity hath developed; laws and 
regulations which are the outcome of lofty ideals and the 
result of sound minds, and which have stepped forth into 
the arena of existence through the efforts of the wise and 
cultured in past and subsequent ages.  The propagator and 
executive power of this call is just government.  
     The other is the soul-stirring call of God, Whose spiritual 
teachings are safeguards of the everlasting glory, the eternal 
happiness and illumination of the world of humanity, and 
cause attributes of mercy to be revealed in the human world 
and the life beyond.  
     This second call is founded upon the instructions and 
exhortations of the Lord and the admonitions and altruistic 
emotions belonging to the realm of morality which, like 
unto a brilliant light, brighten and illumine the lamp of the 
realities of mankind.  Its penetrative power is the Word of 
God.  
     However, until material achievements, physical accomplishments 
and human virtues are reinforced by spiritual 
perfections, luminous qualities and characteristics of mercy, 
no fruit or result shall issue therefrom, nor will the happiness 
of the world of humanity, which is the ultimate aim, be 
 
+P284 
attained.  For although, on the one hand, material achievements 
and the development of the physical world produce 
prosperity, which exquisitely manifests its intended aims, 
on the other hand dangers, severe calamities and violent 
afflictions are imminent.  
     Consequently, when thou lookest at the orderly pattern 
of kingdoms, cities and villages, with the attractiveness of 
their adornments, the freshness of their natural resources, 
the refinement of their appliances, the ease of their means of 
travel, the extent of knowledge available about the world 
of nature, the great inventions, the colossal enterprises, the 
noble discoveries and scientific researches, thou wouldst 
conclude that civilization conduceth to the happiness and 
the progress of the human world.  Yet shouldst thou turn 
thine eye to the discovery of destructive and infernal 
machines, to the development of forces of demolition and 
the invention of fiery implements, which uproot the tree 
of life, it would become evident and manifest unto thee 
that civilization is conjoined with barbarism.  Progress and 
barbarism go hand in hand, unless material civilization be 
confirmed by Divine Guidance, by the revelations of the 
All-Merciful and by godly virtues, and be reinforced by 
spiritual conduct, by the ideals of the Kingdom and by the 
outpourings of the Realm of Might.  
     Consider now, that the most advanced and civilized 
countries of the world have been turned into arsenals of 
explosives, that the continents of the globe have been transformed 
into huge camps and battlefields, that the peoples of 
the world have formed themselves into armed nations, and 
that the governments of the world are vying with each 
other as to who will first step into the field of carnage and 
bloodshed, thus subjecting mankind to the utmost degree of 
affliction.  
 
+P285 
     Therefore, this civilization and material progress should 
be combined with the Most Great Guidance so that this 
nether world may become the scene of the appearance of the 
bestowals of the Kingdom, and physical achievements may 
be conjoined with the effulgences of the Merciful.  This in 
order that the beauty and perfection of the world of man 
may be unveiled and be manifested before all in the utmost 
grace and splendour.  Thus everlasting glory and happiness 
shall be revealed.  
     Praise be to God, throughout succeeding centuries and 
ages the call of civilization hath been raised, the world of 
humanity hath been advancing and progressing day by day, 
various countries have been developing by leaps and bounds, 
and material improvements have increased, until the world 
of existence obtained universal capacity to receive the 
spiritual teachings and to hearken to the Divine Call.  The 
suckling babe passeth through various physical stages, 
growing and developing at every stage, until its body 
reacheth the age of maturity.  Having arrived at this stage it 
acquireth the capacity to manifest spiritual and intellectual 
perfections.  The lights of comprehension, intelligence and 
knowledge become perceptible in it and the powers of its 
soul unfold.  Similarly, in the contingent world, the human 
species hath undergone progressive physical changes and, 
by a slow process, hath scaled the ladder of civilization, 
realizing in itself the wonders, excellencies and gifts of 
humanity in their most glorious form, until it gained the 
capacity to express the splendours of spiritual perfections 
and divine ideals and became capable of hearkening to the 
call of God.  Then at last the call of the Kingdom was raised, 
the spiritual virtues and perfections were revealed, the Sun 
of Reality dawned, and the teachings of the Most Great 
Peace, of the oneness of the world of humanity and of the 
 
+P286 
universality of men, were promoted.  We hope that the 
effulgence of these rays shall become more and more intense, 
and the ideal virtues more resplendent, so that the goal of 
this universal human process will be attained and the love 
of God will appear in the utmost grace and beauty and 
bedazzle all hearts.  
     O ye beloved of God!  Know ye, verily, that the happiness 
of mankind lieth in the unity and the harmony of the human 
race, and that spiritual and material developments are conditioned 
upon love and amity among all men.  Consider ye 
the living creatures, namely those which move upon the 
earth and those which fly, those which graze and those 
which devour.  Among the beasts of prey each kind liveth 
apart from other species of its genus, observing complete 
antagonism and hostility; and whenever they meet they 
immediately fight and draw blood, gnashing their teeth and 
baring their claws.  This is the way in which ferocious beasts 
and bloodthirsty wolves behave, carnivorous animals that 
live by themselves and fight for their lives.  But the docile, 
good-natured and gentle animals, whether they belong to 
the flying or grazing species, associate with one another in 
complete affinity, united in their flocks, and living their 
lives with enjoyment, happiness and contentment.  Such are 
the birds that are satisfied with and grateful for a few grains; 
they live in complete gladness, and break into rich and 
melodious song while soaring over meadows, plains, hills 
and mountains.  Similarly those animals which graze, like 
the sheep, the antelope and the gazelle, consort in the 
greatest amity, intimacy and unity while living in their 
plains and prairies in a condition of complete contentment.  
But dogs, wolves, tigers, hyenas and those other beasts of 
prey, are alienated from each other as they hunt and roam 
about alone.  The creatures of the fields and birds of the air 
 
+P287 
do not even shun or molest one another when they come 
upon their mutual grazing and resting grounds but accept 
each other with friendliness, unlike the devouring beasts 
who immediately tear each other apart when one intrudes 
upon the other's cave or lair; yea, even if one merely 
passeth by the abode of another the latter at once rusheth 
out to attack and if possible kill the former.  
     Therefore, it hath been made clear and manifest that in 
the animal kingdom also love and affinity are the fruits of a 
gentle disposition, a pure nature and praiseworthy character, 
while discord and isolation are characteristic of the fierce 
beasts of the wild.  
     The Almighty hath not created in man the claws and 
teeth of ferocious animals, nay rather hath the human form 
been fashioned and set with the most comely attributes and 
adorned with the most perfect virtues.  The honour of this 
creation and the worthiness of this garment therefore 
require man to have love and affinity for his own kind, nay 
rather, to act towards all living creatures with justice and 
equity.  
     Similarly, consider how the cause of the welfare, happiness, 
joy and comfort of humankind are amity and union, 
whereas dissension and discord are most conducive to hardship, 
humiliation, agitation and failure.  
     But a thousand times alas, that man is negligent and 
unaware of these facts, and daily doth he strut abroad with 
the characteristics of a wild beast.  Lo!  At one moment he 
turneth into a ferocious tiger; at the next he becometh a 
creeping, venomous viper!  But the sublime achievements 
of man reside in those qualities and attributes that exclusively 
pertain to the angels of the Supreme Concourse.  Therefore, 
when praiseworthy qualities and high morals emanate from 
man, he becometh a heavenly being, an angel of the 
 
+P288 
Kingdom, a divine reality and a celestial effulgence.  On the 
other hand, when he engageth in warfare, quarrelling and 
bloodshed, he becometh viler than the most fierce of savage 
creatures, for if a bloodthirsty wolf devoureth a lamb in a 
single night, man slaughtereth a hundred thousand in the 
field of battle, strewing the ground with their corpses and 
kneading the earth with their blood.  
     In short, man is endowed with two natures:  one tendeth 
towards moral sublimity and intellectual perfection, while 
the other turneth to bestial degradation and carnal imperfections.  
If ye travel the countries of the globe ye shall observe 
on one side the remains of ruin and destruction, while on 
the other ye shall see the signs of civilization and development.  
Such desolation and ruin are the result of war, strife 
and quarrelling, while all development and progress are 
fruits of the lights of virtue, co-operation and concord.  
     If one were to travel through the deserts of Central Asia 
he would observe how many cities, once great and prosperous 
like Paris and London, are now demolished and 
razed to the ground.  From the Caspian Sea to the River 
Oxus there stretch wild and desolate plains, deserts, wildernesses 
and valleys.  For two days and two nights the Russian 
railway traverseth the ruined cities and uninhabited villages 
of that wasteland.  Formerly that plain bore the fruit of the 
finest civilizations of the past.  Tokens of development and 
refinement were apparent all around, arts and sciences were 
well protected and promoted, professions and industries 
flourished, commerce and agriculture had reached a high 
stage of efficiency, and the foundations of government and 
statesmanship were laid on a strong and solid basis.  Today 
that vast stretch of land hath become mostly the shelter and 
asylum of Turkoman tribes, and an arena for the ferocious 
display of wild beasts.  The ancient cities of that plain, such 
 
+P289 
as &amp;Gurgan, &amp;Nissa, &amp;Abivard and &amp;Shahristan, famous throughout 
the world for their arts, sciences, culture, industry, and 
well known for their wealth, greatness, prosperity and 
distinction, have given way to a wilderness wherein no 
voice is heard save the roaring of wild beasts and where 
bloodthirsty wolves roam at will.  This destruction and 
desolation was brought about by war and strife, dissension 
and discord between the Persians and the Turks, who 
differed in their religion and customs.  So rigid was the spirit 
of religious prejudice that the faithless leaders sanctioned 
the shedding of innocent blood, the ruin of property and 
the desecration of family honour.  This is to cite only one 
illustration.  
     Consequently, when thou traversest the regions of the 
world, thou shalt conclude that all progress is the result 
of association and co-operation, while ruin is the outcome of 
animosity and hatred.  Notwithstanding this, the world of 
humanity doth not take warning, nor doth it awake from 
the slumber of heedlessness.  Man is still causing differences, 
quarrels and strife in order to marshal the cohorts of war 
and, with his legions, rush into the field of bloodshed and 
slaughter.  
     Then again, consider the phenomenon of composition 
and decomposition, of existence and non-existence.  Every 
created thing in the contingent world is made up of many 
and varied atoms, and its existence is dependent on the 
composition of these.  In other words, through the divine 
creative power a conjunction of simple elements taketh 
place so that from this composition a distinct organism is 
produced.  The existence of all things is based upon this 
principle.  But when the order is deranged, decomposition 
is produced and disintegration setteth in, then that thing 
ceaseth to exist.  That is, the annihilation of all things is 
 
+P290 
caused by decomposition and disintegration.  Therefore 
attraction and composition between the various elements is 
the means of life, and discord, decomposition and division 
produce death.  Thus the cohesive and attractive forces in all 
things lead to the appearance of fruitful results and effects, 
while estrangement and alienation of things lead to disturbance 
and annihilation.  Through affinity and attraction 
all living things like plants, animals and men come into 
existence, while division and discord bring about decomposition 
and destruction.  
     Consequently, that which is conducive to association and 
attraction and unity among the sons of men is the means of 
the life of the world of humanity, and whatever causeth 
division, repulsion and remoteness leadeth to the death of 
humankind.  
     And if, as thou passest by fields and plantations, thou 
observest that the plants, flowers and sweet-smelling herbs 
are growing luxuriantly together, forming a pattern of 
unity, this is an evidence of the fact that that plantation and 
garden is flourishing under the care of a skilful gardener.  
But when thou seest it in a state of disorder and irregularity 
thou inferrest that it hath lacked the training of an efficient 
farmer and thus hath produced weeds and tares.  
     It therefore becometh manifest that amity and cohesion 
are indicative of the training of the Real Educator, and dispersion 
and separation a proof of savagery and deprivation 
of divine education.  
     A critic may object, saying that peoples, races, tribes and 
communities of the world are of different and varied 
customs, habits, tastes, character, inclinations and ideas, that 
opinions and thoughts are contrary to one another, and how, 
therefore, is it possible for real unity to be revealed and 
perfect accord among human souls to exist?  
 
+P291 
     In answer we say that differences are of two kinds.  One 
is the cause of annihilation and is like the antipathy existing 
among warring nations and conflicting tribes who seek each 
other's destruction, uprooting one another's families, depriving 
one another of rest and comfort and unleashing 
carnage.  The other kind which is a token of diversity is the 
essence of perfection and the cause of the appearance of the 
bestowals of the Most Glorious Lord.  
     Consider the flowers of a garden:  though differing in 
kind, colour, form and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are 
refreshed by the waters of one spring, revived by the breath 
of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one sun, this diversity 
increaseth their charm, and addeth unto their beauty.  
Thus when that unifying force, the penetrating influence of 
the Word of God, taketh effect, the difference of customs, 
manners, habits, ideas, opinions and dispositions embellisheth 
the world of humanity.  This diversity, this difference 
is like the naturally created dissimilarity and variety of the 
limbs and organs of the human body, for each one contributeth 
to the beauty, efficiency and perfection of the 
whole.  When these different limbs and organs come under 
the influence of man's sovereign soul, and the soul's power 
pervadeth the limbs and members, veins and arteries of the 
body, then difference reinforceth harmony, diversity 
strengtheneth love, and multiplicity is the greatest factor 
for co-ordination.  
     How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and plants, 
the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the branches and the 
trees of that garden were all of the same shape and colour!  
Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth and adorneth 
the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof.  In like 
manner, when divers shades of thought, temperament and 
character, are brought together under the power and 
 
+P292 
influence of one central agency, the beauty and glory of 
human perfection will be revealed and made manifest.  
Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which 
ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable 
of harmonizing the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas, 
and convictions of the children of men.  Verily, it is the 
penetrating power in all things, the mover of souls and the 
binder and regulator in the world of humanity.  
     Praise be to God, today the splendour of the Word of 
God hath illumined every horizon, and from all sects, races, 
tribes, nations, and communities souls have come together 
in the light of the Word, assembled, united and agreed in 
perfect harmony.  Oh!  What a great number of meetings 
are held adorned with souls from various races and diverse 
sects!  Anyone attending these will be struck with amazement, 
and might suppose that these souls are all of one land, 
one nationality, one community, one thought, one belief 
and one opinion; whereas, in fact, one is an American, the 
other an African, one cometh from Asia and another from 
Europe, one is a native of India, another is from Turkestan, 
one is an Arab, another a Tajik, another a Persian and yet 
another a Greek.  Notwithstanding such diversity they 
associate in perfect harmony and unity, love and freedom; 
they have one voice, one thought and one purpose.  Verily, 
this is from the penetrative power of the Word of God!  If 
all the forces of the universe were to combine they would 
not be able thus to gather a single assemblage so imbued 
with the sentiments of love, affection, attraction and enkindlement 
as to unite the members of different races and to 
raise up from the heart of the world a voice that shall dispel 
war and strife, uproot dissension and disputation, usher in 
the era of universal peace and establish unity and concord 
amongst men.  
 
+P293 
     Can any power withstand the penetrative influence of 
the Word of God?  Nay, by God!  The proof is clear and the 
evidence is complete!  If anyone looketh with the eyes of 
justice he shall be struck with wonder and amazement and 
will testify that all the peoples, sects and races of the world 
should be glad, content and grateful for the teachings and 
admonitions of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  For these divine injunctions 
tame every ferocious beast, transform the creeping insect 
into a soaring bird, cause human souls to become angels of 
the Kingdom, and make the human world a focus for the 
qualities of mercy.  
     Furthermore each and every one is required to show 
obedience, submission and loyalty towards his own government.  
Today no state in the world is in a condition of peace 
or tranquillity, for security and trust have vanished from 
among the people.  Both the governed and the governors 
are alike in danger.  The only group of people which today 
submitteth peacefully and loyally to the laws and ordinances 
of government and dealeth honestly and frankly with the 
people, is none other than this wronged community.  For 
while all sects and races in Persia and Turkestan are absorbed 
in promoting their own interests and only obey their governments 
either with the hope of reward or from fear of punishment, 
the &amp;Baha'is are the well-wishers of the government, 
obedient to its laws and bearing love towards all peoples.  
     Such obedience and submission is made incumbent and 
obligatory upon all by the clear Text of the &amp;Abha Beauty.  
Therefore the believers, in obedience to the command of 
the True One, show the utmost sincerity and goodwill 
towards all nations; and should any soul act contrary to the 
laws of the government he would consider himself responsible 
before God, deserving divine wrath and chastisement 
for his sin and wrongdoing.  It is astonishing that, in spite of 
 
+P294 
this, some of the officials of the government consider the 
&amp;Baha'is to be ill-wishers while they regard the members of 
other communities as their well-wishers.  Gracious God!  
Recently, when there was general revolution and agitation 
in &amp;Tihran and in other provinces of Persia, it was proven 
that not a single &amp;Baha'i had taken part nor intervened in 
these affairs.  For this reason they were reproached by the 
ignorant because they had obeyed the command of the 
Blessed Perfection and refrained absolutely from interference 
in political matters.  They were not associated with 
any party, but busied themselves with their own affairs and 
professions and discharged their own duties.  
     All the friends of God bear witness to the fact that 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha is, from every standpoint, the well-wisher of 
all governments and nations, and prayeth sincerely for their 
progress and advancement, especially for the two great states 
of the east, for these two countries are the native land and 
the place of exile of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In all epistles and writings 
he hath commended and praised these two governments 
and hath supplicated divine confirmations for them from 
the Threshold of the One true God.  The &amp;Abha Beauty--
may my life be a sacrifice for His loved ones--hath offered 
prayers on behalf of Their Imperial Majesties.  Gracious 
God!  How strange that, notwithstanding these conclusive 
proofs, every day some event transpireth and difficulties 
arise.  But we, and the friends of God, should on no account 
slacken our efforts to be loyal, sincere and men of good will.  
We should at all times manifest our truthfulness and 
sincerity, nay rather, we must be constant in our faithfulness 
and trustworthiness, and occupy ourselves in offering 
prayers for the good of all.  
     O ye beloved of God, these are days for steadfastness, for 
firmness and perseverance in the Cause of God.  Ye must 
 
+P295 
not focus your attention upon the person of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
for erelong he will bid you farewell.  Rather must ye fix 
your gaze upon the Word of God.  If the Word of God is 
being promoted, rejoice and be happy and thankful, though 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha himself be threatened by the sword or 
burdened by the weight of chains and fetters.  For the Holy 
Temple of the Cause of God is important, not the physical 
body of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The friends of God must arise with 
such steadfastness that if, at any moment, a hundred souls 
like &amp;Abdu'l-Baha become the target for the arrows of 
affliction, they will not shift or waver in their resolve, their 
determination, their enkindlement, their devotion and 
service in the Cause of God.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is himself a 
servant at the Threshold of the Blessed Beauty and a manifestation 
of pure and utter servitude at the Threshold of the 
Almighty.  He hath no other station or title, no other rank 
or power.  This is my ultimate Purpose, my eternal Paradise, 
my holiest Temple and my &amp;Sadratu'l-Muntaha.  With the 
&amp;Abha Blessed Beauty and the Exalted One, His Herald--
may my life be a sacrifice for Them both--hath ended the 
appearance of God's independent and universal Manifestation.  
And for a thousand years all shall be illumined by His 
lights and be sustained by the ocean of His favours.  
     O ye lovers of God!  This, verily, is my last wish and my 
admonition unto you.  Blessed, therefore, is he who is aided 
by God to follow that which is inscribed upon this scroll 
whose words are sanctified from the symbols current 
amongst men.  
 
     226.  O thou servant of God!  Thy letter was received, 
and was the cause of gladness.  Thou hast expressed thine 
ardent wish that I should attend the Peace Congress.  I do 
 
+P296 
not present myself at such political conferences, for the 
establishment of peace is unachievable save through the 
power of the Word of God.  When a conference is convened, 
representative of all nations and working under the 
influence of the Word of God, then universal peace will be 
established but otherwise it is impossible.  
     At present it is certain that temporary peace is established 
but it is not lasting.  All governments and nations have 
become tired of war, of the difficulties of travel, of huge 
expenditures, of the loss of life, of the affliction of women, 
of the great number of orphans, and they are driven by 
force to peace.  But this peace is not permanent, it is temporary.  
     We hope that the power of the Word of God will establish 
a peace that shall eternally remain effective and secure.  
 
     227.+F1  O ye esteemed ones who are pioneers among the 
well-wishers of the world of humanity!  
     The letters which ye sent during the war were not 
received, but a letter dated February 11th, 1916, has just 
come to hand, and immediately an answer is being written.  
Your intention deserves a thousand praises, because you are 
serving the world of humanity, and this is conducive to the 
happiness and welfare of all.  This recent war has proved to 
the world and the people that war is destruction while 
universal peace is construction; war is death while peace is 
 
+F1 This is the first part of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's reply to a letter addressed 
+F1 to Him by the Executive Committee of the Central Organization 
+F1 for a Durable Peace.  The Tablet, described by Shoghi Effendi in 
+F1 God Passes By as of `far reaching importance', and dated December 
+F1 17, 1919, was despatched to the Committee at The Hague by the 
+F1 hands of a special delegation.  
 
+P297 
life; war is rapacity and bloodthirstiness while peace is 
beneficence and humaneness; war is an appurtenance of the 
world of nature while peace is of the foundation of the 
religion of God; war is darkness upon darkness while peace 
is heavenly light; war is the destroyer of the edifice of mankind 
while peace is the everlasting life of the world of 
humanity; war is like a devouring wolf while peace is like 
the angels of heaven; war is the struggle for existence while 
peace is mutual aid and co-operation among the peoples of 
the world and the cause of the good-pleasure of the True 
One in the heavenly realm.  
     There is not one soul whose conscience does not testify 
that in this day there is no more important matter in the 
world than that of universal peace.  Every just one bears 
witness to this and adores that esteemed Assembly because 
its aim is that this darkness may be changed into light, this 
bloodthirstiness into kindness, this torment into bliss, this 
hardship into ease and this enmity and hatred into fellowship 
and love.  Therefore, the effort of those esteemed souls 
is worthy of praise and commendation.  
     But the wise souls who are aware of the essential relationships 
emanating from the realities of things consider that 
one single matter cannot, by itself, influence the human 
reality as it ought and should, for until the minds of men 
become united, no important matter can be accomplished.  
At present universal peace is a matter of great importance, 
but unity of conscience is essential, so that the foundation of 
this matter may become secure, its establishment firm and 
its edifice strong.  
     Therefore &amp;Baha'u'llah, fifty years ago, expounded this 
question of universal peace at a time when He was confined 
in the fortress of &amp;Akka and was wronged and imprisoned.  
He wrote about this important matter of universal 
 
+P298 
peace to all the great sovereigns of the world, and established 
it among His friends in the orient.  The horizon of the 
east was in utter darkness, nations displayed the utmost 
hatred and enmity towards each other, religions thirsted for 
each other's blood, and it was darkness upon darkness.  At 
such a time &amp;Baha'u'llah shone forth like the sun from the 
horizon of the east and illumined Persia with the lights of 
these teachings.  
     Among His teachings was the declaration of universal 
peace.  People of different nations, religions and sects who 
followed Him came together to such an extent that remarkable 
gatherings were instituted consisting of the various 
nations and religions of the east.  Every soul who entered 
these gatherings saw but one nation, one teaching, one 
pathway, one order, for the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah were 
not limited to the establishment of universal peace.  They 
embraced many teachings which supplemented and supported 
that of universal peace.  
     Among these teachings was the independent investigation 
of reality so that the world of humanity may be saved 
from the darkness of imitation and attain to the truth; may 
tear off and cast away this ragged and outgrown garment of 
a thousand years ago and may put on the robe woven in the 
utmost purity and holiness in the loom of reality.  As reality 
is one and cannot admit of multiplicity, therefore different 
opinions must ultimately become fused into one.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the oneness 
of the world of humanity; that all human beings are the 
sheep of God and He is the kind Shepherd.  This Shepherd 
is kind to all the sheep, because He created them all, trained 
them, provided for them and protected them.  There is no 
doubt that the Shepherd is kind to all the sheep and should 
there be among these sheep ignorant ones, they must be 
 
+P299 
educated; if there be children, they must be trained until 
they reach maturity; if there be sick ones, they must be 
cured.  There must be no hatred and enmity, for as by a kind 
physician these ignorant, sick ones should be treated.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that religion 
must be the cause of fellowship and love.  If it becomes the 
cause of estrangement then it is not needed, for religion is 
like a remedy; if it aggravates the disease then it becomes 
unnecessary.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that religion 
must be in conformity with science and reason, so that it 
may influence the hearts of men.  The foundation must be 
solid and must not consist of imitations.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that religious, 
racial, political, economic and patriotic prejudices destroy 
the edifice of humanity.  As long as these prejudices prevail, 
the world of humanity will not have rest.  For a period of 
6,000 years history informs us about the world of humanity.  
During these 6,000 years the world of humanity has not 
been free from war, strife, murder and bloodthirstiness.  In 
every period war has been waged in one country or another 
and that war was due to either religious prejudice, racial 
prejudice, political prejudice or patriotic prejudice.  It has 
therefore been ascertained and proved that all prejudices are 
destructive of the human edifice.  As long as these prejudices 
persist, the struggle for existence must remain dominant, 
and bloodthirstiness and rapacity continue.  Therefore, even 
as was the case in the past, the world of humanity cannot be 
saved from the darkness of nature and cannot attain illumination 
except through the abandonment of prejudices and the 
acquisition of the morals of the Kingdom.  
     If this prejudice and enmity are on account of religion 
consider that religion should be the cause of fellowship, 
 
+P300 
otherwise it is fruitless.  And if this prejudice be the prejudice 
of nationality consider that all mankind are of one 
nation; all have sprung from the tree of Adam, and Adam 
is the root of the tree.  That tree is one and all these nations 
are like branches, while the individuals of humanity are like 
leaves, blossoms and fruits thereof.  Then the establishment 
of various nations and the consequent shedding of blood 
and destruction of the edifice of humanity result from 
human ignorance and selfish motives.  
     As to the patriotic prejudice, this is also due to absolute 
ignorance, for the surface of the earth is one native land.  
Every one can live in any spot on the terrestrial globe.  
Therefore all the world is man's birthplace.  These boundaries 
and outlets have been devised by man.  In the creation, 
such boundaries and outlets were not assigned.  Europe is 
one continent, Asia is one continent, Africa is one continent, 
Australia is one continent, but some of the souls, from 
personal motives and selfish interests, have divided each one 
of these continents and considered a certain part as their own 
country.  God has set up no frontier between France and 
Germany; they are continuous.  Yea, in the first centuries, 
selfish souls, for the promotion of their own interests, have 
assigned boundaries and outlets and have, day by day, 
attached more importance to these, until this led to intense 
enmity, bloodshed and rapacity in subsequent centuries.  In 
the same way this will continue indefinitely, and if this 
conception of patriotism remains limited within a certain 
circle, it will be the primary cause of the world's destruction.  
No wise and just person will acknowledge these imaginary 
distinctions.  Every limited area which we call our native 
country we regard as our motherland, whereas the terrestrial 
globe is the motherland of all, and not any restricted 
area.  In short, for a few days we live on this earth and 
 
+P301 
eventually we are buried in it, it is our eternal tomb.  Is it 
worth while that we should engage in bloodshed and tear 
one another to pieces for this eternal tomb?  Nay, far from 
it, neither is God pleased with such conduct nor would any 
sane man approve of it.  
     Consider!  The blessed animals engage in no patriotic 
quarrels.  They are in the utmost fellowship with one another 
and live together in harmony.  For example, if a dove 
from the east and a dove from the west, a dove from the 
north and a dove from the south chance to arrive, at the 
same time, in one spot, they immediately associate in 
harmony.  So is it with all the blessed animals and birds.  But 
the ferocious animals, as soon as they meet, attack and fight 
with each other, tear each other to pieces and it is impossible 
for them to live peaceably together in one spot.  They are all 
unsociable and fierce, savage and combative fighters.  
     Regarding the economic prejudice, it is apparent that 
whenever the ties between nations become strengthened 
and the exchange of commodities accelerated, and any 
economic principle is established in one country, it will 
ultimately affect the other countries and universal benefits 
will result.  Then why this prejudice?  
     As to the political prejudice, the policy of God must be 
followed and it is indisputable that the policy of God is 
greater than human policy.  We must follow the Divine 
policy and that applies alike to all individuals.  He treats all 
individuals alike:  no distinction is made, and that is the 
foundation of the Divine Religions.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the origination 
of one language that may be spread universally among 
the people.  This teaching was revealed from the pen of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in order that this universal language may eliminate 
misunderstandings from among mankind.  
 
+P302 
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the equality of 
women and men.  The world of humanity has two wings--
one is women and the other men.  Not until both wings are 
equally developed can the bird fly.  Should one wing remain 
weak, flight is impossible.  Not until the world of women 
becomes equal to the world of men in the acquisition of 
virtues and perfections, can success and prosperity be attained 
as they ought to be.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is voluntary 
sharing of one's property with others among mankind.  
This voluntary sharing is greater than equality, and consists 
in this, that man should not prefer himself to others, but 
rather should sacrifice his life and property for others.  But 
this should not be introduced by coercion so that it becomes 
a law and man is compelled to follow it.  Nay, rather, man 
should voluntarily and of his own choice sacrifice his 
property and life for others, and spend willingly for the 
poor, just as is done in Persia among the &amp;Baha'is.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is man's freedom, 
that through the ideal Power he should be free and 
emancipated from the captivity of the world of nature; for 
as long as man is captive to nature he is a ferocious animal, 
as the struggle for existence is one of the exigencies of the 
world of nature.  This matter of the struggle for existence is 
the fountain-head of all calamities and is the supreme affliction.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that religion 
is a mighty bulwark.  If the edifice of religion shakes and 
totters, commotion and chaos will ensue and the order of 
things will be utterly upset, for in the world of mankind 
there are two safeguards that protect man from wrongdoing.  
One is the law which punishes the criminal; but the 
law prevents only the manifest crime and not the concealed 
 
+P303 
sin; whereas the ideal safeguard, namely, the religion of 
God, prevents both the manifest and the concealed crime, 
trains man, educates morals, compels the adoption of virtues 
and is the all-inclusive power which guarantees the felicity 
of the world of mankind.  But by religion is meant that 
which is ascertained by investigation and not that which is 
based on mere imitation, the foundations of Divine Religions 
and not human imitations.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that although 
material civilization is one of the means for the progress of 
the world of mankind, yet until it becomes combined with 
Divine civilization, the desired result, which is the felicity 
of mankind, will not be attained.  Consider!  These battleships 
that reduce a city to ruins within the space of an hour 
are the result of material civilization; likewise the Krupp 
guns, the Mauser rifles, dynamite, submarines, torpedo 
boats, armed aircraft and bombers--all these weapons of 
war are the malignant fruits of material civilization.  Had 
material civilization been combined with Divine civilization, 
these fiery weapons would never have been invented.  
Nay, rather, human energy would have been wholly 
devoted to useful inventions and would have been concentrated 
on praiseworthy discoveries.  Material civilization 
is like a lamp-glass.  Divine civilization is the lamp itself and 
the glass without the light is dark.  Material civilization is 
like the body.  No matter how infinitely graceful, elegant 
and beautiful it may be, it is dead.  Divine civilization is like 
the spirit, and the body gets its life from the spirit, otherwise 
it becomes a corpse.  It has thus been made evident that the 
world of mankind is in need of the breaths of the Holy 
Spirit.  Without the spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, 
and without this light the world of mankind is in utter 
darkness.  For the world of nature is an animal world.  
 
+P304 
Until man is born again from the world of nature, that is to 
say, becomes detached from the world of nature, he is 
essentially an animal, and it is the teachings of God which 
convert this animal into a human soul.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the promotion 
of education.  Every child must be instructed in sciences as 
much as is necessary.  If the parents are able to provide the 
expenses of this education, it is well, otherwise the community 
must provide the means for the teaching of that 
child.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah are justice and 
right.  Until these are realized on the plane of existence, all 
things shall be in disorder and remain imperfect.  The world 
of mankind is a world of oppression and cruelty, and a 
realm of aggression and error.  
     In fine, such teachings are numerous.  These manifold 
principles, which constitute the greatest basis for the felicity 
of mankind and are of the bounties of the Merciful, must be 
added to the matter of universal peace and combined with 
it, so that results may accrue.  Otherwise the realization of 
universal peace by itself in the world of mankind is difficult.  
As the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah are combined with universal 
peace, they are like a table provided with every kind of 
fresh and delicious food.  Every soul can find, at that table of 
infinite bounty, that which he desires.  If the question is 
restricted to universal peace alone, the remarkable results 
which are expected and desired will not be attained.  The 
scope of universal peace must be such that all the communities 
and religions may find their highest wish realized 
in it.  The teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah are such that all the 
communities of the world, whether religious, political or 
ethical, ancient or modern, find in them the expression of 
their highest wish.  
 
+P305 
     For example, the people of religions find, in the teachings 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the establishment of Universal Religion--a 
religion that perfectly conforms with present conditions, 
which in reality effects the immediate cure of the incurable 
disease, which relieves every pain, and bestows the infallible 
antidote for every deadly poison.  For if we wish to arrange 
and organize the world of mankind in accordance with the 
present religious imitations and thereby to establish the 
felicity of the world of mankind, it is impossible and impracticable
--for example, the enforcement of the laws of 
the Torah and also of the other religions in accordance with 
present imitations.  But the essential basis of all the Divine 
Religions which pertains to the virtues of the world of mankind 
and is the foundation of the welfare of the world of 
man, is found in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the most 
perfect presentation.  
     Similarly, with regard to the peoples who clamour for 
freedom:  the moderate freedom which guarantees the welfare 
of the world of mankind and maintains and preserves 
the universal relationships, is found in its fullest power and 
extension in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     So with regard to political parties:  that which is the 
greatest policy directing the world of mankind, nay, rather, 
the Divine policy, is found in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Likewise with regard to the party of `equality' which 
seeks the solution of the economic problems:  until now all 
proposed solutions have proved impracticable except the 
economic proposals in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah which 
are practicable and cause no distress to society.  
     So with the other parties:  when ye look deeply into this 
matter, ye will discover that the highest aims of those 
parties are found in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  These 
teachings constitute the all-inclusive power among all men 
 
+P306 
and are practicable.  But there are some teachings of the past, 
such as those of the Torah, which cannot be carried out at 
the present day.  It is the same with the other religions and 
the tenets of the various sects and the different parties.  
     For example, the question of universal peace, about 
which &amp;Baha'u'llah says that the Supreme Tribunal must be 
established:  although the League of Nations has been 
brought into existence, yet it is incapable of establishing 
universal peace.  But the Supreme Tribunal which &amp;Baha'u'llah 
has described will fulfil this sacred task with the utmost 
might and power.  And His plan is this:  that the national 
assemblies of each country and nation--that is to say 
parliaments--should elect two or three persons who are the 
choicest men of that nation, and are well informed concerning 
international laws and the relations between governments 
and aware of the essential needs of the world of 
humanity in this day.  The number of these representatives 
should be in proportion to the number of inhabitants of that 
country.  The election of these souls who are chosen by the 
national assembly, that is, the parliament, must be confirmed 
by the upper house, the congress and the cabinet and 
also by the president or monarch so these persons may be the 
elected ones of all the nation and the government.  From 
among these people the members of the Supreme Tribunal 
will be elected, and all mankind will thus have a share 
therein, for every one of these delegates is fully representative 
of his nation.  When the Supreme Tribunal gives a 
ruling on any international question, either unanimously or 
by majority rule, there will no longer be any pretext for 
the plaintiff or ground of objection for the defendant.  In 
case any of the governments or nations, in the execution of 
the irrefutable decision of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent 
or dilatory, the rest of the nations will rise up against 
 
+P307 
it, because all the governments and nations of the world are 
the supporters of this Supreme Tribunal.  Consider what a 
firm foundation this is!  But by a limited and restricted League 
the purpose will not be realized as it ought and should.  This 
is the truth about the situation, which has been stated....  
 
     228.  O Servant of the Threshold of &amp;Baha'u'llah!  Thy 
letter dated 14 June 1920 hath been received.  A letter from 
some of the members of the Peace Committee hath also 
been received and an answer hath been written to them.  
Deliver it to them.  
     It is evident that this meeting is not what it is reputed to 
be and is unable to order and arrange affairs in the manner 
which is befitting and necessary.  However that may be, the 
matter in which they are engaged is nevertheless of the 
greatest importance.  The meeting at The Hague should 
have such power and influence that its word will have an 
effect on the governments and nations.  Point out to the 
revered members gathered there that the Hague Conference 
held before the war had as its President the Emperor 
of Russia, and its members were men of the greatest eminence.  
Nevertheless this did not prevent such a terrible war.  
Now how will it be?  For in the future another war, fiercer 
than the last, will assuredly break out; verily, of this there 
is no doubt whatever.  What can the Hague meeting do?  
     But the fundamental principles laid down by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
are day by day spreading.  Deliver the answer to their letter 
and express the greatest love and kindness, and leave them 
to their own affairs.  In any case they ought to be pleased 
with you, and subject to their approval you may print and 
distribute that detailed epistle of mine which hath already 
been translated into English.  
 
+P308 
     As to the Esperantists, associate with them.  Whenever 
you find one with capacity, convey to him the fragrances of 
Life.  In all the meetings converse about the teachings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, because this will be effective today in the western 
countries.  And if they ask regarding your belief in 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, you should reply that we consider Him as the 
foremost Teacher and Educator of the world in this age, 
and make clear, explaining in detail, that these teachings 
regarding universal peace and other subjects were revealed 
by the pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah fifty years ago and have already 
been published in Persia and India and spread abroad 
throughout the whole world.  In the beginning all were 
incredulous about the idea of universal peace, considering 
it an impossibility.  Further, speak of the greatness of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, of the events that took place in Persia and 
Turkey, of the astonishing influence that He exerted, of the 
contents of the Epistles which He addressed to all the 
sovereigns, and of their fulfilment.  Also speak of the spread 
of the &amp;Baha'i Cause.  Associate with the Committee of 
Universal Peace at The Hague as much as possible, showing 
them every courtesy.  
     It is evident that the Esperantists are receptive and thou 
art familiar with and expert in their language.  Communicate 
also with the Esperantists of Germany and other places.  
The literature which thou circulatest should deal only with 
the teachings.  The dissemination of other literature is at 
present not advisable.  My hope is that the divine confirmations 
may continually assist thee....  
     Grieve not over the apathy and coldness of the Hague 
meeting.  Put thy trust in God.  Our hope is that among the 
people the Esperanto language may hereafter have a powerful 
effect.  Thou hast now sown the seed.  Assuredly it will 
grow.  Its growth dependeth upon God.  
 
+P309 
     229.  O sincere servant of the True One!  I hear thou 
art grieved and distressed at the happenings of the world 
and the vicissitudes of fortune.  Wherefore this fear and 
sorrow?  The true lovers of the &amp;Abha Beauty, and they that 
have quaffed the Cup of the Covenant fear no calamity, nor 
feel depressed in the hour of trial.  They regard the fire of 
adversity as their garden of delight, and the depth of the sea 
the expanse of heaven.  
     Thou who art neath the shelter of God, and under the 
shadow of the Tree of His Covenant, why sorrow and 
repine?  Rest thou assured and feel confident.  Observe the 
written commandments of thy Lord with joy and peace, 
with earnestness and sincerity; and be thou the well-wisher 
of thy country and thy government.  His grace shall assist 
thee at all times, His blessings shall be bestowed upon thee, 
and thy heart's desire shall be realized.  
     By the Ancient Beauty!--may my life be a sacrifice for 
His loved ones--Were the friends to realize what a glorious 
sovereignty the Lord hath destined for them in His Kingdom, 
surely they would be filled with ecstasy, would 
behold themselves crowned with immortal glory and carried 
away with transports of delight.  Erelong it shall be 
made manifest how brilliantly the light of His bountiful 
care and mercy hath shone upon His loved ones, and what a 
turbulent ocean hath been stirred in their hearts!  Then will 
they clamour and exclaim:  Happy are we; let all the world 
rejoice!  
 
     230.  O respected personage!  Thy second letter dated 
19 December 1918 was received.  It was the cause of great 
joy and gladness, for it showed thy firmness and steadfastness 
in the Covenant and Testament and thy yearning to 
 
+P310 
raise the call of the Kingdom of God.  Today the call of the 
Kingdom is the magnetic power which draweth to itself the 
world of mankind, for capacity in men is great.  Divine 
teachings constitute the spirit of this age, nay rather the sun of 
this age.  Every soul must endeavour that the veils that cover 
men's eyes may be torn asunder and that instantly the sun may 
be seen and that heart and sight may be illumined thereby.  
     Now, through the aid and bounty of God, this power of 
guidance and this merciful bestowal are found in thee.  Arise, 
therefore, in the utmost Power that thou mayest bestow 
spirit upon mouldering bones, give sight to the blind, balm 
and freshness to the depressed, and liveliness and grace to 
the dispirited.  Every lamp will eventually be extinguished 
save the lamp of the Kingdom, which increaseth day by day 
in splendour.  Every call shall ultimately weaken except the 
call to the Kingdom of God, which day unto day is raised.  
Every path shall finally be twisted except the road of the 
Kingdom, which straighteneth day by day.  Undoubtedly 
heavenly melody is not to be measured with an earthly one, 
and artificial lights are not to be compared with the heavenly 
Sun.  Hence one must exert endeavour in whatever is lasting 
and permanent so that one may more and more be 
illumined, strengthened and revived....  
     I pray and supplicate the Divine Kingdom that thy father, 
mother and brother may, through the light of guidance, 
enter the Kingdom of God.  
 
     231.  O thou blossom on the Tree of Life!  Happy art 
thou to have girded thy loins in service; to have risen with 
all thy power in the promulgation of the divine teachings, 
to have convened gatherings and to have striven for the 
exaltation of the Word of God.  
 
+P311 
     In this mortal world every important matter hath an end; 
and every remarkable achievement a termination; none 
having permanent existence.  For instance, consider how the 
important achievements of the ancient world have been 
totally exterminated and not a trace remaineth therefrom 
save the great Cause of the Kingdom of God, which hath 
no beginning and will have no end.  At most, it is only 
renewed.  At the beginning of each renewal it commandeth 
no attention in the sight of the people, but when once 
definitely established, it will daily advance and in its daily 
exaltation will reach the supreme heavens.  
     For instance, consider the day of Christ, which was the 
day of the renewal of the Kingdom of God.  The people of 
the world attached no importance to it and did not realize 
its significance to such an extent that the sepulchre of Christ 
remained lost and unknown for three hundred years, until 
the maidservant of God, Helen, the mother of Constantine 
arrived and discovered the sacred spot.  
     My purpose in all this is to show how unobservant are 
the people of the world and how ignorant, and on the day 
of the establishment of the Kingdom, they remain heedless 
and negligent.  
     Erelong the power of the Kingdom will encompass all 
the world and then they will be awakened and will cry 
and lament over those who were oppressed and martyred, 
and will sigh and moan.  Such is the nature of 
people.  
 
     232.  As to President Wilson, the fourteen principles 
which he hath enunciated are mostly found in the teachings 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah and I therefore hope that he will be confirmed 
and assisted.  Now is the dawn of universal peace; 
 
+P312 
my hope is that its morn will fully break, converting the 
gloom of war, of strife and of wrangling among men into 
the light of union, of harmony and of affection.  
 
     233.  O ye faithful friends, O ye sincere servants of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah!  Now, in the midwatches of the night, when 
eyes are closed in slumber and all have laid their heads upon 
the couch of rest and deep sleep, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is wakeful 
within the precincts of the Hallowed Shrine and, in the 
ardour of his invocation uttereth this, his prayer:  
 
          O Thou kind and loving Providence!  The east is 
     astir and the west surgeth even as the eternal billows of 
     the sea.  The gentle breezes of holiness are diffused and, 
     from the Unseen Kingdom, the rays of the Orb of Truth 
     shine forth resplendent.  The anthems of divine unity are 
     being chanted and the ensigns of celestial might are 
     waving.  The angelic Voice is raised and, even as the 
     roaring of the leviathan, soundeth the call to selflessness 
     and evanescence.  The triumphal cry &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha 
     resoundeth on every side, and the call &amp;Ya &amp;Aliyyu'l-'Ala 
     ringeth throughout all regions.  No stir is there in the 
     world save that of the Glory of the One Ravisher of 
     Hearts, and no tumult is there save the surging of the love 
     of Him, the Incomparable, the Well-Beloved.  
          The beloved of the Lord, with their musk-scented 
     breath, burn like bright candles in every clime, and the 
     friends of the All-Merciful, even as unfolding flowers, 
     can be found in all regions.  Not for a moment do they 
     rest; they breathe not but in remembrance of Thee, and 
     crave naught but to serve Thy Cause.  In the meadows of 
     truth they are as sweet-singing nightingales, and in the 
 
+P313 
     flower-garden of guidance they are even as brightly-coloured 
     blossoms.  With mystic flowers they adorn the 
     walks of the Garden of Reality; as swaying cypresses 
     they line the riverbanks of the Divine Will.  Above the 
     horizon of being they shine as radiant stars; in the 
     firmament of the world they gleam as resplendent orbs.  
     Manifestations of celestial grace are they, and daysprings 
     of the light of divine assistance.  
          Grant, O Thou Loving Lord, that all may stand 
     firm and steadfast, shining with everlasting splendour, so 
     that, at every breath, gentle breezes may blow from the 
     bowers of Thy loving-kindness, that from the ocean of 
     Thy grace a mist may rise, that the kindly showers of 
     Thy love may bestow freshness, and the zephyr waft its 
     perfume from the rose garden of divine unity.  
          Vouchsafe, O Best Beloved of the World, a ray 
     from Thy Splendour.  O Well-Beloved of mankind, shed 
     upon us the light of Thy Countenance.  
          O God Omnipotent, do Thou shield us and be our 
     refuge and, O Lord of Being, show forth Thy might and 
     Thy dominion.  
          O Thou loving Lord, the movers of sedition are in 
     some regions astir and active, and by night and day are 
     inflicting a grievous wrong.  
          Even as wolves, tyrants are lying in wait, and the 
     wronged, innocent flock hath neither help nor succour.  
     Hounds are on the trail of the gazelles of the fields of 
     divine unity, and the pheasant in the mountains of 
     heavenly guidance is pursued by the ravens of envy.  
          O Thou divine Providence, preserve and protect us!  
     O Thou Who art our Shield, save us and defend us!  
     Keep us beneath Thy Shelter, and by Thy Help save us 
     from all ills.  Thou art, indeed, the True Protector, the 
 
+P314 
     Unseen Guardian, the Celestial Preserver, and the 
     Heavenly Loving Lord.  
 
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  On one side the standard of 
the One True God is unfurled and the Voice of the Kingdom 
raised.  The Cause of God is spreading, and manifest 
in splendour are the wonders from on high.  The east is 
illumined and the west perfumed; fragrant with ambergris 
is the north, and musk-scented the south.  
     On the other side the faithless wax in hate and rancour, 
ceaselessly stirring up grievous sedition and mischief.  No 
day goeth by but someone raiseth the standard of revolt and 
spurreth his charger into the arena of discord.  No hour 
passeth but the vile adder bareth its fangs and scattereth its 
deadly venom.  
     The beloved of the Lord are wrapped in utter sincerity 
and devotion, unmindful of this rancour and malice.  Smooth 
and insidious are these snakes, these whisperers of evil, artful 
in their craft and guile.  Be ye on your guard and ever 
wakeful!  Quick-witted and keen of intellect are the faithful, 
and firm and steadfast are the assured.  Act ye with all 
circumspection!  
     `Fear ye the sagacity of the faithful, for he seeth with the 
divine light!'  
     Beware lest any soul privily cause disruption or stir up 
strife.  In the Impregnable Stronghold be ye brave warriors, 
and for the Mighty Mansion a valiant host.  Exercise the 
utmost care, and day and night be on your guard, that 
thereby the tyrant may inflict no harm.  
     Study the Tablet of the Holy Mariner that ye may know 
the truth and consider that the Blessed Beauty hath fully 
foretold future events.  Let them who perceive take warning.  
Verily in this is a bounty for the sincere!  
 
+P315 
     Even as dust upon the Sacred Threshold, in utter humility 
and lowliness, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is engaged in the promulgation 
of His signs in the daytime and in the night season.  Whensoever 
he findeth time he prayeth ardently, and beseecheth 
Him tearfully and fervently, saying:  
 
          O Thou divine Providence, pitiful are we, grant us 
     Thy succour; homeless wanderers, give us Thy shelter; 
     scattered, do Thou unite us; astray, gather us to Thy 
     fold; bereft, do Thou bestow upon us a share and portion; 
     athirst, lead us to the well-spring of Life; frail, strengthen 
     us that we may arise to help Thy Cause and offer ourselves 
     as a living sacrifice in the pathway of guidance.  
 
     The faithless, however, by day and night, openly and 
privily do their utmost to shake the foundations of the 
Cause, to root out the Blessed Tree, to deprive this servant 
of service, to kindle secret sedition and strife and to annihilate 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Outwardly they appear as sheep, yet 
inwardly they are naught but ravening wolves.  Sweet in 
words, they are but at heart a deadly poison.  
     O ye beloved ones, guard the Cause of God!  Let no 
sweetness of tongue beguile you--nay, rather consider the 
motive of every soul, and ponder the thought he cherisheth.  
Be ye straightway mindful and on your guard.  Avoid him, 
yet be not aggressive!  Refrain from censure and from 
slander, and leave him in the Hand of God.  Upon you rest 
the Glory of Glories.  
 
     234.  O thou who art enraptured by the sweet breathings 
of the Lord!  I have noted the contents of thine 
eloquent letter, and have learned that thou sheddest tears 
 
+P316 
and thy heart is afire from grieving over the imprisonment 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     O thou handmaid of God!  This prison is sweeter to me 
and more to be desired than a garden of flowers; to me, this 
bondage is better than the freedom to go my way, and I 
find this narrow place more spacious than wide and open 
plains.  Do not grieve over me.  And should my Lord decree 
that I be blessed with sweet martyrdom's cup, this would 
but mean receiving what I long for most.  
     Fear not if this Branch be severed from this material 
world and cast aside its leaves; nay, the leaves thereof shall 
flourish, for this Branch will grow after it is cut off from 
this world below, it shall reach the loftiest pinnacles of 
glory, and it shall bear such fruits as will perfume the world 
with their fragrance.  
 
     235.  O God, my God!  Illumine the brows of Thy true 
lovers and support them with angelic hosts of certain 
triumph.  Set firm their feet on Thy straight path, and out of 
Thine ancient bounty open before them the portals of Thy 
blessings; for they are expending on Thy pathway what 
Thou hast bestowed upon them, safeguarding Thy Faith, 
putting their trust in their remembrance of Thee, offering 
up their hearts for love of Thee, and withholding not what 
they possess in adoration for Thy Beauty and in their search 
for ways to please Thee.  
     O my Lord!  Ordain for them a plenteous share, a 
destined recompense and sure reward.  
     Verily, Thou art the Sustainer, the Helper, the Generous, 
the Bountiful, the Ever-Bestowing.  
 
+P317 
     236.  O Thou, my God, Who guidest the seeker to the 
pathway that leadeth aright, Who deliverest the lost and 
blinded soul out of the wastes of perdition, Thou Who 
bestowest upon the sincere great bounties and favours, Who 
guardest the frightened within Thine impregnable refuge, 
Who answerest, from Thine all-highest horizon, the cry 
of those who cry out unto Thee.  Praised be Thou, O my 
Lord!  Thou hast guided the distracted out of the death of 
unbelief, and hast brought those who draw nigh unto Thee 
to the journey's goal, and hast rejoiced the assured among 
Thy servants by granting them their most cherished desires, 
and hast, from Thy Kingdom of beauty, opened before the 
faces of those who yearn after Thee the gates of reunion, 
and hast rescued them from the fires of deprivation and loss
--so that they hastened unto Thee and gained Thy presence, 
and arrived at Thy welcoming door, and received of gifts 
an abundant share.  
     O my Lord, they thirsted, Thou didst lift to their parched 
lips the waters of reunion.  O Tender One, Bestowing One, 
Thou didst calm their pain with the balm of Thy bounty 
and grace, and didst heal their ailments with the sovereign 
medicine of Thy compassion.  O Lord, make firm their feet 
on Thy straight path, make wide for them the needle's eye, 
and cause them, dressed in royal robes, to walk in glory for 
ever and ever.  
     Verily art Thou the Generous, the Ever-Giving, the 
Precious, the Most Bountiful.  There is none other God 
but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted, the 
Victorious.  
     O my spiritual loved ones!  Praise be to God, ye have 
thrust the veils aside and recognized the compassionate 
Beloved, and have hastened away from this abode to the 
placeless realm.  Ye have pitched your tents in the world of 
 
+P318 
God, and to glorify Him, the Self-Subsistent, ye have raised 
sweet voices and sung songs that pierced the heart.  Well 
done!  A thousand times well done!  For ye have beheld the 
Light made manifest, and in your reborn beings ye have 
raised the cry, `Blessed be the Lord, the best of all creators!'  
Ye were but babes in the womb, then were ye sucklings, 
and from a precious breast ye drew the milk of knowledge, 
then came ye to your full growth, and won salvation.  Now 
is the time for service, and for servitude unto the Lord.  
Release yourselves from all distracting thoughts, deliver the 
Message with an eloquent tongue, adorn your assemblages 
with praise of the Beloved, till bounty shall descend in 
overwhelming floods and dress the world in fresh greenery 
and blossoms.  This streaming bounty is even the counsels, 
admonitions, instructions, and injunctions of Almighty 
God.  
     O ye my loved ones!  The world is wrapped in the thick 
darkness of open revolt and swept by a whirlwind of hate.  
It is the fires of malevolence that have cast up their flames to 
the clouds of heaven, it is a blood-drenched flood that 
rolleth across the plains and down the hills, and no one on 
the face of the earth can find any peace.  Therefore must the 
friends of God engender that tenderness which cometh 
from Heaven, and bestow love in the spirit upon all humankind.  
With every soul must they deal according to the 
Divine counsellings and admonitions; to all must they 
show forth kindness and good faith; to all must they wish 
well.  They must sacrifice themselves for their friends, and 
wish good fortune to their foes.  They must comfort the ill-natured, 
and treat their oppressors with loving-kindness.  
They must be as refreshing water to the thirsty, and to the 
sick, a swift remedy, a healing balm to those in pain and a 
solace to every burdened heart.  They must be a guiding 
 
+P319 
light to those who have gone astray, a sure leader for the 
lost.  They must be seeing eyes to the blind, hearing ears to 
the deaf, and to the dead eternal life, and to the despondent 
joy forever.  
     Let them willingly subject themselves to every just king, 
and to every generous ruler be good citizens.  Let them obey 
the government and not meddle in political affairs, but 
devote themselves to the betterment of character and 
behaviour, and fix their gaze upon the Light of the world.  
 
     237.  Whoso reciteth this prayer with lowliness and 
           fervour will bring gladness and joy to the heart of 
           this Servant; it will be even as meeting Him face 
           to face.  
 
                     He is the All-Glorious!  
 
     O God, my God!  Lowly and tearful, I raise my suppliant 
hands to Thee and cover my face in the dust of that 
Threshold of Thine, exalted above the knowledge of the 
learned, and the praise of all that glorify Thee.  Graciously 
look upon Thy servant, humble and lowly at Thy door, 
with the glances of the eye of Thy mercy, and immerse 
him in the Ocean of Thine eternal grace.  
     Lord!  He is a poor and lowly servant of Thine, enthralled 
and imploring Thee, captive in Thy hand, praying 
fervently to Thee, trusting in Thee, in tears before Thy 
face, calling to Thee and beseeching Thee, saying:  
     O Lord, my God!  Give me Thy grace to serve Thy 
loved ones, strengthen me in my servitude to Thee, illumine 
my brow with the light of adoration in Thy court of 
holiness, and of prayer to Thy Kingdom of grandeur.  Help 
 
+P320 
me to be selfless at the heavenly entrance of Thy gate, and 
aid me to be detached from all things within Thy holy 
precincts.  Lord!  Give me to drink from the chalice of selflessness; 
with its robe clothe me, and in its ocean immerse 
me.  Make me as dust in the pathway of Thy loved ones, 
and grant that I may offer up my soul for the earth ennobled 
by the footsteps of Thy chosen ones in Thy path, 
O Lord of Glory in the Highest.  
     With this prayer doth Thy servant call Thee, at dawntide 
and in the night-season.  Fulfil his heart's desire, O 
Lord!  Illumine his heart, gladden his bosom, kindle his 
light, that he may serve Thy Cause and Thy servants.  
     Thou art the Bestower, the Pitiful, the Most Bountiful, 
the Gracious, the Merciful, the Compassionate.
