              THE DUTY OF KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY 
              TOWARDS STRANGERS AND FOREIGNERS 
 
                                    October 16th and 17th, 1911 
     When a man turns his face to God he finds sunshine 
everywhere.  All men are his brothers.  
Let not conventionality cause you to seem cold and 
unsympathetic when you meet strange people from 
other countries.  Do not look at them as though you 
suspected them of being evil-doers, thieves and boors.  
You think it necessary to be very careful, not to expose 
yourselves to the risk of making acquaintance with 
such, possibly, undesirable people.  
     I ask you not to think only of yourselves.  Be kind 
to the strangers, whether come they from Turkey, 
Japan, Persia, Russia, China or any other country in 
the world.  
     Help to make them feel at home; find out where 
they are staying, ask if you may render them any 
service; try to make their lives a little happier.  
     In this way, even if, sometimes, what you at first 
suspected should be true, still go out of your way to be 
kind to them--this kindness will help them to become 
better.  
     After all, why should any foreign people be treated 
as strangers?  
     Let those who meet you know, without your proclaiming 
the fact, that you are indeed a &amp;Baha'i.  
 
+P16 
     Put into practice the Teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah, that 
of kindness to all nations.  Do not be content with 
showing friendship in words alone, let your heart burn 
with loving kindness for all who may cross your path.  
     Oh, you of the Western nations, be kind to those 
who come from the Eastern world to sojourn among 
you.  Forget your conventionality when you speak 
with them; they are not accustomed to it.  To Eastern 
peoples this demeanour seems cold, unfriendly.  Rather 
let your manner be sympathetic.  Let it be seen that 
you are filled with universal love.  When you meet a 
Persian or any other stranger, speak to him as to a 
friend; if he seems to be lonely try to help him, give 
him of your willing service; if he be sad console him, 
if poor succour him, if oppressed rescue him, if in 
misery comfort him.  In so doing you will manifest 
that not in words only, but in deed and in truth, you 
think of all men as your brothers.  
     What profit is there in agreeing that universal friendship 
is good, and talking of the solidarity of the human 
race as a grand ideal?  Unless these thoughts are translated 
into the world of action, they are useless.  
     The wrong in the world continues to exist just because 
people talk only of their ideals, and do not strive 
to put them into practice.  If actions took the place of 
words, the world's misery would very soon be changed 
into comfort.  
     A man who does great good, and talks not of it, is 
on the way to perfection.  
     The man who has accomplished a small good and 
magnifies it in his speech is worth very little.  
 
+P17 
     If I love you, I need not continually speak of my 
love--you will know without any words.  On the other 
hand if I love you not, that also will you know--and 
you would not believe me, were I to tell you in a 
thousand words, that I loved you.  
     People make much profession of goodness, multiplying 
fine words because they wish to be thought 
greater and better than their fellows, seeking fame in 
the eyes of the world.  Those who do most good use 
fewest words concerning their actions.  
     The children of God do the works without boasting, 
obeying His laws.  
     My hope for you is that you will ever avoid tyranny 
and oppression; that you will work without ceasing 
till justice reigns in every land, that you will keep your 
hearts pure and your hands free from unrighteousness.  
     This is what the near approach to God requires from 
you, and this is what I expect of you.  
 
 
             THE POWER AND VALUE OF TRUE THOUGHT 
           DEPEND UPON ITS MANIFESTATION IN ACTION 
 
                                            October 18th 
     The reality of man is his thought, not his material 
body.  The thought force and the animal force are 
partners.  Although man is part of the animal creation, 
he possesses a power of thought superior to all other 
created beings.  
     If a man's thought is constantly aspiring towards 
heavenly subjects then does he become saintly; if on 
 
+P18 
the other hand his thought does not soar, but is 
directed downwards to centre itself upon the things of 
this world, he grows more and more material until he 
arrives at a state little better than that of a mere animal.  
     Thoughts may be divided into two classes:  
     (1st) Thought that belongs to the world of thought 
           alone.  
     (2nd) Thought that expresses itself in action.  
     Some men and women glory in their exalted 
thoughts, but if these thoughts never reach the plane 
of action they remain useless:  the power of thought is 
dependent on its manifestation in deeds.  A philosopher's 
thought may, however, in the world of progress and 
evolution, translate itself into the actions of other 
people, even when they themselves are unable or unwilling 
to show forth their grand ideals in their own 
lives.  To this class the majority of philosophers belong, 
their teachings being high above their actions.  This is 
the difference between philosophers who are Spiritual 
Teachers, and those who are mere philosophers:  the 
Spiritual Teacher is the first to follow His own teaching; 
He brings down into the world of action His spiritual 
conceptions and ideals.  His Divine thoughts are made 
manifest to the world.  His thought is Himself, from 
which He is inseparable.  When we find a philosopher 
emphasizing the importance and grandeur of justice, 
and then encouraging a rapacious monarch in his 
oppression and tyranny, we quickly realize that he 
belongs to the first class:  for he thinks heavenly 
thoughts and does not practise the corresponding 
heavenly virtues.  
 
+P19 
     This state is impossible with Spiritual Philosophers, 
for they ever express their high and noble thoughts in 
actions.  
 
 
          GOD IS THE GREAT COMPASSIONATE PHYSICIAN 
                WHO ALONE GIVES TRUE HEALING 
 
                                                 October 19th 
     All true healing comes from God!  There are two 
causes for sickness, one is material, the other 
spiritual.  If the sickness is of the body, a material 
remedy is needed, if of the soul, a spiritual remedy.  
     If the heavenly benediction be upon us while we 
are being healed then only can we be made whole, for 
medicine is but the outward and visible means through 
which we obtain the heavenly healing.  Unless the 
spirit be healed, the cure of the body is worth nothing.  
All is in the hands of God, and without Him there 
can be no health in us!  
     There have been many men who have died at last of 
the very disease of which they have made a special 
study.  Aristotle, for instance, who made a special study 
of the digestion, died of a gastronomic malady.  
Aviseu was a specialist of the heart, but he died of 
heart disease.  God is the great compassionate Physician 
who alone has the power to give true healing.  
     All creatures are dependent upon God, however 
great may seem their knowledge, power and independence.  
     Behold the mighty kings upon earth, for they have 
 
+P20 
all the power in the world that man can give them, 
and yet when death calls they must obey, even as the 
peasants at their gates.  
     Look also at the animals, how helpless they are in 
their apparent strength!  For the elephant, the largest of 
all animals, is troubled by the fly, and the lion cannot 
escape the irritation of the worm.  Even man, the 
highest form of created beings, needs many things for 
his very life; first of all he needs air, and if he is 
deprived of it for a few minutes, he dies.  He is also 
dependent on water, food, clothing, warmth, and 
many other things.  On all sides he is surrounded by 
dangers and difficulties, against which his physical body 
alone cannot cope.  If a man looks at the world around 
him, he will see how all created things are dependent 
and are captive to the laws of Nature.  
     Man alone, by his spiritual power, has been able to 
free himself, to soar above the world of matter and to 
make it his servant.  
     Without the help of God man is even as the beasts 
that perish, but God has bestowed such wonderful 
power upon him that he might ever look upward, and 
receive, among other gifts, healing from His divine 
Bounty.  
     But alas! man is not grateful for this supreme good, 
but sleeps the sleep of negligence, being careless of the 
great mercy which God has shown towards him, 
turning his face away from the light and going on his 
way in darkness.  
     It is my earnest prayer, that ye be not like unto this, 
but rather that ye keep your faces steadfastly turned to 
 
+P21 
the light, so that ye may be as lighted torches in the 
dark places of life.  
 
 
           THE NEED FOR UNION BETWEEN THE PEOPLES 
                    OF THE EAST AND WEST 
 
                                      Friday, October 20th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     In the past, as in the present, the Spiritual Sun of 
Truth has always shone from the horizon of the East.  
     Abraham appeared in the East.  In the East Moses 
arose to lead and teach the people.  On the Eastern 
horizon arose the Lord Christ.  &amp;Muhammad was sent to 
an Eastern nation.  The &amp;Bab arose in the Eastern land 
of Persia.  &amp;Baha'u'llah lived and taught in the East.  
All the great Spiritual Teachers arose in the Eastern 
world.  But although the Sun of Christ dawned in the 
East the radiance thereof was apparent in the West, 
where the effulgence of its glory was more clearly seen.  
The divine light of His Teaching shone with a greater 
force in the Western world, where it has made a more 
rapid headway than in the land of its birth.  
     In these days the East is in need of material progress 
and the West is in want of a spiritual idea.  It would be 
well for the West to turn to the East for illumination, 
and to give in exchange its scientific knowledge.  There 
must be this interchange of gifts.  
     The East and the West must unite to give to each 
other what is lacking.  This union will bring about a 
 
+P22 
true civilization, where the spiritual is expressed and 
carried out in the material.  
     Receiving thus the one from the other the greatest 
harmony will prevail, all people will be united, a state 
of great perfection will be attained, there will be a firm 
cementing, and this world will become a shining 
mirror for the reflection of the attributes of God.  
     We all, the Eastern with the Western nations, must 
strive day and night with heart and soul to achieve 
this high ideal, to cement the unity between all the 
nations of the earth.  Every heart will then be refreshed, 
all eyes will be opened, the most wonderful power will 
be given, the happiness of humanity will be assured.  
     We must pray that by the Bounty of God, Persia will 
be enabled to receive the material and mental civilization 
of the West, and by Divine Grace to give in return 
her spiritual light.  The devoted energetic work of the 
united peoples, occidentals and orientals, will succeed 
in establishing this result, for the force of the Holy 
Spirit will aid them.  
     The principles of the Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah should 
be carefully studied, one by one, until they are realized 
and understood by mind and heart--so will you become 
strong followers of the light, truly spiritual, 
heavenly soldiers of God, acquiring and spreading the 
true civilization in Persia, in Europe, and in the whole 
world.  
     This will be the paradise which is to come on earth, 
when all mankind will be gathered together under the 
tent of unity in the Kingdom of Glory.  
 
+P23 
              GOD COMPREHENDS ALL:  HE CANNOT BE 
                        COMPREHENDED 
 
                            Friday evening, October 20th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     Numerous meetings are held in Paris every day 
for different purposes, to discuss politics, commerce, 
education, art, science and many other subjects.  
     All these meetings are good:  but this assembly has 
met together to turn their faces towards God, to learn 
how best to work for the good of humanity, to seek 
how prejudices may be abolished, and the seed of 
love and universal brotherhood sown in the heart of 
man.  
     God approves of the motive of our gathering together 
and gives us His blessing.  
     In the Old Testament we read that God said, `Let 
us make man in Our own image'.  In the Gospel, Christ 
said, `I am in the Father, and the Father in Me'.+F1  In 
the &amp;Qur'an, God says, `Man is my Mystery and I am 
his'.  &amp;Baha'u'llah writes that God says, `Thy heart is 
My home; purify it for My descent.  Thy spirit is My 
place of revelation; cleanse it for My manifestation'.  
     All these sacred words show us that man is made in 
God's image:  yet the Essence of God is incomprehensible 
to the human mind, for the finite understanding 
cannot be applied to this infinite Mystery.  God 
contains all:  He cannot be contained.  That which 
 
+F1 St. John xiv, II 
 
+P24 
contains is superior to that which is contained.  The 
whole is greater than its parts.  
     Things which are understood by men cannot be outside 
their capacity for understanding, so that it is 
impossible for the heart of man to comprehend the 
nature of the Majesty of God.  Our imagination can 
only picture that which it is able to create.  
     The power of the understanding differs in degree in 
the various kingdoms of creation.  The mineral, vegetable, 
and animal realms are each incapable of understanding 
any creation beyond their own.  The mineral 
cannot imagine the growing power of the plant.  The 
tree cannot understand the power of movement in the 
animal, neither can it comprehend what it would mean 
to possess sight, hearing or the sense of smell.  These 
all belong to the physical creation.  
     Man also shares in this creation; but it is not possible 
for either of the lower kingdoms to understand that 
which takes place in the mind of man.  The animal 
cannot realize the intelligence of a human being, he 
only knows that which is perceived by his animal 
senses, he cannot imagine anything in the abstract.  An 
animal could not learn that the world is round, that 
the earth revolves round the sun, or the construction 
of the electric telegraph.  These things are only possible 
to man.  Man is the highest work of creation, the 
nearest to God of all creatures.  
     All superior kingdoms are incomprehensible to the 
inferior; how therefore could it be possible that the 
creature, man, should understand the almighty Creator 
of all?  
 
+P25 
     That which we imagine, is not the Reality of God; 
He, the Unknowable, the Unthinkable, is far beyond 
the highest conception of man.  
     All creatures that exist are dependent upon the 
Divine Bounty.  Divine Mercy gives life itself.  As 
the light of the sun shines on the whole world, so the 
Mercy of the infinite God is shed on all creatures.  As 
the sun ripens the fruits of the earth, and gives life and 
warmth to all living beings, so shines the Sun of Truth 
on all souls, filling them with the fire of Divine love 
and understanding.  
     The superiority of man over the rest of the created 
world is seen again in this, that man has a soul in 
which dwells the divine spirit; the souls of the lower 
creatures are inferior in their essence.  
     There is no doubt then, that of all created beings 
man is the nearest to the nature of God, and therefore 
receives a greater gift of the Divine Bounty.  
     The mineral kingdom possesses the power of existing.  
The plant has the power of existing and growing.  
The animal, in addition to existence and growth, has 
the capacity of moving about, and the use of the 
faculties of the senses.  In the human kingdom we find 
all the attributes of the lower worlds, with much more 
added thereto.  Man is the sum of every previous 
creation, for he contains them all.  
     To man is given the special gift of the intellect by 
which he is able to receive a larger share of the light 
Divine.  The Perfect Man is as a polished mirror 
reflecting the Sun of Truth, manifesting the attributes 
of God.  
 
+P26 
     The Lord Christ said, `He that hath seen Me hath 
seen the Father'--God manifested in man.  
     The sun does not leave his place in the heavens and 
descend into the mirror, for the actions of ascent and 
descent, coming and going, do not belong to the 
Infinite, they are the methods of finite beings.  In the 
Manifestation of God, the perfectly polished mirror, 
appear the qualities of the Divine in a form that man is 
capable of comprehending.  
     This is so simple that all can understand it, and that 
which we are able to understand we must perforce 
accept.  
     Our Father will not hold us responsible for the rejection 
of dogmas which we are unable either to believe 
or comprehend, for He is ever infinitely just to His 
children.  
     This example is, however, so logical that it can easily 
be grasped by all minds willing to give it their consideration.  
     May each one of you become a shining lamp, of 
which the flame is the Love of God.  May your hearts 
burn with the radiance of unity.  May your eyes be 
illumined with the effulgence of the Sun of Truth!  
     The city of Paris is very beautiful, a more civilized 
and well-appointed town in all material development 
it would be impossible to find in the present world.  But 
the spiritual light has not shone upon her for a long 
time:  her spiritual progress is far behind that of her 
material civilization.  A supreme power is needed to 
awaken her to the reality of spiritual truth, to breathe 
the breath of life into her dormant soul.  You must all 
 
+P27 
unite in this work of arousing her, in reanimating her 
people by the help of that Superior Force.  
     When an illness is slight a small remedy will suffice 
to heal it, but when the slight illness becomes a terrible 
disease, then a very strong remedy must be used by the 
Divine Healer.  There are some trees that blossom and 
bear fruit in a cool climate, others there are which need 
the hottest rays of the sun to bring them to perfect 
maturity.  Paris is one of those trees for whose spiritual 
unfoldment a great flaming Sun of the Divine Power 
of God is needed.  
     I ask you all, each one of you, to follow well the 
light of truth, in the Holy Teachings, and God will 
strengthen you by His Holy Spirit so that you will be 
enabled to overcome the difficulties, and to destroy 
the prejudices which cause separation and hatred 
amongst the people.  Let your hearts be filled with the 
great love of God, let it be felt by all; for every man is 
a servant of God, and all are entitled to a share of the 
Divine Bounty.  
     Especially to those whose thoughts are material 
and retrograde show the utmost love and patience, 
thereby winning them into the unity of fellowship by 
the radiance of your kindness.  
     If you are faithful to your great work, following the 
Holy Sun of Truth without swerving, then will the 
blessed day of universal brotherhood dawn on this 
beautiful city.  
 
+P28 
           THE PITIFUL CAUSES OF WAR, AND THE DUTY 
               OF EVERYONE TO STRIVE FOR PEACE 
 
                                               October 21st 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     I hope you are all happy and well.  I am not 
happy, but very sad.  The news of the Battle of Benghazi 
grieves my heart.  I wonder at the human savagery 
that still exists in the world!  How is it possible for men 
to fight from morning until evening, killing each other, 
shedding the blood of their fellow-men:  And for 
what object?  To gain possession of a part of the earth!  
Even the animals, when they fight, have an immediate 
and more reasonable cause for their attacks!  How 
terrible it is that men, who are of the higher kingdom, 
can descend to slaying and bringing misery to their 
fellow-beings, for the possession of a tract of land!  
     The highest of created beings fighting to obtain the 
lowest form of matter, earth!  Land belongs not to one 
people, but to all people.  This earth is not man's home, 
but his tomb.  It is for their tombs these men are 
fighting.  There is nothing so horrible in this world as 
the tomb, the abode of the decaying bodies of men.  
     However great the conqueror, however many 
countries he may reduce to slavery, he is unable to 
retain any part of these devastated lands but one tiny 
portion--his tomb!  If more land is required for the 
improvement of the condition of the people, for the 
spread of civilization (for the substitution of just laws 
for brutal customs)--surely it would be possible to 
 
+P29 
acquire peaceably the necessary extension of territory.  
     But war is made for the satisfaction of men's ambition; 
for the sake of worldly gain to the few, terrible 
misery is brought to numberless homes, breaking the 
hearts of hundreds of men and women!  
     How many widows mourn their husbands, how 
many stories of savage cruelty do we hear!  How many 
little orphaned children are crying for their dead 
fathers, how many women are weeping for their slain 
sons!  
     There is nothing so heart-breaking and terrible as 
an outburst of human savagery!  
     I charge you all that each one of you concentrate all 
the thoughts of your heart on love and unity.  When a 
thought of war comes, oppose it by a stronger thought 
of peace.  A thought of hatred must be destroyed by a 
more powerful thought of love.  Thoughts of war 
bring destruction to all harmony, well-being, restfulness 
and content.  
     Thoughts of love are constructive of brotherhood, 
peace, friendship, and happiness.  
     When soldiers of the world draw their swords to kill, 
soldiers of God clasp each other's hands!  So may all 
the savagery of man disappear by the Mercy of God, 
working through the pure in heart and the sincere of 
soul.  Do not think the peace of the world an ideal 
impossible to attain!  
     Nothing is impossible to the Divine Benevolence of 
God.  
     If you desire with all your heart, friendship with 
every race on earth, your thought, spiritual and 
 
+P30 
positive, will spread; it will become the desire of 
others, growing stronger and stronger, until it reaches 
the minds of all men.  
     Do not despair!  Work steadily.  Sincerity and love 
will conquer hate.  How many seemingly impossible 
events are coming to pass in these days!  Set your faces 
steadily towards the Light of the World.  Show love 
to all; `Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit in the 
heart of Man'.  Take courage!  God never forsakes His 
children who strive and work and pray!  Let your hearts 
be filled with the strenuous desire that tranquillity and 
harmony may encircle all this warring world.  So will 
success crown your efforts, and with the universal 
brotherhood will come the Kingdom of God in peace 
and goodwill.  
     In this room today are members of many races, 
French, American, English, German, Italian, brothers 
and sisters meeting in friendship and harmony!  Let 
this gathering be a foreshadowing of what will, in 
very truth, take place in this world, when every child 
of God realizes that they are leaves of one tree, flowers 
in one garden, drops in one ocean, and sons and 
daughters of one Father, whose name is love!  
 
 
                      THE SUN OF TRUTH 
 
                                         October 22nd 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     It is a lovely day, the sun shines brightly upon the 
earth, giving light and warmth to all creatures.  The 
Sun of Truth is also shining, giving light and warmth 
 
+P31 
to the souls of men.  The sun is the life-giver to the 
physical bodies of all creatures upon earth; without its 
warmth their growth would be stunted, their development 
would be arrested, they would decay and die.  
Even so do the souls of men need the Sun of Truth to 
shed its rays upon their souls, to develop them, to 
educate and encourage them.  As the sun is to the body 
of a man so is the Sun of Truth to his soul.  
     A man may have attained to a high degree of 
material progress, but without the light of truth his 
soul is stunted and starved.  Another man may have no 
material gifts, may be at the bottom of the social 
ladder, but, having received the warmth of the Sun of 
Truth his soul is great and his spiritual understanding 
is enlightened.  
     A Greek philosopher living in the days of the youth 
of Christianity, being full of the Christian element, 
though not a professing Christian, wrote thus:  `It is 
my belief that religion is the very foundation of true 
civilization'.  For, unless the moral character of a nation 
is educated, as well as its brain and its talents, civilization 
has no sure basis.  
     As religion inculcates morality, it is therefore the 
truest philosophy, and on it is built the only lasting 
civilization.  As an example of this, he points out the 
Christians of the time whose morality was on a very 
high level.  The belief of this philosopher conforms to 
the truth, for the civilization of Christianity was the 
best and most enlightened in the world.  The Christian 
Teaching was illumined by the Divine Sun of Truth, 
therefore its followers were taught to love all men as 
 
+P32 
brothers to fear nothing, not even death!  To love 
their neighbours as themselves, and to forget their own 
selfish interests in striving for the greater good of 
humanity.  The grand aim of the religion of Christ was 
to draw the hearts of all men nearer to God's effulgent 
Truth.  
     If the followers of the Lord Christ had continued to 
follow out these principles with steadfast faithfulness, 
there would have been no need for a renewal of the 
Christian Message, no necessity for a re-awakening of 
His people, for a great and glorious civilization would 
now be ruling the world and the Kingdom of Heaven 
would have come on earth.  
     But instead of this, what has taken place!  Men 
turned away their faces from following the divinely 
illuminated precepts of their Master, and winter fell 
upon the hearts of men.  For, as the body of man depends 
for life upon the rays of the sun, so cannot the 
celestial virtues grow in the soul without the radiance 
of the Sun of Truth.  
     God leaves not His children comfortless, but, when 
the darkness of winter overshadows them, then again 
He sends His Messengers, the Prophets, with a renewal 
of the blessed spring.  The Sun of Truth appears again 
on the horizon of the world shining into the eyes of 
those who sleep, awaking them to behold the glory of 
a new dawn.  Then again will the tree of humanity 
blossom and bring forth the fruit of righteousness for 
the healing of the nations.  Because man has stopped his 
ears to the Voice of Truth and shut his eyes to the 
Sacred Light, neglecting the Law of God, for this 
 
+P33 
reason has the darkness of war and tumult, unrest and 
misery, desolated the earth.  I pray that you will all 
strive to bring each child of God into the radiance of 
the Sun of Truth, that the darkness may be dissipated 
by the penetrating rays of its glory, and the winter's 
hardness and cold may be melted away by the merciful 
warmth of its shining.  
 
 
           THE LIGHT OF TRUTH IS NOW SHINING UPON 
                      THE EAST AND WEST 
 
                                      Monday, October 23rd 
     When a man has found the joy of life in one 
place, he returns to that same spot to find more 
joy.  When a man has found gold in a mine, he returns 
again to that mine to dig for more gold.  
     This shows the internal force and natural instinct 
which God has given to man, and the power of vital 
energy which is born in him.  
     The West has always received spiritual enlightenment 
from the East.  The Song of the Kingdom is first 
heard in the East, but in the West the greater volume 
of sound bursts upon the listening ears.  
     The Lord Christ arose as a bright Star in the Eastern 
sky, but the light of His Teaching shone more perfectly 
in the West, where His influence has taken root more 
firmly and His Cause has spread to a greater degree 
than in the land of His birth.  
     The sound of the Song of Christ has echoed over all 
 
+P34 
the lands of the Western World and entered the hearts 
of its people.  
     The people of the West are firm, and the foundations 
on which they build are of rock; they are steadfast, and 
do not easily forget.  
     The West is like a strong sturdy plant; when the 
rain falls gently upon it to give it nourishment and the 
sun shines upon it, then does it blossom in due time and 
bring forth good fruit.  It is a long time since the Sun 
of Truth mirrored forth by the Lord Christ has shed 
its radiance upon the West, for the Face of God has 
been veiled by the sin and forgetfulness of man.  But 
now again, praise be to God, the Holy Spirit speaks 
anew to the world!  The constellation of love and 
wisdom and power is once more shining from the 
Divine Horizon to give joy to all who turn their faces 
to the Light of God.  &amp;Baha'u'llah has rent the veil of 
prejudice and superstition which was stifling the souls 
of men.  Let us pray to God that the breath of the Holy 
Spirit may again give hope and refreshment to the 
people, awakening in them a desire to do the Will of 
God.  May heart and soul be vivified in every man:  so 
will they all rejoice in a new birth.  
     Then shall humanity put on a new garment in the 
radiance of the love of God, and it shall be the dawn of 
a new creation!  Then will the Mercy of the Most 
Merciful be showered upon all mankind and they will 
arise to a new life.  
     My earnest desire is that you will all strive and work 
for this glorious end; that you will be faithful and 
loving workers in the building of the new spiritual 
 
+P35 
civilization; the elect of God, in willing joyful obedience 
carrying out His supreme design!  Success is truly 
near at hand, for the Flag of Divinity has been raised 
aloft, and the Sun of the Righteousness of God 
appeareth upon the horizon in the sight of all men!  
 
 
                     THE UNIVERSAL LOVE 
 
                                            October 24th 
     An Indian said to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:  
     `My aim in life is to transmit as far as in me lies 
the message of Krishna to the world.'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  The Message of Krishna is the 
message of love.  All God's prophets have brought the 
message of love.  None has ever thought that war 
and hate are good.  Every one agrees in saying that 
love and kindness are best.  
     Love manifests its reality in deeds, not only in words
--these alone are without effect.  In order that love 
may manifest its power there must be an object, an 
instrument, a motive.  
     There are many ways of expressing the love principle; 
there is love for the family, for the country, for the 
race, there is political enthusiasm, there is also the love 
of community of interest in service.  These are all ways 
and means of showing the power of love.  Without 
any such means, love would be unseen, unheard, unfelt
--altogether unexpressed, unmanifested!  Water 
shows its power in various ways, in quenching thirst, 
causing seed to grow, etc.  Coal expresses one of its 
 
+P36 
principles in gas-light, while one of the powers of 
electricity is shown in the electric light.  If there were 
neither gas nor electricity, the nights of the world 
would be darkness!  So, it is necessary to have an 
instrument, a motive for love's manifestation, an 
object, a mode of expression.  
     We must find a way of spreading love among the 
sons of humanity.  
     Love is unlimited, boundless, infinite!  Material 
things are limited, circumscribed, finite.  You cannot 
adequately express infinite love by limited means.  
     The perfect love needs an unselfish instrument, 
absolutely freed from fetters of every kind.  The love 
of family is limited; the tie of blood relationship is not 
the strongest bond.  Frequently members of the same 
family disagree, and even hate each other.  
     Patriotic love is finite; the love of one's country 
causing hatred of all others, is not perfect love!  Compatriots 
also are not free from quarrels amongst 
themselves.  
     The love of race is limited; there is some union here, 
but that is insufficient.  Love must be free from 
boundaries!  
     To love our own race may mean hatred of all others, 
and even people of the same race often dislike each 
other.  
     Political love also is much bound up with hatred of 
one party for another; this love is very limited and 
uncertain.  
     The love of community of interest in service is likewise 
fluctuating; frequently competitions arise, which 
 
+P37 
lead to jealousy, and at length hatred replaces love.  
     A few years ago, Turkey and Italy had a friendly 
political understanding; now they are at war!  
     All these ties of love are imperfect.  It is clear that 
limited material ties are insufficient to adequately express 
the universal love.  
     The great unselfish love for humanity is bounded by 
none of these imperfect, semi-selfish bonds; this is the 
one perfect love, possible to all mankind, and can only 
be achieved by the power of the Divine Spirit.  No 
worldly power can accomplish the universal love.  
     Let all be united in this Divine power of love!  Let 
all strive to grow in the light of the Sun of Truth, and 
reflecting this luminous love on all men, may their 
hearts become so united that they may dwell evermore 
in the radiance of the limitless love.  
     Remember these words which I speak unto you 
during the short time I am amongst you in Paris.  I 
earnestly exhort you:  let not your hearts be fettered by 
the material things of this world; I charge you not to 
lie contentedly on the beds of negligence, prisoners of 
matter, but to arise and free yourselves from its chains!  
     The animal creation is captive to matter, God has 
given freedom to man.  The animal cannot escape the 
law of nature, whereas man may control it, for he, 
containing nature, can rise above it.  
     The power of the Holy Spirit, enlightening man's 
intelligence, has enabled him to discover means of 
bending many natural laws to his will.  He flies through 
the air, floats on the sea, and even moves under the 
waters.  
 
+P38 
     All this proves how man's intelligence has been 
enabled to free him from the limitations of nature, and 
to solve many of her mysteries.  Man, to a certain 
extent, has broken the chains of matter.  
     The Holy Spirit will give to man greater powers 
than these, if only he will strive after the things of the 
spirit and endeavour to attune his heart to the Divine 
infinite love.  
     When you love a member of your family or a compatriot, 
let it be with a ray of the Infinite Love!  Let 
it be in God, and for God!  Wherever you find the 
attributes of God love that person, whether he be of 
your family or of another.  Shed the light of a boundless 
love on every human being whom you meet, 
whether of your country, your race, your political 
party, or of any other nation, colour or shade of 
political opinion.  Heaven will support you while you 
work in this in-gathering of the scattered peoples of the 
world beneath the shadow of the almighty tent of unity.  
     You will be servants of God, who are dwelling 
near to Him, His divine helpers in the service, ministering 
to all Humanity.  All Humanity!  Every human 
being!  never forget this!  
     Do not say, he is an Italian, or a Frenchman, or an 
American, or an Englishman, remember only that he 
is a son of God, a servant of the Most High, a man!  All 
are men!  Forget nationalities; all are equal in the sight 
of God!  
     Remember not your own limitations; the help of 
God will come to you.  Forget yourself.  God's help 
will surely come!  
 
+P39 
     When you call on the Mercy of God waiting to 
reinforce you, your strength will be tenfold.  
     Look at me:  I am so feeble, yet I have had the 
strength given me to come amongst you:  a poor 
servant of God, who has been enabled to give you this 
message!  I shall not be with you long!  One must never 
consider one's own feebleness, it is the strength of the 
Holy Spirit of Love, which gives the power to teach.  
The thought of our own weakness could only bring 
despair.  We must look higher than all earthly thoughts; 
detach ourselves from every material idea, crave for 
the things of the spirit; fix our eyes on the everlasting 
bountiful Mercy of the Almighty, who will fill our 
souls with the gladness of joyful service to His command 
`Love One Another'.  
 
 
              THE IMPRISONMENT OF &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA 
 
                                 4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, 
                                     Wednesday, October 25th 
     I regret much that I have kept you waiting this 
morning, but I have so much to do in a short time 
for the Cause of the love of God.  
     You will not mind having waited a little to see me.  
I have waited years and years in prison, that I might 
come to see you now.  
     Above all, God be praised, our hearts are always in 
unison, and with one aim are drawn to the love of 
God.  By the Bounty of the Kingdom our desires, our 
hearts, our spirits, are they not united in one bond?  
 
+P40 
Our prayers, are they not for the gathering together of 
all men in harmony?  Therefore are we not always 
together?  
     Yesterday evening when I came home from the 
house of Monsieur Dreyfus I was very tired--yet I did 
not sleep, I lay awake thinking.  
     I said, O God, Here am I in Paris!  What is Paris and 
who am I?  Never did I dream that from the darkness 
of my prison I should ever be able to come to you, 
though when they read me my sentence I did not 
believe in it.  
     They told me that &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid had ordered my 
everlasting imprisonment, and I said, `This is impossible!  
I shall not always be a prisoner.  If &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid 
were immortal, such a sentence might possibly 
be carried out.  It is certain that one day I shall be free.  
My body may be captive for a time, but &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid 
has no power over my spirit--free it must 
remain--that can no man imprison'.  
     Released from my prison by the Power of God I 
meet here the friends of God, and I am thankful unto 
Him.  
     Let us spread the Cause of God, for which I suffered 
persecution.  
     What a privilege it is for us to meet here in freedom.  
How happy for us that God has so decided that we 
may work together for the coming of the Kingdom!  
     Are you pleased to receive such a guest, freed from 
his prison to bring the glorious Message to you?  He 
who never could have thought such a meeting possible!  
Now by the Grace of God, by His wonderful Power, 
 
+P41 
I, who was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in 
a far off town of the East, am here in Paris talking with 
you!  
     Henceforward we shall always be together, heart and 
soul and spirit, pressing forward in the work till all 
men are gathered together under the tent of the Kingdom, 
singing the songs of peace.  
 
 
                 GOD'S GREATEST GIFT TO MAN 
 
                                    Thursday, October 26th 
     God's greatest gift to man is that of intellect, or 
understanding.  
     The understanding is the power by which man 
acquires his knowledge of the several kingdoms of 
creation, and of various stages of existence, as well as 
of much which is invisible.  
     Possessing this gift, he is, in himself, the sum of 
earlier creations--he is able to get into touch with those 
kingdoms; and by this gift, he can frequently, through 
his scientific knowledge, reach out with prophetic 
vision.  
     Intellect is, in truth, the most precious gift bestowed 
upon man by the Divine Bounty.  Man alone, among 
created beings, has this wonderful power.  
     All creation, preceding Man, is bound by the stern 
law of nature.  The great sun, the multitudes of stars, 
the oceans and seas, the mountains, the rivers, the 
trees, and all animals, great or small--none is able to 
evade obedience to nature's law.  
 
+P42 
     Man alone has freedom, and, by his understanding 
or intellect, has been able to gain control of and adapt 
some of those natural laws to his own needs.  By the 
power of his intellect he has discovered means by which 
he not only traverses great continents in express trains 
and crosses vast oceans in ships, but, like the fish 
he travels under water in submarines, and, imitating the 
birds, he flies through the air in airships.  
     Man has succeeded in using electricity in several 
ways--for light, for motive power, for sending 
messages from one end of the earth to the other--and 
by electricity he can even hear a voice many miles 
away!  
     By this gift of understanding or intellect he has also 
been able to use the rays of the sun to picture people 
and things, and even to capture the form of distant 
heavenly bodies.  
     We perceive in what numerous ways man has been 
able to bend the powers of nature to his will.  
     How grievous it is to see how man has used his God-given 
gift to frame instruments of war, for breaking 
the Commandment of God `Thou shalt not kill', and 
for defying Christ's injunction to `Love one another'.  
     God gave this power to man that it might be used 
for the advancement of civilization, for the good of 
humanity, to increase love and concord and peace.  
But man prefers to use this gift to destroy instead of 
to build, for injustice and oppression, for hatred and 
discord and devastation, for the destruction of his 
fellow-creatures, whom Christ has commanded that 
he should love as himself!  
 
+P43 
     I hope that you will use your understanding to promote 
the unity and tranquillity of mankind, to give 
enlightenment and civilization to the people, to produce 
love in all around you, and to bring about the 
universal peace.  
     Study the sciences, acquire more and more knowledge.  
Assuredly one may learn to the end of one's 
life!  Use your knowledge always for the benefit of 
others; so may war cease on the face of this beautiful 
earth, and a glorious edifice of peace and concord be 
raised.  Strive that your high ideals may be realized 
in the Kingdom of God on earth, as they will be in 
Heaven.  
 
 
             THE CLOUDS THAT OBSCURE THE SUN OF 
                            TRUTH 
 
                      4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, 
                           Morning of Friday, October 27th 
     The day is fine, the air is pure, the sun shines, no 
mist nor cloud obscures its radiance.  
     These brilliant rays penetrate into all parts of the city; 
so may the Sun of Truth illumine the minds of men.  
     Christ said, `They shall see the Son of Man coming 
in the clouds of Heaven'.+F1  &amp;Baha'u'llah said, `When 
Christ came for the first time He came upon the 
clouds'.+F2  Christ said that He had come from the sky, 
from Heaven--that He came forth from God--while 
He was born of Mary, His Mother.  But when He 
 
+F1 St Matthew xxiv, 30.  St Matthew xvi, 27.  
+F2 St John iii, 13.  
 
+P44 
declared that He had come from Heaven, it is clear 
that He did not mean the blue firmament but that He 
spoke of the Heaven of the Kingdom of God, and 
that from this Heaven He descended upon the clouds.  
As clouds are obstacles to the shining of the sun, so 
the clouds of the world of humanity hid from the 
eyes of men the radiance of the Divinity of Christ.  
     Men said, `He is of Nazareth, born of Mary, we 
know Him and we know his brethren.  What can He 
mean?  What is He saying?  That He came forth from 
God?'  
     The Body of Christ was born of Mary of Nazareth, 
but the Spirit was of God.  The capacities of His human 
body were limited but the strength of His spirit was 
vast, infinite, immeasurable.  
     Men asked, `Why does He say He is of God?'  If 
they had understood the reality of Christ, they would 
have known that the body of His humanity was a 
cloud that hid His Divinity.  The world only saw His 
human form, and therefore wondered how He could 
have `come down from Heaven'.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah said, `Even as the clouds hide the sun 
and the sky from our gaze, even so did the humanity 
of Christ hide from men His real Divine character'.  
     I hope that you will turn with unclouded eyes towards 
the Sun of Truth, beholding not the things of 
earth, lest your hearts be attracted to the worthless and 
passing pleasures of the world; let that Sun give you 
of His strength, then will not the clouds of prejudice 
veil His illumination from your eyes!  Then will the 
Sun be without clouds for you.  
 
+P45 
     Breathe the air of purity.  May you each and all 
share in the Divine Bounties of the Kingdom of 
Heaven.  May the world be for you no obstacle hiding 
the truth from your sight, as the human body of 
Christ hid His Divinity from the people of His day.  
May you receive the clear vision of the Holy Spirit, 
so that your hearts may be illumined and able to 
recognize the Sun of Truth shining through all material 
clouds, His splendour flooding the universe.  
     Let not the things of the body obscure the celestial 
light of the spirit, so that, by the Divine Bounty, you 
may enter with the children of God into His Eternal 
Kingdom.  
     This is my prayer for you all.  
 
 
                    RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES 
 
                                       October 27th 
     The basis of the teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the Unity 
of Mankind, and his greatest desire was that love 
and goodwill should live in the heart of men.  
     As He exhorted the people to do away with strife 
and discord, so I wish to explain to you the principal 
reason of the unrest among nations.  The chief cause 
is the misrepresentation of religion by the religious 
leaders and teachers.  They teach their followers to 
believe that their own form of religion is the only one 
pleasing to God, and that followers of any other persuasion 
are condemned by the All-Loving Father and 
deprived of His Mercy and Grace.  Hence arise among 
 
+P46 
the peoples, disapproval, contempt, disputes and hatred.  
If these religious prejudices could be swept away, the 
nations would soon enjoy peace and concord.  
     I was once at Tiberias where the Jews have a Temple.  
I was staying in a house just opposite the Temple, and 
there I saw and heard a Rabbi speaking to his congregation 
of Jews, and he spoke thus:  
     `O Jews, you are in truth the people of God!  All 
other races and religions are of the devil.  God has 
created you the descendants of Abraham, and He has 
showered His blessings upon you.  Unto you God sent 
Moses, Jacob and Joseph, and many other great prophets.  
These prophets, one and all, were of your race.  
     `It was for you that God broke the power of Pharaoh 
and caused the Red Sea to dry up; to you also He sent 
manna from above to be your food, and out of the 
stony rock did He give you water to quench your 
thirst.  You are indeed the chosen people of God, you 
are above all the races of the earth!  Therefore, all other 
races are abhorrent to God, and condemned by Him.  
In truth you will govern and subdue the world, and 
all men shall become your slaves.  
     `Do not profane yourselves by consorting with 
people who are not of your own religion, make not 
friends of such men.'  
     When the Rabbi had finished his eloquent discourse, 
his hearers were filled with joy and satisfaction.  It 
is impossible to describe to you their happiness!  
     Alas!  It is misguided ones like these who are the 
cause of division and hatred upon earth.  Today there 
are millions of people who still worship idols, and the 
 
+P47 
great religions of the world are at war among themselves.  
For 1,300 years, Christians and Mussulmans 
have been quarrelling, when with very little effort their 
differences and disputes could be overcome and peace 
and harmony could exist between them and the world 
could be at rest!  
     In the &amp;Qur'an we read that &amp;Muhammad spoke to his 
followers, saying:  
     `Why do you not believe in Christ, and in the 
Gospel?  Why will you not accept Moses and the 
Prophets, for surely the Bible is the Book of God?  In 
truth, Moses was a sublime Prophet, and Jesus was 
filled with the Holy Spirit.  He came to the world 
through the Power of God, born of the Holy Spirit and 
of the blessed Virgin Mary.  Mary, His mother, was 
a saint from Heaven.  She passed her days in the Temple 
at prayer and food was sent to her from above.  Her 
father, Zacharias, came to her and asked her from 
whence the food came, and Mary made answer, "From 
on high."  Surely God made Mary to be exalted above 
all other women.'  
     This is what &amp;Muhammad taught His people concerning 
Jesus and Moses, and He reproached them for their 
lack of faith in these great Teachers, and taught them 
the lessons of truth and tolerance.  &amp;Muhammad was 
sent from God to work among a people as savage and 
uncivilized as the wild beasts.  They were quite devoid 
of understanding, nor had they any feelings of love, 
sympathy and pity.  Women were so degraded and 
despised that a man could bury his daughter alive, and 
he had as many wives to be his slaves as he chose.  
 
+P48 
     Among these half animal people &amp;Muhammad was 
sent with His divine Message.  He taught the people 
that idol worship was wrong, but that they should 
reverence Christ, Moses and the Prophets.  Under His 
influence they became a more enlightened and civilized 
people and arose from the degraded state in which He 
found them.  Was not this a good work, and worthy of 
all praise, respect and love?  
     Look at the Gospel of the Lord Christ and see how 
glorious it is!  Yet even today men fail to understand 
its priceless beauty, and misinterpret its words of 
wisdom.  
     Christ forbade war!  When the disciple Peter, thinking 
to defend his Lord, cut off the ear of the servant of the 
High Priest, Christ said to him:  `Put up thy sword 
into the sheath'.+F1  Yet, in spite of the direct command 
of the Lord they profess to serve--men still dispute, 
make war, and kill one another, and His counsels and 
teaching seem quite forgotten.  
     But do not therefore attribute to the Masters and 
Prophets the evil deeds of their followers.  If the priests, 
teachers and people, lead lives which are contrary to 
the religion they profess to follow, is that the fault of 
Christ or the other Teachers?  
     The people of &amp;Islam were taught to realize how 
Jesus came from God and was born of the Spirit, and 
that He must be glorified of all men.  Moses was a 
prophet of God, and revealed in His day and for the 
people to whom He was sent, the Book of God.  
     &amp;Muhammad recognized the sublime grandeur of 
 
+F1 St John xviii, 11.  
 
+P49 
Christ and the greatness of Moses and the prophets.  If 
only the whole world would acknowledge the greatness 
of &amp;Muhammad and all the Heaven-sent Teachers, 
strife and discord would soon vanish from the face of 
the earth, and God's Kingdom would come among 
men.  
     The people of &amp;Islam who glorify Christ are not 
humiliated by so doing.  
     Christ was the Prophet of the Christians, Moses of 
the Jews--why should not the followers of each prophet 
recognize and honour the other prophets also?  
If men could only learn the lesson of mutual tolerance, 
understanding, and brotherly love, the unity of the 
world would soon be an established fact.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah spent His life teaching this lesson of Love 
and Unity.  Let us then put away from us all prejudice 
and intolerance, and strive with all our hearts and souls 
to bring about understanding and unity between 
Christians and Mussulmans.  
 
 
                 THE BENEFITS OF GOD TO MAN 
 
                                 4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, 
                                             October 27th 
     God alone ordereth all things and is all-powerful.  
Why then does He send trials to His servants?  
     The trials of man are of two kinds.  (a) The consequences 
of his own actions.  If a man eats too much, 
he ruins his digestion; if he takes poison he becomes 
 
+P50 
ill or dies.  If a person gambles he will lose his money; 
if he drinks too much he will lose his equilibrium.  All 
these sufferings are caused by the man himself, it is 
quite clear therefore that certain sorrows are the result 
of our own deeds.  
     (b) Other sufferings there are, which come upon the 
Faithful of God.  Consider the great sorrows endured 
by Christ and by His apostles!  
     Those who suffer most, attain to the greatest perfection.  
     Those who declare a wish to suffer much for Christ's 
sake must prove their sincerity; those who proclaim 
their longing to make great sacrifices can only prove 
their truth by their deeds.  Job proved the fidelity of 
his love for God by being faithful through his great 
adversity, as well as during the prosperity of his life.  
The apostles of Christ who steadfastly bore all their 
trials and sufferings--did they not prove their faithfulness?  
Was not their endurance the best proof?  
     These griefs are now ended.  
     Caiaphas lived a comfortable and happy life while 
Peter's life was full of sorrow and trial; which of these 
two is the more enviable?  Assuredly we should choose 
the present state of Peter, for he possesses immortal 
life whilst Caiaphas has won eternal shame.  The trials 
of Peter tested his fidelity.  Tests are benefits from God, 
for which we should thank Him.  Grief and sorrow do 
not come to us by chance, they are sent to us by the 
Divine Mercy for our own perfecting.  
     While a man is happy he may forget his God; but 
when grief comes and sorrows overwhelm him, then 
 
+P51 
will he remember his Father who is in Heaven, and 
who is able to deliver him from his humiliations.  
     Men who suffer not, attain no perfection.  The plant 
most pruned by the gardeners is that one which, 
when the summer comes, will have the most beautiful 
blossoms and the most abundant fruit.  
     The labourer cuts up the earth with his plough, and 
from that earth comes the rich and plentiful harvest.  
The more a man is chastened, the greater is the harvest 
of spiritual virtues shown forth by him.  A soldier is 
no good General until he has been in the front of the 
fiercest battle and has received the deepest wounds.  
     The prayer of the prophets of God has always been, 
and still is:  Oh God, I long to lay down my life in the 
path to Thee!  I desire to shed my blood for Thee, and 
to make the supreme sacrifice.  
 
 
               BEAUTY AND HARMONY IN DIVERSITY 
 
                                          October 28th 
     The Creator of all is One God.  
     From this same God all creation sprang into existence, 
and He is the one goal, towards which everything 
in nature yearns.  This conception was embodied in the 
words of Christ, when He said, `I am the Alpha and the 
Omega, the beginning and the end'.  Man is the sum 
of Creation, and the Perfect Man is the expression of 
the complete thought of the Creator--the Word of 
God.  
     Consider the world of created beings, how varied 
 
+P52 
and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin.  
All the differences that appear are those of outward 
form and colour.  This diversity of type is apparent 
throughout the whole of nature.  
     Behold a beautiful garden full of flowers, shrubs, and 
trees.  Each flower has a different charm, a peculiar 
beauty, its own delicious perfume and beautiful colour.  
The trees too, how varied are they in size, in growth, 
in foliage--and what different fruits they bear!  Yet all 
these flowers, shrubs and trees spring from the self-same 
earth, the same sun shines upon them and the 
same clouds give them rain.  
     So it is with humanity.  It is made up of many races, 
and its peoples are of different colour, white, black, 
yellow, brown and red--but they all come from the 
same God, and all are servants to Him.  This diversity 
among the children of men has unhappily not the same 
effect as it has among the vegetable creation, where the 
spirit shown is more harmonious.  Among men exists 
the diversity of animosity, and it is this that causes 
war and hatred among the different nations of the 
world.  
     Differences which are only those of blood also cause 
them to destroy and kill one another.  Alas!  that this 
should still be so.  Let us look rather at the beauty 
in diversity, the beauty of harmony, and learn a lesson 
from the vegetable creation.  If you beheld a garden in 
which all the plants were the same as to form, colour 
and perfume, it would not seem beautiful to you at all, 
but, rather, monotonous and dull.  The garden which 
is pleasing to the eye and which makes the heart glad, 
 
+P53 
is the garden in which are growing side by side flowers 
of every hue, form and perfume, and the joyous contrast 
of colour is what makes for charm and beauty.  So 
is it with trees.  An orchard full of fruit trees is a delight; 
so is a plantation planted with many species of 
shrubs.  It is just the diversity and variety that constitutes 
its charm; each flower, each tree, each fruit, beside 
being beautiful in itself, brings out by contrast the 
qualities of the others, and shows to advantage the 
special loveliness of each and all.  
     Thus should it be among the children of men!  The 
diversity in the human family should be the cause of 
love and harmony, as it is in music where many 
different notes blend together in the making of a perfect 
chord.  If you meet those of different race and colour 
from yourself, do not mistrust them and withdraw 
yourself into your shell of conventionality, but rather 
be glad and show them kindness.  Think of them as 
different coloured roses growing in the beautiful 
garden of humanity, and rejoice to be among them.  
     Likewise, when you meet those whose opinions differ 
from your own, do not turn away your face from 
them.  All are seeking truth, and there are many roads 
leading thereto.  Truth has many aspects, but it remains 
always and forever one.  
     Do not allow difference of opinion, or diversity of 
thought to separate you from your fellow-men, or to 
be the cause of dispute, hatred and strife in your 
hearts.  
     Rather, search diligently for the truth and make all 
men your friends.  
 
+P54 
     Every edifice is made of many different stones, yet 
each depends on the other to such an extent that if 
one were displaced the whole building would suffer; 
if one is faulty the structure is imperfect.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah has drawn the circle of unity, He has 
made a design for the uniting of all the peoples, and 
for the gathering of them all under the shelter of the 
tent of universal unity.  This is the work of the Divine 
Bounty, and we must all strive with heart and soul 
until we have the reality of unity in our midst, and 
as we work, so will strength be given unto us.  Leave 
all thought of self, and strive only to be obedient and 
submissive to the Will of God.  In this way only shall 
we become citizens of the Kingdom of God, and attain 
unto life everlasting.  
 
 
             THE TRUE MEANING OF THE PROPHECIES 
               CONCERNING THE COMING OF CHRIST 
 
                                             October 30th 
     In the Bible there are prophecies of the coming of 
Christ.  The Jews still await the coming of the 
Messiah, and pray to God day and night to hasten His 
advent.  
     When Christ came they denounced and slew Him, 
saying:  `This is not the One for whom we wait.  
Behold when the Messiah shall come, signs and wonders 
shall testify that He is in truth the Christ.  We know 
the signs and conditions, and they have not appeared.  
The Messiah will arise out of an unknown city.  He 
 
+P55 
shall sit upon the throne of David, and behold, He shall 
come with a sword of steel, and with a sceptre of iron 
shall He rule!  He shall fulfil the law of the Prophets, 
He shall conquer the East and the West, and shall 
glorify His chosen people the Jews.  He shall bring 
with Him a reign of peace, during which even the 
animals shall cease to be at enmity with man.  For 
behold the wolf and the lamb shall drink from the 
same spring, and the lion and the doe shall lie down in 
the same pasture, the serpent and the mouse shall share 
the same nest, and all God's creatures shall be at rest'.  
     According to the Jews, Jesus the Christ fulfilled none 
of these conditions, for their eyes were holden and 
they could not see.  
     He came from Nazareth, no unknown place.  He 
carried no sword in His hand, nor even a stick.  He 
did not sit upon the Throne of David, He was a poor 
man.  He reformed the Law of Moses, and broke the 
Sabbath Day.  He did not conquer the East and the 
West, but was Himself subject to the Roman Law.  He 
did not exalt the Jews, but taught equality and brotherhood, 
and rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees.  He 
brought in no reign of peace, for during His lifetime 
injustice and cruelty reached such a height that even 
He Himself fell a victim to it, and died a shameful 
death upon the cross.  
     Thus the Jews thought and spoke, for they did not 
understand the Scriptures nor the glorious truths that 
were contained in them.  The letter they knew by 
heart, but of the life-giving spirit they understood not 
a word.  
 
+P56 
     Hearken, and I will show you the meaning thereof.  
Although He came from Nazareth, which was a known 
place, He also came from Heaven.  His body was born 
of Mary, but His Spirit came from Heaven.  The sword 
He carried was the sword of His tongue, with which 
He divided the good from the evil, the true from the 
false, the faithful from the unfaithful, and the light 
from the darkness.  His Word was indeed a sharp sword!  
The Throne upon which He sat is the Eternal Throne 
from which Christ reigns for ever, a heavenly throne, 
not an earthly one, for the things of earth pass away 
but heavenly things pass not away.  He re-interpreted 
and completed the Law of Moses and fulfilled the Law 
of the Prophets.  His word conquered the East and the 
West.  His Kingdom is everlasting.  He exalted those 
Jews who recognized Him.  They were men and 
women of humble birth, but contact with Him made 
them great and gave them everlasting dignity.  The 
animals who were to live with one another signified 
the different sects and races, who, once having been at 
war, were now to dwell in love and charity, drinking 
together the water of life from Christ the Eternal 
Spring.  
     Thus, all the spiritual prophecies concerning the 
coming of Christ were fulfilled, but the Jews shut their 
eyes that they should not see, and their ears that they 
should not hear, and the Divine Reality of Christ 
passed through their midst unheard, unloved and unrecognized.  
     It is easy to read the Holy Scriptures, but it is only 
with a clean heart and a pure mind that one may understand 
 
+P57 
their true meaning.  Let us ask God's help to 
enable us to understand the Holy Books.  Let us pray 
for eyes to see and ears to hear, and for hearts that 
long for peace.  
     God's eternal Mercy is immeasurable.  He has always 
chosen certain souls upon whom He has shed the 
Divine Bounty of His heart, whose minds He has illumined 
with celestial light, to whom He has revealed 
the sacred mysteries, and kept clear before their sight 
the Mirror of Truth.  These are the disciples of God, 
and His goodness has no bounds.  You who are servants 
of the Most High may be disciples also.  The treasuries 
of God are limitless.  
     The Spirit breathing through the Holy Scriptures is 
food for all who hunger.  God Who has given the 
revelation to His Prophets will surely give of His 
abundance daily bread to all those who ask Him 
faithfully.  
 
 
           THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE INTERMEDIARY POWER 
                     BETWEEN GOD AND MAN 
 
                                  4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, 
                                             October 31st 
     The Divine Reality is Unthinkable, Limitless, 
Eternal, Immortal and Invisible.  
     The world of creation is bound by natural law, 
finite and mortal.  
     The Infinite Reality cannot be said to ascend or 
descend.  It is beyond the understanding of man, and 
 
+P58 
cannot be described in terms which apply to the phenomenal 
sphere of the created world.  
     Man, then, is in extreme need of the only Power by 
which he is able to receive help from the Divine 
Reality, that Power alone bringing him into contact 
with the Source of all life.  
     An intermediary is needed to bring two extremes 
into relation with each other.  Riches and poverty, 
plenty and need:  without an intermediary power there 
could be no relation between these pairs of opposites.  
     So we can say there must be a Mediator between 
God and Man, and this is none other than the Holy 
Spirit, which brings the created earth into relation 
with the `Unthinkable One', the Divine Reality.  
     The Divine Reality may be likened to the sun and 
the Holy Spirit to the rays of the sun.  As the rays of 
the sun bring the light and warmth of the sun to the 
earth, giving life to all created beings, so do the `Manifestations'+F1 
bring the power of the Holy Spirit from 
the Divine Sun of Reality to give light and life to the 
souls of men.  
     Behold, there is an intermediary necessary between 
the sun and the earth; the sun does not descend to the 
earth, neither does the earth ascend to the sun.  This 
contact is made by the rays of the sun which bring 
light and warmth and heat.  
     The Holy Spirit is the Light from the Sun of Truth 
bringing, by its infinite power, life and illumination to 
all mankind, flooding all souls with Divine Radiance, 
conveying the blessings of God's Mercy to the whole 
 
+F1 Manifestations of God.  
 
+P59 
world.  The earth, without the medium of the warmth 
and light of the rays of the sun, could receive no 
benefits from the sun.  
     Likewise the Holy Spirit is the very cause of the 
life of man; without the Holy Spirit he would have no 
intellect, he would be unable to acquire his scientific 
knowledge by which his great influence over the rest 
of creation is gained.  The illumination of the Holy 
Spirit gives to man the power of thought, and enables 
him to make discoveries by which he bends the laws 
of nature to his will.  
     The Holy Spirit it is which, through the mediation 
of the Prophets of God, teaches spiritual virtues to man 
and enables him to attain Eternal Life.  
     All these blessings are brought to man by the Holy 
Spirit; therefore we can understand that the Holy 
Spirit is the Intermediary between the Creator and the 
created.  The light and heat of the sun cause the earth 
to be fruitful, and create life in all things that grow; 
and the Holy Spirit quickens the souls of men.  
     The two great apostles, St Peter and St John the 
Evangelist, were once simple, humble workmen, 
toiling for their daily bread.  By the Power of the Holy 
Spirit their souls were illumined, and they received the 
eternal blessings of the Lord Christ.  
 
+P60 
                   THE TWO NATURES IN MAN 
 
                                         November 1st 
     Today is a day of rejoicing in Paris!  They are 
celebrating the Festival of `All Saints'.  Why do 
you think that these people were called `Saints'?  The 
word has a very real meaning.  A saint is one who leads 
a life of purity, one who has freed himself from all 
human weaknesses and imperfections.  
     In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher 
nature and his material or lower nature.  In one he 
approaches God, in the other he lives for the world 
alone.  Signs of both these natures are to be found in 
men.  In his material aspect he expresses untruth, 
cruelty and injustice; all these are the outcome of his 
lower nature.  The attributes of his Divine nature are 
shown forth in love, mercy, kindness, truth and justice, 
one and all being expressions of his higher nature.  
Every good habit, every noble quality belongs to man's 
spiritual nature, whereas all his imperfections and sinful 
actions are born of his material nature.  If a man's 
Divine nature dominates his human nature, we have a 
saint.  
     Man has the power both to do good and to do evil; 
if his power for good predominates and his inclinations 
to do wrong are conquered, then man in truth may be 
called a saint.  But if, on the contrary, he rejects the 
things of God and allows his evil passions to conquer 
him, then he is no better than a mere animal.  
     Saints are men who have freed themselves from the 
 
+P61 
world of matter and who have overcome sin.  They 
live in the world but are not of it, their thoughts being 
continually in the world of the spirit.  Their lives are 
spent in holiness, and their deeds show forth love, 
justice and godliness.  They are illumined from on 
high; they are as bright and shining lamps in the dark 
places of the earth.  These are the saints of God.  The 
apostles, who were the disciples of Jesus Christ, were 
just as other men are; they, like their fellows, were 
attracted by the things of the world, and each thought 
only of his own advantage.  They knew little of justice, 
nor were the Divine perfections found in their midst.  
But when they followed Christ and believed in Him, 
their ignorance gave place to understanding, cruelty 
was changed to justice, falsehood to truth, darkness 
into light.  They had been worldly, they became 
spiritual and divine.  They had been children of darkness, 
they became sons of God, they became saints!  
Strive therefore to follow in their steps, leaving all 
worldly things behind, and striving to attain to the 
Spiritual Kingdom.  
     Pray to God that He may strengthen you in divine 
virtue, so that you may be as angels in the world, and 
beacons of light to disclose the mysteries of the Kingdom 
to those with understanding hearts.  
     God sent His Prophets into the world to teach and 
enlighten man, to explain to him the mystery of the 
Power of the Holy Spirit, to enable him to reflect the 
light, and so in his turn, to be the source of guidance 
to others.  The Heavenly Books, the Bible, the &amp;Qur'an, 
and the other Holy Writings have been given by God 
 
+P62 
as guides into the paths of Divine virtue, love, justice 
and peace.  
     Therefore I say unto you that ye should strive to 
follow the counsels of these Blessed Books, and so order 
your lives that ye may, following the examples set 
before you, become yourselves the saints of the Most 
High!  
 
 
               MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL PROGRESS 
 
                                               November 2nd 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     How beautiful the weather is today, the sky is 
clear, the sun shines, and the heart of man is made 
glad thereby!  
     Such bright and beautiful weather gives new life and 
strength to man, and if he has been sick, he feels once 
more in his heart the joyous hope of health renewed.  
All these gifts of nature concern the physical side of 
man, for it is only his body that can receive material 
benefits.  
     If a man is successful in his business, art, or profession 
he is thereby enabled to increase his physical 
wellbeing and to give his body the amount of ease and 
comfort in which it delights.  All around us today we 
see how man surrounds himself with every modern 
convenience and luxury, and denies nothing to the 
physical and material side of his nature.  But, take heed, 
lest in thinking too earnestly of the things of the body 
you forget the things of the soul:  for material advantages 
 
+P63 
do not elevate the spirit of a man.  Perfection in 
worldly things is a joy to the body of a man but in no 
wise does it glorify his soul.  
     It may be that a man who has every material benefit, 
and who lives surrounded by all the greatest comfort 
modern civilization can give him, is denied the all important 
gift of the Holy Spirit.  
     It is indeed a good and praiseworthy thing to progress 
materially, but in so doing, let us not neglect the more 
important spiritual progress, and close our eyes to the 
Divine light shining in our midst.  
     Only by improving spiritually as well as materially 
can we make any real progress, and become perfect 
beings.  It was in order to bring this spiritual life and 
light into the world that all the great Teachers have 
appeared.  They came so that the Sun of Truth might 
be manifested, and shine in the hearts of men, and that 
through its wondrous power men might attain unto 
Everlasting Light.  
     When the Lord Christ came He spread the light of 
the Holy Spirit on all around Him, and His disciples 
and all who received His illumination became enlightened, 
spiritual beings.  
     It was to manifest this light that &amp;Baha'u'llah was 
born, and came into the world.  He taught Eternal 
Truth to men, and shed the rays of Divine Light in all 
lands.  
     Alas!  behold how man disregards this Light.  He 
still goes on his way of darkness, and disunity, and 
quarrels and fierce war are still rife.  
     He uses material progress to gratify his lust for war, 
 
+P64 
and he makes destructive implements and appliances 
to destroy his brother man.  
     But let us rather exert ourselves for the attainment of 
spiritual advantages, for this is the only way of true 
progress, that which cometh from God and is alone 
Godly.  
     I pray for you one and all that you may receive the 
Bounties of the Holy Spirit; so will you become in 
truth enlightened, and progress ever onward and upward 
to the Kingdom of God.  Then shall your hearts 
be prepared to receive the glad tidings, your eyes shall 
be opened and you will see the Glory of God; your 
ears shall be unstopped and you will hear the call of 
the Kingdom, and with tongue made eloquent shall 
you call men to the realization of the Divine Power 
and Love of God!  
 
 
           THE EVOLUTION OF MATTER AND DEVELOPMENT 
                         OF THE SOUL 
 
                                               November 3rd 
     Paris is becoming very cold, so cold that I shall 
soon be obliged to go away, but the warmth of 
your love still keeps me here.  God willing, I hope to 
stay among you yet a little while; bodily cold and heat 
cannot affect the spirit, for it is warmed by the fire of 
the Love of God.  When we understand this, we begin 
to understand something of our life in the world to 
come.  
 
+P65 
     God, in His Bounty, has given us a foretaste here, 
has given us certain proofs of the difference that exists 
between body, soul and spirit.  
     We see that cold, heat, suffering, etc, only concern 
the body, they do not touch the spirit.  
     How often do we see a man, poor, sick, miserably 
clad, and with no means of support, yet spiritually 
strong.  Whatever his body has to suffer, his spirit is 
free and well!  Again, how often do we see a rich man, 
physically strong and healthy, but with a soul sick unto 
death.  
     It is quite apparent to the seeing mind that a man's 
spirit is something very different from his physical 
body.  
     The spirit is changeless, indestructible.  The progress 
and development of the soul, the joy and sorrow of the 
soul, are independent of the physical body.  
     If we are caused joy or pain by a friend, if a love 
prove true or false, it is the soul that is affected.  If our 
dear ones are far from us--it is the soul that grieves, 
and the grief or trouble of the soul may react on the 
body.  
     Thus, when the spirit is fed with holy virtues, then is 
the body joyous; if the soul falls into sin, the body is in 
torment!  
     When we find truth, constancy, fidelity, and love, 
we are happy; but if we meet with lying, faithlessness, 
and deceit, we are miserable.  
     These are all things pertaining to the soul, and are 
not bodily ills.  Thus, it is apparent that the soul, even 
as the body, has its own individuality.  But if the body 
 
+P66 
undergoes a change, the spirit need not be touched.  
When you break a glass on which the sun shines, the 
glass is broken, but the sun still shines!  If a cage containing 
a bird is destroyed, the bird is unharmed!  If a 
lamp is broken, the flame can still burn bright!  
     The same thing applies to the spirit of man.  Though 
death destroy his body, it has no power over his 
spirit--this is eternal, everlasting, both birthless and 
deathless.  
     As to the soul of man after death, it remains in the 
degree of purity to which it has evolved during life in 
the physical body, and after it is freed from the body it 
remains plunged in the ocean of God's Mercy.  
     From the moment the soul leaves the body and 
arrives in the Heavenly World, its evolution is spiritual, 
and that evolution is:  The approaching unto God.  
     In the physical creation, evolution is from one 
degree of perfection to another.  The mineral passes 
with its mineral perfections to the vegetable; the 
vegetable, with its perfections, passes to the animal 
world, and so on to that of humanity.  This world is 
full of seeming contradictions; in each of these kingdoms 
(mineral, vegetable and animal) life exists in its 
degree; though when compared to the life in a man, 
the earth appears to be dead, yet she, too, lives and has 
a life of her own.  In this world things live and die, and 
live again in other forms of life, but in the world of 
the spirit it is quite otherwise.  
     The soul does not evolve from degree to degree as a 
law--it only evolves nearer to God, by the Mercy and 
Bounty of God.  
 
+P67 
     It is my earnest prayer that we may all be in the 
Kingdom of God, and near Him.  
 
 
               THE SPIRITUAL MEETINGS IN PARIS 
 
                                               November 4th 
     All over Europe today one hears of meetings and 
assemblies, and societies of all kinds are formed.  
There are those interested in commerce, science, and 
politics, and many others.  All these are for material 
service, their desire being for the progress and enlightenment 
of the world of matter.  But rarely does a breath 
from the spirit world breathe upon them.  They seem 
unconscious of the Divine Voice, careless concerning 
the things of God.  But this meeting in Paris is a truly 
spiritual one.  The Divine Breath is poured forth in 
your midst, the light of the Kingdom is shining in all 
hearts.  The Divine love of God is a power among you, 
and with souls athirst, ye receive the glad tidings of 
great joy.  
     You are all met here with one accord, heart drawn 
to heart, souls overflowing with Divine love, working 
and longing for the unity of the world.  
     Verily this assembly is a spiritual one!  It is like unto 
a beautiful perfumed garden!  On it the Heavenly Sun 
sheds the golden rays, and the warmth thereof penetrates 
and gladdens each waiting heart.  The love of 
Christ, which passeth all knowledge, is among you, 
the Holy Spirit is your help.  
     Day by day this meeting will grow and become 
 
+P68 
more powerful until gradually its spirit will conquer 
the whole world!  
     Try with all your hearts to be willing channels for 
God's Bounty.  For I say unto you that He has chosen 
you to be His messengers of love throughout the 
world, to be His bearers of spiritual gifts to man, to 
be the means of spreading unity and concord on the 
earth.  Thank God with all your hearts that such a 
privilege has been given unto you.  For a life devoted 
to praise is not too long in which to thank God for 
such a favour.  
     Lift up your hearts above the present and look with 
eyes of faith into the future!  Today the seed is sown, 
the grain falls upon the earth, but behold the day will 
come when it shall rise a glorious tree and the branches 
thereof shall be laden with fruit.  Rejoice and be glad 
that this day has dawned, try to realize its power, for 
it is indeed wonderful!  God has crowned you with 
honour and in your hearts has He set a radiant star; 
verily the light thereof shall brighten the whole world!  
 
 
                   THE TWO KINDS OF LIGHT 
 
                                             November 5th 
     Today the weather is gloomy and dull!  In the 
East there is continual sunshine, the stars are never 
veiled, and there are very few clouds.  Light always 
rises in the East and sends forth its radiance into the 
West.  
     There are two kinds of light.  There is the visible 
 
+P69 
light of the sun, by whose aid we can discern the 
beauties of the world around us--without this we could 
see nothing.  
     Nevertheless, though it is the function of this light to 
make things visible to us, it cannot give us the power 
to see them or to understand what their various charms 
may be, for this light has no intelligence, no consciousness.  
It is the light of the intellect which gives us knowledge 
and understanding, and without this light the 
physical eyes would be useless.  
     This light of the intellect is the highest light that 
exists, for it is born of the Light Divine.  
     The light of the intellect enables us to understand 
and realize all that exists, but it is only the Divine 
Light that can give us sight for the invisible things, and 
which enables us to see truths that will only be visible 
to the world thousands of years hence.  
     It was the Divine Light which enabled the prophets 
to see two thousand years in advance what was going 
to take place and today we see the realization of their 
vision.  Thus it is this Light which we must strive to 
seek, for it is greater than any other.  
     It was by this Light that Moses was enabled to see 
and comprehend the Divine Appearance, and to hear 
the Heavenly Voice which spoke to him from the 
Burning Bush.+F1  
     It is of this Light &amp;Muhammad is speaking when he 
says, `&amp;Allah is the light of the Heavens, and of the 
Earth'.  
     Seek with all your hearts this Heavenly Light, so 
 
+F1 Exodus iii, 2.  
 
+P70 
that you may be enabled to understand the realities, 
that you may know the secret things of God, that the 
hidden ways may be made plain before your eyes.  
     This light may be likened unto a mirror, and as a 
mirror reflects all that is before it, so this Light shows 
to the eyes of our spirits all that exists in God's 
Kingdom and causes the realities of things to be made 
visible.  By the help of this effulgent Light all the 
spiritual interpretation of the Holy Writings has been 
made plain, the hidden things of God's Universe have 
become manifest, and we have been enabled to comprehend 
the Divine purposes for man.  
     I pray that God in His mercy may illumine your 
hearts and souls with His glorious Light, then shall 
each one of you shine as a radiant star in the dark places 
of the world.  
 
 
              SPIRITUAL ASPIRATION IN THE WEST 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     You are very welcome!  From Eastern lands I have 
come to the West to sojourn awhile among you.  In 
the East it is often said that the people of the West 
are without spirituality, but I have not found it thus.  
Thank God, I see and feel that there is much spiritual 
aspiration among the Western peoples, and that in 
some cases their spiritual perception is even keener than 
among their Eastern brothers.  If the teaching given in 
the East had been conscientiously spread in the West 
the world today would be a more enlightened place.  
 
+P71 
     Although in the past all the great Spiritual Teachers 
have arisen in the East, there are still many men there 
who are quite devoid of spirituality.  With regard to 
the things of the spirit they are as lifeless as a stone; 
nor do they wish to be otherwise, for they consider 
that man is only a higher form of animal and that the 
things of God concern him not.  
     But man's ambition should soar above this--he 
should ever look higher than himself, ever upward and 
onward, until through the Mercy of God he may come 
to the Kingdom of Heaven.  Again, there are men 
whose eyes are only open to physical progress and to 
the evolution in the world of matter.  These men prefer 
to study the resemblance between their own physical 
body and that of the ape, rather than to contemplate 
the glorious affiliation between their spirit and that of 
God.  This is indeed strange, for it is only physically 
that man resembles the lower creation, with regard to 
his intellect he is totally unlike it.  
     Man is always progressing.  His circle of knowledge 
is ever widening, and his mental activity flows through 
many and varied channels.  Look what man has accomplished 
in the field of science, consider his many 
discoveries and countless inventions and his profound 
understanding of natural law.  
     In the world of art it is just the same, and this 
wonderful development of man's faculties becomes 
more and more rapid as time goes on.  If the discoveries, 
inventions and material accomplishments of the last 
fifteen hundred years could be put together, you would 
see that there has been greater advancement during the 
 
+P72 
last hundred years than in the previous fourteen centuries.  
For the rapidity with which man is progressing 
increases century by century.  
     The power of the intellect is one of God's greatest 
gifts to men, it is the power that makes him a higher 
creature than the animal.  For whereas, century by 
century and age by age man's intelligence grows and 
becomes keener, that of the animal remains the same.  
They are no more intelligent today then they were a 
thousand years ago!  Is there a greater proof than this 
needed to show man's dissimilarity to the animal 
creation?  It is surely as clear as day.  
     As for the spiritual perfections they are man's birthright 
and belong to him alone of all creation.  Man 
is, in reality, a spiritual being, and only when he lives 
in the spirit is he truly happy.  This spiritual longing 
and perception belongs to all men alike, and it is my 
firm conviction that the Western people possess great 
spiritual aspiration.  
     It is my fervent prayer that the star of the East will 
shed its brilliant rays on the Western world, and that 
the people of the West may arise in strength, earnestness, 
and courage, to help their brethren in the East.  
 
 
             LECTURE GIVEN AT A STUDIO IN PARIS 
 
                                              November 6th 
     This is in truth a &amp;Baha'i house.  Every time such a 
house or meeting place is founded it becomes one 
of the greatest aids to the general development of the 
 
+P73 
town and country to which it belongs.  It encourages 
the growth of learning and science and is known for 
its intense spirituality and for the love it spreads among 
the peoples.  
     The foundation of such a meeting-place is always 
followed by the greatest prosperity.  The first &amp;Baha'i 
Assembly that existed in &amp;Tihran was singularly 
blessed!  In one year it had grown so rapidly that its 
members had increased to nine times their original 
number.  Today, in far-away Persia, there are many 
such assemblies where the friends of God meet together 
in the fulness of joy, love and unity.  They teach 
the Cause of God, educate the ignorant, and draw 
heart to heart in brotherly kindness.  It is they who help 
the poor and needy and give to them their daily bread.  
They love and care for the sick and are messengers of 
hope and consolation to the desolate and oppressed.  
     Oh, ye in Paris, strive that your assemblies may be 
like unto this, and may bear even greater fruits!  
     Oh, friends of God!  If ye will trust in the Word of 
God and be strong; if ye will follow the precepts of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah to tend the sick, raise the fallen, care for the 
poor and needy, give shelter to the destitute, protect 
the oppressed, comfort the sorrowful and love the 
world of humanity with all your hearts, then I say 
unto you that ere long this meeting-place will see a 
wonderful harvest.  Day by day each member will 
advance and become more and more spiritual.  But ye 
must have a firm foundation and your aims and ambitions 
must be clearly understood by each member.  
They shall be as follows:  
 
+P74 
1.  To show compassion and goodwill to all mankind.  
2.  To render service to humanity.  
3.  To endeavour to guide and enlighten those in 
    darkness.  
4.  To be kind to everyone, and show forth affection 
    to every living soul.  
5.  To be humble in your attitude towards God, 
    to be constant in prayer to Him, so as to grow 
    daily nearer to God.  
6.  To be so faithful and sincere in all your actions 
    that every member may be known as embodying 
    the qualities of honesty, love, faith, kindness, generosity, 
    and courage.  To be detached from all that 
    is not God, attracted by the Heavenly Breath--a 
    divine soul; so that the world may know that a 
    &amp;Baha'i is a perfect being.  
 
    Strive to attain this at these meetings.  Then, indeed 
and in truth will ye, the friends of God, come together 
with great joy!  Render help one to the other, become 
as one man, having reached perfect unity.  
     I pray to God that daily ye may advance in spirituality, 
that God's love may be more and more manifested 
in you, that the thoughts of your hearts may be purified, 
and that your faces may be ever turned towards 
Him.  May you one and all approach to the threshold of 
unity, and enter into the Kingdom.  May each of you 
be like unto a flaming torch, lighted and burning 
bright with the fire of the Love of God.  
 
+P75 
                         &amp;BAHA'U'LLAH 
 
                                         November 7th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     I will speak to you today of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In the 
third year after the &amp;Bab had declared his Mission, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, being accused by fanatical &amp;Mullas of 
believing in the new doctrine, was arrested and thrown 
into prison.  The next day, however, several ministers 
of the Government and other influential men caused 
him to be set free.  Later on he was again arrested, and 
the priests condemned him to death!  The Governor 
hesitated to have this sentence carried out for fear of a 
revolution.  The priests met together in the Mosque, 
before which was the place of execution.  All the people 
of the town gathered in crowds outside the Mosque.  
The carpenters brought their saws and hammers, the 
butchers came with their knives, the bricklayers and 
builders shouldered their spades, all these men, incited 
by the frenzied &amp;Mullas, were eager to share in the 
honour of killing Him.  Inside the Mosque were assembled 
the doctors of religion.  &amp;Baha'u'llah stood before 
them, and answered all their questions with great 
wisdom.  The chief sage in particular, was completely 
silenced by &amp;Baha'u'llah, who refuted all his arguments.  
     A discussion arose between two of these priests as to 
the meaning of some words in the writings of the &amp;Bab; 
accusing Him of inaccuracy, they challenged &amp;Baha'u'llah 
to defend Him if He were able.  These priests were 
 
+P76 
entirely humiliated, for &amp;Baha'u'llah proved before the 
whole assembly that the &amp;Bab was absolutely right, and 
that the accusation was made in ignorance.  
     The defeated ones now put Him to the torture of the 
bastinado, and more infuriated than before brought 
Him out before the walls of the Mosque unto the 
place of execution, where the misguided people were 
awaiting His coming.  
     Still the Governor feared to comply with the demand 
of the priests for His execution.  Realizing the danger 
in which the dignified prisoner was placed, some men 
were sent to rescue Him.  In this they succeeded by 
breaking through the wall of the Mosque and leading 
&amp;Baha'u'llah through the opening into a place of safety, 
but not of freedom; for the Governor shifted the 
responsibility from off his own shoulders by sending 
him to &amp;Tihran.  Here He was imprisoned in an underground 
dungeon, where the light of day was never 
seen.  A heavy chain was placed about his neck by 
which He was chained to five other &amp;Babis; these fetters 
were locked together by strong, very heavy bolts, and 
screws.  His clothes were torn to pieces, also His fez.  
In this terrible condition He was kept for four months.  
     During this time none of His friends were able to 
get access to Him.  
     A prison official made an attempt to poison Him but, 
beyond causing Him great suffering, this poison had no 
effect.  
     After a time the Government liberated Him and 
exiled Him and His family to &amp;Baghdad, where He 
remained for eleven years.  During this time He 
 
+P77 
underwent severe persecutions, being surrounded by 
the watchful hatred of His enemies.  
     He bore all evils and torments with the greatest 
courage and fortitude.  Often when He arose in the 
morning, He knew not whether He would live until 
the sun should set.  Meanwhile, each day, the priests 
came and questioned Him on religion and metaphysics.  
     At length the Turkish Governor exiled Him to Constantinople, 
whence He was sent to Adrianople; here 
He stayed for five years.  Eventually, He was sent to the 
far off prison fortress of St. Jean d'Acre.  Here He was 
imprisoned in the military portion of the fortress and 
kept under the strictest surveillance.  Words would 
fail me to tell you of the many trials He had to suffer, 
and all the misery He endured in that prison.  Notwithstanding, 
it was from this prison that &amp;Baha'u'llah 
wrote to all the Monarchs of Europe, and these letters 
with one exception were sent through the post.  
     The Epistle of &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah was confided to a 
Persian &amp;Baha'i, &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi &amp;Khurasani, who undertook 
to deliver it into the &amp;Shah's own hands.  This brave man 
waited in the neighbourhood of &amp;Tihran for the passing 
of the &amp;Shah, who had the intention to journey by 
that way to his Summer Palace.  The courageous 
messenger followed the &amp;Shah to his Palace, and waited 
on the road near the entrance for several days.  Always 
in the same place was he seen waiting on the road, 
until the people began to wonder why he should be 
there.  At last the &amp;Shah heard of him, and commanded 
his servants that the man should be brought before him.  
     `Oh! servants of the &amp;Shah, I bring a letter, which I 
 
+P78 
must deliver into his own hands', &amp;Badi said, and then 
&amp;Badi said to the &amp;Shah, `I bring you a letter from 
&amp;Baha'u'llah!'  
     He was immediately seized and questioned by those 
who wished to elicit information which would help 
them in the further persecutions of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  &amp;Badi 
would not answer a word; then they tortured him, 
still he held his peace!  After three days they killed him, 
having failed to force him to speak!  These cruel men 
photographed him whilst he was under torture.+F1  
     The &amp;Shah gave the letter from &amp;Baha'u'llah to the 
priests that they might explain it to him.  After some 
days these priests told the &amp;Shah that the letter was 
from a political enemy.  The &amp;Shah grew angry and said, 
`This is no explanation.  I pay you to read and answer 
my letters, therefore obey!'  
     The spirit and meaning of the Tablet to &amp;Nasiri'd-Din 
&amp;Shah was, in short, this:  `Now that the time has come, 
when the Cause of the Glory of God has appeared, I 
ask that I may be allowed to come to &amp;Tihran and 
answer any questions the priests may put to Me.  
     `I exhort you to detach yourself from the worldly 
magnificence of your Empire.  Remember all those 
great kings who have lived before you--their glories 
have passed away!'  
     The letter was written in a most beautiful manner, 
and continued warning the King and telling him of the 
future triumph of the Kingdom of &amp;Baha'u'llah, both 
in the Eastern and in the Western World.  
 
+F1 A certain man who was present when &amp;Badi was told he should carry 
+F1 the Epistle to the &amp;Shah saw him transfigured; he became radiant.  
 
+P79 
     The &amp;Shah paid no attention to the warning of this 
letter and continued to live in the same fashion until 
the end.  
     Although &amp;Baha'u'llah was in prison the great Power 
of the Holy Spirit was with Him!  
     None other in prison could have been like unto Him.  
In spite of all the hardships He suffered, He never 
complained.  
     In the dignity of His Majesty, He always refused to 
see the Governor, or the influential people of the town.  
     Although the surveillance was unremittingly strict 
He came and went as He wished!  He died in a house 
situated about three kilometers from St. Jean d'Acre.  
 
 
           GOOD IDEAS MUST BE CARRIED INTO ACTION 
 
                                              November 8th 
     All over the world one hears beautiful sayings extolled 
and noble precepts admired.  All men say 
they love what is good, and hate everything that is 
evil!  Sincerity is to be admired, whilst lying is despicable.  
Faith is a virtue, and treachery is a disgrace to 
humanity.  It is a blessed thing to gladden the hearts 
of men, and wrong to be the cause of pain.  To be 
kind and merciful is right, while to hate is sinful.  
Justice is a noble quality and injustice an iniquity.  That 
it is one's duty to be pitiful and harm no one, and to 
avoid jealousy and malice at all costs.  Wisdom is the 
glory of man, not ignorance; light, not darkness!  It 
is a good thing to turn one's face toward God, and 
 
+P80 
foolishness to ignore Him.  That it is our duty to 
guide man upward, and not to mislead him and be the 
cause of his downfall.  There are many more examples 
like unto these.  
     But all these sayings are but words and we see very 
few of them carried into the world of action.  On the 
contrary, we perceive that men are carried away by 
passion and selfishness, each man thinking only of what 
will benefit himself even if it means the ruin of his 
brother.  They are all anxious to make their fortune 
and care little or nothing for the welfare of others.  They 
are concerned about their own peace and comfort, 
while the condition of their fellows troubles them not 
at all.  
     Unhappily this is the road most men tread.  
     But &amp;Baha'is must not be thus; they must rise above 
this condition.  Actions must be more to them than 
words.  By their actions they must be merciful and 
not merely by their words.  They must on all occasions 
confirm by their actions what they proclaim in words.  
Their deeds must prove their fidelity, and their actions 
must show forth Divine light.  
     Let your actions cry aloud to the world that you are 
indeed &amp;Baha'is, for it is actions that speak to the world 
and are the cause of the progress of humanity.  
     If we are true &amp;Baha'is speech is not needed.  Our 
actions will help on the world, will spread civilization, 
will help the progress of science, and cause the arts to 
develop.  Without action nothing in the material world 
can be accomplished, neither can words unaided advance 
a man in the spiritual Kingdom.  It is not through 
 
+P81 
lip-service only that the elect of God have attained to 
holiness, but by patient lives of active service they 
have brought light into the world.  
     Therefore strive that your actions day by day may 
be beautiful prayers.  Turn towards God, and seek 
always to do that which is right and noble.  Enrich 
the poor, raise the fallen, comfort the sorrowful, bring 
healing to the sick, reassure the fearful, rescue the 
oppressed, bring hope to the hopeless, shelter the 
destitute!  
     This is the work of a true &amp;Baha'i, and this is what is 
expected of him.  If we strive to do all this, then are 
we true &amp;Baha'is, but if we neglect it, we are not 
followers of the Light, and we have no right to the 
name.  
     God, who sees all hearts, knows how far our lives 
are the fulfilment of our words.  
 
 
            THE TRUE MEANING OF BAPTISM BY WATER 
                          AND FIRE 
 
                                             November 9th 
     In the Gospel according to St John, Christ has said:  
`Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he 
cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.'+F1  The 
priests have interpreted this into meaning that baptism 
is necessary for salvation.  In another Gospel it is said:  
`He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with 
fire'.+F2  
 
+F1 St John iii, 5.  
+F2 St Matthew iii, 11.  
 
+P82 
     Thus the water of baptism and the fire are one!  
It cannot mean that the `water' spoken of is physical 
water, for it is the direct opposite of `fire', and one 
destroys the other.  When in the Gospels, Christ speaks 
of `water', He means that which causes life, for without 
water no worldly creature can live--mineral, vegetable, 
animal and man, one and all, depend upon water 
for their very being.  Yes, the latest scientific discoveries 
prove to us that even mineral has some form of 
life, and that it also needs water for its existence.  
     Water is the cause of life, and when Christ speaks 
of water, He is symbolizing that which is the cause of 
Everlasting Life.  
     This life-giving water of which He speaks is like 
unto fire, for it is none other than the Love of God, 
and this love means life to our souls.  
     By the fire of the Love of God the veil is burnt which 
separates us from the Heavenly Realities, and with 
clear vision we are enabled to struggle onward and 
upward, ever progressing in the paths of virtue and 
holiness, and becoming the means of light to the 
world.  
     There is nothing greater or more blessed than the 
Love of God!  It gives healing to the sick, balm to the 
wounded, joy and consolation to the whole world, and 
through it alone can man attain Life Everlasting.  The 
essence of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the 
foundation of all the sacred teachings.  
     It was the Love of God that led Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob, that strengthened Joseph in Egypt and gave to 
Moses courage and patience.  
 
+P83 
     Through the Love of God, Christ was sent into the 
world with His inspiring example of a perfect life of 
self-sacrifice and devotion, bringing to men the message 
of Eternal Life.  It was the Love of God that gave 
&amp;Muhammad power to bring the Arabs from a state of 
animal degradation to a loftier state of existence.  
     God's Love it was that sustained the &amp;Bab and brought 
him to his supreme sacrifice, and made his bosom the 
willing target for a thousand bullets.  
     Finally, it was the Love of God that gave to the 
East &amp;Baha'u'llah, and is now sending the light of His 
teaching far into the West, and from Pole to Pole.  
     Thus I exhort each of you, realizing its power and 
beauty, to sacrifice all your thoughts, words and 
actions to bring the knowledge of the Love of God 
into every heart.  
 
 
           DISCOURSE AT `L'ALLIANCE SPIRITUALISTE' 
 
                                  Salle de &amp;l'Athenee, 
                                      St Germain, Paris, 
                                              November 9th 
     I wish to express my gratitude for your hospitality, 
and my joy that you are spiritually minded.  I am 
happy to be present at a gathering such as this, assembled 
together to listen to a Divine Message.  If you 
could see with the eye of truth, great waves of spirituality 
would be visible to you in this place.  The power 
of the Holy Spirit is here for all.  Praise be to God that 
 
+P84 
your hearts are inspired with Divine fervour!  Your 
souls are as waves on the sea of the spirit; although 
each individual is a distinct wave, the ocean is one, all 
are united in God.  
     Every heart should radiate unity, so that the Light 
of the one Divine Source of all may shine forth bright 
and luminous.  We must not consider the separate 
waves alone, but the entire sea.  We should rise from 
the individual to the whole.  The spirit is as one great 
ocean and the waves thereof are the souls of men.  
     We are told in the Holy Scripture that the New 
Jerusalem shall appear on earth.  Now it is evident that 
this celestial city is not built of material stones and 
mortar, but that it is a city not made with hands, 
eternal in the Heavens.  
     This is a prophetic symbol, meaning the coming 
again of the Divine Teaching to enlighten the hearts of 
men.  It is long since this Holy Guidance has governed 
the lives of humanity.  But now, at last, the Holy City 
of the New Jerusalem has come again to the world, it 
has appeared anew under an Eastern sky; from the 
horizon of Persia has its effulgence arisen to be a light 
to lighten the whole world.  We see in these days the 
fulfilment of the Divine Prophecy.  Jerusalem had disappeared.  
The heavenly city was destroyed, now it is 
rebuilt; it was razed to the ground, but now its walls 
and pinnacles have been restored, and are towering 
aloft in their renewed and glorious beauty.  
     In the Western world material prosperity has triumphed, 
whilst in the East the spiritual sun has shone 
forth.  
 
+P85 
     I am very glad to see such an assembly as this in 
Paris, where spiritual and material progress are met 
together in unity.  
     Man--the true man--is soul, not body; though 
physically man belongs to the animal kingdom, yet his 
soul lifts him above the rest of creation.  Behold how 
the light of the sun illuminates the world of matter:  
even so doth the Divine Light shed its rays in the 
kingdom of the soul.  The soul it is which makes the 
human creature a celestial entity!  
     By the power of the Holy Spirit, working through 
his soul, man is able to perceive the Divine reality of 
things.  All great works of art and science are witnesses 
to this power of the Spirit.  
     The same Spirit gives Eternal Life.  
     Those alone who are baptized by the Divine Spirit 
will be enabled to bring all peoples into the bond of 
unity.  It is by the power of the Spirit that the Eastern 
World of spiritual thought can intermingle with the 
Western realm of action, so that the world of matter 
may become Divine.  
     It follows that all who work for the Supreme Design 
are soldiers in the army of the Spirit.  
     The light of the celestial world makes war against 
the world of shadow and illusion.  The rays of the Sun 
of Truth dispel the darkness of superstition and misunderstanding.  
     You are of the Spirit!  To you who seek the truth, 
the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah will come as a great joy!  
This teaching is of the Spirit, in it is no precept which 
is not of the Divine Spirit.  
 
+P86 
     Spirit cannot be perceived by the material senses 
of the physical body, excepting as it is expressed in 
outward signs and works.  The human body is visible, 
the soul is invisible.  It is the soul nevertheless that 
directs a man's faculties, that governs his humanity.  
     The soul has two main faculties.  (a) As outer circumstances 
are communicated to the soul by the eyes, 
ears, and brain of a man, so does the soul communicate 
its desires and purposes through the brain to the hands 
and tongue of the physical body, thereby expressing 
itself.  The spirit in the soul is the very essence of life.  
(b) The second faculty of the soul expresses itself in the 
world of vision, where the soul inhabited by the spirit 
has its being, and functions without the help of the 
material bodily senses.  There, in the realm of vision, 
the soul sees without the help of the physical eye, hears 
without the aid of the physical ear, and travels without 
dependence upon physical motion.  It is, therefore, clear 
that the spirit in the soul of man can function through 
the physical body by using the organs of the ordinary 
senses, and that it is able also to live and act without 
their aid in the world of vision.  This proves without a 
doubt the superiority of the soul of man over his body, 
the superiority of spirit over matter.  
     For example, look at this lamp:  is not the light within 
it superior to the lamp which holds it?  However 
beautiful the form of the lamp may be, if the light is 
not there its purpose is unfulfilled, it is without life--a 
dead thing.  The lamp needs the light, but the light does 
not need the lamp.  
     The spirit does not need a body, but the body needs 
 
+P87 
spirit, or it cannot live.  The soul can live without a 
body, but the body without a soul dies.  
     If a man lose his sight, his hearing, his hand or his 
foot, should his soul still inhabit the body he lives, and 
is able to manifest divine virtues.  On the other hand, 
without the spirit it would be impossible for a perfect 
body to exist.  
     The greatest power of the Holy Spirit exists in the 
Divine Manifestations of the Truth.  Through the 
power of the Spirit the Heavenly Teaching has been 
brought into the World of Humanity.  Through the 
power of the Spirit life everlasting has come to the 
children of men.  Through the power of the Spirit 
the Divine Glory has shone from East to West, and 
through the power of the same Spirit will the divine 
virtues of humanity become manifest.  
     Our greatest efforts must be directed towards detachment 
from the things of the world; we must strive 
to become more spiritual, more luminous, to follow 
the counsel of the Divine Teaching, to serve the cause 
of unity and true equality, to be merciful, to reflect the 
love of the Highest on all men, so that the light of the 
Spirit shall be apparent in all our deeds, to the end that 
all humanity shall be united, the stormy sea thereof 
calmed, and all rough waves disappear from off the 
surface of life's ocean henceforth unruffled and peaceful.  
Then will the New Jerusalem be seen by mankind, who 
will enter through its gates and receive the Divine 
Bounty.  
     I thank God that I have been present amongst you 
this afternoon, and I thank you for your spiritual feeling.  
 
+P88 
     I pray that you may grow in Divine fervour, and 
that the power of unity in the Spirit will augment, so 
that the prophecies may be fulfilled, and that in this 
great century of the Light of God all the glad tidings 
written in the Sacred Books may come to pass.  This 
is the glorious time of which the Lord Jesus Christ 
spoke when He told us to pray `Thy Kingdom come, 
Thy Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven'.  I hope 
that this is also your expectation and great desire.  
     We are united in the one aim and hope that all shall 
be as one and every heart illumined by the Love of 
our Divine Father, God!  
     May all our actions be spiritual, and all our interests 
and affections be centred in the Kingdom of Glory!  
 
 
                 THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPIRIT 
 
                                     15 Rue Greuze, Paris, 
                                               November 10th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     Tonight I will speak of the evolution or progress 
of the spirit.  
     Absolute repose does not exist in nature.  All things 
either make progress or lose ground.  Everything moves 
forward or backward, nothing is without motion.  
From his birth, a man progresses physically until he 
reaches maturity, then, having arrived at the prime of 
his life, he begins to decline, the strength and powers 
of his body decrease, and he gradually arrives at the 
hour of death.  Likewise a plant progresses from the 
 
+P89 
seed to maturity, then its life begins to lessen until it 
fades and dies.  A bird soars to a certain height and 
having reached the highest possible point in its flight, 
begins its descent to earth.  
     Thus it is evident that movement is essential to all 
existence.  All material things progress to a certain 
point, then begin to decline.  This is the law which 
governs the whole physical creation.  
     Now let us consider the soul.  We have seen that 
movement is essential to existence; nothing that has 
life is without motion.  All creation, whether of the 
mineral, vegetable or animal kingdom, is compelled 
to obey the law of motion; it must either ascend or 
descend.  But with the human soul, there is no decline.  
Its only movement is towards perfection; growth and 
progress alone constitute the motion of the soul.  
     Divine perfection is infinite, therefore the progress 
of the soul is also infinite.  From the very birth of a 
human being the soul progresses, the intellect grows 
and knowledge increases.  When the body dies the soul 
lives on.  All the differing degrees of created physical 
beings are limited, but the soul is limitless!  
     In all religions the belief exists that the soul survives 
the death of the body.  Intercessions are sent up for 
the beloved dead, prayers are said for their progress 
and for the forgiveness of their sins.  If the soul perished 
with the body all this would have no meaning.  Further, 
if it were not possible for the soul to advance towards 
perfection after it had been released from the body, of 
what avail are all these loving prayers, of devotion?  
     We read in the sacred writings that `all good works 
 
+P90 
are found again'.+F1  Now, if the soul did not survive, 
this also would mean nothing!  
     The very fact that our spiritual instinct, surely never 
given in vain, prompts us to pray for the welfare of 
those, our loved ones, who have passed out of the 
material world:  does it not bear witness to the continuance 
of their existence?  
     In the world of spirit there is no retrogression.  The 
world of mortality is a world of contradictions, of 
opposites; motion being compulsory everything must 
either go forward or retreat.  In the realm of spirit 
there is no retreat possible, all movement is bound to 
be towards a perfect state.  `Progress' is the expression 
of spirit in the world of matter.  The intelligence of 
man, his reasoning powers, his knowledge, his scientific 
achievements, all these being manifestations of the 
spirit, partake of the inevitable law of spiritual progress 
and are, therefore, of necessity, immortal.  
     My hope for you is that you will progress in the 
world of spirit, as well as in the world of matter; that 
your intelligence will develop, your knowledge will 
augment, and your understanding be widened.  
     You must ever press forward, never standing still; 
avoid stagnation, the first step to a backward movement, 
to decay.  
     The whole physical creation is perishable.  These 
material bodies are composed of atoms; when these 
atoms begin to separate decomposition sets in, then 
comes what we call death.  This composition of atoms, 
which constitutes the body or mortal element of any 
 
+F1 i.e.--All good actions bring their own reward.  
 
+P91 
created being, is temporary.  When the power of attraction, 
which holds these atoms together, is withdrawn, 
the body, as such, ceases to exist.  
     With the soul it is different.  The soul is not a combination 
of elements, it is not composed of many 
atoms, it is of one indivisible substance and therefore 
eternal.  It is entirely out of the order of the physical 
creation; it is immortal!  
     Scientific philosophy has demonstrated that a simple 
element (`simple' meaning `not composed') is indestructible, 
eternal.  The soul, not being a composition 
of elements, is, in character, as a simple element, and 
therefore cannot cease to exist.  
     The soul, being of that one indivisible substance, can 
suffer neither disintegration nor destruction, therefore 
there is no reason for its coming to an end.  All things 
living show signs of their existence, and it follows that 
these signs could not of themselves exist if that which 
they express or to which they testify had no being.  A 
thing which does not exist, can, of course, give no sign 
of its existence.  The manifold signs of the existence of 
the spirit are for ever before us.  
     The traces of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the influence 
of His Divine Teaching, is present with us today, and 
is everlasting.  
     A non-existent thing, it is agreed, cannot be seen by 
signs.  In order to write a man must exist--one who 
does not exist cannot write.  Writing is, in itself, a sign 
of the writer's soul and intelligence.  The Sacred 
Writings (with ever the same Teaching) prove the 
continuity of the spirit.  
 
+P92 
     Consider the aim of creation:  is it possible that all is 
created to evolve and develop through countless ages 
with this small goal in view--a few years of a man's 
life on earth?  Is it not unthinkable that this should be 
the final aim of existence?  
     The mineral evolves till it is absorbed in the life of 
the plant, the plant progresses till finally it loses its life 
in that of the animal; the animal, in its turn, forming 
part of the food of man, is absorbed into human life.  
     Thus, man is shown to be the sum of all creation, the 
superior of all created beings, the goal to which countless 
ages of existence have progressed.  
     At the best, man spends four-score years and ten in 
this world--a short time indeed!  
     Does a man cease to exist when he leaves the body?  
If his life comes to an end, then all the previous 
evolution is useless, all has been for nothing!  Can one 
imagine that Creation has no greater aim than this?  
     The soul is eternal, immortal.  
     Materialists say, `Where is the soul?  What is it?  
We cannot see it, neither can we touch it'.  
     This is how we must answer them:  However much 
the mineral may progress, it cannot comprehend the 
vegetable world.  Now, that lack of comprehension 
does not prove the non-existence of the plant!  
     To however great a degree the plant may have 
evolved, it is unable to understand the animal world; 
this ignorance is no proof that the animal does not 
exist!  
     The animal, be he never so highly developed, cannot 
imagine the intelligence of man, neither can he realize 
 
+P93 
the nature of his soul.  But, again, this does not prove 
that man is without intellect, or without soul.  It only 
demonstrates this, that one form of existence is incapable 
of comprehending a form superior to itself.  
     This flower may be unconscious of such a being 
as man, but the fact of its ignorance does not prevent 
the existence of humanity.  
     In the same way, if materialists do not believe in the 
existence of the soul, their unbelief does not prove that 
there is no such realm as the world of spirit.  The very 
existence of man's intelligence proves his immortality; 
moreover, darkness proves the presence of light, for 
without light there would be no shadow.  Poverty 
proves the existence of riches, for, without riches, how 
could we measure poverty?  Ignorance proves that 
knowledge exists, for without knowledge how could 
there be ignorance?  
     Therefore the idea of mortality presupposes the 
existence of immortality--for if there were no Life 
Eternal, there would be no way of measuring the life 
of this world!  
     If the spirit were not immortal, how could the Manifestations 
of God endure such terrible trials?  
     Why did Christ Jesus suffer the fearful death on the 
cross?  
     Why did &amp;Muhammad bear persecutions?  
     Why did the &amp;Bab make the supreme sacrifice and 
why did &amp;Baha'u'llah pass the years of his life in prison?  
     Why should all this suffering have been, if not to 
prove the everlasting life of the spirit?  
     Christ suffered, He accepted all His trials because of 
 
+P94 
the immortality of His spirit.  If a man reflects he will 
understand the spiritual significance of the law of progress; 
how all moves from the inferior to the superior 
degree.  
     It is only a man without intelligence who, after considering 
these things, can imagine that the great scheme 
of creation should suddenly cease to progress, that 
evolution should come to such an inadequate end!  
     Materialists who reason in this way, and contend 
that we are unable to see the world of spirit, or to 
perceive the blessings of God, are surely like the 
animals who have no understanding; having eyes they 
see not, ears they have, but do not hear.  And this lack 
of sight and hearing is a proof of nothing but their 
own inferiority; of whom we read in the &amp;Qur'an, 
`They are men who are blind and deaf to the Spirit.'  
They do not use that great gift of God, the power of 
the understanding, by which they might see with the 
eyes of the spirit, hear with spiritual ears and also 
comprehend with a Divinely enlightened heart.  
     The inability of the materialistic mind to grasp the 
idea of the Life Eternal is no proof of the non-existence 
of that life.  
     The comprehension of that other life depends on 
our spiritual birth!  
     My prayer for you is that your spiritual faculties and 
aspirations may daily increase, and that you will never 
allow the material senses to veil from your eyes the 
glories of the Heavenly Illumination.

          THE DESIRES AND PRAYERS OF &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA 
 
                                              November 15th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     You are all very welcome, and I love you all 
most dearly.  
     Day and night I pray to Heaven for you that strength 
may be yours, and that, one and all, you may participate 
in the blessings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and enter into the 
Kingdom.  
     I supplicate that you may become as new beings, 
illumined with the Divine Light, like unto shining 
lamps, and that from one end of Europe to the other 
the knowledge of the Love of God may spread.  
     May this boundless love so fill your hearts and minds 
that sadness may find no room to enter and may you 
with joyful hearts soar like birds into the Divine 
Radiance.  
     May your hearts become clear and pure like unto 
polished mirrors in which may be reflected the full 
glory of the Sun of Truth.  
     May your eyes be opened to see the signs of the 
Kingdom of God, and may your ears be unstopped 
so that you may hear with a perfect understanding the 
Heavenly Proclamation sounding in your midst.  
     May your souls receive help and comfort, and, being 
so strengthened, may they be enabled to live in accordance 
with the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     I pray for each and all that you may be as flames of 
love in the world, and that the brightness of your light 
 
+P96 
and the warmth of your affection may reach the heart 
of every sad and sorrowing child of God.  
     May you be as shining stars, bright and luminous for 
ever in the Kingdom.  
     I counsel you that you study earnestly the teachings 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, so that, God helping you, you may in 
deed and truth become &amp;Baha'is.  
 
 
              CONCERNING BODY, SOUL AND SPIRIT 
 
                                4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                  Friday morning, November 17th 
     There are in the world of humanity three 
degrees; those of the body, the soul, and spirit.  
     The body is the physical or animal degree of man.  
From the bodily point of view man is a sharer of the 
animal kingdom.  The bodies alike of men and animals 
are composed of elements held together by the law of 
attraction.  
     Like the animal, man possesses the faculties of the 
senses, is subject to heat, cold, hunger, thirst, etc.; 
unlike the animal, man has a rational soul, the human 
intelligence.  
     This intelligence of man is the intermediary between 
his body and his spirit.  
     When man allows the spirit, through his soul, to 
enlighten his understanding, then does he contain all 
Creation; because man, being the culmination of all 
that went before and thus superior to all previous 
 
+P97 
evolutions, contains all the lower world within himself.  
Illumined by the spirit through the instrumentality of 
the soul, man's radiant intelligence makes him the 
crowning-point of Creation.  
     But on the other hand, when man does not open his 
mind and heart to the blessing of the spirit, but turns 
his soul towards the material side, towards the bodily 
part of his nature, then is he fallen from his high place 
and he becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the lower 
animal kingdom.  In this case the man is in a sorry 
plight!  For if the spiritual qualities of the soul, open 
to the breath of the Divine Spirit, are never used, they 
become atrophied, enfeebled, and at last incapable; 
whilst the soul's material qualities alone being exercised, 
they become terribly powerful--and the 
unhappy, misguided man, becomes more savage, more 
unjust, more vile, more cruel, more malevolent than 
the lower animals themselves.  All his aspirations and 
desires being strengthened by the lower side of the 
soul's nature, he becomes more and more brutal, until 
his whole being is in no way superior to that of the 
beasts that perish.  Men such as this, plan to work evil, 
to hurt and to destroy; they are entirely without the 
spirit of Divine compassion, for the celestial quality of 
the soul has been dominated by that of the material.  If, 
on the contrary, the spiritual nature of the soul has 
been so strengthened that it holds the material side 
in subjection, then does the man approach the 
Divine; his humanity becomes so glorified that the 
virtues of the Celestial Assembly are manifested in 
him; he radiates the Mercy of God, he stimulates the 
 
+P98 
spiritual progress of mankind, for he becomes a lamp 
to show light on their path.  
     You perceive how the soul is the intermediary between 
the body and the spirit.  In like manner is this 
tree+F1 the intermediary between the seed and the fruit.  
When the fruit of the tree appears and becomes ripe, 
then we know that the tree is perfect; if the tree bore 
no fruit it would be merely a useless growth, serving 
no purpose!  
     When a soul has in it the life of the spirit, then does 
it bring forth good fruit and become a Divine tree.  
I wish you to try to understand this example.  I hope 
that the unspeakable goodness of God will so strengthen 
you that the celestial quality of your soul, which 
relates it to the spirit, will for ever dominate the 
material side, so entirely ruling the senses that your 
soul will approach the perfections of the Heavenly 
Kingdom.  May your faces, being steadfastly set towards 
the Divine Light, become so luminous that all 
your thoughts, words and actions will shine with the 
Spiritual Radiance dominating your souls, so that in 
the gatherings of the world you will show perfection 
in your life.  
     Some men's lives are solely occupied with the things 
of this world; their minds are so circumscribed by 
exterior manners and traditional interests that they are 
blind to any other realm of existence, to the spiritual 
significance of all things!  They think and dream of 
earthly fame, of material progress.  Sensuous delights 
and comfortable surroundings bound their horizon, 
 
+F1 A small orange-tree on the table nearby.  
 
+P99 
their highest ambitions centre in successes of worldly 
conditions and circumstances!  They curb not their 
lower propensities; they eat, drink, and sleep!  Like 
the animal, they have no thought beyond their own 
physical well-being.  It is true that these necessities 
must be despatched.  Life is a load which must be 
carried on while we are on earth, but the cares of the 
lower things of life should not be allowed to monopolize 
all the thoughts and aspirations of a human being.  
The heart's ambitions should ascend to a more glorious 
goal, mental activity should rise to higher levels!  Men 
should hold in their souls the vision of celestial perfection, 
and there prepare a dwelling-place for the 
inexhaustible bounty of the Divine Spirit.  
     Let your ambition be the achievement on earth of a 
Heavenly civilization!  I ask for you the supreme 
blessing, that you may be so filled with the vitality of 
the Heavenly Spirit that you may be the cause of life 
to the world.  
 
 
            THE &amp;BAHA'IS MUST WORK WITH HEART AND 
           SOUL TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER CONDITION 
                        IN THE WORLD 
 
                                             November 19th 
     How joyful it is to see such a meeting as this, for it 
is in truth a gathering together of `heavenly men'.  
     We are all united in one Divine purpose, no material 
motive is ours, and our dearest wish is to spread the 
Love of God throughout the world!  
 
+P100 
     We work and pray for the unity of mankind, that 
all the races of the earth may become one race, all 
the countries one country, and that all hearts may beat 
as one heart, working together for perfect unity and 
brotherhood.  
     Praise be to God that our efforts are sincere and that 
our hearts are turned to the Kingdom.  Our greatest 
longing is that truth may be established in the world, 
and in this hope we draw near to one another in love 
and affection.  Each and all are whole-hearted and selfless, 
willing to sacrifice all personal ambition to the 
grand ideal towards which they strive:  Brotherly love 
and peace and union among men!  
     Doubt not that God is with us, on our right hand 
and on our left, that day by day He will cause our 
numbers to increase, and that our meetings will grow 
in strength and usefulness.  
     It is my dearest hope that you may all become a 
blessing to others, that you may give sight to the 
spiritually blind, hearing to the spiritually deaf and 
life to those who are dead in sin.  
     May you help those sunk in materiality to realize 
their Divine son-ship, and encourage them to arise and 
be worthy of their birthright; so that by your endeavour 
the world of humanity may become the 
Kingdom of God and of His elect.  
     I thank God that we are at one in this grand ideal, 
that my longings are also yours and that we work 
together in perfect unity.  
     Today, upon the earth, one sees the sad spectacle of 
cruel war!  Man slays his brother man for selfish gain, 
 
+P101 
and to enlarge his territories!  For this ignoble ambition 
hate has taken possession of his heart, and more and 
more blood is shed!  
     Fresh battles are fought, the armies are increased, 
more cannon, more guns, more explosives of all kinds 
are sent out--so does bitterness and hate augment 
from day to day!  
     But this assembly, thank God, longs only for peace 
and unity, and must work with heart and soul to 
bring about a better condition in the world.  
     You who are the servants of God fight against 
oppression, hate and discord, so that wars may cease 
and God's laws of peace and love may be established 
among men.  
     Work!  Work with all your strength, spread the 
Cause of the Kingdom among men; teach the self-sufficient 
to turn humbly towards God, the sinful to 
sin no more, and await with glad expectation the 
coming of the Kingdom.  
     Love and obey your Heavenly Father, and rest 
assured that Divine help is yours.  Verily I say unto you 
that you shall indeed conquer the world!  
     Only have faith, patience and courage--this is but 
the beginning, but surely you will succeed, for God is 
with you!  
 
+P102 
                         ON CALUMNY 
 
                                       Monday, November 20th 
     From the beginning of the world until the present 
time each `Manifestation'+F1 sent from God has been 
opposed by an embodiment of the `Powers of Darkness'.  
     This dark power has always endeavoured to extinguish 
the light.  Tyranny has ever sought to overcome 
justice.  Ignorance has persistently tried to trample 
knowledge underfoot.  This has, from the earliest ages, 
been the method of the material world.  
     In the time of Moses, Pharaoh set himself to prevent 
the Mosaic Light being spread abroad.  
     In the day of Christ, Annas and Caiaphas inflamed 
the Jewish people against Him and the learned doctors 
of Israel joined together to resist His Power.  All sorts 
of calumnies were circulated against Him.  The Scribes 
and Pharisees conspired to make the people believe 
Him to be a liar, an apostate, and a blasphemer.  They 
spread these slanders throughout the whole Eastern 
world against Christ, and caused Him to be condemned 
to a shameful death!  
     In the case of &amp;Muhammad also, the learned doctors 
of His day determined to extinguish the light of His 
influence.  They tried by the power of the sword to 
prevent the spread of His teaching.  
     In spite of all their efforts the Sun of Truth shone 
forth from the horizon.  In every case the army of 
light vanquished the powers of darkness on the battlefield 
 
+F1 i.e.--Divine Manifestation.  
 
+P103 
of the world, and the radiance of the Divine 
Teaching illumined the earth.  Those who accepted the 
Teaching and worked for the Cause of God became 
luminous stars in the sky of humanity.  
     Now, in our own day, history repeats itself.  
     Those who would have men believe that religion 
is their own private property once more bring their 
efforts to bear against the Sun of Truth:  they resist 
the Command of God; they invent calumnies, not 
having arguments against it, neither proofs.  They 
attack with masked faces, not daring to come forth 
into the light of day.  
     Our methods are different, we do not attack, neither 
calumniate; we do not wish to dispute with them; we 
bring forth proofs and arguments; we invite them to 
confute our statements.  They cannot answer us, but 
instead, they write all they can think of against the 
Divine Messenger, &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Do not let your hearts be troubled by these defamatory 
writings!  Obey the words of &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
answer them not.  Rejoice, rather, that even these falsehoods 
will result in the spread of the truth.  When these 
slanders appear inquiries are made, and those who 
inquire are led into a knowledge of the Faith.  
     If a man were to declare, `There is a lamp in the 
next room which gives no light', one hearer might be 
satisfied with his report, but a wiser man goes into the 
room to judge for himself, and behold, when he finds 
the light shining brilliantly in the lamp, he knows the 
truth!  
     Again, a man proclaims:  `There lies a garden in 
 
+P104 
which there are trees with broken branches bearing no 
fruit, and the leaves thereof are faded and yellow!  In 
that garden, also, there are flowering plants with no 
blooms, and rose bushes withered and dying--go not 
into that garden!'  A just man, hearing this account 
of the garden, would not be content without seeing for 
himself whether it be true or not.  He, therefore, enters 
the garden, and behold, he finds it well tilled; the 
branches of the trees are sturdy and strong, being also 
loaded with the sweetest of ripe fruits amongst the 
luxuriance of beautiful green leaves.  The flowering 
plants are bright with many-hued blossoms; the rose 
bushes are covered with fragrant and lovely roses and 
all is verdant and well tended.  When the glory of the 
garden is spread out before the eyes of the just man, he 
praises God that, through unworthy calumny, he has 
been led into a place of such wondrous beauty!  
     This is the result of the slanderer's work:  to be the 
cause of guiding men to a discovery of the truth.  
     We know that all the falsehoods spread about Christ 
and His apostles and all the books written against Him, 
only led the people to inquire into His doctrine; then, 
having seen the beauty and inhaled the fragrance, they 
walked evermore amidst the roses and the fruits of that 
celestial garden.  
     Therefore, I say unto you, spread the Divine Truth 
with all your might that men's intelligence may become 
enlightened; this is the best answer to those who 
slander.  I do not wish to speak of those people nor to 
say anything ill of them--only to tell you that slander 
is of no importance!  
 
+P105 
     Clouds may veil the sun, but, be they never so dense, 
his rays will penetrate!  Nothing can prevent the radiance 
of the sun descending to warm and vivify the 
Divine Garden.  
     Nothing can prevent the fall of the rain from 
Heaven.  
     Nothing can prevent the fulfilment of the Word of 
God!  
     Therefore when you see books and papers written 
against the Revelation, be not distressed, but take 
comfort in the assurance that the cause will thereby 
gain strength.  
     No one casts stones at a tree without fruit.  No one 
tries to extinguish a lamp without light!  
     Regard the former times.  Had the calumnies of 
Pharaoh any effect?  He affirmed that Moses was a 
murderer, that he had slain a man and deserved to be 
executed!  He also declared that Moses and Aaron 
were fomenters of discord, that they tried to destroy 
the religion of Egypt and therefore must be put to 
death.  These words of Pharaoh were vainly spoken.  
The light of Moses shone.  The radiance of the Law of 
God has encircled the world!  
     When the Pharisees said of Christ that He had 
broken the Sabbath Day, that He had defied the Law 
of Moses, that He had threatened to destroy the Temple 
and the Holy City of Jerusalem, and that He deserved 
to be crucified--We know that all these slanderous 
attacks had no result in hindering the spread of the 
Gospel!  
     The Sun of Christ shone brilliantly in the sky, and 
 
+P106 
the breath of the Holy Spirit wafted over the whole 
earth!  
     And I say unto you that no calumny is able to prevail 
against the Light of God; it can only result in causing 
it to be more universally recognized.  If a cause were 
of no significance, who would take the trouble to 
work against it!  
     But always the greater the cause the more do 
enemies arise in larger and larger numbers to attempt 
its overthrow!  The brighter the light the darker the 
shadow!  Our part it is to act in accordance with the 
teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah in humility and firm steadfastness.  
 
 
            THERE CAN BE NO TRUE HAPPINESS AND 
               PROGRESS WITHOUT SPIRITUALITY 
 
                                           November 21st 
     Ferocity and savagery are natural to animals, but 
men should show forth the qualities of love and 
affection.  God sent all His Prophets into the world with 
one aim, to sow in the hearts of men love and goodwill, 
and for this great purpose they were willing to suffer 
and to die.  All the sacred Books were written to 
lead and direct man into the ways of love and unity; 
and yet, in spite of all this, we have the sad spectacle of 
war and bloodshed in our midst.  
     When we look into the pages of history, past and 
present, we see the black earth reddened by human 
 
+P107 
blood.  Men kill each other like the savage wolves, and 
forget the laws of love and tolerance.  
     Now this luminous age has come, bringing with it 
wonderful civilization and material progress.  Men's 
intellects have widened, their perceptions grown, but 
alas, in spite of all this, fresh blood is being spilt day by 
day.  Look at the present Turco-Italian war; consider 
for a moment the fate of these unhappy people!  How 
many have been killed during this sad time?  How 
many homes are ruined, wives desolate, and children 
orphans!  And what is to be gained in exchange for 
all this anguish and heartache?  Only a corner of the 
earth!  
     This all shows that material progress alone does not 
tend to uplift man.  On the contrary, the more he 
becomes immersed in material progress, the more 
does his spirituality become obscured.  
     In times gone by progress on the material plane was 
not so rapid, neither was there bloodshed in such 
profusion.  In ancient warfare there were no cannons, 
no guns, no dynamite, no shells, no torpedo boats, no 
battleships, no submarines.  Now, owing to material 
civilization, we have all these inventions, and war goes 
from bad to worse!  Europe itself has become like one 
immense arsenal, full of explosives, and may God 
prevent its ignition--for, should this happen, the 
whole world would be involved.  
     I want to make you understand that material progress 
and spiritual progress are two very different things, 
and that only if material progress goes hand in hand 
with spirituality can any real progress come about, and 
 
+P108 
the Most Great Peace reign in the world.  If men 
followed the Holy Counsels and the Teachings of the 
Prophets, if Divine Light shone in all hearts and men 
were really religious, we should soon see peace on 
earth and the Kingdom of God among men.  The laws 
of God may be likened unto the soul and material 
progress unto the body.  If the body was not animated 
by the soul, it would cease to exist.  It is my earnest 
prayer that spirituality may ever grow and increase in 
the world, so that customs may become enlightened 
and peace and concord may be established.  
     War and rapine with their attendant cruelties are an 
abomination to God, and bring their own punishment, 
for the God of love is also a God of justice and each 
man must inevitably reap what he sows.  Let us try to 
understand the commands of the Most High and to 
order our lives as He directs.  True happiness depends 
on spiritual good and having the heart ever open to 
receive the Divine Bounty.  
     If the heart turns away from the blessings God offers 
how can it hope for happiness?  If it does not put its 
hope and trust in God's Mercy, where can it find rest?  
Oh, trust in God!  for His Bounty is everlasting, and 
in His Blessings, for they are superb.  Oh!  put your 
faith in the Almighty, for He faileth not and His goodness 
endureth for ever!  His Sun giveth Light continually, 
and the Clouds of His Mercy are full of the Waters 
of Compassion with which He waters the hearts of all 
who trust in Him.  His refreshing Breeze ever carries 
healing in its wings to the parched souls of men!  Is it 
wise to turn away from such a loving Father, Who 
 
+P109 
showers His blessings upon us, and to choose rather 
to be slaves of matter?  
     God in His infinite goodness has exalted us to so 
much honour, and has made us masters over the material 
world.  Shall we then become her slaves?  Nay, 
rather let us claim our birthright, and strive to live the 
life of the spiritual sons of God.  The glorious Sun of 
Truth has once again risen in the East.  From the far 
horizon of Persia its radiance is spreading far and wide, 
dispersing the dense clouds of superstition.  The light 
of the unity of mankind is beginning to illumine the 
world, and soon the banner of Divine harmony and the 
solidarity of nations will be flying high in the Heavens.  
Yea, the breezes of the Holy Spirit will inspire the 
whole world!  
     Oh, peoples and nations!  Arise and work and be 
happy!  Gather together under the tent of the unity of 
mankind!  
 
 
                      PAIN AND SORROW 
 
                                         November 22nd 
     In this world we are influenced by two sentiments, 
Joy and Pain.  
     Joy gives us wings!  In times of joy our strength 
is more vital, our intellect keener, and our understanding 
less clouded.  We seem better able to cope with the 
world and to find our sphere of usefulness.  But when 
sadness visits us we become weak, our strength leaves 
us, our comprehension is dim and our intelligence 
veiled.  The actualities of life seem to elude our grasp, 
 
+P110 
the eyes of our spirits fail to discover the sacred mysteries, 
and we become even as dead beings.  
     There is no human being untouched by these two 
influences; but all the sorrow and the grief that exist 
come from the world of matter--the spiritual world 
bestows only the joy!  
     If we suffer it is the outcome of material things, and 
all the trials and troubles come from this world of 
illusion.  
     For instance, a merchant may lose his trade and 
depression ensues.  A workman is dismissed and 
starvation stares him in the face.  A farmer has a bad 
harvest, anxiety fills his mind.  A man builds a house 
which is burnt to the ground and he is straightway 
homeless, ruined, and in despair.  
     All these examples are to show you that the trials 
which beset our every step, all our sorrow, pain, shame 
and grief, are born in the world of matter; whereas 
the spiritual Kingdom never causes sadness.  A man 
living with his thoughts in this Kingdom knows perpetual 
joy.  The ills all flesh is heir to do not pass him by, 
but they only touch the surface of his life, the depths 
are calm and serene.  
     Today, humanity is bowed down with trouble, 
sorrow and grief, no one escapes; the world is wet 
with tears; but, thank God, the remedy is at our doors.  
Let us turn our hearts away from the world of matter 
and live in the spiritual world!  It alone can give us 
freedom!  If we are hemmed in by difficulties we have 
only to call upon God, and by His great Mercy we 
shall be helped.  
 
+P111 
     If sorrow and adversity visit us, let us turn our faces 
to the Kingdom and heavenly consolation will be outpoured.  
     If we are sick and in distress let us implore God's 
healing, and He will answer our prayer.  
     When our thoughts are filled with the bitterness of 
this world, let us turn our eyes to the sweetness of 
God's compassion and He will send us heavenly calm!  
If we are imprisoned in the material world, our spirit 
can soar into the Heavens and we shall be free indeed!  
     When our days are drawing to a close let us think of 
the eternal worlds, and we shall be full of joy!  
     You see all round you proofs of the inadequacy of 
material things--how joy, comfort, peace and consolation 
are not to be found in the transitory things of the 
world.  Is it not then foolishness to refuse to seek these 
treasures where they may be found?  The doors of the 
spiritual Kingdom are open to all, and without is 
absolute darkness.  
     Thank God that you in this assembly have this knowledge, 
for in all the sorrows of life you can obtain 
supreme consolation.  If your days on earth are numbered, 
you know that everlasting life awaits you.  If 
material anxiety envelops you in a dark cloud, 
spiritual radiance lightens your path.  Verily, those 
whose minds are illumined by the Spirit of the Most 
High have supreme consolation.  
     I myself was in prison forty years--one year alone 
would have been impossible to bear--nobody survived 
that imprisonment more than a year!  But, thank God, 
during all those forty years I was supremely happy!  
 
+P112 
Every day, on waking, it was like hearing good tidings, 
and every night infinite joy was mine.  Spirituality was 
my comfort, and turning to God was my greatest joy.  
If this had not been so, do you think it possible that 
I could have lived through those forty years in prison?  
     Thus, spirituality is the greatest of God's gifts, and 
`Life Everlasting' means `Turning to God'.  May you, 
one and all, increase daily in spirituality, may you 
be strengthened in all goodness, may you be helped 
more and more by the Divine consolation, be made 
free by the Holy Spirit of God, and may the power of 
the Heavenly Kingdom live and work among you.  
     This is my earnest desire, and I pray to God to grant 
you this favour.  
 
 
         THE PERFECT HUMAN SENTIMENTS AND VIRTUES 
 
                                               November 23rd 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     You should all be very happy and thankful to 
God for the great privilege that is yours.  
     This is purely a spiritual meeting!  Praise be to God, 
your hearts are turned to Him, your souls are attracted 
to the Kingdom, you have spiritual aspirations, and 
your thoughts soar above the world of dust.  
     You belong to the world of purity, and are not content 
to live the life of the animal, spending your days in 
eating, drinking, and sleeping.  You are indeed men!  
Your thoughts and ambitions are set to acquire human 
perfection.  You live to do good and to bring happiness 
 
+P113 
to others.  Your greatest longing is to comfort those 
who mourn, to strengthen the weak, and to be the 
cause of hope to the despairing soul.  Day and night 
your thoughts are turned to the Kingdom, and your 
hearts are full of the Love of God.  
     Thus you know neither opposition, dislike, nor 
hatred, for every living creature is dear to you and the 
good of each is sought.  
     These are perfect human sentiments and virtues.  
If a man has none of these, he had better cease to exist.  
If a lamp has ceased to give light, it had better be destroyed.  
If a tree bear no fruit, it had better be cut down, 
for it only cumbereth the ground.  
     Verily, it is better a thousand times for a man to die 
than to continue living without virtue.  
     We have eyes wherewith to see, but if we do not use 
them how do they profit us?  We have ears wherewith 
to hear, but if we are deaf of what use are they?  
     We have a tongue wherewith to praise God and 
proclaim the good tidings, but if we are dumb how 
useless it is!  
     The All-loving God created man to radiate the 
Divine light and to illumine the world by his words, 
action and life.  If he is without virtue he becomes no 
better than a mere animal, and an animal devoid of 
intelligence is a vile thing.  
     The Heavenly Father gave the priceless gift of intelligence 
to man so that he might become a spiritual 
light, piercing the darkness of materiality, and bringing 
goodness and truth into the world.  If ye will follow 
earnestly the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, ye shall indeed 
 
+P114 
become the light of the world, the soul for the body of 
the world, the comfort and help for humanity, and the 
source of salvation for the whole universe.  Strive therefore, 
with heart and soul, to follow the precepts of the 
Blessed Perfection, and rest assured that if ye succeed 
in living the life he marks out for you, Eternal Life and 
everlasting joy in the Heavenly Kingdom will be yours, 
and celestial sustenance will be sent to strengthen you 
all your days.  
     It is my heartfelt prayer that each one of you may 
attain to this perfect joy!  
 
 
         THE CRUEL INDIFFERENCE OF PEOPLE TOWARDS 
              THE SUFFERING OF FOREIGN RACES 
 
                                              November 24th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     I have just been told that there has been a terrible 
accident in this country.  A train has fallen into the 
river and at least twenty people have been killed.  This 
is going to be a matter for discussion in the French 
Parliament today, and the Director of the State Railway 
will be called upon to speak.  He will be cross-examined 
as to the condition of the railroad and as to 
what caused the accident, and there will be a heated 
argument.  I am filled with wonder and surprise to 
notice what interest and excitement has been aroused 
throughout the whole country on account of the death 
of twenty people, while they remain cold and indifferent 
to the fact that thousands of Italians, Turks, 
 
+P115 
and Arabs are killed in Tripoli!  The horror of this 
wholesale slaughter has not disturbed the Government 
at all!  Yet these unfortunate people are human beings 
too.  
     Why is there so much interest and eager sympathy 
shown towards these twenty individuals, while for 
five thousand persons there is none?  They are all men, 
they all belong to the family of mankind, but they are 
of other lands and races.  It is no concern of the disinterested 
countries if these men are cut to pieces, this 
wholesale slaughter does not affect them!  How unjust, 
how cruel is this, how utterly devoid of any good and 
true feeling!  The people of these other lands have 
children and wives, mothers, daughters, and little sons!  
In these countries today there is hardly a house free 
from the sound of bitter weeping, scarcely can one 
find a home untouched by the cruel hand of war.  
     Alas!  we see on all sides how cruel, prejudiced and 
unjust is man, and how slow he is to believe in God 
and follow His commandments.  
     If these people would love and help one another 
instead of being so eager to destroy with sword and 
cannon, how much nobler would it be!  How much 
better if they would live like a flock of doves in peace 
and harmony, instead of being like wolves and tearing 
each other to pieces.  
     Why is man so hard of heart?  It is because he does 
not yet know God.  If he had knowledge of God he 
could not act in direct opposition to His laws; if he 
were spiritually minded such a line of conduct would 
be impossible to him.  If only the laws and precepts of 
 
+P116 
the prophets of God had been believed, understood and 
followed, wars would no longer darken the face of the 
earth.  
     If man had even the rudiments of justice, such a 
state of things would be impossible.  
     Therefore, I say unto you pray--pray and turn your 
faces to God, that He, in His infinite compassion and 
mercy, may help and succour these misguided ones.  
Pray that He will grant them spiritual understanding 
and teach them tolerance and mercy, that the eyes of 
their minds may be opened and that they may be 
endued with the gift of the spirit.  Then would peace 
and love walk hand in hand through the lands, and 
these poor unhappy people might have rest.  
     Let us all strive night and day to help in the bringing 
about of better conditions.  My heart is broken by these 
terrible things and cries aloud--may this cry reach 
other hearts!  
     Then will the blind see, the dead will be raised, and 
Justice will come and reign upon the earth.  
     I beseech you all to pray with heart and soul that 
this may be accomplished.  
 
 
             WE MUST NOT BE DISCOURAGED BY THE 
                 SMALLNESS OF OUR NUMBERS 
 
                                           November 25th 
     When Christ appeared He manifested Himself at 
Jerusalem.  He called men to the Kingdom of 
God, He invited them to Eternal Life and He told them 
to acquire human perfections.  The Light of Guidance 
 
+P117 
was shed forth by that radiant Star, and He at length 
gave His life in sacrifice for humanity.  
     All through His blessed life He suffered oppression 
and hardship, and in spite of all this humanity was His 
enemy!  
     They denied Him, scorned Him, ill-treated Him 
and cursed Him.  He was not treated like a man--and 
yet in spite of all this He was the embodiment of pity 
and of supreme goodness and love.  
     He loved all humanity, but they treated Him as an 
enemy and were incapable of appreciating Him.  They 
set no value on His words and were not illumined by 
the flame of His love.  
     Later they realized who He was; that He was the 
Sacred and Divine Light, and that His words held 
Eternal Life.  
     His heart was full of love for all the world, His goodness 
was destined to reach each one--and as they began 
to realize these things, they repented--but He had 
been crucified!  
     It was not until many years after His ascension that 
they knew who He was, and at the time of His ascension 
He had only a very few disciples; only a comparatively 
small following believed His precepts and 
followed His laws.  The ignorant said, `Who is this 
individual; He has only a few disciples!'  But those who 
knew said:  `He is the Sun who will shine in the East 
and in the West, He is the Manifestation who shall give 
life to the world'.  
     What the first disciples had seen the world realized 
later.  
 
+P118 
     Therefore, you who are in Europe, do not be discouraged 
because you are few or because people think 
that your Cause is of no importance.  If few people 
come to your gatherings do not lose heart, and if you 
are ridiculed and contradicted be not distressed, for 
the apostles of Christ had the same to bear.  They were 
reviled and persecuted, cursed and ill-treated, but in 
the end they were victorious and their enemies were 
found to be wrong.  
     If history should repeat itself and all these same 
things should happen to you, do not be saddened but 
be full of joy, and thank God that you are called upon 
to suffer as holy men of old suffered.  If they oppose 
you be gentle with them, if they contradict be firm in 
your faith, if they desert you and flee from before you, 
seek them out and treat them kindly.  Do harm to 
nobody; pray for all; try to make your light shine in 
the world and let your banner fly high in the Heavens.  
The beautiful perfume of your noble lives will permeate 
everywhere.  The light of truth kindled in your 
hearts will shine out to the distant horizon!  
     The indifference and scorn of the world matters not 
at all, whereas your lives will be of the greatest 
importance.  
     All those who seek truth in the Heavenly Kingdom 
shine like the stars; they are like fruit trees laden with 
choice fruit, like seas full of precious pearls.  
     Only have faith in the Mercy of God, and spread the 
Divine Truth.  
 
+P119 
          WORDS SPOKEN BY &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA IN PASTOR 
         WAGNER'S CHURCH (FOYER DE L'AME) IN PARIS 
 
                                               November 26th 
     I am deeply touched by the sympathetic words 
which have been addressed to me, and I hope that 
day by day true love and affection may grow among 
us.  God has willed that love should be a vital force in 
the world, and you all know how I rejoice to speak of 
love.  
     All down the ages the prophets of God have been 
sent into the world to serve the cause of truth--Moses 
brought the law of truth, and all the prophets of Israel 
after him sought to spread it.  
     When Jesus came He lighted the flaming torch of 
truth, and carried it aloft so that the whole world might 
be illumined thereby.  After Him came His chosen 
apostles, and they went far and wide, carrying the light 
of their Master's teaching into a dark world--and, in 
their turn, passed on.  
     Then came &amp;Muhammad, who in His time and way 
spread the knowledge of truth among a savage people; 
for this has always been the mission of God's elect.  
     So, at last, when &amp;Baha'u'llah arose in Persia, this was 
His most ardent desire, to rekindle the waning light of 
truth in all lands.  All the holy ones of God have tried 
with heart and soul to spread the light of love and 
unity throughout the world, so that the darkness of 
materiality might disappear and the light of spirituality 
might shine forth among the children of men.  Then 
 
+P120 
would hate, slander and murder disappear, and in their 
stead love, unity and peace would reign.  
     All the Manifestations of God came with the same 
purpose, and they have all sought to lead men into 
the paths of virtue.  Yet we, their servants, still dispute 
among ourselves!  Why is it thus?  Why do we not 
love one another and live in unity?  
     It is because we have shut our eyes to the underlying 
principle of all religions, that God is one, that He is the 
Father of us all, that we are all immersed in the ocean 
of His mercy and sheltered and protected by His 
loving care.  
     The glorious Sun of Truth shines for all alike, the 
waters of Divine Mercy immerse each one, and His 
Divine favour is bestowed on all His children.  
     This loving God desires peace for all His creatures--
why, then, do they spend their time in war?  
     He loves and protects all His children--why do they 
forget Him?  
     He bestows His Fatherly care on us all--why do we 
neglect our brothers?  
     Surely, when we realize how God loves and cares for 
us, we should so order our lives that we may become 
more like Him.  
     God has created us, one and all--why do we act in 
opposition to His wishes, when we are all His children, 
and love the same Father?  All these divisions we see 
on all sides, all these disputes and opposition, are 
caused because men cling to ritual and outward observances, 
and forget the simple, underlying truth.  It is 
the outward practices of religion that are so different, and 
 
+P121 
it is they that cause disputes and enmity--while the 
reality is always the same, and one.  The Reality is the 
Truth, and truth has no division.  Truth is God's 
guidance, it is the light of the world, it is love, it is 
mercy.  These attributes of truth are also human virtues 
inspired by the Holy Spirit.  
     So let us one and all hold fast to truth, and we shall 
be free indeed!  
     The day is coming when all the religions of the world 
will unite, for in principle they are one already.  There 
is no need for division, seeing that it is only the outward 
forms that separate them.  Among the sons of 
men some souls are suffering through ignorance, let 
us hasten to teach them; others are like children needing 
care and education until they are grown, and some are 
sick--to these we must carry Divine healing.  
     Whether ignorant, childish or sick, they must be 
loved and helped, and not disliked because of their 
imperfection.  
     Doctors of religion were instituted to bring spiritual 
healing to the peoples and to be the cause of unity 
among the nations.  If they become the cause of division 
they had better not exist!  A remedy is given to 
cure a disease, but if it only succeeds in aggravating the 
complaint, it is better to leave it alone.  If religion is 
only to be a cause of disunion it had better not exist.  
     All the Divine Manifestations sent by God into the 
world would have gone through their terrible hardships 
and sufferings for the single hope of spreading 
Truth, unity and concord among men.  Christ endured 
a life of sorrow, pain and grief, to bring a perfect 
 
+P122 
example of love into the world--and in spite of this we 
continue to act in a contrary spirit one towards the other!  
     Love is the fundamental principle of God's purpose 
for man, and He has commanded us to love each other 
even as He loves us.  All these discords and disputes 
which we hear on all sides only tend to increase 
materiality.  
     The world for the most part is sunk in materialism, 
and the blessings of the Holy Spirit are ignored.  There 
is so little real spiritual feeling, and the progress of the 
world is for the most part merely material.  Men are 
becoming like unto beasts that perish, for we know 
that they have no spiritual feeling--they do not turn to 
God, they have no religion!  These things belong to 
man alone, and if he is without them he is a prisoner 
of nature, and no whit better than an animal.  
     How can man be content to lead only an animal 
existence when God has made him so high a creature?  
All creation is made subject to the laws of nature, but 
man has been able to conquer these laws.  The sun, 
in spite of its power and glory, is bound by the laws of 
nature, and cannot change its course by so much as a 
hair's breadth.  The great and mighty ocean is powerless 
to change the ebb and flow of its tides--nothing 
can stand against nature's laws but man!  
     But to man God has given such wonderful power 
that he can guide, control and overcome nature.  
     The natural law for man is to walk on the earth, but 
he makes ships and flies in the air!  He is created to 
live on dry land, but he rides on the sea and even 
travels under it!  
 
+P123 
     He has learnt to control the power of electricity, and 
he takes it at his will and imprisons it in a lamp!  The 
human voice is made to speak across short distances, 
but man's power is such that he has made instruments 
and can speak from East to West!  All these examples 
show you how man can govern nature, and how, as it 
were, he wrests a sword from the hand of nature and 
uses it against herself.  Seeing that man has been created 
master of nature, how foolish it is of him to become 
her slave!  What ignorance and stupidity it is to worship 
and adore nature, when God in His goodness has 
made us masters thereof.  God's power is visible to all, 
yet men shut their eyes and see it not.  The Sun of 
Truth is shining in all His splendour, but man with 
fast shut eyes cannot behold His glory!  It is my earnest 
prayer to God that by His Mercy and Loving Kindness 
you may all be united, and filled with the utmost joy.  
     I beseech you, one and all, to add your prayers to 
mine to the end that war and bloodshed may cease, and 
that love, friendship, peace and unity may reign in 
the world.  
     All down the ages we see how blood has stained the 
surface of the earth; but now a ray of greater light has 
come, man's intelligence is greater, spirituality is beginning 
to grow, and a time is surely coming when 
the religions of the world will be at peace.  Let us leave 
the discordant arguments concerning outward forms, 
and let us join together to hasten forward the Divine 
Cause of unity, until all humanity knows itself to be 
one family, joined together in love.

     The Eleven Principles out of the Teaching of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, Explained by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Paris.  
 
        I.--The Search after Truth.  
       II.--The Unity of Mankind.  
      III.--Religion ought to be the Cause of Love and 
            Affection. (Not given separately.) 
       IV.--The Unity of Religion and Science.  
        V.--Abolition of Prejudices.  
       VI.--Equalization of Means of Existence.  
      VII.--Equality of Men before the Law.  
     VIII.--Universal Peace.  
       IX.--Non-Interference of Religion and Politics.  
        X.--Equality of Sex--Education of Women.  
       XI.--The Power of the Holy Spirit.  
 
 
                 THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, PARIS 
 
     Since my arrival in Paris, I have been told of the 
Theosophical Society, and I know that it is composed 
of honoured and respected men.  You are men of 
intellect and thought, men with spiritual ideals, and it 
is a great pleasure for me to be among you.  
     Let us thank God who has drawn us together this 
evening.  It gives me great joy, for I see that you are 
seekers after truth.  You are not held in bondage by 
the chains of prejudice, and your greatest longing is to 
know the truth.  Truth may be likened to the sun!  
The sun is the luminous body that disperses all 
 
+P128 
shadows; in the same way does truth scatter the 
shadows of our imagination.  As the sun gives life to 
the body of humanity so does truth give life to their 
souls.  Truth is a sun that rises from different points on 
the horizon.  
     Sometimes the sun rises from the centre of the 
horizon, then in summer it rises farther north, in winter 
farther south--but it is always the self-same sun, 
however different are the points of its rising.  
     In like manner truth is one, although its manifestations 
may be very different.  Some men have eyes and 
see.  These worship the sun, no matter from which 
point on the horizon it may dawn; and when the sun 
has left the winter sky to appear in the summer one, 
they know how to find it again.  Others there are who 
worship only the spot from which the sun arose, and 
when it arises in its glory from another place they 
remain in contemplation before the spot of its former 
rising.  Alas! these men are deprived of the blessings of 
the sun.  Those who in truth adore the sun itself will 
recognize it from whatsoever dawning-place it may 
appear, and will straightway turn their faces towards 
its radiance.  
     We must adore the sun itself and not merely the 
place of its appearance.  In the same way men of 
enlightened heart worship truth on whatever horizon 
it appears.  They are not bound by personality, but 
they follow the truth, and are able to recognize it no 
matter from whence it may come.  It is this same truth 
which helps humanity to progress, which gives life to 
all created beings, for it is the Tree of Life!  
 
+P129 
     In His teaching &amp;Baha'u'llah gives us the explanation 
of truth, and I wish to speak to you briefly about this, 
for I see that you are capable of understanding.  
 
I.--The first principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
                    The Search for Truth 
 
     Man must cut himself free from all prejudice and 
from the result of his own imagination, so that he may 
be able to search for truth unhindered.  Truth is one in 
all religions, and by means of it the unity of the world 
can be realized.  
     All the peoples have a fundamental belief in common.  
Being one, truth cannot be divided, and the differences 
that appear to exist among the nations only result 
from their attachment to prejudice.  If only men would 
search out truth, they would find themselves united.  
 
 
II.--The second principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
                    The Unity of Mankind 
 
     The one all-loving God bestows His divine Grace 
and Favour on all mankind; one and all are servants 
of the Most High, and His Goodness, Mercy and loving 
Kindness are showered upon all His creatures.  The 
glory of humanity is the heritage of each one.  
     All men are the leaves and fruit of one same tree, 
they are all branches of the tree of Adam, they all have 
the same origin.  The same rain has fallen upon them 
all, the same warm sun makes them grow, they are all 
refreshed by the same breeze.  The only differences that 
exist and that keep them apart are these:  there are the 
 
+P130 
children who need guidance, the ignorant to be 
instructed, the sick to be tended and healed; thus, I say 
that the whole of humanity is enveloped by the Mercy 
and Grace of God.  As the Holy Writings tell us:  All 
men are equal before God.  He is no respecter of 
persons.  
 
 
III.--The third principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
     Religion should be the Cause of Love and Affection 
 
     Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and 
disputes to vanish from the face of the earth, give birth 
to spirituality, and bring life and light to each heart.  If 
religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division, 
it were better to be without it, and to withdraw from 
such a religion would be a truly religious act.  For it 
is clear that the purpose of a remedy is to cure; but 
if the remedy should only aggravate the complaint it 
had better be left alone.  Any religion which is not a 
cause of love and unity is no religion.  All the holy 
prophets were as doctors to the soul; they gave prescriptions 
for the healing of mankind; thus any remedy 
that causes disease does not come from the great and 
supreme Physician.  
 
 
IV.--The fourth principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
              The Unity of Religion and Science 
 
     We may think of science as one wing and religion as 
the other; a bird needs two wings for flight, one alone 
would be useless.  Any religion that contradicts science 
 
+P131 
or that is opposed to it, is only ignorance--for ignorance 
is the opposite of knowledge.  
     Religion which consists only of rites and ceremonies 
of prejudice is not the truth.  Let us earnestly endeavour 
to be the means of uniting religion and science.  
     &amp;Ali, the son-in-law of &amp;Muhammad, said:  `That 
which is in conformity with science is also in conformity 
with religion'.  Whatever the intelligence of 
man cannot understand, religion ought not to accept.  
Religion and science walk hand in hand, and any 
religion contrary to science is not the truth.  
 
 
V.--The fifth principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
        Prejudices of Religion, Race or Sect destroy 
                 the foundation of Humanity 
 
     All the divisions in the world, hatred, war and bloodshed, 
are caused by one or other of these prejudices.  
     The whole world must be looked upon as one single 
country, all the nations as one nation, all men as 
belonging to one race.  Religions, races, and nations 
are all divisions of man's making only, and are necessary 
only in his thought; before God there are neither 
Persians, Arabs, French nor English; God is God for 
all, and to Him all creation is one.  We must obey God, 
and strive to follow Him by leaving all our prejudices 
and bringing about peace on earth.  
 
 
VI.--The sixth principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
         Equal opportunity of the means of Existence 
 
     Every human being has the right to live; they have a 
 
+P132 
right to rest, and to a certain amount of well-being.  As 
a rich man is able to live in his palace surrounded by 
luxury and the greatest comfort, so should a poor man 
be able to have the necessaries of life.  Nobody should 
die of hunger; everybody should have sufficient 
clothing; one man should not live in excess while 
another has no possible means of existence.  
     Let us try with all the strength we have to bring 
about happier conditions, so that no single soul may 
be destitute.  
 
 
VII.--The seventh principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
        The Equality of Men--equality before the Law 
 
     The Law must reign, and not the individual; thus 
will the world become a place of beauty and true 
brotherhood will be realized.  Having attained solidarity, 
men will have found truth.  
 
 
VIII.--The eighth principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
                       Universal Peace 
 
     A Supreme Tribunal shall be elected by the peoples 
and governments of every nation, where members 
from each country and government shall assemble in 
unity.  All disputes shall be brought before this Court, 
its mission being to prevent war.  
 
 
IX.--The ninth principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
   That Religion should not concern itself with Political 
                          Questions 
 
     Religion is concerned with things of the spirit, 
politics with things of the world.  Religion has to work 
 
+P133 
with the world of thought, whilst the field of politics 
lies with the world of external conditions.  
     It is the work of the clergy to educate the people, to 
instruct them, to give them good advice and teaching 
so that they may progress spiritually.  With political 
questions they have nothing to do.  
 
 
X.--The tenth principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
             Education and Instruction of Women 
 
     Women have equal rights with men upon earth; 
in religion and society they are a very important 
element.  As long as women are prevented from attaining 
their highest possibilities, so long will men be unable 
to achieve the greatness which might be theirs.  
 
 
XI.--The eleventh principle of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
 
   The Power of the Holy Spirit, by which alone Spiritual 
                   Development is achieved 
 
     It is only by the breath of the Holy Spirit that 
spiritual development can come about.  No matter 
how the material world may progress, no matter how 
splendidly it may adorn itself, it can never be anything 
but a lifeless body unless the soul is within, for it is the 
soul that animates the body; the body alone has no real 
significance.  Deprived of the blessings of the Holy 
Spirit the material body would be inert.  
     Here are, very briefly explained, some of the principles 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     In short, it behoves us all to be lovers of truth.  Let 
us seek her in every season and in every country, being 
 
+P134 
careful never to attach ourselves to personalities.  Let us 
see the light wherever it shines, and may we be enabled 
to recognize the light of truth no matter where it may 
arise.  Let us inhale the perfume of the rose from the 
midst of thorns which surround it; let us drink the 
running water from every pure spring.  
     Since I arrived in Paris, it has given me much pleasure 
to meet such Parisians as you are, for praise be to God, 
you are intelligent, unprejudiced, and you long to 
know the truth.  You have in your hearts the love 
of humanity, and as far as you are able, you exert 
yourselves in the cause of charitable work and in 
the bringing about of unity; this is especially what 
&amp;Baha'u'llah desired.  
     It is for this reason that I am so happy to be among 
you, and I pray for you, that you may be receptacles 
for the Blessings of God, and that you may be the 
means of spreading spirituality throughout this 
country.  
     You already have a wonderful material civilization 
and in like manner shall spiritual civilization be yours.  
     Monsieur Bleck thanked &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and he 
replied:  
     `I am very grateful to you for the kind sentiments 
which you have just uttered.  I hope that these two 
movements will ere long be spread all over the earth.  
Then will the unity of humanity have pitched its tent 
in the centre of the world.'  
 
+P135 
          THE FIRST PRINCIPLE--SEARCH AFTER TRUTH 
 
                           4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris 
                                               November 10th 
     The first principle of the Teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
is:  
 
                   The Search after Truth 
 
     If a man would succeed in his search after truth, he 
must, in the first place, shut his eyes to all the traditional 
superstitions of the past.  
     The Jews have traditional superstitions, the Buddhists 
and the Zoroastrians are not free from them, neither 
are the Christians!  All religions have gradually become 
bound by tradition and dogma.  
     All consider themselves, respectively, the only guardians 
of the truth, and that every other religion is 
composed of errors.  They themselves are right, all 
others are wrong!  The Jews believe that they are the 
only possessors of the truth and condemn all other 
religions.  The Christians affirm that their religion is 
the only true one, that all others are false.  Likewise 
the Buddhists and &amp;Muhammadans; all limit themselves.  
If all condemn one another, where shall we search for 
truth?  All contradicting one another, all cannot be 
true.  If each believe his particular religion to be the 
only true one, he blinds his eyes to the truth in the 
others.  If, for instance, a Jew is bound by the external 
practice of the religion of Israel, he does not permit 
himself to perceive that truth can exist in any other 
religion; it must be all contained in his own!  
 
+P136 
     We should, therefore, detach ourselves from the 
external forms and practices of religion.  We must 
realize that these forms and practices, however beautiful, 
are but garments clothing the warm heart and the 
living limbs of Divine truth.  We must abandon the 
prejudices of tradition if we would succeed in finding 
the truth at the core of all religions.  If a Zoroastrian 
believes that the Sun is God, how can he be united to 
other religions?  While idolaters believe in their various 
idols, how can they understand the oneness of God?  
     It is, therefore, clear that in order to make any progress 
in the search after truth we must relinquish 
superstition.  If all seekers would follow this principle 
they would obtain a clear vision of the truth.  
     If five people meet together to seek for truth, they 
must begin by cutting themselves free from all their 
own special conditions and renouncing all preconceived 
ideas.  In order to find truth we must give up 
our prejudices, our own small trivial notions; an open 
receptive mind is essential.  If our chalice is full of self, 
there is no room in it for the water of life.  The fact that 
we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else 
wrong is the greatest of all obstacles in the path towards 
unity, and unity is necessary if we would reach truth, 
for truth is one.  
     Therefore it is imperative that we should renounce 
our own particular prejudices and superstitions if we 
earnestly desire to seek the truth.  Unless we make a 
distinction in our minds between dogma, superstition 
and prejudice on the one hand, and truth on the other, 
we cannot succeed.  When we are in earnest in our 
 
+P137 
search for anything we look for it everywhere.  This 
principle we must carry out in our search for truth.  
     Science must be accepted.  No one truth can contradict 
another truth.  Light is good in whatsoever 
lamp it is burning!  A rose is beautiful in whatsoever 
garden it may bloom!  A star has the same radiance 
if it shines from the East or from the West.  Be free 
from prejudice, so will you love the Sun of Truth from 
whatsoever point in the horizon it may arise!  You will 
realize that if the Divine light of truth shone in Jesus 
Christ it also shone in Moses and in Buddha.  The 
earnest seeker will arrive at this truth.  This is what is 
meant by the `Search after Truth'.  
     It means, also, that we must be willing to clear away 
all that we have previously learned, all that would clog 
our steps on the way to truth; we must not shrink if 
necessary from beginning our education all over again.  
We must not allow our love for any one religion or 
any one personality to so blind our eyes that we become 
fettered by superstition!  When we are freed 
from all these bonds, seeking with liberated minds, 
then shall we be able to arrive at our goal.  
     `Seek the truth, the truth shall make you free.'  So 
shall we see the truth in all religions, for truth is in all 
and truth is one!  
 
+P138 
             THE SECOND PRINCIPLE--THE UNITY OF 
                           MANKIND 
 
                                            November 11th 
     I spoke yesterday of the first principle of the Teaching 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, `The Search for Truth'; how it is 
necessary for a man to put aside all in the nature of 
superstition, and every tradition which would blind his 
eyes to the existence of truth in all religions.  He must 
not, while loving and clinging to one form of religion, 
permit himself to detest all others.  It is essential that 
he search for truth in all religions, and, if his seeking 
be in earnest, he will assuredly succeed.  
     Now the first discovery which we make in our 
`Search after Truth', will lead us to the second principle, 
which is the `Unity of Mankind'.  All men are servants 
of the One God.  One God reigns over all the nations 
of the world and has pleasure in all His children.  All 
men are of one family; the crown of humanity rests 
on the head of every human being.  
     In the eyes of the Creator all His children are equal; 
His goodness is poured forth on all.  He does not favour 
this nation nor that nation, all alike are His creatures.  
This being so, why should we make divisions, separating 
one race from another?  Why should we create 
barriers of superstition and tradition bringing discord 
and hatred among the people?  
     The only difference between members of the human 
family is that of degree.  Some are like children who are 
ignorant, and must be educated until they arrive at 
maturity.  Some are like the sick and must be treated 
 
+P139 
with tenderness and care.  None are bad or evil!  We 
must not be repelled by these poor children.  We must 
treat them with great kindness, teaching the ignorant 
and tenderly nursing the sick.  
     Consider:  Unity is necessary to existence.  Love is 
the very cause of life; on the other hand, separation 
brings death.  In the world of material creation, for 
instance, all things owe their actual life to unity.  The 
elements which compose wood, mineral, or stone, are 
held together by the law of attraction.  If this law 
should cease for one moment to operate these elements 
would not hold together, they would fall apart, and the 
object would in that particular form cease to exist.  
The law of attraction has brought together certain 
elements in the form of this beautiful flower, but when 
that attraction is withdrawn from this centre the flower 
will decompose, and, as a flower, cease to exist.  
     So it is with the great body of humanity.  The 
wonderful Law of Attraction, Harmony and Unity, 
holds together this marvellous Creation.  
     As with the whole, so with the parts; whether a 
flower or a human body, when the attracting principle 
is withdrawn from it, the flower or the man dies.  It is 
therefore clear that attraction, harmony, unity and 
Love, are the cause of life, whereas repulsion, discord, 
hatred and separation bring death.  
     We have seen that whatever brings division into the 
world of existence causes death.  Likewise in the world 
of the spirit does the same law operate.  
     Therefore should every servant of the One God be 
obedient to the law of love, avoiding all hatred, 
 
+P140 
discord, and strife.  We find when we observe nature, 
that the gentler animals group themselves together into 
flocks and herds, whereas the savage, ferocious creatures, 
such as the lion, the tiger, and the wolf, live in 
wild forests, apart from civilization.  Two wolves, or 
two lions, may live amicably together; but a thousand 
lambs may share the same fold and a large number of 
deer can form one herd.  Two eagles can dwell in the 
same place, but a thousand doves can gather into one 
habitation.  
     Man should, at least, be numbered among the 
gentler animals; but when he becomes ferocious he is 
more cruel and malicious than the most savage of the 
animal creation!  
     Now &amp;Baha'u'llah has proclaimed the `Unity of the 
World of Mankind'.  All peoples and nations are of 
one family, the children of one Father, and should be 
to one another as brothers and sisters!  I hope that you 
will endeavour in your lives to show forth and spread 
this teaching.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah said that we should love even our 
enemies and be to them as friends.  If all men were 
obedient to this principle, the greatest unity and 
understanding would be established in the hearts of 
mankind.  
 
 
                       THIRD PRINCIPLE 
 
['That religion ought to be a Cause of Love and 
Affection' is much emphasized in many of the

          FOURTH PRINCIPLE--THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
           RELATION BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE 
 
                             4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                              November 12th 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  
     I have spoken to you of some of the principles 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah:  The Search after Truth and The Unity 
of Mankind.  I will now explain the Fourth Principle, 
which is The Acceptance of the Relation between Religion 
and Science.  
     There is no contradiction between true religion and 
science.  When a religion is opposed to science it 
becomes mere superstition:  that which is contrary to 
knowledge is ignorance.  
     How can a man believe to be a fact that which 
science has proved to be impossible?  If he believes 
in spite of his reason, it is rather ignorant superstition 
than faith.  The true principles of all religions are in 
conformity with the teachings of science.  
     The Unity of God is logical, and this idea is not 
antagonistic to the conclusions arrived at by scientific 
study.  
     All religions teach that we must do good, that we 
must be generous, sincere, truthful, law-abiding, and 
faithful; all this is reasonable, and logically the only 
way in which humanity can progress.  
     All religious laws conform to reason, and are suited 
 
+P142 
to the people for whom they are framed, and for the 
age in which they are to be obeyed.  
     Religion has two main parts:  
                  (1) The Spiritual.  
                  (2) The Practical.  
     The spiritual part never changes.  All the Manifestations 
of God and His Prophets have taught the same 
truths and given the same spiritual law.  They all 
teach the one code of morality.  There is no division in 
the truth.  The Sun has sent forth many rays to illumine 
human intelligence, the light is always the same.  
     The practical part of religion deals with exterior 
forms and ceremonies, and with modes of punishment 
for certain offences.  This is the material side of the law, 
and guides the customs and manners of the people.  
     In the time of Moses, there were ten crimes punishable 
by death.  When Christ came this was changed; 
the old axiom `an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a 
tooth' was converted into `Love your enemies, do 
good to them that hate you', the stern old law being 
changed into one of love, mercy and forbearance!  
     In the former days the punishment for theft was the 
cutting off of the right hand; in our time this law could 
not be so applied.  In this age, a man who curses his 
father is allowed to live, when formerly he would have 
been put to death.  It is therefore evident that whilst the 
spiritual law never alters, the practical rules must change 
their application with the necessities of the time.  The 
spiritual aspect of religion is the greater, the more 
important of the two, and this is the same for all time, 
it never changes!  It is the same, yesterday, today, and 
 
+P143 
for ever!  `As it was the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be.'  
     Now, all questions of morality contained in the 
spiritual, immutable law of every religion are logically 
right.  If religion were contrary to logical reason 
then it would cease to be a religion and be merely a 
tradition.  Religion and science are the two wings upon 
which man's intelligence can soar into the heights, with 
which the human soul can progress.  It is not possible 
to fly with one wing alone!  Should a man try to fly 
with the wing of religion alone he would quickly 
fall into the quagmire of superstition, whilst on the 
other hand, with the wing of science alone he would 
also make no progress, but fall into the despairing 
slough of materialism.  All religions of the present day 
have fallen into superstitious practices, out of harmony 
alike with the true principles of the teaching they represent 
and with the scientific discoveries of the time.  
Many religious leaders have grown to think that the 
importance of religion lies mainly in the adherence 
to a collection of certain dogmas and the practice of 
rites and ceremonies!  Those whose souls they profess 
to cure are taught to believe likewise, and these cling 
tenaciously to the outward forms, confusing them 
with the inward truth.  
     Now, these forms and rituals differ in the various 
churches and amongst the different sects, and even 
contradict one another; giving rise to discord, hatred, 
and disunion.  The outcome of all this dissension is the 
belief of many cultured men that religion and science 
are contradictory terms, that religion needs no powers 
 
+P144 
of reflection, and should in no wise be regulated by 
science, but must of necessity be opposed, the one to 
the other.  The unfortunate effect of this is that science 
has drifted apart from religion, and religion has become 
a mere blind and more or less apathetic following of 
the precepts of certain religious teachers, who insist 
on their own favourite dogmas being accepted even 
when they are contrary to science.  This is foolishness, 
for it is quite evident that science is the light, and, 
being so, religion truly so-called does not oppose 
knowledge.  
     We are familiar with the phrases `Light and Darkness', 
`Religion and Science'.  But the religion which 
does not walk hand in hand with science is itself in the 
darkness of superstition and ignorance.  
     Much of the discord and disunion of the world is 
created by these man-made oppositions and contradictions.  
If religion were in harmony with science and 
they walked together, much of the hatred and bitterness 
now bringing misery to the human race would be at 
an end.  
     Consider what it is that singles man out from among 
created beings, and makes of him a creature apart.  
Is it not his reasoning power, his intelligence?  Shall he 
not make use of these in his study of religion?  I say 
unto you:  weigh carefully in the balance of reason and 
science everything that is presented to you as religion.  
If it passes this test, then accept it, for it is truth!  If, 
however, it does not so conform, then reject it, for 
it is ignorance!  
     Look around and see how the world of today is 
 
+P145 
drowned in superstition and outward forms!  
     Some worship the product of their own imagination:  
they make for themselves an imaginary God and adore 
this, when the creation of their finite minds cannot be 
the Infinite Mighty Maker of all things visible and 
invisible!  Others worship the sun or trees, also 
stones!  In past ages there were those who adored the 
sea, the clouds, and even clay!  
     Today, men have grown into such adoring attachment 
to outward forms and ceremonies that they dispute 
over this point of ritual or that particular practice, 
until one hears on all sides of wearisome arguments and 
unrest.  There are individuals who have weak intellects 
and their powers of reasoning have not developed, but 
the strength and power of religion must not be 
doubted because of the incapacity of these persons to 
understand.  
     A small child cannot comprehend the laws that 
govern nature, but this is on account of the immature 
intellect of that child; when he is grown older and has 
been educated he too will understand the everlasting 
truths.  A child does not grasp the fact that the earth 
revolves round the sun, but, when his intelligence is 
awakened, the fact is clear and plain to him.  
     It is impossible for religion to be contrary to science, 
even though some intellects are too weak or too immature 
to understand truth.  
     God made religion and science to be the measure, as 
it were, of our understanding.  Take heed that you 
neglect not such a wonderful power.  Weigh all things 
in this balance.  
 
+P146 
     To him who has the power of comprehension 
religion is like an open book, but how can it be possible 
for a man devoid of reason and intellectuality to understand 
the Divine Realities of God?  
     Put all your beliefs into harmony with science; 
there can be no opposition, for truth is one.  When 
religion, shorn of its superstitions, traditions, and unintelligent 
dogmas, shows its conformity with science, 
then will there be a great unifying, cleansing force in 
the world which will sweep before it all wars, disagreements, 
discords and struggles--and then will 
mankind be united in the power of the Love of God.  
 
                     THE FIFTH PRINCIPLE 
 
                 THE ABOLITION OF PREJUDICES 
 
                              4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                              November 13th 
     All prejudices, whether of religion, race, politics or 
nation, must be renounced, for these prejudices 
have caused the world's sickness.  It is a grave malady 
which, unless arrested, is capable of causing the destruction 
of the whole human race.  Every ruinous war, 
with its terrible bloodshed and misery, has been caused 
by one or other of these prejudices.  
     The deplorable wars going on in these days are 
caused by the fanatical religious hatred of one people 
for another, or the prejudices of race or colour.  
 
+P147 
     Until all these barriers erected by prejudice are 
swept away, it is not possible for humanity to be at 
peace.  For this reason &amp;Baha'u'llah has said, `These 
Prejudices are destructive to mankind'.  
     Contemplate first the prejudice of religion:  consider 
the nations of so-called religious people; if they were 
truly worshippers of God they would obey His law 
which forbids them to kill one another.  
     If priests of religion really adored the God of love 
and served the Divine Light, they would teach their 
people to keep the chief Commandment, `To be in 
love and charity with all men'.  But we find the contrary, 
for it is often the priests who encourage nations 
to fight.  Religious hatred is ever the most cruel!  
     All religions teach that we should love one another; 
that we should seek out our own shortcomings before 
we presume to condemn the faults of others, that we 
must not consider ourselves superior to our neighbours!  
We must be careful not to exalt ourselves lest we be 
humiliated.  
     Who are we that we should judge?  How shall we 
know who, in the sight of God, is the most upright 
man?  God's thoughts are not like our thoughts!  How 
many men who have seemed saint-like to their friends 
have fallen into the greatest humiliation.  Think of 
Judas Iscariot; he began well, but remember his end!  
On the other hand, Paul, the Apostle, was in his early 
life an enemy of Christ, whilst later he became His 
most faithful servant.  How then can we flatter ourselves 
and despise others?  
     Let us therefore be humble, without prejudices, 
 
+P148 
preferring others' good to our own!  Let us never say, 
`I am a believer but he is an infidel', `I am near to God, 
whilst he is an outcast'.  We can never know what 
will be the final judgment!  Therefore let us help all 
who are in need of any kind of assistance.  
     Let us teach the ignorant, and take care of the young 
child until he grows to maturity.  When we find a 
person fallen into the depths of misery or sin we must 
be kind to him, take him by the hand, help him to 
regain his footing, his strength; we must guide him 
with love and tenderness, treat him as a friend not as 
an enemy.  
     We have no right to look upon any of our fellow-mortals 
as evil.  
     Concerning the prejudice of race:  it is an illusion, a 
superstition pure and simple!  For God created us all of 
one race.  There were no differences in the beginning, 
for we are all descendants of Adam.  In the beginning, 
also, there were no limits and boundaries between the 
different lands; no part of the earth belonged more to 
one people than to another.  In the sight of God there 
is no difference between the various races.  Why should 
man invent such a prejudice?  How can we uphold war 
caused by an illusion?  
     God has not created men that they should destroy 
one another.  All races, tribes, sects and classes share 
equally in the Bounty of their Heavenly Father.  
     The only difference lies in the degree of faithfulness, 
of obedience to the laws of God.  There are some who 
are as lighted torches, there are others who shine as 
stars in the sky of humanity.  The lovers of mankind, 
 
+P149 
these are the superior men, of whatever nation, creed, 
or colour they may be.  For it is they to whom God 
will say these blessed words, `Well done, My good and 
faithful servants'.  In that day He will not ask, `Are 
you English, French, or perhaps Persian?  Do you come 
from the East, or from the West?'  
     The only division that is real is this:  There are 
heavenly men and earthly men; self-sacrificing servants 
of humanity in the love of the Most High, bringing 
harmony and unity, teaching peace and goodwill to 
men.  On the other hand there are those selfish men, 
haters of their brethren, in whose hearts prejudice has 
replaced loving kindness, and whose influence breeds 
discord and strife.  
     To which race or to which colour belong these two 
divisions of men, to the White, to the Yellow, to the 
Black, to the East or to the West, to the North or to 
the South?  If these are God's divisions, why should we 
invent others?  Political prejudice is equally mischievous, 
it is one of the greatest causes of bitter strife 
amongst the children of men.  There are people who 
find pleasure in breeding discord, who constantly endeavour 
to goad their country into making war upon 
other nations--and why?  They think to advantage 
their own country to the detriment of all others.  They 
send armies to harass and destroy the land, in order to 
become famous in the world, for the joy of conquest.  
That it may be said:  `Such a country has defeated another, 
and brought it under the yoke of their stronger, 
more superior rule'.  This victory, bought at the price 
of much bloodshed, is not lasting!  The conqueror 
 
+P150 
shall one day be conquered; and the vanquished 
ones victorious!  Remember the history of the past:  
did not France conquer Germany more than once--
then did not the German nation overcome France?  
     We learn also that France conquered England; 
then was the English nation victorious over France!  
     These glorious conquests are so ephemeral!  Why 
attach so great importance to them and to their fame, 
as to be willing to shed the blood of the people for their 
attainment?  Is any victory worth the inevitable train 
of evils consequent upon human slaughter, the grief 
and sorrow and ruin which must overwhelm so many 
homes of both nations?  For it is not possible that one 
country alone should suffer.  
     Oh!  why will man, the disobedient child of God, 
who should be an example of the power of the spiritual 
law, turn his face away from the Divine Teaching and 
put all his effort into destruction and war?  
     My hope is that in this enlightened century the 
Divine Light of love will shed its radiance over the 
whole world, seeking out the responsive heart's intelligence 
of every human being; that the light of the Sun 
of Truth will lead politicians to shake off all the claims 
of prejudice and superstition, and with freed minds to 
follow the Policy of God:  for Divine Politics are 
mighty, man's politics are feeble!  God has created all 
the world, and bestows His Divine Bounty upon every 
creature.  
     Are we not the servants of God?  Shall we neglect 
to follow our Master's Example, and ignore His 
Commands?  
 
+P151 
     I pray that the Kingdom shall come on Earth, and 
that all darkness shall be driven away by the effulgence 
of the Heavenly Sun.  
 
 
          THE SIXTH PRINCIPLE--MEANS OF EXISTENCE 
 
                                 4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris 
     One of the most important principles of the 
Teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah is:  
     The right of every human being to the daily bread 
whereby they exist, or the equalization of the means of 
livelihood.  
     The arrangements of the circumstances of the people 
must be such that poverty shall disappear, that everyone, 
as far as possible, according to his rank and 
position, shall share in comfort and well-being.  
     We see amongst us men who are overburdened with 
riches on the one hand, and on the other those unfortunate 
ones who starve with nothing; those who possess 
several stately palaces, and those who have not where 
to lay their head.  Some we find with numerous courses 
of costly and dainty food; whilst others can scarce find 
sufficient crusts to keep them alive.  Whilst some are 
clothed in velvets, furs and fine linen, others have insufficient, 
poor and thin garments with which to 
protect them from the cold.  
     This condition of affairs is wrong, and must be 
remedied.  Now the remedy must be carefully undertaken.  
It cannot be done by bringing to pass absolute 
equality between men.  
 
+P152 
     Equality is a chimera!  It is entirely impracticable!  
Even if equality could be achieved it could not continue
--and if its existence were possible, the whole order of 
the world would be destroyed.  The law of order must 
always obtain in the world of humanity.  Heaven has 
so decreed in the creation of man.  
     Some are full of intelligence, others have an ordinary 
amount of it, and others again are devoid of intellect.  
In these three classes of men there is order but not 
equality.  How could it be possible that wisdom and 
stupidity should be equal?  Humanity, like a great army, 
requires a general, captains, under-officers in their 
degree, and soldiers, each with their own appointed 
duties.  Degrees are absolutely necessary to ensure 
an orderly organization.  An army could not be composed 
of generals alone, or of captains only, or of 
nothing but soldiers without one in authority.  The 
certain result of such a plan would be that disorder 
and demoralization would overtake the whole army.  
     King Lycurgus, the philosopher, made a great plan 
to equalize the subjects of Sparta; with self-sacrifice 
and wisdom was the experiment begun.  Then the 
king called the people of his kingdom, and made them 
swear a great oath to maintain the same order of 
government if he should leave the country, also that 
nothing should make them alter it until his return.  
Having secured this oath, he left his kingdom of Sparta 
and never returned.  Lycurgus abandoned the situation, 
renouncing his high position, thinking to achieve the 
permanent good of his country by the equalization of 
the property and of the conditions of life in his kingdom.  
 
+P153 
All the self-sacrifice of the king was in vain.  The 
great experiment failed.  After a time all was destroyed; 
his carefully thought-out constitution came to an end.  
     The futility of attempting such a scheme was shown 
and the impossibility of attaining equal conditions 
of existence was proclaimed in the ancient kingdom of 
Sparta.  In our day any such attempt would be equally 
doomed to failure.  
     Certainly, some being enormously rich and others 
lamentably poor, an organization is necessary to control 
and improve this state of affairs.  It is important to 
limit riches, as it is also of importance to limit poverty.  
Either extreme is not good.  To be seated in the mean+F1 
is most desirable.  If it be right for a capitalist to possess 
a large fortune, it is equally just that his workman 
should have a sufficient means of existence.  
     A financier with colossal wealth should not exist 
whilst near him is a poor man in dire necessity.  When 
we see poverty allowed to reach a condition of starvation 
it is a sure sign that somewhere we shall find 
tyranny.  Men must bestir themselves in this matter, 
and no longer delay in altering conditions which bring 
the misery of grinding poverty to a very large number 
of the people.  The rich must give of their abundance, 
they must soften their hearts and cultivate a compassionate 
intelligence, taking thought for those sad 
ones who are suffering from lack of the very necessities 
of life.  
     There must be special laws made, dealing with these 
extremes of riches and of want.  The members of the 
 
+F1 `Give me neither poverty nor riches.'--Prov. xxx., 8.  
 
+P154 
Government should consider the laws of God when 
they are framing plans for the ruling of the people.  
The general rights of mankind must be guarded and 
preserved.  
     The government of the countries should conform 
to the Divine Law which gives equal justice to all.  
This is the only way in which the deplorable superfluity 
of great wealth and miserable, demoralizing, 
degrading poverty can be abolished.  Not until this is 
done will the Law of God be obeyed.  
 
 
             SEVENTH PRINCIPLE--EQUALITY OF MEN 
 
     `The Laws of God are not imposition of will, or 
of power, or pleasure, but the resolutions of 
truth, reason and justice.'  
     All men are equal before the law, which must reign 
absolutely.  
     The object of punishment is not vengeance, but the 
prevention of crime.  
     Kings must rule with wisdom and justice; prince, 
peer and peasant alike have equal rights to just treatment, 
there must be no favour shown to individuals.  A 
judge must be no `respecter of persons', but administer 
the law with strict impartiality in every case brought 
before him.  
     If a person commit a crime against you, you have 
not the right to forgive him; but the law must punish 
him in order to prevent a repetition of that same crime 
by others, as the pain of the individual is unimportant 
beside the general welfare of the people.  
 
+P155 
     When perfect justice reigns in every country of the 
Eastern and Western World, then will the earth become 
a place of beauty.  The dignity and equality of 
every servant of God will be acknowledged; the ideal 
of the solidarity of the human race, the true brotherhood 
of man, will be realized; and the glorious light 
of the Sun of Truth will illumine the souls of all men.  
 
 
                    THE EIGHTH PRINCIPLE 
 
                       UNIVERSAL PEACE 
 
                              4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris 
     A Supreme Tribunal shall be established by the 
peoples and Governments of every nation, composed 
of members elected from each country and 
Government.  The members of this Great Council shall 
assemble in unity.  All disputes of an international 
character shall be submitted to this Court, its work 
being to arrange by arbitration everything which 
otherwise would be a cause of war.  The mission of 
this Tribunal would be to prevent war.  
     One of the great steps towards universal peace 
would be the establishment of a universal language.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah commands that the servants of humanity 
should meet together, and either choose a language 
which now exists, or form a new one.  This was revealed 
in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas forty years ago.  It is there 
pointed out that the question of diversity of tongues 
is a very difficult one.  There are more than eight 
 
+P156 
hundred languages in the world, and no person could 
acquire them all.  
     The races of mankind are not isolated as in former 
days.  Now, in order to be in close relationship with all 
countries it is necessary to be able to speak their 
tongues.  
     A universal language would make intercourse possible 
with every nation.  Thus it would be needful to 
know two languages only, the mother tongue and the 
universal speech.  The latter would enable a man to 
communicate with any and every man in the world!  
     A third language would not be needed.  To be able 
to talk with a member of any race and country without 
requiring an interpreter, how helpful and restful to all!  
     Esperanto has been drawn up with this end in view:  
it is a fine invention and a splendid piece of work, but 
it needs perfecting.  Esperanto as it stands is very 
difficult for some people.  
     An international Congress should be formed, consisting 
of delegates from every nation in the world, 
Eastern as well as Western.  This Congress should form 
a language that could be acquired by all, and every 
country would thereby reap great benefit.  
     Until such a language is in use, the world will continue 
to feel the vast need of this means of intercourse.  
Difference of speech is one of the most fruitful causes 
of dislike and distrust that exists between nations, 
which are kept apart by their inability to understand 
each other's language more than by any other reason.  
     If everybody could speak one language, how much 
more easy would it be to serve humanity!  
 
+P157 
     Therefore appreciate `Esperanto', for it is the beginning 
of the carrying out of one of the most important 
of the Laws of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and it must continue to be 
improved and perfected.  
 
 
                       NINTH PRINCIPLE 
 
            THE NON-INTERFERENCE OF RELIGION WITH 
                           POLITICS 
 
                             4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                             November 17th 
     In the conduct of life, man is actuated by two main 
motives:  `The Hope for Reward' and `The Fear 
of Punishment'.  
     This hope and this fear must consequently be greatly 
taken into account by those in authority who have 
important posts under Government.  Their business 
in life is to consult together for the framing of laws, 
and to provide for their just administration.  
     The tent of the order of the world is raised and 
established on the two pillars of `Reward and Retribution'.  
     In despotic Governments carried on by men without 
Divine faith, where no fear of spiritual retribution 
exists, the execution of the laws is tyrannical and unjust.  
     There is no greater prevention of oppression than 
these two sentiments, hope and fear.  They have both 
political and spiritual consequences.  
     If administrators of the law would take into consideration 
 
+P158 
the spiritual consequences of their decisions, 
and follow the guidance of religion, `They would be 
Divine agents in the world of action, the representatives 
of God for those who are on earth, and they would 
defend, for the love of God, the interests of His servants 
as they would defend their own'.  If a governor realizes 
his responsibility, and fears to defy the Divine Law, 
his judgments will be just.  Above all, if he believes 
that the consequences of his actions will follow him 
beyond his earthly life, and that `as he sows so must 
he reap', such a man will surely avoid injustice and 
tyranny.  
     Should an official, on the contrary, think that all 
responsibility for his actions must end with his earthly 
life, knowing and believing nothing of Divine favours 
and a spiritual kingdom of joy, he will lack the incentive 
to just dealing, and the inspiration to destroy oppression 
and unrighteousness.  
     When a ruler knows that his judgments will be 
weighed in a balance by the Divine Judge, and that if 
he be not found wanting he will come into the Celestial 
Kingdom and that the light of the Heavenly Bounty 
will shine upon him, then will he surely act with justice 
and equity.  Behold how important it is that Ministers 
of State should be enlightened by religion!  
     With political questions the clergy, however, have 
nothing to do!  Religious matters should not be confused 
with politics in the present state of the world 
(for their interests are not identical).  
     Religion concerns matters of the heart, of the spirit, 
and of morals.  
 
+P159 
     Politics are occupied with the material things of life.  
Religious teachers should not invade the realm of 
politics; they should concern themselves with the 
spiritual education of the people; they should ever give 
good counsel to men, trying to serve God and human 
kind; they should endeavour to awaken spiritual 
aspiration, and strive to enlarge the understanding and 
knowledge of humanity, to improve morals, and to 
increase the love for justice.  
     This is in accordance with the Teaching of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  In the Gospel also it is written, `Render 
unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto 
God the things which are God's'.  
     In Persia there are some amongst the important 
Ministers of State who are religious, who are exemplary, 
who worship God, and who fear to disobey His 
Laws, who judge justly and rule their people with 
Equity.  Other Governors there are in this land who 
have no fear of God before their eyes, who think not 
of the consequences of their actions, working for their 
own desires, and these have brought Persia into great 
trouble and difficulty.  
     Oh, friends of God, be living examples of justice!  
So that by the Mercy of God, the world may see in 
your actions that you manifest the attributes of justice 
and mercy.  
     Justice is not limited, it is a universal quality.  Its 
operation must be carried out in all classes, from the 
highest to the lowest.  Justice must be sacred, and the 
rights of all the people must be considered.  Desire for 
others only that which you desire for yourselves.  Then 
 
+P160 
shall we rejoice in the Sun of Justice, which shines from 
the Horizon of God.  
     Each man has been placed in a post of honour, which 
he must not desert.  A humble workman who commits 
an injustice is as much to blame as a renowned tyrant.  
Thus we all have our choice between justice and 
injustice.  
     I hope that each one of you will become just, and 
direct your thoughts towards the unity of mankind; 
that you will never harm your neighbours nor speak 
ill of any one; that you will respect the rights of all 
men, and be more concerned for the interests of others 
than for your own.  Thus will you become torches of 
Divine justice, acting in accordance with the Teaching 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, who, during His life, bore innumerable 
trials and persecutions in order to show forth to the 
world of mankind the virtues of the World of Divinity, 
making it possible for you to realize the supremacy of 
the spirit, and to rejoice in the Justice of God.  
     By His Mercy, the Divine Bounty will be showered 
upon you, and for this I pray!  
 
 
           THE TENTH PRINCIPLE--EQUALITY OF SEX 
 
                               4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                             November 14th 
     The Tenth Principle of the teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
is the equality of the sexes.  
     God has created all creatures in couples.  Man, 
beast, or vegetable, all the things of these three kingdoms 
 
+P161 
are of two sexes, and there is absolute equality 
between them.  
     In the vegetable world there are male plants and 
female plants; they have equal rights, and possess an 
equal share of the beauty of their species; though indeed 
the tree that bears fruit might be said to be 
superior to that which is unfruitful.  
     In the animal kingdom we see that the male and the 
female have equal rights; and that they each share the 
advantages of their kind.  
     Now in the two lower kingdoms of nature we have 
seen that there is no question of the superiority of one 
sex over the other.  In the world of humanity we find 
a great difference; the female sex is treated as though 
inferior, and is not allowed equal rights and privileges.  
This condition is due not to nature, but to education.  
In the Divine Creation there is no such distinction.  
Neither sex is superior to the other in the sight of God.  
Why then should one sex assert the inferiority of the 
other, withholding just rights and privileges as though 
God had given His authority for such a course of 
action?  If women received the same educational advantages 
as those of men, the result would demonstrate 
the equality of capacity of both for scholarship.  
     In some respects woman is superior to man.  She is 
more tender-hearted, more receptive, her intuition is 
more intense.  
     It is not to be denied that in various directions woman 
at present is more backward than man, also that this 
temporary inferiority is due to the lack of educational 
opportunity.  In the necessity of life, woman is more 
 
+P162 
instinct with power than man, for to her he owes his 
very existence.  
     If the mother is educated then her children will be 
well taught.  When the mother is wise, then will the 
children be led into the path of wisdom.  If the mother 
be religious she will show her children how they should 
love God.  If the mother is moral she guides her little 
ones into the ways of uprightness.  
     It is clear therefore that the future generation depends 
on the mothers of today.  Is not this a vital responsibility 
for the woman?  Does she not require every 
possible advantage to equip her for such a task?  
     Therefore, surely, God is not pleased that so important 
an instrument as woman should suffer from 
want of training in order to attain the perfections 
desirable and necessary for her great life's work!  
Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes 
should be equally respected since neither is superior to 
the other in the eyes of Heaven.  Dignity before God 
depends, not on sex, but on purity and luminosity of 
heart.  Human virtues belong equally to all!  
     Woman must endeavour then to attain greater 
perfection, to be man's equal in every respect, to make 
progress in all in which she has been backward, so that 
man will be compelled to acknowledge her equality of 
capacity and attainment.  
     In Europe women have made greater progress than 
in the East, but there is still much to be done!  When 
students have arrived at the end of their school term 
an examination takes place, and the result thereof 
determines the knowledge and capacity of each student.  
 
+P163 
So will it be with woman; her actions will show her 
power, there will no longer be any need to proclaim it 
by words.  
     It is my hope that women of the East, as well as their 
Western sisters, will progress rapidly until humanity 
shall reach perfection.  
     God's Bounty is for all and gives power for all 
progress.  When men own the equality of women there 
will be no need for them to struggle for their rights!  
One of the principles then of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the equality 
of sex.  
     Women must make the greatest effort to acquire 
spiritual power and to increase in the virtue of wisdom 
and holiness until their enlightenment and striving 
succeeds in bringing about the unity of mankind.  They 
must work with a burning enthusiasm to spread the 
Teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah among the peoples, so that 
the radiant light of the Divine Bounty may envelop 
the souls of all the nations of the world!  
 
 
                   THE ELEVENTH PRINCIPLE 
 
                THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 
 
                               4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                               November 18th 
     In the teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah, it is written:  `By the 
Power of the Holy Spirit alone is man able to 
progress, for the power of man is limited and the 
Divine Power is boundless.'  The reading of history 
 
+P164 
brings us to the conclusion that all truly great men, the 
benefactors of the human race, those who have moved 
men to love the right and hate the wrong and who 
have caused real progress, all these have been inspired 
by the force of the Holy Spirit.  
     The Prophets of God have not all graduated in the 
schools of learned philosophy; indeed they were often 
men of humble birth, to all appearance ignorant, unknown 
men of no importance in the eyes of the world; 
sometimes even lacking the knowledge of reading and 
writing.  
     That which raised these great ones above men, and 
by which they were able to become Teachers of the 
truth, was the power of the Holy Spirit.  Their influence 
on humanity, by virtue of this mighty inspiration, 
was great and penetrating.  
     The influence of the wisest philosophers, without this 
Spirit Divine, has been comparatively unimportant, 
however extensive their learning and deep their 
scholarship.  
     The unusual intellects, for instance, of Plato, Aristotle, 
Pliny and Socrates, have not influenced men so 
greatly that they have been anxious to sacrifice their 
lives for their teachings; whilst some of those simple 
men so moved humanity that thousands of men have 
become willing martyrs to uphold their words; for 
these words were inspired by the Divine Spirit of God!  
The prophets of Judah and Israel, Elijah, Jeremiah, 
Isaiah and Ezekiel, were humble men, as were also 
the apostles of Jesus Christ.  
     Peter, the chief of the apostles, used to divide the 
 
+P165 
proceeds of his fishing into seven parts, and when, 
having taken one part for each day's use, he arrived 
at the seventh portion, he knew it was the Sabbath day.  
Consider this! and then think of his future position; 
to what glory he attained because the Holy Spirit 
wrought great works through him.  
     We understand that the Holy Spirit is the energizing 
factor in the life of man.  Whosoever receives this 
power is able to influence all with whom he comes into 
contact.  
     The greatest philosophers without this Spirit are 
powerless, their souls lifeless, their hearts dead!  Unless 
the Holy Spirit breathes into their souls, they can do no 
good work.  No system of philosophy has ever been 
able to change the manners and customs of a people 
for the better.  Learned philosophers, unenlightened by 
the Divine Spirit, have often been men of inferior 
morality; they have not proclaimed in their actions 
the reality of their beautiful phrases.  
     The difference between spiritual philosophers and 
others is shown by their lives.  The Spiritual Teacher 
shows His belief in His own teaching, by Himself being 
what He recommends to others.  
     An humble man without learning, but filled with 
the Holy Spirit, is more powerful than the most nobly-born 
profound scholar without that inspiration.  He 
who is educated by the Divine Spirit can, in his time, 
lead others to receive the same Spirit.  
     I pray for you that you may be informed by the life 
of the Divine Spirit, so that you may be the means of 
educating others.  The life and morals of a spiritual 
 
+P166 
man are, in themselves, an education to those who 
know him.  
     Think not of your own limitations, dwell only on 
the welfare of the Kingdom of Glory.  Consider the 
influence of Jesus Christ on His apostles, then think of 
their effect upon the world.  These simple men were 
enabled by the power of the Holy Spirit to spread the 
glad tidings!  
     So may you all receive Divine assistance!  No capacity 
is limited when led by the Spirit of God!  
     The earth of itself has no properties of life, it is 
barren and dry, until fertilized by the sun and the rain; 
still the earth need not bewail its own limitations.  
     May you be given life!  May the rain of the Divine 
Mercy and the warmth of the Sun of Truth make your 
gardens fruitful, so that many beautiful flowers of exquisite 
fragrance and love may blossom in abundance.  
Turn your faces away from the contemplation of your 
own finite selves and fix your eyes upon the Everlasting 
Radiance; then will your souls receive in full measure 
the Divine Power of the Spirit and the Blessings of the 
Infinite Bounty.  
     If you thus keep yourselves in readiness, you will 
become to the world of humanity a burning flame, a 
star of guidance, and a fruitful tree, changing all its 
darkness and woe into light and joy by the shining 
of the Sun of Mercy and the infinite blessings of the 
Glad Tidings.  
     This is the meaning of the power of the Holy Spirit, 
which I pray may be bountifully showered upon you.  
 
+P167 
                             4 Avenue de &amp;Camoens, Paris, 
                                            November 28th 
     In these gatherings where we have met and spoken 
together you have all become acquainted with the 
principles of this dispensation, and with the reality of 
facts.  Unto you it has been given to know these things, 
but there are many still unenlightened and submerged 
in superstition.  They have heard but little of this great 
and glorious Cause, and the knowledge they have is 
for the most part based only on hearsay.  Alas, poor 
souls, the knowledge they have is not based on truth, 
the foundation of their belief is not the teaching of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah!  There is, assuredly, a certain amount 
of truth in what they have been told, but for the most 
part their information has been inaccurate.  
     The true principles of the blessed Cause of God are 
the eleven rules which I have given you, and I have 
carefully explained these, one by one.  
     You must endeavour always to live and act in direct 
obedience to the teachings and laws of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
so that every individual may see in all the acts of your 
life that in word and in deed you are followers of the 
Blessed Perfection.  
     Exert yourselves so that this glorious teaching may 
encircle the globe, and that spirituality may be infused 
into the hearts of men.  
     The breath of the Holy Spirit shall confirm you, and 
although many will arise against you, they shall not 
prevail!  
     When the Lord Christ was crowned with thorns, 
He knew that all the diadems of the world were at His 
 
+P168 
feet.  All earthly crowns, however brilliant, powerful 
and resplendent, bowed in adoration before the crown 
of thorns!  It was from this sure and certain knowledge 
He spoke, when He said:  `All power is given unto 
Me, in Heaven and in earth'.+F1  
     Now I say unto you, bear this on your hearts and in 
your minds.  Verily your light shall illumine the whole 
world, your spirituality shall affect the heart of things.  
You shall in truth become the lighted torches of the 
globe.  Fear not, neither be dismayed, for your light 
shall penetrate the densest darkness.  This is the Promise 
of God, which I give unto you.  Rise! and serve the 
Power of God!  
 
 
                      THE LAST MEETING 
 
                                           15 Rue Greuze, Paris, 
                                                    December 1st 
     When I arrived in Paris some time ago for the 
first time, I looked around me with much 
interest, and in my mind I likened this beautiful city 
to a large garden.  
     With loving care and much thought I examined the 
soil, and found it to be very good and full of possibility 
for steadfast faith and firm belief, for a seed of God's 
love has been cast into the ground.  
     Clouds of Heavenly Mercy showered their rain upon 
it, and the Sun of Truth fell warmly upon the young 
seeds, and today one can see in your midst the birth 
 
+F1 Matthew xviii, 18.  
 
+P169 
of belief.  The seed cast into the ground has begun to 
spring up, and day by day you will see it grow.  The 
bounties of the Kingdom of &amp;Baha'u'llah shall indeed 
bring forth a wondrous harvest!  
     Behold!  I bring you glad and joyful tidings!  Paris 
will become a garden of roses!  All kinds of beautiful 
flowers will spring up and flourish in this garden, and 
the fame of their fragrance and beauty will be spread in 
all lands.  When I think of Paris in the future, I seem 
to see her bathed in the light of the Holy Spirit!  
Verily, the day is dawning when Paris will receive her 
illumination, and the Goodness and Mercy of God will 
be visible to every living creature.  
     Do not allow your minds to dwell on the present, 
but with eyes of faith look into the future, for in truth 
the Spirit of God is working in your midst.  
     Since my arrival a few weeks ago, I can see the 
growth of spirituality.  At the beginning only a few 
souls came to me for Light, but during my short sojourn 
among you the numbers have increased and 
doubled.  This is a promise for the future!  
     When Christ was crucified and left this world, He 
had only eleven disciples and a very few followers; but 
as He served the Cause of truth, look today at the result 
of His life's work!  He has illumined the world, and 
given life to dead humanity.  After His ascension little 
by little His Cause grew, the souls of His followers 
became more and more luminous, and the exquisite 
perfume of their saintly lives spread on all sides.  
     Now today, thank God, a similar condition has begun 
in Paris.  There are many souls who have turned to 
 
+P170 
the Kingdom of God, and who are attracted to unity, 
love and truth.  
     Try so to work that the goodness and mercy of &amp;Abha 
may enfold the whole of Paris.  The Breath of the Holy 
Spirit will help you, the Celestial Light of the Kingdom 
will shine in your hearts, and the blessed angels of God 
from Heaven will bring you strength and will succour 
you.  Then thank God with all your hearts that you 
have attained to this supreme benefit.  A great part of 
the world is plunged in sleep, but you have been 
awakened.  Many are blind, but you see!  
     The call of the Kingdom is heard in your midst.  
Glory be to God, you have been born again, you have 
been baptized by the fire of the Love of God; you have 
been plunged in the Sea of Life and regenerated by the 
Spirit of Love!  
     Having received such favour be thankful unto God, 
and never doubt His Goodness and Loving Kindness 
but have undying faith in the Bounties of the Kingdom.  
Consort together in brotherly love, be ready to 
lay down your lives one for the other, and not only for 
those who are dear to you, but for all humanity.  Look 
upon the whole human race as members of one family, 
all children of God; and, in so doing, you will see no 
difference between them.  
     Humanity may be likened to a tree.  This tree has 
branches, leaves, buds and fruit.  Think of all men as 
being flowers, leaves or buds of this tree, and try to 
help each and all to realize and enjoy God's blessings.  
God neglects none:  He loves all.  
     The only real difference that exists between people 
 
+P171 
is that they are at various stages of development.  Some 
are imperfect--these must be brought to perfection.  
Some are asleep--they must be awakened; some are 
negligent--they must be roused; but one and all are 
the children of God.  Love them all with your whole 
heart; no one is a stranger to the other, all are friends.  
Tonight I come to say farewell to you--but bear this 
in your minds, that although our bodies may be far 
apart, in spirit we shall always be together.  
     I bear you one and all in my heart, and will forget 
none of you--and I hope that none of you will forget 
me.  
     I in the East, and you in the West, let us try with 
heart and soul that unity may dwell in the world, that 
all the peoples may become one people, and that the 
whole surface of the earth may be like one country--
for the Sun of Truth shines on all alike.  
     All the Prophets of God came for love of this one 
great aim.  
     Look how Abraham strove to bring faith and love 
among the people; how Moses tried to unite the people 
by sound laws; how the Lord Christ suffered unto 
death to bring the light of love and truth into a darkened 
world; how &amp;Muhammad sought to bring unity 
and peace between the various uncivilized tribes among 
whom he dwelt.  And last of all, &amp;Baha'u'llah has 
suffered forty years for the same cause--the single noble 
purpose of spreading love among the children of men
--and for the peace and unity of the world the &amp;Bab 
gave up his life.  
     Thus, strive to follow the example of these Divine 
 
+P172 
Beings, drink from Their fountain, be illumined by 
Their Light, and to the world be as symbols of the 
Mercy and Love of God.  Be unto the world as rain 
and clouds of mercy, as suns of truth; be a celestial 
army, and you shall indeed conquer the city of hearts.  
     Be thankful unto God that &amp;Baha'u'llah has given us 
a firm and solid foundation.  He left no place for sadness 
in hearts, and the writings of His sacred pen contain 
consolation for the whole world.  He had the words of 
truth, and anything that is contrary to His teaching is 
false.  The chief aim of all His work was to do away 
with division.  
     The testament of &amp;Baha'u'llah is a Rain of Goodness, 
a Sun of Truth, Water of Life, the Holy Spirit.  Thus 
open your hearts to receive the full power of His 
Beauty, and I will pray for you all that this joy may be 
yours.  
     Now I say `Good-bye'.  
     This I say only to your outer selves; I do not say it 
to your souls, for our souls are always together.  
     Be comforted, and rest assured that day and night 
I shall turn to the Kingdom of &amp;Abha in supplication for 
you, that day by day you may grow better and holier, 
nearer to God, and more and more illumined by the 
radiance of His Love.  
 
+P173 
                  ADDRESS BY &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA 
 
         AT THE FRIENDS' MEETING HOUSE, ST MARTIN'S 
                     LANE, LONDON, W.C.  
 
                                       Sunday, January 12th, 1913 
     About one thousand years ago a society was 
formed in Persia called the Society of the Friends, 
who gathered together for silent communion with the 
Almighty.  
     They divided Divine philosophy into two parts:  
one kind is that of which the knowledge can be acquired 
through lectures and study in schools and 
colleges.  The second kind of philosophy was that of the 
Illuminati, or followers of the inner light.  The schools 
of this philosophy were held in silence.  Meditating, and 
turning their faces to the Source of Light, from that 
central Light the mysteries of the Kingdom were reflected 
in the hearts of these people.  All the Divine 
problems were solved by this power of illumination.  
     This Society of Friends increased greatly in Persia, 
and up to the present time their societies exist.  Many 
books and epistles were written by their leaders.  When 
they assemble in their meeting-house they sit silently 
and contemplate; their leader opens with a certain 
proposition, and says to the assembly `You must meditate 
on this problem'.  Then, freeing their minds from 
everything else, they sit and reflect, and before long the 
answer is revealed to them.  Many abstruse divine 
questions are solved by this illumination.  
 
+P174 
     Some of the great questions unfolding from the 
rays of the Sun of Reality upon the mind of man are:  
the problem of the reality of the spirit of man; of the 
birth of the spirit; of its birth from this world into 
the world of God; the question of the inner life of the 
spirit and of its fate after its ascension from the body.  
     They also meditate upon the scientific questions of 
the day, and these are likewise solved.  
     These people, who are called `Followers of the inner 
light', attain to a superlative degree of power, and are 
entirely freed from blind dogmas and imitations.  Men 
rely on the statements of these people:  by themselves--
within themselves--they solve all mysteries.  
     If they find a solution with the assistance of the 
inner light, they accept it, and afterwards they declare 
it:  otherwise they would consider it a matter of blind 
imitation.  They go so far as to reflect upon the essential 
nature of the Divinity, of the Divine revelation, of the 
manifestation of the Deity in this world.  All the divine 
and scientific questions are solved by them through the 
power of the spirit.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah says there is a sign (from God) in every 
phenomenon:  the sign of the intellect is contemplation 
and the sign of contemplation is silence, because it is 
impossible for a man to do two things at one time--he 
cannot both speak and meditate.  
     It is an axiomatic fact that while you meditate you 
are speaking with your own spirit.  In that state of 
mind you put certain questions to your spirit and the 
spirit answers:  the light breaks forth and the reality is 
revealed.  
 
+P175 
     You cannot apply the name `man' to any being void 
of this faculty of meditation; without it he would be 
a mere animal, lower than the beasts.  
     Through the faculty of meditation man attains to 
eternal life; through it he receives the breath of the 
Holy Spirit--the bestowal of the Spirit is given in 
reflection and meditation.  
     The spirit of man is itself informed and strengthened 
during meditation; through it affairs of which man 
knew nothing are unfolded before his view.  Through 
it he receives Divine inspiration, through it he receives 
heavenly food.  
     Meditation is the key for opening the doors of 
mysteries.  In that state man abstracts himself:  in that 
state man withdraws himself from all outside objects; 
in that subjective mood he is immersed in the ocean of 
spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of things-in-themselves.  
To illustrate this, think of man as endowed 
with two kinds of sight; when the power of insight is 
being used the outward power of vision does not see.  
     This faculty of meditation frees man from the animal 
nature, discerns the reality of things, puts man in 
touch with God.  
     This faculty brings forth from the invisible plane the 
sciences and arts.  Through the meditative faculty 
inventions are made possible, colossal undertakings are 
carried out; through it governments can run smoothly.  
Through this faculty man enters into the very Kingdom 
of God.  
     Nevertheless some thoughts are useless to man; they 
are like waves moving in the sea without result.  But 
 
+P176 
if the faculty of meditation is bathed in the inner light 
and characterized with divine attributes, the results 
will be confirmed.  
     The meditative faculty is akin to the mirror; if you 
put it before earthly objects it will reflect them.  Therefore 
if the spirit of man is contemplating earthly 
subjects he will be informed of these.  
     But if you turn the mirror of your spirits heavenwards, 
the heavenly constellations and the rays of the 
Sun of Reality will be reflected in your hearts, and the 
virtues of the Kingdom will be obtained.  
     Therefore let us keep this faculty rightly directed--
turning it to the heavenly Sun and not to earthly 
objects--so that we may discover the secrets of the 
Kingdom, and comprehend the allegories of the Bible 
and the mysteries of the spirit.  
     May we indeed become mirrors reflecting the 
heavenly realities, and may we become so pure as to 
reflect the stars of heaven.  
 
 
                           PRAYER 
 
                        97 Cadogan Gardens, London, 
                                     December 26th, 1912 
     `Should Prayer take the form of action?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`Yes:  In the &amp;Baha'i Cause arts, 
sciences and all crafts are (counted as) worship.  The 
man who makes a piece of notepaper to the best of his 
ability, conscientiously, concentrating all his forces on 
perfecting it, is giving praise to God.  Briefly, all effort 
and exertion put forth by man from the fullness of his 
 
+P177 
heart is worship, if it is prompted by the highest 
motives and the will to do service to humanity.  This is 
worship:  to serve mankind and to minister to the needs 
of the people.  Service is prayer.  A physician ministering 
to the sick, gently, tenderly, free from prejudice and 
believing in the solidarity of the human race, he is 
giving praise'.  
     `What is the purpose of our lives?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`To acquire virtues.  We come from 
the earth; why were we transferred from the mineral 
to the vegetable kingdom--from the plant to the 
animal kingdom?  So that we may attain perfection in 
each of these kingdoms, that we may possess the best 
qualities of the mineral, that we may acquire the power 
of growing as in the plant, that we may be adorned with 
the instincts of the animal and possess the faculties of 
sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste, until from the 
animal kingdom we step into the world of humanity 
and are gifted with reason, the power of invention, 
and the forces of the spirit.'  
 
 
                            EVIL 
 
     `What is evil?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`Evil is imperfection.  Sin is 
the state of man in the world of the baser nature, for 
in nature exist defects such as injustice, tyranny, hatred, 
hostility, strife:  these are characteristics of the lower 
plane of nature.  These are the sins of the world, the 
fruits of the tree from which Adam did eat.  Through 
education we must free ourselves from these imperfections.  
 
+P178 
The Prophets of God have been sent, the Holy 
Books have been written, so that man may be made 
free.  Just as he is born into this world of imperfection 
from the womb of his earthly mother, so is he born 
into the world of spirit through divine education.  
When a man is born into the world of phenomena he 
finds the universe; when he is born from this world to 
the world of the spirit, he finds the Kingdom.'  
 
 
                  THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUL 
 
     `Does the soul progress more through sorrow or 
through the joy in this world?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`The mind and spirit of man advance 
when he is tried by suffering.  The more the ground is 
ploughed the better the seed will grow, the better the 
harvest will be.  Just as the plough furrows the earth 
deeply, purifying it of weeds and thistles, so suffering 
and tribulation free man from the petty affairs of this 
worldly life until he arrives at a state of complete 
detachment.  His attitude in this world will be that of 
divine happiness.  Man is, so to speak, unripe:  the heat 
of the fire of suffering will mature him.  Look back 
to the times past and you will find that the greatest men 
have suffered most.'  
     `He who through suffering has attained development, 
should he fear happiness?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`Through suffering he will attain to 
an eternal happiness which nothing can take from him.  
The apostles of Christ suffered:  they attained eternal 
happiness.'  
 
+P179 
     `Then it is impossible to attain happiness without 
suffering?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`To attain eternal happiness one 
must suffer.  He who has reached the state of self-sacrifice 
has true joy.  Temporal joy will vanish.'  
     `Can a departed soul converse with someone still 
on earth?'  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.--`A conversation can be held, but 
not as our conversation.  There is no doubt that the 
forces of the higher worlds interplay with the forces of 
this plane.  The heart of man is open to inspiration; 
this is spiritual communication.  As in a dream one 
talks with a friend while the mouth is silent, so is it 
in the conversation of the spirit.  A man may converse 
with the ego within him saying:  "May I do this?  
Would it be advisable for me to do this work?"  Such 
as this is conversation with the higher self.'  
 
 
                   THE FOUR KINDS OF LOVE 
 
                         97 Cadogan Gardens, London, 
                             Saturday, January 4th, 1913 
     What a power is love!  It is the most wonderful, 
the greatest of all living powers.  
     Love gives life to the lifeless.  Love lights a flame in 
the heart that is cold.  Love brings hope to the hopeless 
and gladdens the hearts of the sorrowful.  
     In the world of existence there is indeed no greater 
power than the power of love.  When the heart of man 
is aglow with the flame of love, he is ready to sacrifice 
 
+P180 
all--even his life.  In the Gospel it is said God is love.  
     There are four kinds of love.  The first is the love that 
flows from God to man; it consists of the inexhaustible 
graces, the Divine effulgence and heavenly illumination.  
Through this love the world of being receives 
life.  Through this love man is endowed with physical 
existence, until, through the breath of the Holy Spirit--
this same love--he receives eternal life and becomes the 
image of the Living God.  This love is the origin of all 
the love in the world of creation.  
     The second is the love that flows from man to God.  
This is faith, attraction to the Divine, enkindlement, 
progress, entrance into the Kingdom of God, receiving 
the Bounties of God, illumination with the lights of the 
Kingdom.  This love is the origin of all philanthropy; 
this love causes the hearts of men to reflect the rays of 
the Sun of Reality.  
     The third is the love of God towards the Self or 
Identity of God.  This is the transfiguration of His 
Beauty, the reflection of Himself in the mirror of His 
Creation.  This is the reality of love, the Ancient Love, 
the Eternal Love.  Through one ray of this Love all 
other love exists.  
     The fourth is the love of man for man.  The love 
which exists between the hearts of believers is prompted 
by the ideal of the unity of spirits.  This love is 
attained through the knowledge of God, so that men 
see the Divine Love reflected in the heart.  Each sees in 
the other the Beauty of God reflected in the soul, and 
finding this point of similarity, they are attracted to 
one another in love.  This love will make all men the 
 
+P181 
waves of one sea, this love will make them all the stars 
of one heaven and the fruits of one tree.  This love will 
bring the realization of true accord, the foundation of 
real unity.  
     But the love which sometimes exists between friends 
is not (true) love, because it is subject to transmutation; 
this is merely fascination.  As the breeze blows, the 
slender trees yield.  If the wind is in the East the tree 
leans to the West, and if the wind turns to the West 
the tree leans to the East.  This kind of love is originated 
by the accidental conditions of life.  This is not love, 
it is merely acquaintanceship; it is subject to change.  
     Today you will see two souls apparently in close 
friendship; tomorrow all this may be changed.  Yesterday 
they were ready to die for one another, today they 
shun one another's society!  This is not love; it is the 
yielding of the hearts to the accidents of life.  When 
that which has caused this `love' to exist passes, the 
love passes also; this is not in reality love.  
     Love is only of the four kinds that I have explained.  
(a) The love of God towards the identity of God.  
Christ has said God is Love.  (b) The love of God for 
His children--for His servants.  (c) The love of man for 
God and (d) the love of man for man.  These four kinds 
of love originate from God.  These are rays from the 
Sun of Reality; these are the Breathings of the Holy 
Spirit; these are the Signs of the Reality.

              TABLET REVEALED BY &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA 
 
                                       August 28th, 1913 
     O Thou my beloved daughter!  
     Thine eloquent and fluent letter was perused in a 
garden, under the cool shade of a tree, while the gentle 
breeze was wafting.  The means of physical enjoyment 
was spread before the eyes and thy letter became the 
cause of spiritual enjoyment.  Truly, I say, it was not a 
letter but a rose-garden adorned with hyacinths and 
flowers.  
     It contained the sweet fragrance of paradise and the 
zephyr of Divine Love blew from its roseate words.  
     As I have not ample time at my disposal, I will give 
herein a brief, conclusive and comprehensive answer.  
It is as follows:  
     In this Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the women go 
neck and neck with the men.  In no movement will 
they be left behind.  Their rights with men are equal in 
degree.  They will enter all the administrative branches 
of politics.  They will attain in all such a degree as will 
be considered the very highest station of the world of 
humanity and will take part in all affairs.  Rest ye 
assured.  Do ye not look upon the present conditions; 
in the not far distant future the world of women will 
become all-refulgent and all-glorious, For His Holiness 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Hath Willed It so!  At the time of elections 
the right to vote is the inalienable right of women, 
and the entrance of women into all human departments 
 
+P183 
is an irrefutable and incontrovertible question.  No soul 
can retard or prevent it.  
     But there are certain matters, the participation in 
which is not worthy of women.  For example, at the 
time when the community is taking up vigorous defensive 
measures against the attack of foes, the women 
are exempt from military engagements.  It may so 
happen that at a given time warlike and savage tribes 
may furiously attack the body politic with the intention 
of carrying on a wholesale slaughter of its members; 
under such a circumstance defence is necessary, but it 
is the duty of men to organize and execute such defensive 
measures and not the women--because their 
hearts are tender and they cannot endure the sight of 
the horror of carnage, even if it is for the sake of 
defence.  From such and similar undertakings the 
women are exempt.  
     As regards the constitution of the House of Justice, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah addresses the men.  He says:  `O ye men 
of the House of Justice!'  
     But when its members are to be elected, the right 
which belongs to women, so far as their voting and 
their voice is concerned, is indisputable.  When the 
women attain to the ultimate degree of progress, then, 
according to the exigency of the time and place and 
their great capacity, they shall obtain extraordinary 
privileges.  Be ye confident on these accounts.  His 
Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah has greatly strengthened the 
cause of women, and the rights and privileges of 
women is one of the greatest principles of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Rest ye assured!  Ere long the days shall come 
 
+P184 
when the men addressing the women, shall say:  
`Blessed are ye!  Blessed are ye!  Verily ye are worthy of 
every gift.  Verily ye deserve to adorn your heads with the 
crown of everlasting glory, because in sciences and arts, in 
virtues and perfections ye shall become equal to man, and 
as regards tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy 
and sympathy ye are superior'.
