                    &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA'S 
                TABLET TO DR. FOREL+F1  
 
     O revered personage, lover of truth!  Thy letter 
dated 28 July 1921+F2 hath been received.  The contents 
thereof were most pleasing and indicated that, 
praised be the Lord, thou art as yet young, and 
searchest after truth, that thy power of thought is 
strong and the discoveries of thy mind manifest.  
     Numerous copies of the epistle I had written to 
Dr. F. are spread far and wide and every one 
knoweth that it hath been revealed in the year 1910.  
Apart from this, numerous epistles have been 
written before the war upon the same theme, and 
reference, too, hath been made to these questions 
in the Journal of the San Francisco University, the 
date whereof is known beyond any doubt.+F3  In like 
manner have the philosophers of broad vision 
praised highly the discourse eloquently delivered 
 
+F1 Original Persian text first published Cairo 1922.  This translation 
+F1 taken from The &amp;Baha'i World, Vol. XV, pp. 37-43.  
+F2 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is obviously referring to the letter from Forel 
+F2 translated above and dated 28 December 1920.  
+F3 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha refers to His talk at Stanford University, Palo Alto, 
+F3 California, in 1912, which was published in the local newspaper and is 
+F3 also included in the collection of His talks in America, entitled The 
+F3 Promulgation of Universal Peace.  
 
+P7 
in the above-named University.+F1  A copy of that 
paper is thus enclosed and forwarded.  Thy works 
are no doubt of great benefit, and if published, send 
us a copy of each.  
     By materialists, whose belief with regard to 
Divinity hath been explained, is not meant philosophers 
in general, but rather that group of 
materialists of narrow vision who worship that 
which is sensed, who depend upon the five senses 
only, and whose criterion of knowledge is limited 
to that which can be perceived by the senses.  All 
that can be sensed is to them real, whilst whatever 
falleth not under the power of the senses is either 
unreal or doubtful.  The existence of the Deity they 
regard as wholly doubtful.  
     It is as thou hast written, not philosophers in 
general but narrow-minded materialists that are 
meant.  As to deistic philosophers, such as Socrates, 
Plato and Aristotle, they are indeed worthy of 
esteem and of the highest praise, for they have 
rendered distinguished services to mankind.  In like 
manner we regard the materialistic, accomplished, 
moderate philosophers, who have been of service 
(to mankind).  
 
+F1 There &amp;Abdu'l-Baha distinguishes the materialistic and empirical 
+F1 philosophy of the modern West from the standard rationalistic 
+F1 philosophy of the Greeks and Persians, and highlights the difference 
+F1 between theories of the essence of nature and of the origin of man.  
 
+P8 
     We regard knowledge and wisdom as the 
foundation of the progress of mankind, and extol 
philosophers who are endowed with broad vision.  
Peruse carefully the San Francisco University 
Journal that the truth may be revealed to thee.  
     Now concerning mental faculties, they are in 
truth of the inherent properties of the soul, even 
as the radiation of light is the essential property of 
the sun.  The rays of the sun are renewed but the 
sun itself is ever the same and unchanged.  Consider 
how the human intellect develops and weakens, 
and may at times come to naught, whereas the soul 
changeth not.  For the mind to manifest itself, the 
human body must be whole; and a sound mind 
cannot be but in a sound body, whereas the soul 
dependeth not upon the body.  It is through the 
power of the soul that the mind comprehendeth, 
imagineth and exerteth its influence, whilst the soul 
is a power that is free.  The mind comprehendeth 
the abstract by the aid of the concrete, but the soul 
hath limitless manifestations of its own.  The mind 
is circumscribed, the soul limitless.  It is by the aid 
of such senses as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell 
and touch, that the mind comprehendeth, whereas 
the soul is free from all agencies.  The soul as thou 
observest, whether it be in sleep or waking, is in 
motion and ever active.  Possibly it may, whilst in 
 
+P9 
a dream, unravel an intricate problem, incapable 
of solution in the waking state.  The mind, moreover, 
understandeth not whilst the senses have 
ceased to function, and in the embryonic stage and 
in early infancy the reasoning power is totally 
absent, whereas the soul is ever endowed with full 
strength.  In short, the proofs are many that go to 
show that despite the loss of reason, the power of 
the soul would still continue to exist.  The spirit 
however possesseth various grades and stations.  
     As to the existence of spirit in the mineral:  it is 
indubitable that minerals are endowed with a spirit 
and life according to the requirements of that stage.  
This unknown secret, too, hath become known 
unto the materialists who now maintain that all 
beings are endowed with life, even as He saith in 
the &amp;Qur'an, `All things are living'.  
     In the vegetable world, too, there is the power 
of growth, and that power of growth is the spirit.  
In the animal world there is the sense of feeling, 
but in the human world there is an all-embracing 
power.  In all the preceding stages the power of 
reason is absent, but the soul existeth and revealeth 
itself.  The sense of feeling understandeth not the 
soul, whereas the reasoning power of the mind 
proveth the existence thereof.  
     In like manner the mind proveth the existence 
 
+P10 
of an unseen Reality that embraceth all beings, and 
that existeth and revealeth itself in all stages, the 
essence whereof is beyond the grasp of the mind.  
Thus the mineral world understandeth neither the 
nature nor the perfections of the vegetable world; 
the vegetable world understandeth not the nature 
of the animal world, neither the animal world the 
nature of the reality of man that discovereth and 
embraceth all things.  
     The animal is the captive of nature and cannot 
transgress the rules and laws thereof.  In man, however, 
there is a discovering power that transcendeth 
the world of nature and controlleth and interfereth 
with the laws thereof.  For instance, all minerals, 
plants and animals are captives of nature.  The sun 
itself with all its majesty is so subservient to nature 
that it hath no will of its own and cannot deviate 
a hair's-breadth from the laws thereof.  In like manner 
all other beings, whether of the mineral, the 
vegetable or the animal world, cannot deviate 
from the laws of nature, nay, all are the slaves 
thereof.  Man, however, though in body the captive 
of nature is yet free in his mind and soul, and 
hath the mastery over nature.  
     Consider:  according to the law of nature man 
liveth, moveth and hath his being on earth, yet his 
soul and mind interfere with the laws thereof, and 
 
+P11 
even as the bird he flieth in the air, saileth speedily 
upon the seas and as the fish soundeth the deep and 
discovereth the things therein.  Verily this is a 
grievous defeat inflicted upon the laws of nature.  
     So is the power of electrical energy:  this unruly 
violent force that cleaveth mountains is yet imprisoned 
by man within a globe!  This is manifestly 
interfering with the laws of nature.  Likewise man 
discovereth those hidden secrets of nature that in 
conformity with the laws thereof must remain 
concealed, and transfereth them from the invisible 
plane to the visible.  This, too, is interfering with 
the law of nature.  In the same manner he discovereth 
the inherent properties of things that are the 
secrets of nature.  Also he bringeth to light the past 
events that have been lost to memory, and foreseeth 
by his power of induction future happenings 
that are as yet unknown.  Furthermore, communication 
and discovery are limited by the laws of 
nature to short distances, whereas man, through 
that inner power of his that discovereth the reality 
of all things, connecteth the East with the West.  
This, too, is interfering with the laws of nature.  
Similarly, according to the law of nature all shadows 
are fleeting, whereas man fixeth them upon 
the plate, and this, too, is interference with a law 
of nature.  Ponder and reflect:  all sciences, arts, 
 
+P12 
crafts, inventions and discoveries, have been once 
the secrets of nature and in conformity with the 
laws thereof must remain hidden; yet man through 
his discovering power interfereth with the laws of 
nature and transfereth these hidden secrets from the 
invisible to the visible plane.  This again is interfering 
with the laws of nature.  
     In fine, that inner faculty in man, unseen of the 
eye, wresteth the sword from the hands of nature, 
and giveth it a grievous blow.  All other beings, 
however great, are bereft of such perfections.  Man 
hath the powers of will and understanding, but 
nature hath them not.  Nature is constrained, man 
is free.  Nature is bereft of understanding, man 
understandeth.  Nature is unaware of past events, 
but man is aware of them.  Nature forecasteth not 
the future; man by his discerning power seeth that 
which is to come.  Nature hath no consciousness of 
itself, man knoweth about all things.  
     Should any one suppose that man is but a part 
of the world of nature, and he being endowed with 
these perfections, these being but manifestations of 
the world of nature, and thus nature is the originator 
of these perfections and is not deprived therefrom, 
to him we make reply and say:  the part 
dependeth upon the whole; the part cannot possess 
perfections whereof the whole is deprived.  
 
+P13 
     By nature is meant those inherent properties and 
necessary relations derived from the realities of 
things.  And these realities of things, though in the 
utmost diversity, are yet intimately connected one 
with the other.  For these diverse realities an all-unifying 
agency is needed that shall link them all one 
to the other.  For instance, the various organs and 
members, the parts and elements, that constitute 
the body of man, though at variance, are yet all 
connected one with the other by that all-unifying 
agency known as the human soul, that causeth 
them to function in perfect harmony and with 
absolute regularity, thus making the continuation 
of life possible.  The human body, however, is 
utterly unconscious of that all-unifying agency, 
and yet acteth with regularity and dischargeth its 
functions according to its will.  
     Now concerning philosophers, they are of two 
schools.  Thus Socrates the wise believed in the 
unity of God and the existence of the soul after 
death; as his opinion was contrary to that of the 
narrow-minded people of his time, that divine sage 
was poisoned by them.  All divine philosophers and 
men of wisdom and understanding, when observing 
these endless beings, have considered that in this 
great and infinite universe all things end in the 
mineral kingdom, that the outcome of the mineral 
 
+P14 
kingdom is the vegetable kingdom, the outcome 
of the vegetable kingdom is the animal kingdom 
and the outcome of the animal kingdom the world 
of man.  The consummation of this limitless universe 
with all its grandeur and glory hath been man 
himself, who in this world of being toileth and suffereth 
for a time, with divers ills and pains, and ultimately 
disintegrates, leaving no trace and no fruit 
after him.  Were it so, there is no doubt that this 
infinite universe with all its perfections has ended 
in sham and delusion with no result, no fruit, no 
permanence and no effect.  It would be utterly without 
meaning.  They were thus convinced that such 
is not the case, that this Great Workshop with all its 
power, its bewildering magnificence and endless perfections, 
cannot eventually come to naught.  That 
still another life should exist is thus certain, and, just 
as the vegetable kingdom is unaware of the world 
of man, so we, too, know not of the Great Life 
hereafter that followeth the life of man here below.  
Our non-comprehension of that life, however, is 
no proof of its non-existence.  The mineral world, 
for instance, is utterly unaware of the world of 
man and cannot comprehend it, but the ignorance 
of a thing is no proof of its non-existence.  Numerous 
and conclusive proofs exist that go to show that 
this infinite world cannot end with this human life.  
 
+P15 
     Now concerning the Essence of Divinity:  in 
truth it is on no account determined by anything 
apart from its own nature, and can in no wise be 
comprehended.  For whatsoever can be conceived 
by man is a reality that hath limitations and is not 
unlimited; it is circumscribed, not all-embracing.  
It can be comprehended by man, and is controlled 
by him.  Similarly it is certain that all human conceptions 
are contingent, not absolute; that they 
have a mental existence, not a material one.  Moreover, 
differentiation of stages in the contingent 
world is an obstacle to understanding.  How then 
can the contingent conceive the Reality of the absolute?  
As previously mentioned, differentiation of 
stages in the contingent plane is an obstacle to 
understanding.  Minerals, plants and animals are 
bereft of the mental faculties of man that discover 
the realities of all things, but man himself comprehendeth 
all the stages beneath him.  Every superior 
stage comprehendeth that which is inferior and discovereth 
the reality thereof, but the inferior one 
is unaware of that which is superior and cannot 
comprehend it.  Thus man cannot grasp the Essence 
of Divinity, but can, by his reasoning power, by 
observation, by his intuitive faculties and the revealing 
power of his faith, believe in God, discover 
the bounties of His Grace.  He becometh certain 
 
+P16 
that though the Divine Essence is unseen of the eye, 
and the existence of the Deity is intangible, yet conclusive 
spiritual proofs assert the existence of that unseen 
Reality.  The Divine Essence as it is in itself is 
however beyond all description.  For instance, the 
nature of ether is unknown, but that it existeth is 
certain by the effects it produceth, heat, light and 
electricity being the waves thereof.  By these waves 
the existence of ether is thus proven.  And as we 
consider the outpourings of Divine Grace we are 
assured of the existence of God.  For instance, we 
observe that the existence of beings is conditioned 
upon the coming together of various elements and 
their non-existence upon the decomposition of 
their constituent elements.  For decomposition 
causeth the dissociation of the various elements.  
Thus, as we observe the coming together of elements 
giveth rise to the existence of beings, and 
knowing that beings are infinite, they being the 
effect, how can the Cause be finite?  
     Now, formation is of three kinds and of three 
kinds only:  accidental, necessary and voluntary.  
The coming together of the various constituent 
elements of beings cannot be accidental, for unto 
every effect there must be a cause.  It cannot be 
compulsory, for then the formation must be an 
inherent property of the constituent parts and the 
 
+P17 
inherent property of a thing can in no wise be dissociated 
from it, such as light that is the revealer of 
things, heat that causeth the expansion of elements 
and the solar rays which are the essential property 
of the sun.  Thus under such circumstances the 
decomposition of any formation is impossible, for 
the inherent properties of a thing cannot be 
separated from it.  The third formation remaineth 
and that is the voluntary one, that is, an unseen 
force described as the Ancient Power, causeth these 
elements to come together, every formation giving 
rise to a distinct being.  
     As to the attributes and perfections such as will, 
knowledge, power and other ancient attributes 
that we ascribe to that Divine Reality, these are the 
signs that reflect the existence of beings in the 
visible plane and not the absolute perfections of the 
Divine Essence that cannot be comprehended.  For 
instance, as we consider created things we observe 
infinite perfections, and the created things being in 
the utmost regularity and perfection we infer that 
the Ancient Power on whom dependeth the existence 
of these beings, cannot be ignorant; thus we 
say He is All-Knowing.  It is certain that it is not 
impotent, it must be then All-Powerful; it is not 
poor, it must be All-Possessing; it is not non-existent, 
it must be Ever-Living.  The purpose is to 
 
+P18 
show that these attributes and perfections that we 
recount for that Universal Reality are only in order 
to deny imperfections, rather than to assert the perfections 
that the human mind can conceive.  Thus 
we say His attributes are unknowable.  
     In fine, that Universal Reality with all its qualities 
and attributes that we recount is holy and 
exalted above all minds and understandings.  As we, 
however, reflect with broad minds upon this infinite 
universe, we observe that motion without a 
motive force, and an effect without a cause are both 
impossible; that every being hath come to exist 
under numerous influences and continually undergoeth 
reaction.  These influences, too, are formed 
under the action of still other influences.  For instance, 
plants grow and flourish through the outpourings 
of vernal showers, whilst the cloud itself 
is formed under various other agencies and these 
agencies in their turn are reacted upon by still other 
agencies.  For example, plants and animals grow 
and develop under the influence of what the philosophers 
of our day designate as hydrogen and 
oxygen and are reacted upon by the effects of these 
two elements; and these in turn are formed under 
still other influences.  The same can be said of other 
beings whether they affect other things or be 
affected.  Such process of causation goes on, and 
 
+P19 
to maintain that this process goes on indefinitely 
is manifestly absurd.  Thus such a chain of causation 
must of necessity lead eventually to Him who is 
the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, who is Self-Dependent 
and the Ultimate Cause.  This Universal 
Reality cannot be sensed, it cannot be seen.  
It must be so of necessity, for it is All-Embracing, 
not circumscribed, and such attributes qualify the 
effect and not the cause.  
     And as we reflect, we observe that man is like 
unto a tiny organism contained within a fruit; this 
fruit hath developed out of the blossom, the 
blossom hath grown out of the tree, the tree is 
sustained by the sap, and the sap formed out of 
earth and water.  How then can this tiny organism 
comprehend the nature of the garden, conceive of 
the gardener and comprehend his being?  That is 
manifestly impossible.  Should that organism 
understand and reflect, it would observe that this 
garden, this tree, this blossom, this fruit would in 
no wise have come to exist by themselves in such 
order and perfection.  Similarly the wise and 
reflecting soul will know of a certainty that this 
infinite universe with all its grandeur and perfect 
order could not have come to exist by itself.  
     Similarly in the world of being there exist forces 
unseen of the eye, such as the force of ether previously 
 
+P20 
mentioned, that cannot be sensed, that 
cannot be seen.  However, from the effects it produceth, 
that is from its waves and vibrations, light, 
heat, electricity appear and are made evident.  In 
like manner is the power of growth, of feeling, of 
understanding, of thought, of memory, of imagination 
and of discernment; all these inner faculties 
are unseen of the eye and cannot be sensed, yet all 
are evident by the effects they produce.  
     Now as to the infinite Power that knoweth no 
limitations; limitation itself proveth the existence 
of the unlimited, for the limited is known through 
the unlimited, just as weakness itself proveth the 
existence of power, ignorance the existence of 
knowledge, poverty the existence of wealth.  Without 
wealth there would be no poverty, without 
knowledge no ignorance, without light no darkness.  
Darkness itself is a proof of the existence of 
light for darkness is the absence of light.  
     Now concerning nature, it is but the essential 
properties and the necessary relations inherent in 
the realities of things.  And though these infinite 
realities are diverse in their character yet they are 
in the utmost harmony and closely connected 
together.  As one's vision is broadened and the matter 
observed carefully, it will be made certain that 
every reality is but an essential requisite of other 
 
+P21 
realities.  Thus to connect and harmonize these 
diverse and infinite realities an all-unifying Power 
is necessary, that every part of existent being may 
in perfect order discharge its own function.  Consider 
the body of man, and let the part be an indication 
of the whole.  Consider how these diverse parts 
and members of the human body are closely connected 
and harmoniously united one with the 
other.  Every part is the essential requisite of all 
other parts and has a function by itself.  It is the 
mind that is the all-unifying agency that so uniteth 
all the component parts one with the other that 
each dischargeth its specific function in perfect 
order, and thereby co-operation and reaction are 
made possible.  All parts function under certain 
laws that are essential to existence.  Should that all-unifying 
agency that directeth all these parts be 
harmed in any way there is no doubt that the constituent 
parts and members will cease functioning 
properly; and though that all-unifying agency in 
the temple of man be not sensed or seen and the 
reality thereof be unknown, yet by its effects it 
manifesteth itself with the greatest power.  
     Thus it hath been proven and made evident that 
these infinite beings in this wondrous universe will 
discharge their functions properly only when 
directed and controlled by that Universal Reality, 
 
+P22 
so that order may be established in the world.  For 
example, interaction and co-operation between the 
constituent parts of the human body are evident 
and indisputable, yet this does not suffice; an all-unifying 
agency is necessary that shall direct and 
control the component parts, so that these through 
interaction and co-operation may discharge in perfect 
order their necessary and respective functions.  
     You are well aware, praised be the Lord, that 
both interaction and co-operation are evident and 
proven amongst all beings, whether large or small.  
In the case of large bodies interaction is as manifest 
as the sun, whilst in the case of small bodies, though 
interaction be unknown, yet the part is an indication 
of the whole.  All these interactions therefore 
are connected with that all-embracing power 
which is their pivot, their centre, their source and 
their motive power.  
     For instance, as we have observed, co-operation 
among the constituent parts of the human body is 
clearly established, and these parts and members 
render services unto all the component parts of the 
body.  For instance, the hand, the foot, the eye, the 
ear, the mind, the imagination all help the various 
parts and members of the human body, but all these 
interactions are linked by an unseen, all-embracing 
power, that causeth these interactions to be produced 
 
+P23 
with perfect regularity.  This is the inner 
faculty of man, that is his spirit and his mind, both 
of which are invisible.  
     In like manner consider machinery and workshops 
and the interaction existing among the 
various component parts and sections, and how 
connected they are one with the other.  All these 
relations and interactions, however, are connected 
with a central power which is their motive force, 
their pivot and their source.  This central power is 
either the power of steam or the skill of the 
mastermind.  
     It hath therefore been made evident and proved 
that interaction, co-operation and interrelation 
amongst beings are under the direction and will of 
a motive Power which is the origin, the motive 
force and the pivot of all interactions in the 
universe.  
     Likewise every arrangement and formation that 
is not perfect in its order we designate as accidental, 
and that which is orderly, regular, perfect in 
its relations and every part of which is in its proper 
place and is the essential requisite of the other constituent 
parts, this we call a composition formed 
through will and knowledge.  There is no doubt 
that these infinite beings and the association of these 
diverse elements arranged in countless forms must 
 
+P24 
have proceeded from a Reality that could in no 
wise be bereft of will or understanding.  This is clear 
and proven to the mind and no one can deny it.  
It is not meant, however, that that Universal 
Reality or the attributes thereof have been comprehended.  
Neither its Essence nor its true attributes 
hath any one comprehended.  We maintain, however, 
that these infinite beings, these necessary relations, 
this perfect arrangement must of necessity 
have proceeded from a source that is not bereft of 
will and understanding, and this infinite composition 
cast into infinite forms must have been caused 
by an all-embracing Wisdom.  This none can dispute 
save he that is obstinate and stubborn, and 
denieth the clear and unmistakable evidence, and 
becometh the object of the blessed Verse:  `They 
are deaf, they are dumb, they are blind and shall 
return no more'.  
     Now regarding the question whether the 
faculties of the mind and the human soul are one 
and the same.  These faculties are but the inherent 
properties of the soul, such as the power of imagination, 
of thought, of understanding; powers that 
are the essential requisites of the reality of man, 
even as the solar ray is the inherent property of the 
sun.  The temple of man is like unto a mirror, his 
soul is as the sun, and his mental faculties even as 
 
+P25 
the rays that emanate from that source of light.  The 
ray may cease to fall upon the mirror, but it can 
in no wise be dissociated from the sun.  
     In short, the point is this, that the world of man 
is supernatural in its relation to the vegetable 
kingdom, though in reality it is not so.  Relatively 
to the plant, the reality of man, his power of hearing 
and sight, are all supernatural, and for the plant 
to comprehend that reality and the nature of the 
powers of man's mind is impossible.  In like manner 
for man to comprehend the Divine Essence and the 
nature of the great Hereafter is in no wise possible.  
The merciful outpourings of that Divine Essence, 
however, are vouchsafed unto all beings and it is 
incumbent upon man to ponder in his heart upon 
the effusions of the Divine Grace, the soul being 
counted as one, rather than upon the Divine 
Essence itself.  This is the utmost limit for human 
understanding.  As it hath previously been mentioned, 
these attributes and perfections that we recount 
of the Divine Essence, these we have derived 
from the existence and observation of beings, 
and it is not that we have comprehended the 
essence and perfection of God.  When we say that 
the Divine Essence understandeth and is free, we 
do not mean that we have discovered the Divine 
Will and Purpose, but rather that we have acquired 
 
+P26 
knowledge of them through the Divine Grace 
revealed and manifested in the realities of things.  
     Now concerning our social principles, namely 
the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah spread far 
and wide fifty years ago, they verily comprehend 
all other teachings.  It is clear and evident that without 
these teachings progress and advancement for 
mankind are in no wise possible.  Every community 
in the world findeth in these Divine Teachings the 
realization of its highest aspirations.  These teachings 
are even as the tree that beareth the best fruits 
of all trees.  Philosophers, for instance, find in these 
heavenly teachings the most perfect solution of 
their social problems, and similarly a true and noble 
exposition of matters that pertain to philosophical 
questions.  In like manner men of faith behold the 
reality of religion manifestly revealed in these 
heavenly teachings, and clearly and conclusively 
prove them to be the real and true remedy for the 
ills and infirmities of all mankind.  Should these 
sublime teachings be diffused, mankind shall be 
freed from all perils, from all chronic ills and sicknesses.  
In like manner are the &amp;Baha'i economic 
principles the embodiment of the highest aspirations 
of all wage-earning classes and of economists 
of various schools.  
     In short, all sections and parties have their aspirations 
 
+P27 
realized in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  As 
these teachings are declared in churches, in 
mosques and in other places of worship, whether 
those of the followers of Buddha or of Confucius, 
in political circles or amongst materialists, all shall 
bear witness that these teachings bestow a fresh life 
upon mankind and constitute the immediate 
remedy for all the ills of social life.  None can find 
fault with any of these teachings, nay rather, once 
declared they will all be acclaimed, and all will confess 
their vital necessity, exclaiming, `Verily this is 
the truth and naught is there beside the truth but 
manifest error.' 
     In conclusion, these few words are written, and 
unto everyone they will be a clear and conclusive 
evidence of the truth.  Ponder them in thine heart.  
The will of every sovereign prevaileth during his 
reign, the will of every philosopher findeth 
expression in a handful of disciples during his lifetime, 
but the Power of the Holy Spirit shineth 
radiantly in the realities of the Messengers of God, 
and strengtheneth Their will in such wise as to influence 
a great nation for thousands of years and 
to regenerate the human soul and revive mankind.  
Consider how great is this power!  It is an extraordinary 
Power, an all-sufficient proof of the truth 
of the mission of the Prophets of God, and a conclusive 
 
+P28 
evidence of the power of Divine Inspiration.  
     The Glory of Glories rest upon thee.  
 
Haifa, 21 September 1921.
