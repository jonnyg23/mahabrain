          The City Temple:  Introduction 
 
     ON September 10th, the first Sunday after 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's arrival in England, he 
spoke from the City Temple pulpit to 
the evening congregation at the special 
desire of the Pastor, the Reverend R. J. Campbell.  
     Though &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's coming had not been 
advertised the Church was filled to its utmost 
capacity.  Few that were there will ever forget the 
sight of that venerable figure clad in his Eastern 
garb, ascending the pulpit stairs to address a 
public gathering for the first time in his life.  That 
this should be at a Christian place of worship in 
the West has its own deep significance.  Mr. 
Campbell introduced the visitor with a few simple 
words in the course of which he said:  "We, as the 
followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is to us 
and will always be the Light of the World, view 
with sympathy and respect every movement of 
the Spirit of God in the experience of mankind, 
and therefore we give greeting to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in 
the name of all who share the spirit of our Master, 
and are trying to live their lives in that Spirit.  The 
&amp;Baha'i Movement is very closely akin to, I think I 
might say is identical with, the spiritual purpose 
of Christianity."  
     Before &amp;Abdu'l-Baha left the Church, he wrote 
in the old Bible used by generations of preachers, 
the following words in his own native Persian, the 
translation being added as follows:  
 
+P18 
           Inscription in the Old Bible 
         Written by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Persian 
 
     THIS book is the Holy Book of God, of 
celestial Inspiration.  It is the Bible of 
Salvation, the Noble Gospel.  It is the 
mystery of the Kingdom and its light.  
It is the Divine Bounty, the sign of the guidance of 
God.

     Address given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at the City 
                      Temple 
           Sunday, September 10th, 1911 
     O NOBLE friends; seekers after God!  
Praise be to God!  Today the light of 
Truth is shining upon the world in its 
abundance; the breezes of the heavenly 
garden are blowing throughout all regions; the 
call of the Kingdom is heard in all lands, and the 
breath of the Holy Spirit is felt in all hearts that 
are faithful.  The Spirit of God is giving eternal 
life.  In this wonderful age the East is enlightened, 
the West is fragrant, and everywhere the soul 
inhales the holy perfume.  The sea of the unity of 
mankind is lifting up its waves with joy, for there 
is real communication between the hearts and 
minds of men.  The banner of the Holy Spirit is 
uplifted, and men see it, and are assured with the 
knowledge that this is a new day.  
     This is a new cycle of human power.  All the 
horizons of the world are luminous, and the world 
will become indeed as a garden and a paradise.  It 
is the hour of unity of the sons of men and of the 
drawing together of all races and all classes.  You 
are loosed from ancient superstitions which have 
kept men ignorant, destroying the foundation of 
true humanity.  
     The gift of God to this enlightened age is the 
knowledge of the oneness of mankind and of the 
fundamental oneness of religion.  War shall cease 
 
+P20 
between nations, and by the will of God the Most 
Great Peace shall come; the world will be seen as 
a new world, and all men will live as brothers.  
     In the days of old an instinct for warfare was 
developed in the struggle with wild animals; this 
is no longer necessary; nay, rather, co-operation 
and mutual understanding are seen to produce 
the greatest welfare of mankind.  Enmity is now 
the result of prejudice only.  
     In the Hidden Words &amp;Baha'u'llah says, "Justice 
is to be loved above all."  Praise be to God, in this 
country the standard of justice has been raised; a 
great effort is being made to give all souls an 
equal and a true place.  This is the desire of all 
noble natures; this is today the teaching for the 
East and for the West; therefore the East and the 
West will understand each other and reverence 
each other, and embrace like long-parted lovers 
who have found each other.  
     There is one God; mankind is one; the 
foundations of religion are one.  Let us worship 
Him, and give praise for all His great Prophets 
and Messengers who have manifested His 
brightness and glory.  
     The blessing of the Eternal One be with you in 
all its richness, that each soul according to his 
measure may take freely of Him.  Amen.

          St. John's Westminster:  Introduction 
 
     On September 17th, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at the 
request of the venerable Archdeacon of 
Westminster addressed the congregation 
of Saint John the Divine after 
evening service.  With a few warm words 
characteristic of his whole attitude Archdeacon 
Wilberforce introduced the revered Messenger 
from the East, who had crossed seas and countries 
on his Mission of Peace and Unity for which he 
had suffered forty years of captivity and 
persecution.  The Archdeacon had the Bishop's 
chair placed for his Guest on the Chancel steps, 
and standing beside him read the translation of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's address himself.  The Congregation 
was profoundly moved, and following the 
Archdeacon's example knelt to receive the 
blessing of the Servant of God--who stood with 
extended arms--his wonderful voice rising and 
falling in the silence with the power of his 
invocation.  As the Archdeacon said:  "Truly the 
East and the West have met in this sacred place 
tonight."  The hymn "O God our help in ages 
past" was sung by the entire assembly standing, 
as &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and the Archdeacon passed 
down the aisle to the vestry hand in hand.  
     Outside the Church, Salvationists were holding 
their meeting and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was deeply 
impressed and touched at the sight of the men, 
women and children gathered together in the 
night, at the street corner, praying and singing.

     Discourse of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at St. John's, 
                  Westminster.  
             September 17th, 1911.  
 
     O NOBLE Friends!  O Seekers for the 
Kingdom of God!  Man all over the 
world is seeking for God.  All that exists 
is God; but the Reality of Divinity is 
holy above all understanding.  
     The pictures of Divinity that come to our mind 
are the product of our fancy; they exist in the 
realm of our imagination.  They are not adequate 
to the Truth; truth in its essence cannot be put 
into words.  
     Divinity cannot by comprehended because it is 
comprehending.  
     Man, who has also a real existence, is 
comprehended by God; therefore, the Divinity 
which man can understand is partial; it is not 
complete.  Divinity is actual Truth and real 
existence, and not any representation of it.  
Divinity itself contains All, and is not contained.  
     Although the mineral, vegetable, animal and 
man all have actual being, yet the mineral has no 
knowledge of the vegetable.  It cannot apprehend 
it.  It cannot imagine nor understand it.  
     It is the same with the vegetable.  Any progress 
it may make, however highly it may become 
developed, it will never apprehend the animal, 
nor understand it.  It is, so to speak, without news 
of it.  It has no ears, no sight, no understanding.  
 
+P23 
     It is the same with the animal.  However much 
it may progress in its own kingdom, however 
refined its feelings may become, it will have no 
real notion of the world of man or of his special 
intellectual faculties.  
     The animal cannot understand the roundness 
of the earth, nor its motion in space, nor the 
central position of the sun, nor can it imagine 
such a thing as the all-pervading ether.  
     Although the mineral, vegetable, animal and 
man himself are actual beings, the difference 
between their kingdoms prevents members of the 
lower degree from comprehending the essence 
and nature of those of the superior degree.  This 
being so, how can the temporal and phenomenal 
comprehend the Lord of Hosts?  
     It is clear that this is impossible!  
     But the Essence of Divinity, the Sun of Truth, 
shines forth upon all horizons and is spreading its 
rays upon all things.  Each creature is the 
recipient of some portion of that power, and man, 
who contains the perfection of the mineral, the 
vegetable and animal, as well as his own 
distinctive qualities, has become the noblest of 
created beings.  It stands written that he is made 
in the Image of God.  Mysteries that were hidden 
he discovers; and secrets that were concealed he 
brings into the light.  By Science and by Art he 
brings hidden powers into the region of the visible 
world.  Man perceives the hidden law in created 
things and co-operates with it.  
     Lastly the perfect man, the Prophet, is one who 
is transfigured, one who has the purity and 
 
+P24 
clearness of a perfect mirror--one who reflects the 
Sun of Truth.  Of such a one--of such a Prophet 
and Messenger--we can say that the Light of 
Divinity with the heavenly Perfections dwells in 
him.  
     If we claim that the sun is seen in the mirror, 
we do not mean that the sun itself has descended 
from the holy heights of his heaven and entered 
into the mirror!  This is impossible.  The Divine 
Nature is seen in the Manifestations and its Light 
and Splendor are visible in extreme glory.  
     Therefore, men have always been taught and 
led by the Prophets of God.  The Prophets of God 
are the Mediators of God.  All the Prophets and 
Messengers have come from One Holy Spirit and 
bear the Message of God, fitted to the age in 
which they appear.  The One Light is in them and 
they are One with each other.  But the Eternal 
does not become phenomenal; neither can the 
phenomenal become Eternal.  
     Saint Paul, the great Apostle, said:  "We all, 
with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory 
of God, are changed into the same image from 
glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord."  
 
     O GOD the Forgiver!  O Heavenly 
Educator!  This assembly is adorned 
with the mention of thy holy Name.  
Thy children turn their face towards 
thy Kingdom, hearts are made happy and souls 
are comforted.  
     Merciful God! cause us to repent of our 
 
+P25 
shortcomings!  Accept us in thy heavenly Kingdom 
and give unto us an abode where there shall 
be no error.  Give us peace; give us knowledge, 
and open unto us the gates of thy heaven.  
     Thou art the Giver of all!  Thou art the 
Forgiver!  Thou art the Merciful!  Amen.

          Theosophical Society:  Introduction 
 
     ON September 30th, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha met 
the Theosophical society at their new 
Headquarters at the express request of 
their president Mrs. Annie Besant.  
After a general history of the movement and 
sympathetic words of welcome by Mr. A. P. 
Sinnett, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha rose and delivered to the 
crowded assembly an address upon the distinctive 
notes of the &amp;Baha'i teaching, warmly commending 
the eagerness of the Society in its search for 
Truth.  
 
+P27 
     Discourse of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha given at the 
          Theosophical Head Quarters.  
             September 30th, 1911.  
 
     O RESPECTED Assembly!  O friends of 
Truth!  The inherent nature of fire is to 
burn, the inherent nature of electricity 
is to give light, the inherent nature of 
the sun is to shine, and the inherent nature of the 
organic earth is the power of growth.  
     There is no separation between a thing and its 
inherent qualities.  
     It is the inherent nature of things on this earth 
to change, thus we see around us the change of 
the seasons.  Every spring is followed by a summer 
and every autumn brings a winter--every day a 
night and every evening a morning.  There is a 
sequence in all things.  
     Thus when hatred and animosity, fighting, 
slaughtering, and great coldness of heart were 
governing this world, and darkness had overcome 
the nations, &amp;Baha'u'llah, like a bright star, rose 
from the horizon of Persia and shone with the 
great Light of Guidance, giving heavenly 
radiance and establishing the new Teaching.  
     He declared the most human virtues; He 
manifested the Spiritual powers, and put them 
into practice in the world around Him.  
     Firstly:  He lays stress on the search for Truth.  
This is most important, because the people are 
too easily led by tradition.  It is because of this 
 
+P28 
that they are often antagonistic to each other, and 
dispute with one another.  
     But the manifesting of Truth discovers the 
darkness and becomes the cause of Oneness of 
faith and belief:  because Truth cannot be two!  
That is not possible.  
     Secondly:  &amp;Baha'u'llah taught the Oneness of 
humanity; that is to say, all the children of men 
are under the mercy of the Great God.  They are 
the sons of one God; they are trained by God.  He 
has placed the crown of humanity on the head of 
every one of the servants of God.  Therefore all 
nations and peoples must consider themselves 
brethren.  They are all descendants from Adam.  
They are the branches, leaves, flowers and fruits 
of One Tree.  They are pearls from one shell.  But 
the children of men are in need of education and 
civilization, and they require to be polished, till 
they become bright and shining.  
     Man and woman both should be educated 
equally and equally regarded.  
     It is racial, patriotic, religious and class 
prejudice, that has been the cause of the 
destruction of Humanity.  
     Thirdly:  &amp;Baha'u'llah taught, that Religion is the 
chief foundation of Love and Unity and the cause 
of Oneness.  If a religion become the cause of 
hatred and disharmony, it would be better that it 
should not exist.  To be without such a religion is 
better than to be with it.  
     Fourthly:  Religion and Science are inter-twined 
with each other and cannot be separated.  These 
are the two wings with which humanity must fly.  
 
+P29 
One wing is not enough.  Every religion which 
does not concern itself with Science is mere 
tradition, and that is not the essential.  Therefore 
science, education and civilization are most 
important necessities for the full religious life.  
     Fifthly:  The Reality of the divine Religions is 
one, because the Reality is one and cannot be two.  
All the prophets are united in their message, and 
unshaken.  They are like the sun; in different 
seasons they ascend from different rising points 
on the horizon.  Therefore every ancient prophet 
gave the glad tidings of the future, and every 
future has accepted the past.  
     Sixthly:  Equality and Brotherhood must be 
established among all members of mankind.  This 
is according to Justice.  The general rights of 
mankind must be guarded and preserved.  
     All men must be treated equally.  This is 
inherent in the very nature of humanity.  
     Seventhly:  The arrangements of the circumstances 
of the people must be such that poverty 
shall disappear, and that every one as far as 
possible, according to his position and rank, shall 
be comfortable.  Whilst the nobles and others in 
high rank are in easy circumstances, the poor also 
should be able to get their daily food and not be 
brought to the extremities of hunger.  
     Eighthly:  &amp;Baha'u'llah declared the coming of 
the Most Great Peace.  All the nations and peoples 
will come under the shadow of the Tent of the 
Great Peace and Harmony--that is to say, by 
general election a Great Board of Arbitration 
shall be established, to settle all differences and 
 
+P30 
quarrels between the Powers; so that disputes 
shall not end in war.  
     Ninthly:  &amp;Baha'u'llah taught that hearts must 
receive the Bounty of the Holy Spirit, so that 
Spiritual civilization may be established.  For 
material civilization is not adequate for the needs 
of mankind and cannot be the cause of its 
happiness.  Material civilization is like the body 
and spiritual civilization is like the soul.  Body 
without soul cannot live.  
     This is a short summary of the Teachings of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  To establish this &amp;Baha'u'llah underwent 
great difficulties and hardships.  He was in 
constant confinement and He suffered great 
persecution.  But in the fortress (&amp;Akka) He reared 
a spiritual palace and from the darkness of His 
prison He sent out a great light to the world.  
     It is the ardent desire of the &amp;Baha'is to put these 
teachings into common practice:  and they will 
strive with soul and heart to give up their lives for 
this purpose, until the heavenly light brightens 
the whole world of humanity.  
     I am very happy that I have been able to talk 
with you in this gathering:  and hope that this 
deep consciousness of mine is acceptable to you.  
     I pray for you, that you may succeed in your 
aspirations and that the bounties of the Kingdom 
may be yours.  
 
+P31 
          Farewell Reception:  Introduction 
 
     On the evening of St. Michael's day, a 
large farewell reception was given to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the hall of the Passmore 
Edwards' Settlement, which was 
filled to its utmost capacity with representative 
people of every profession, some coming from 
great distances.  
     On the platform surrounding &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
were men of different shades of thought, met to 
express their sympathy with the work and mission 
of their great visitor.  Professor Michael E. Sadler 
was in the chair.  
     The meeting began with the Lord's Prayer 
spoken by the entire assembly; this was followed 
by the prayer for Unity of &amp;Baha'u'llah and a 
prayer of the fifth Century, ascribed to Pope 
Gelasius.  Professor Sadler then spoke in words 
that will never be forgotten by those who heard 
them; and in his address used a quotation from a 
Universal Prayer, which had been submitted by 
an earnest &amp;Baha'i to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the year before 
in Egypt and which had been completed by him 
and commended as one that could be used by 
peoples of all faiths in the East and West.  
     The Chairman was followed by Sir Richard 
Stapley, Mr. Eric Hammond, Mr. Claude 
Montefiore, Mrs. Stannard from Egypt, and 
others.  As &amp;Abdu'l-Baha left the hall, the poor 
people of the neighbourhood, crowded on the 
 
+P32 
pavement to see him and an eager-faced little 
lame girl on crutches was specially brought to 
him.  
 
+P33 
             Meeting of Farewell to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
      Reprinted by kind permission, from the Christian 
               Commonwealth of Oct. 4th.  
                  September 29th, 1911.  
 
     AT the invitation of Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper 
about four hundred and sixty 
representative people met in the hall of 
the Passmore Edwards' Settlement, 
Tavistock Place, last Friday evening to bid 
farewell to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha &amp;Abbas on the eve of his 
departure for Paris.  Arriving in London on 
Monday evening, September the fourth, he has 
spent a happy and busy four weeks in our midst.  
Except for a brief visit to Bristol last week he 
remained at 97, Cadogan Gardens.  His time was 
mainly occupied in interviews with people who 
wish to meet him.  These included not a few whose 
names are household words in this country, and 
some travelled long distances to see him.  
     A beautiful spirit prevailed on Friday evening.  
The atmosphere was very different from that of an 
ordinary meeting or religious gathering.  Everyone 
present was enriched by the lofty spiritual tone of 
the proceedings; the notes struck were all in the 
direction of Brotherhood, Unity, and Peace.  
While a report of the speeches would give a very 
inadequate idea of the effect produced, yet they 
were so well-conceived, so sincere, so exquisitely 
phrased as to be all worthy of reproduction.  
Among others &amp;Amir Ali Siyyid wrote regretting 
 
+P34 
his inability to be present, and Archdeacon 
Wilberforce sent affectionate greetings.  
     After the Lord's Prayer and prayers for Unity 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah and Gelasius (fifth Century), 
Professor Michael Sadler spoke as follows:--
          Speech of Professor Michael Sadler 
     We have met together to bid farewell to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and to thank God for his 
example and teaching, and for the 
power of his prayers to bring Light into 
confused thought, Hope into the place of dread, 
Faith where doubt was, and into troubled hearts, 
the Love which overmasters self-seeking and fear.  
     Though we all, among ourselves, in our 
devotional allegiance have our own individual 
loyalties, to all of us &amp;Abdu'l-Baha brings, and has 
brought, a message of Unity, of sympathy and of 
Peace.  He bids us all be real and true in what we 
profess to believe; and to treasure above 
everything the Spirit behind the form.  With him 
we bow before the Hidden Name, before that 
which is of every life the Inner Life!  He bids us 
worship in fearless loyalty to our own faith, but 
with ever stronger yearning after Union, Brotherhood, 
and Love; so turning ourselves in Spirit, 
and with our whole heart, that we may enter more 
into the mind of God, which is above class, above 
race, and beyond time.  
     Professor Sadler concluded with a beautiful 
prayer of James Martineau.  
 
+P35 
     Mr. Eric Hammond said the &amp;Baha'i movement 
stood for unity; one God, one people; a myriad 
souls manifesting the divine unity, a unity so 
complete that no difference of colour or creed 
could possibly differentiate between one Manifestation 
of God and another, and a sympathy so 
all-embracing as to include the very lowest, 
meanest, shabbiest of men; unity, sympathy, 
brotherhood, leading up to a concord universal.  
He concluded with a saying of &amp;Baha'u'llah, that 
the divine cause of universal good could not be 
limited to either East or West.  
     Miss Alice Buckton said we were standing at 
one of the springtimes of the world, and from that 
assembly of representatives of thought and work 
and love, would go out all over the world 
influences making for unity and brotherhood The 
complete equality of men and women was one of 
the chief notes of &amp;Baha'i teaching.  
     Sir Richard Stapley pointed out that unity 
must not be sought in the forms and externals of 
religion, but in the inner spirit.  In Persia there 
had been such an impulse towards real unity as 
was a rebuke to this so-called Christian country.  
     Mr. Claude Montefiore, as a Jew, rejoiced in 
the growth of the spirit of unity, and regarded 
that meeting as prophetic of the better time to 
come, and in some sense a fulfillment of the idea 
expressed by one who fell as a martyr to the 
Roman Catholic faith, Sir Thomas More, who 
wrote of the great Church of the Utopians, in 
which all varieties of creeds gathered together, 
having a service and liturgy that expressed the 
 
+P36 
higher unity, while admitting special loyalties.  
     Mrs. Stannard dwelt on what that meeting and 
the sentiments expressed meant to the East, 
especially to the women, whose condition it was 
difficult for the West to understand.  
     &amp;Tammaddun'ul-Mulk testified to the unifying 
effect the &amp;Baha'i movement had had in Persia, 
and of the wonderful way in which it had spread 
to America and other countries.  
     Then &amp;Abdu'l-Baha rose to give his farewell 
address.  An impressive figure, the face rather 
worn but the eyes full of animation, he stood for 
about fifteen minutes, speaking in soft musical 
Persian.  With hands extended, palms upwards, 
he closed with a prayer.  
 
          Farewell words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
 
     O NOBLE friends and seekers for the 
Kingdom of God!  About sixty years 
ago in the time when the fire of war 
was blazing among the nations of the 
world, and bloodshed was considered an honour 
to mankind; in a time when the carnage of 
thousands stained the earth; when children were 
rendered fatherless; when fathers were without 
sons and mothers were spent with weeping; when 
the darkness of inter-racial hatred and animosity 
seemed to envelope mankind and blot out the 
divine light; when the wafting of the holy breath 
of God seemed to be cut off--in that time 
&amp;Baha'u'llah rose like a shining star from the 
 
+P37 
horizon of Persia, inspired with the message of 
Peace and of Brotherhood among men.  
     He brought the light of guidance to the world; 
He kindled the fire of love and revealed the great 
reality of the True Beloved.  He sought to destroy 
the foundations of religious and racial prejudice 
and of political rivalry.  
     He likened the world of humanity to a tree, and 
all the nations to its branches and the people to its 
leaves, buds and fruits.  
     His mission was to change ignorant fanaticism 
into Universal love, to establish in the minds of 
His followers the basis of the unity of humanity 
and to bring about in practice the equality of 
mankind.  He declared that all men were equal 
under the mercy and bounty of God.  
     Then was the door of the Kingdom set wide 
and the light of a new heaven on earth revealed 
unto seeing eyes.  
     Yet the whole &amp;Baha'u'llah's life was spent in 
the midst of great trial and cruel tyranny.  In 
Persia He was thrown into prison, put into chains, 
and lived constantly under the menace of the 
sword.  He was scorned and scourged.  
     When He was about thirty years old He was 
exiled to &amp;Baghdad, and from &amp;Baghdad to 
Constantinople, and from there to Adrianople 
and lastly to the prison of &amp;Akka.  
     Yet under chains and from His cell He 
succeeded in spreading His cause, and uplifting 
the banner of the oneness of humanity.  
     Now, God be praised, we see the light of Love 
shining in the East and in the West; and the tent 
 
+P38 
of fellowship is raised in the midst of all the 
peoples for the drawing together of all hearts and 
souls.  
     The call of the Kingdom has been sounded, 
and the annunciation of the world's need for 
Universal Peace has enlightened the world's 
conscience.  
     My hope is that through the zeal and ardour of 
the pure of heart, the darkness of hatred and 
difference will be entirely abolished, and the light 
of love and unity shall shine; this world shall become 
a new world; things material shall become 
the mirror of the divine; human hearts shall meet 
and embrace each other; the whole world 
become as a man's native country and the 
different races be counted as one race.  
     Then disputes and differences will vanish, and 
the Divine Beloved be revealed on this earth.  
     As the East and the West are illumined by one 
sun, so all races, nations, and creeds shall be seen 
as the servants of the One God.  The whole earth 
is one home, and all peoples, did they but know it, 
are bathed in the oneness of God's mercy.  God 
created all.  He gives sustenance to all.  He guides 
and trains all under the shadow of his bounty.  We 
must follow the example God Himself gives us, 
and do away with all disputations and quarrels.  
     Praise be to God! the signs of friendship are 
appearing, and as a proof of this I, today, coming 
from the East, have met in this London of the 
West with extreme kindness, regard and love, and 
I am deeply thankful and happy.  I shall never 
forget this time I am spending with you.

     Forty years I endured in a Turkish prison.  
Then in 1908 the Young Turks "Committee of 
Union and Progress" shook the gates of 
despotism and set all prisoners free, myself among 
them.  I pray that blessing may be upon all who 
work for Union and Progress.  
     In the future untrue reports will be spread 
regarding &amp;Baha'u'llah in order to hinder the 
spread of Truth.  I tell you this, that you may be 
awake and prepared.  
     I leave you with prayer that all the beauty of 
the Kingdom may be yours.  In deep regret at our 
separation, I bid you good-bye.

     The translation of the valedictory having been

meeting by giving his blessing in undulating 
rhythmic tones.  
     By the time these lines appear &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
&amp;Abbas will have left our shores, but the memory 
of his gracious personality is a permanent 
possession.  His influence will be felt for many

promote that union of East and West for which 
many have long yearned.

     The subjoined notes are taken from "The Quarterly 
      Record of `Higher Thought' Work," November 1911.  
 
     ONE of the most interesting and significant 
events which have taken place, has 
been the visit of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to 
London.  The Persian Mage whose life, 
passed in prison, has been spent in promoting 
peace and unity by the one certain method of 
aiding individual spiritual development, must in 
a very real sense have "tasted of the travail of his 
soul and been satisfied".  Not only was he visited 
privately by nearly every earnest truth-seeker and 
leader of high thought in London, but his message 
was made known to thousands who had but dimly 
heard his name before.  
     The Higher Thought Centre was well known to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha as the place where the &amp;Baha'is held 
their weekly meetings under the direction of Miss 
Rosenberg, and an invitation to the Centre was 
accepted by him just two days before his 
departure.  Through his interpreter &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
gave a kindly greeting and a short impressive 
address, dwelling on the blessedness of such an 
assembly gathered in a spirit of unity and 
spiritual aspiration.  He concluded with a lowly 
uttered fervent prayer in his own tongue, and a 
benediction which all present felt to be very real.  
     On the following day a message was conveyed 
to the Centre from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha signifying the 
 
+P41 
fullest appreciation of all kindness shown to the 
&amp;Baha'is, and concluding with these words; "it 
matters not what name each calls himself--The 
Great Work is One."  
     "Christ is ever in the world of existence.  He has 
never disappeared out of it....  Rest assured that 
Christ is present.  The Spiritual beauty we see 
around us today is from the breathings of Christ."

            A Message from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
Written for The Christian Commonwealth and published 
              September 29th, 1911.  
 
     GOD sends Prophets for the education of 
the people and the progress of mankind.  
Each such Manifestation of God 
has raised humanity.  They serve the 
whole world by the bounty of God.  The sure proof 
that they are the Manifestations of God is in the 
education and progress of the people.  The Jews 
were in the lowest condition of ignorance, and 
captives under Pharaoh when Moses appeared 
and raised them to a high state of civilization.  
Thus was the reign of Solomon brought about 
and science and art were made known to 
mankind.  Even Greek philosophers became 
students of Solomon's teaching.  Thus was Moses 
proved to be a Prophet.  
     After the lapse of time the Israelites deteriorated, 
and became subject to the Romans and the 
Greeks.  Then the brilliant Star of Jesus rose from 
the horizon upon the Israelites, brightening the 
world, until all sects and creeds and nations were 
taught the beauty of unity.  There cannot be any 
better proof than this that Jesus was the Word of 
God.  
     So it was with the Arabian nations who, being 
uncivilized, were oppressed by the Persian and 
Greek governments.  When the Light of &amp;Muhammad 
shone forth all Arabia was brightened.  These 
oppressed and degraded peoples became enlightened 
 
+P43 
and cultured; so much so, indeed, that 
other nations imbibed Arabian civilization from 
Arabia.  This was the proof of &amp;Muhammad's 
divine mission.  
     All the teaching of the Prophets is one; one 
faith; one Divine light shining throughout the 
world.  Now, under the banner of the oneness of 
humanity all people of all creeds should turn 
away from prejudice and become friends and 
believers in all the Prophets.  As Christians believe 
in Moses, so the Jews should believe in Jesus.  As 
the &amp;Muhammadans believe in Christ and Moses, 
so likewise the Jews and the Christians should 
believe in &amp;Muhammad.  Then all disputes would 
disappear, all then would be united.  &amp;Baha'u'llah 
came for this purpose.  He has made the three 
religions one.  He has uplifted the standard of the 
oneness of faith and the honour of humanity in 
the centre of the world.  Today we must gather 
round it, and try with heart and soul to bring 
about the union of mankind.  
 
+P44 
    Discourse given at Miss E. J. Rosenberg's 
                 Unity Meeting.  
             September 8th, 1911.  
 
     PRAISE be to God, that such a meeting 
of purity and steadfastness is being 
held in London.  The hearts of those 
present are pure, and are turned 
towards the Kingdom of God.  I hope that all that 
is contained and established in the Holy books of 
God may be realized in you.  The Messengers of 
God are the principal and the first teachers.  
Whenever this world becomes dark, and divided 
in its opinions and indifferent, God will send one 
of His Holy Messengers.  
     Moses came during a time of darkness, when 
ignorance and childishness prevailed amongst the 
people, and they were waverers.  Moses was the 
teacher of God; He gave the teachings of holiness 
and educated the Israelites.  He raised up the 
people from their degradation and caused them to 
be highly honoured.  He taught them Sciences and 
Arts, trained them in civilization and increased 
their human virtues.  After a while, that which 
they had thus received from God was lost; the 
way was prepared for the return of evil qualities, 
and the world was oppressed by tyranny.  
     Then again the rumour of the Light of Reality 
and the breathing of the Holy Spirit became 
known.  The cloud of Bounty showered, the Light 
of Guidance shone upon the earth.  The world put 
 
+P45 
on a new garment, the people became a new 
people, the oneness of humanity was proclaimed.  
The great unity of thought transformed humanity 
and created a new world.  Again, after a time, all 
this was forgotten by the people.  The teachings of 
God no longer influenced their lives.  His 
prophecies and commandments became fainter 
and were finally obliterated from their hearts, and 
tyranny and thoughtlessness once more prevailed.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah then came and once more renewed 
the foundation of Faith.  He brought back the 
teachings of God, and the humane practices of the 
time of Christ.  He quenched the thirst of the 
thirsty, He awakened the careless and called the 
attention of the heedless to the Divine secrets.  He 
declared the unity of humanity, and spread 
abroad the teaching of the equality of all men.  
     Therefore, all of you ought with your hearts 
and minds to endeavour to win the people with 
kindness, so that this great Unity may be 
established, that childish superstitions may pass 
away, and all may become one.  
 
+P46 
     Discourse at Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper's 
            September 13th, 1911.  
 
     &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA said:--Thanks be to 
God, this is a good meeting.  It is very 
enlightened, it is spiritual.  
     As a Persian Poet has written:--
"The Celestial Universe is so formed that 
the under world reflects the upper world."  That is 
to say whatever exists in heaven is reflected in this 
phenomenal world.  Now, praise be to God, this 
meeting of ours is a reflection of the heavenly 
concourse; it is as though we had taken a mirror 
and had gazed into it.  This reflection from the 
heavenly concourse we know as love.  
     As heavenly love exists in the supreme 
concourse even so it is reflected here.  The 
supreme concourse is filled with the desire for 
God--thank God, this desire is also here.  
     Therefore if we say that this meeting is 
heavenly, it is true.  Why?  Because we have no 
other desire except for that which comes from 
God.  We have no other object save the 
commemoration of God.  
     Some of the people of the earth desire conquest 
over others:  some of them are longing for rest and 
ease; others desire a high position; some desire to 
become famous:--thank God our desire is for 
spirituality and for union with God.  
     Now that we are gathered here our wish is to 
raise the banner of the Unity of God, to spread 
 
+P47 
the Light of God, to make the hearts of the people 
turn to the Kingdom.  Therefore I thank God that 
He is causing us to do this great work.  
     I pray for all of you, that you may become 
celestial warriors, that you may everywhere 
spread the Unity of God and enlighten the East 
and West, and that you may give to all hearts the 
love of God.  This is my utmost desire, and I pray 
to God that your desire may be the same.  
     I am very happy to be with you all.  I am 
pleased with the English King and Government, 
and with the people.  
     You may thank God that in this land you are so 
free.  You do not know what lack of freedom there 
is in the East.  When anyone comes to this country 
he is content.  
     I wish God's protection for you all.  Goodbye to 
you all.

     Discourse by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha given at the 
        Unity Meeting of Misses Jack and 
                    Herrick.  
              September 22nd, 1911.  
 
     IT is a cold and miserable day but as I 
was anxious to see you I came here.  
For a man who has love, effort is a rest.  
He will travel any distance to visit his 
friends.  
     Thank God I see you spiritual and at rest; I 
give you this message from God; that you must be 
turned toward Him.  Praise God that you are near 
Him!  The unworthy things of this world have not 
deterred you from seeking the world of Spirit.  
When in harmony with that world, you care not 
for the things that perish; your desire is for that 
which never dies and the Kingdom lies open 
before you.  I hope that the teaching of God will 
spread throughout the world, and will cause all to 
be united.  
     In the time of Jesus Christ there was an 
outpouring of the Light from East to West that 
brought the people under a heavenly banner and 
illumined them with divine insight.  Western 
lands have been kindled by the Light of the 
Christ.  I pray earnestly that the Light in this 
advanced age will so illumine the world that all 
may rally under the banner of Unity and receive 
Spiritual education.  
     Then those problems which cause difference 
 
+P49 
among the peoples of the earth will be seen no 
more, for verily they are not.  You are all waves of 
one sea, mirrors of one reflection.  
     This day the countries of Europe are at rest; 
Education has become widespread.  The light of 
liberty is the light of the West, and the intention 
of government is to work for truth and justice in 
Western countries.  But ever the light of 
spirituality shines from out of the East.  In this age 
that light has become dimmed; religion has 
become a matter of form and ceremony and the 
desire for God's love has been lost.  
     In very age of great spiritual darkness, a light is 
kindled in the East.  So once again the light of the 
teachings of God has come unto you.  Even as 
education and progress travel from West to East, 
so does the spiritual fire travel from East to West.  
     I hope that the people of the West may be 
illumined by the light of God; that the Kingdom 
may come to them, that they may find eternal 
Life, that the Spirit of God may spread like a fire 
among them, that they may be baptized with the 
Water of Life and may find a new birth.  
     This is my desire; I hope by the will of God, He 
will cause you to receive it, and will make you 
happy.  
     In the same way that you have education and 
material progress so may the light of God be your 
portion.  
     God keep all of you in safety.

+P53 
          The Arrival in London 
 
     THE evening of his arrival in London, 
Monday, September 4th, 1911, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  Heaven has blessed 
this day.  It was said that London 
should be a place for a great proclamation of the 
Faith.  I was tired when I went on board the 
steamer, but when I reached London and beheld 
the faces of the friends my fatigue left me.  Your 
great love refreshes me.  I am very pleased with the 
English friends.  
     The feeling that existed between the East and 
the West is changing in the Light of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
teaching.  It used to be such that if an Occidental 
drank from the cup of an Oriental the cup would 
be considered polluted and would be broken.  
Now when a Western &amp;Baha'i dines with an 
Eastern &amp;Baha'i the vessels and the plates that he 
has used are kept apart and reverenced in his 
memory.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha then gave this historic 
instance of wonderful brotherly love:  
     One day some soldiers came to the house of a 
&amp;Baha'i and demanded that one of the guests 
should be given up for execution, according to 
their warrant.  The host took his guest's place and 
died in his stead.  
 
+P54 
                     London 
 
     The magnet of your love brought me to this 
country.  My hope is that the Divine Light may 
shine here, and that the Heavenly Star of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah may strengthen you, so that you may 
be the cause of the oneness of humanity, that you 
may help to make the darkness of superstition and 
prejudice disappear and unite all creeds and 
nations.  
     This is a brilliant century.  Eyes are now open 
to the beauty of the oneness of humanity, of love 
and of brotherhood.  The darkness of suppression 
will disappear and the light of unity will shine.  
We cannot bring love and unity to pass merely by 
talking of it.  Knowledge is not enough.  Wealth, 
science, education are good, we know:  but we 
must also work and study to bring to maturity the 
fruit of knowledge.  
     Knowledge is the first step; resolve, the second 
step; action, its fulfillment, is the third step.  To 
construct a building one must first of all make a 
plan, then one must have the power (money), 
then one can build.  A society of Unity is formed, 
that is good--but meetings and discussions are 
not enough.  In Egypt these meetings take place 
but there is only talk and no result.  These 
meetings here in London are good, the knowledge 
and the intention are good, but how can there be 
a result without action?  Today the force for 
Unity is the Holy Spirit of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He 
 
+P55 
manifested this spirit of Unity.  &amp;Baha'u'llah brings 
East and West together.  Go back, search history, 
you will not find a precedent for this.  
 
                 Differences 
 
     God has created the world as one--the 
boundaries are marked out by man.  God has not 
divided the lands, but each man has his house 
and meadow; horses and dogs do not divide the 
fields into parts.  That is why &amp;Baha'u'llah says:  
"Let not a man glory in that he loves his country, 
but that he loves his kind."  All are of one family, 
one race; all are human beings.  Differences as to 
the partition of lands should not be the cause of 
separation among the people.  
     One of the great reasons of separation is colour.  
Look how this prejudice has power in America, 
for instance.  See how they hate one another!  
Animals do not quarrel because of their colour!  
Surely man who is so much higher in creation, 
should not be lower than the animals.  Think over 
this.  What ignorance exists!  White doves do not 
quarrel with blue doves because of their colour, 
but white men fight with dark-coloured men.  This 
racial prejudice is the worst of all.  
     The Old Testament says that God created man 
like unto His own image; in the Qur'an it says:  
"There is no difference in the Creation of God!"  
Think well, God has created all, cares for all, and 
all are under His protection.  The policy of God is 
better than our policy.  We are not as wise as God!  
 
+P56 
                      Religion 
 
     To most men who have not heard the message 
of this teaching, religion seems an outward form, 
a pretence, merely a seal of respectability.  Some 
priests are in holy office for no other reason than 
to gain their living.  They themselves do not 
believe in the religion they pretend to teach.  
Would these men lay down their lives for their 
faith?  Ask a Christian of this kind to deny Christ 
in order to save his life, and he will do it.  
     Ask a &amp;Baha'i to deny any of the great Prophets, 
to deny his faith or to deny Moses, &amp;Muhammad 
or Christ, and he will say:  I would rather die.  So a 
&amp;Muhammadan &amp;Baha'i is a better Christian than 
many so called Christians.  
     A &amp;Baha'i denies no religion; he accepts the 
Truth in all, and would die to uphold it.  He loves 
all men as his brothers, of whatever class, of 
whatever race or nationality, of whatever creed or 
colour, whether good or bad, rich or poor, 
beautiful or hideous.  He commits no violence; if 
he is struck he does not return the blow.  He calls 
nothing bad, following the example of the Lord 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  As a safeguard against intemperance 
he does not drink wine or spirits.  &amp;Baha'u'llah has 
said it is not good for a sane man to take that 
which will destroy his health and sense.  
     The religion of God has two aspects in this 
world.  The spiritual (the real) and the formal (the 
outward).  The formal side changes, as man 
 
+P57 
changes from age to age.  The spiritual side which 
is the Truth, never changes.  The Prophets and 
Manifestations of God bring always the same 
teaching; at first men cling to the Truth but after 
a time they disfigure it.  The Truth is distorted by 
man-made outward forms and material laws.  The 
veil of substance and worldliness is drawn across 
the reality of Truth.  
     As Moses and Jesus brought their Message to 
the people, so &amp;Baha'u'llah brings the same 
Message.  
     Each time God sends a Great One to us we are 
given new life, but the Truth each Manifestation 
brings is the same.  The Truth never changes but 
man's vision changes.  It is dulled and confused by 
the complication of outward forms.  
     The Truth is easy to understand although the 
outward forms in which it is expressed bewilder 
the intelligence.  As men grow they see the futility 
of man-made forms and despise them.  Therefore 
many leave the churches, because the latter often 
emphasize the external only.  
 
+P58 
     Discourse to an assembly of Theosophists.  
             London - September, 1911.  
 
     THESE are wonderful days!  We see an 
Eastern guest received with love and 
courtesy in the West.  I have been 
drawn here, in spite of indisposition, 
by the magnet of your love and sympathy.  
     Some years ago an Ambassador was sent from 
Persia to London where he stayed five years.  (His 
name was &amp;Abdu'l &amp;Hasan &amp;Khan).  When he 
returned to Persia they asked him to tell them 
about the English people.  He answered:  "I do not 
know the English people, although I have been in 
London for years I have only met the people of 
the Court."  This man was a great man in Persia, 
and was sent to England by princes, and yet he 
did not know the people, although he had lived 
among them five years.  Now, I--long a prisoner, 
come to England for the first time, and although 
my visit is so short, I have already met many dear 
friends, and I can say I know the people.  Those I 
have met are true souls working for peace and 
unity.--Think what a difference there is between 
this time we are living in now, and seventy years 
ago!  Think of the progress! the progress towards 
unity and peace.  
     It is God's will that the differences between 
nations should disappear.  Those who help on the 
cause of unity are doing God's work.  Unity is the 
Divine Bounty for this luminous century.  Praise 
 
+P59 
be to God, there are today many societies and 
many meetings held for Unity.  Enmity is not so 
much the cause of separation as it used to be; the 
cause of disunion now is mostly prejudice. For 
instance, years ago when Europeans visited the 
East they were considered unclean and were hated.  
Now it is different:  when people of the West visit 
those in the East who are followers of the New Light, 
they are received with love and courtesy.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha holding a little child close to him 
said, the true &amp;Baha'i loves the children, because 
Jesus says they are of the Kingdom of heaven.  A 
simple pure heart is near to God; a child has no 
worldly ambitions.  
 
                    Prejudices 
 
     The Universal Races Congress was good, for it 
was intended for the furtherance and progress of 
unity among all nations and a better international 
understanding.  The purpose was good.  The 
causes of dispute among different nations are 
always due to one of the following classes of 
prejudice:  racial, lingual, theological,  personal, 
and prejudices of custom and tradition.  It 
requires a universal active force to overcome these 
differences.  A small disease needs a small remedy, 
but a disease which pervades the whole body 
needs a very strong remedy.  A small lamp may 
light a room, a larger would light a house, a larger 
still might shine through the city, but the sun is 
needed to light the whole world.  
 
+P60 
     The differences in language cause disunion 
between nations.  There must be one universal 
language.  The diversity in Faiths is also a cause of 
separation.  The true foundation of all faiths must 
be established, the outer differences abolished.  
There must be a Oneness of Faith.  To end all 
these differences is a very hard task.  The whole 
world is sick, and needs the power of the Great 
Healer.  
     These meetings teach us that Unity is good, 
and that suppression (slavery under the yoke of 
tradition and prejudice) is the cause of disunion.  
To know this is not enough.  All knowledge is good, 
but it can bear no fruit except by action.  It is well 
to know that riches are good, but that knowledge 
will not make a man rich; he must work, he must 
put his knowledge into practice.  We hope the 
people realize and know that unity is good, and 
we also hope that they will not be content to stand 
still in that knowledge.  Do not only say that 
Unity, Love and Brotherhood are good; you must 
work for their realization.  
     The Czar of Russia suggested the Hague Peace 
Conference and proposed a decrease in armament 
for all nations.  In this Conference it was proved 
that Peace was beneficial to all countries, and that 
war destroyed trade, etc.  The Czar's words were 
admirable though after the conference was over 
he himself was the first to declare war (against 
Japan).  
     Knowledge is not enough; we hope by the Love 
of God we shall put it into practice.  A spiritual 
universal Force is needed for this.  Meetings are 
 
+P61 
good for engendering spiritual force.  To know 
that it is possible to reach a state of perfection, is 
good; to march forward on the path is better.  We 
know that to help the poor and to be merciful is 
good and pleases God, but knowledge alone does 
not feed the starving man, nor can the poor be 
warmed by knowledge or words in the bitter 
winter; we must give the practical help of 
Loving-kindness.  
     What of the Peace Congress?  
     It resembles many drunkards gathered 
together to protest against the drinking of alcohol.  
They say drink is horrible and they straightway 
go out from the house to drink again.  
 
                     Theosophy 
 
     When &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was asked if he recognized 
the good which the Theosophical Society has 
done.  He replied:  
     I know it; I think a great deal of it.  I know that 
their desire is to serve mankind.  I thank this noble 
Society in the name of all &amp;Baha'is and for myself.  I 
hope that by God's help these friends will succeed 
in bringing about love and unity.  It is a great 
work and needs the effort of all the servants of 
God!  
 
                      Peace 
 
     During the last six thousand years nations have 
hated one another, it is now time to stop.  War 
must cease.  Let us be united and love one another 
 
+P62 
and await the result.  We know the effects of war 
are bad.  So let us try, as an experiment, peace, 
and if the results of peace are bad, then we can 
choose if it would be better to go back to the old 
state of war!  Let us in any case make the 
experiment.  If we see that unity brings Light we 
shall continue it.  For six thousand years we have 
been walking on the left-hand path; let us walk on 
the right-hand path now.  We have passed many 
centuries in darkness, let us advance towards the 
light.  
     Question.--(It was remarked, Theosophy 
teaches that truth in all the religions is the same):  
Does the task of unifying all religions have 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's sympathy?  
     Answer.--Surely.  
     Question.--Can &amp;Abdu'l-Baha suggest any lines 
on which it could best be worked out?  
     Answer.--Search for truth.  Seek the realities in 
all religions.  Put aside all superstitions.  Many of 
us do not realize the Reality of all Religions.  
 
               Divine Manifestations 
 
     Question.--What is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's teaching 
concerning the different Divine manifestations?  
     Answer.--The Reality of all is One.  Truth is 
one.  Religions are like the branches of one Tree.  
One branch is high, one is low and one in the 
centre, yet all draw their life from the one stem.  
One branch bears fruit and others are not laden 
so abundantly.  All the Prophets are lights, they 
 
+P63 
only differ in degree; they shine like brilliant 
heavenly bodies, each have their appointed place 
and time of ascension.  Some are like lamps, some 
like the moon, some like distant stars, and a few 
are like the sun, shining from one end of the earth 
to the other.  all have the same Light to give, yet 
they are different in degree.  
 
                      Buddhism 
 
     Some referred to the teaching of Buddha.  
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  The real teaching of Buddha is 
the same as the teaching of Jesus Christ.  The 
teachings of all the Prophets are the same in 
character.  Now men have changed the teaching.  
If you look at the present practice of the Buddhist 
religion, you will see that there is little of the 
Reality left.  Many worship idols although their 
teaching forbids it.  
     Buddha had disciples and he wished to send 
them out into the world to teach, so he asked 
them questions to see if they were prepared as he 
would have them be.  "When you go to the East 
and to the West," said the Buddha, "and the 
people shut their doors to you and refuse to speak 
to you, what will you do?"--The disciples 
answered and said:  "We shall be very thankful 
that they do us no harm."--"Then if they do you 
harm and mock, what will you do?"--"We shall 
be very thankful that they do not give us worse 
treatment."--"If they throw you into 
prison?"--"We shall still be grateful that they do 
 
+P64 
not kill us."--"What if they were to kill you?" the 
Master asked for the last time.  "Still," answered 
the disciples, "we will be thankful, for they cause 
us to be martyrs.  What more glorious fate is there 
than this, to die for the glory of God?"  And the 
Buddha said:  "Well done!"  
     The teaching of Buddha was like a young and 
beautiful child, and now it has become as an old 
and decrepit man.  Like the aged man it cannot 
see, it cannot hear, it cannot remember anything.  
Why go so far back?  Consider the laws of the Old 
Testament:  the Jews do not follow Moses as their 
example nor keep his commands.  So it is with 
many other religions.  
     How can we get the power to follow the right 
path?  
     By putting the teaching into practice power will 
be given.  You know which path to follow:  you 
cannot be mistaken, for there's a great distinction 
between God and evil, between Light and 
darkness, Truth and falsehood,  Love and hatred, 
Generosity and meanness, Education and ignorance, 
Faith in God and superstition, good Laws 
and unjust laws.  
 
                   Faith 
 
     How can one increase in faith?  
     You must strive.  A child does not know, in 
learning he obtains knowledge. search for Truth.  
     There are three kinds of Faith:  first, that which is 
from tradition and birth.  For example:  a child is 
born of &amp;Muhammadan parents, he is a &amp;Muhammadan.  
 
+P65 
This faith is weak traditional faith:  second, 
that which comes from Knowledge, and is the faith 
of understanding.  This is good, but there is a 
better, the faith of practice.  This is real faith.  
     We hear there is an invention, we believe it is 
good; then we come and see it.  We hear that there 
is wealth, we see it; we work hard for it, and 
become rich ourselves and so help others.  We 
know and we see the Light, we go close to it, are 
warmed by it, and reflect its rays on others; this is 
real faith, and thus we receive power to become 
the eternal sons of God.  
 
                       Healing 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  Disease is of two kinds:  
material and spiritual.  
     Take for instance, a cut hand; if you pray for 
the cut to be healed and do not stop its bleeding, 
you will not do much good; a material remedy is 
needed.  
     Sometimes if the nervous system is paralyzed 
through fear, a spiritual remedy is necessary.  
Madness, incurable otherwise,. can be cured 
through prayer.  It often happens that sorrow 
makes one ill, this can be cured by spiritual 
means.  
 
                 Philanthropic Societies 
 
     Someone asked if the Humanitarian Society 
was good.--Yes all societies, all organizations, 
working for the betterment of the human race are 
 
+P66 
good, very good.  All who work for their brothers 
and sisters have &amp;Baha'u'llah's blessing.  They will 
surely succeed.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  It makes me happy to see all 
the believers in London.  You are all, of every race 
and creed, members of one family.  The teaching 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah constrains you to realize your 
brotherhood to one another.  
 
            Man's Comprehension of God and of 
                     Higher Worlds 
 
     To man, the Essence of God is incomprehensible, 
so also are the worlds beyond this, and their 
condition.  It is given to man to obtain knowledge, 
to attain to great spiritual perfection, to discover 
hidden truths and to manifest even the attributes 
of God; but still man cannot comprehend the 
Essence of God.  Where the ever-widening circle of 
man's knowledge meets the spiritual world a 
Manifestation of God is sent to mirror forth His 
splendour.  
 
                Divine Manifestations 
 
     Is the Divine Manifestation, God?  
     Yes, and yet not in Essence.  A Divine 
Manifestation is as a mirror reflecting the light of 
the Sun.  The light is the same and yet the mirror 
is not the Sun.  All the Manifestations of God bring 
the same Light; they only differ in degree, not in 
 
+P67 
reality.  The Truth is one.  The light is the same 
though the lamps may be different; we must look 
at the Light not at the Lamp.  If we accept the 
Light in one, we must accept the Light in all; all 
agree, because all are the same.  The teaching is 
ever the same, it is only the outward forms that 
change.  
     The Manifestations of God are as the heavenly 
bodies.  All have their appointed place and time of 
ascension, but the Light they give is the same.  if 
one wishes to look for the sun rising, one does not 
look always at the same point because that point 
changes with the seasons.  When one sees the sun 
rise further in the north one recognizes it, though 
it has risen at a different point.  
 
+P68 
          Notes of a conversation with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
 
     A COLOURED man from South Africa 
who was visiting &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, said 
that even now no white people really 
cared very much for the black man.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha replies:  Compare the present 
time and the feeling towards the coloured people 
now, with the state of feeling two or three 
hundred years ago, and see how much better it is 
at present.  In a short time the relationship 
between the coloured and white people will still 
further improve, and bye and bye no difference 
will be felt between them.  White doves and purple 
doves exist, but both kinds are doves.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah once compared the coloured people 
to the black pupil of the eye surrounded by the 
white.  In this black pupil you see the reflection of 
that which is before it, and through it the light of 
the Spirit shines forth.  
     In the sight of God colour makes no difference 
at all, He looks at the hearts of men.  That which 
God desires from men is the heart.  A black man 
with a good character is far superior to a white 
man with a character that is less good.  
 
               Ideals of East and West 
 
     One of the organizers of the Races Congress 
present spoke of the Western ideals of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
 
+P69 
as differing from those of former prophets which 
were tinged with the ideas and civilization of the 
East.  He then asked whether &amp;Baha'u'llah had 
made a special study of Western writings, and 
founded his teachings in accordance with them.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha laughed heartily, and said that 
the books of &amp;Baha'u'llah, written and printed 
sixty years ago, contained the ideals now so 
familiar to the West, but, at that time, they had 
not been printed or thought of in the West.  
Besides, he continued, supposing that a very 
advanced thinker from the West had gone to visit 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and to teach Him, would the name of 
such a great man and the fact of his visit have 
been unknown and unrecorded?  No!  In former 
days, in the time of the Buddha and Zoroaster, 
civilization in Asia and in the East was very much 
higher than in the West and ideas and thoughts of 
the Eastern peoples were much in advance of, and 
nearer to the thoughts of God than those of the 
West.  But since that time superstitions had crept 
into the religion and ideals of the East, and from 
many differing causes the ideals and characters of 
the Eastern peoples had gone down and down, 
lower and lower, while the Western peoples had 
been constantly advancing and struggling 
towards the Light.  Consequently, in these days, 
the civilization of the West was much higher than 
that of the East, and the ideas and thoughts of the 
people of the West were much nearer to the 
thought of God than those of the East.  Therefore, 
the ideals of &amp;Baha'u'llah had been more quickly 
realized in the West.  
 
+P70 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha showed further how &amp;Baha'u'llah 
had exactly described in one of his books what has 
since been carried out in the International 
Council of Arbitration, describing its various 
functions, some of which have not yet been 
realized and he (&amp;Abdu'l-Baha) would describe 
them to us now, so that when they were fulfilled, 
as they would be in the near future, we might 
know that they had been prophesied by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     War was the greatest calamity that could 
overtake the nations, because the people usually 
employed in agriculture, trades, commerce, and 
other useful arts, were taken away from their 
various occupations and turned into soldiers, so 
that there was great waste and loss, in addition to 
the destruction and carnage of war.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah had said that the functions of the 
International Court would be to settle disputes 
that arose from time to time between the nations; 
to define the exact boundaries of the different 
countries, and to decide what number of soldiers 
and guns should be maintained by each nation, 
according to its population, in order to preserve 
internal order.  For instance, one country might 
have ten thousand soldiers, another twenty 
thousand, another fifteen thousand, and so on, in 
accordance with the size and population of the 
nation; also if any people rebelled against the 
decision of the Court and rejected it, the Court 
would empower the others to join their forces and 
to endorse their decision, if need be, by united 
action.  
 
+P71 
     We had not seen any of these things actualized 
as yet, but we should do so in the future.  
 
                Science and Faith 
 
     The gentleman then put a question which he 
said he considered of very great importance in 
connection with a religious movement, claiming 
to be universal.  What position he asked, if any, 
did &amp;Baha'u'llah given to the modern ideas and 
conceptions of Science in his teachings.  The 
whole structure of modern civilization is based 
upon the results and the knowledge obtained 
through laborious and patient observation of facts 
collected by men of Science:  in some cases 
through hundreds of years of painstaking 
investigation.  To make his meaning clearer, he 
instanced the ethic, and the moral teachings of 
the Chinese philosophers, than which he could 
conceive nothing higher.  However, these teachings 
had very little effect outside of China, for the 
reason he considered, that they were not 
primarily based on the teachings of Science.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha replied that a very great importance 
was given to Science and knowledge in the 
writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, who wrote that, if a man 
educated the children of the poor, who could not 
themselves afford to do so, it was, in the sight of 
God, as if he had educated the Son of God.  
     If any religion rejected Science and knowledge, 
that religion was false.  Science and Religion 
should go forward together; indeed, they should 
be like two fingers of one hand.  
 
+P72 
     &amp;Baha'u'llah had also in His writings given a 
most important place to Art, and the practice of 
skilled trades.  He had stated that the practice of 
an Art or Trade in the true spirit of service was 
identical with the worship of God.  
     A gentleman connected with the work of a 
Settlement then asked what was the best method 
of raising up and civilizing the very lowest and 
most degraded and ignorant of the people and 
would their education come about gradually 
through the enlightenment of the Spirit, or was 
there any special means we could adopt to further 
this end?  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha replied that the best way was to 
give them spiritual teachings and enlightenment.  
He also remarked that the way to broaden the 
outlook of the very narrow-hearted and prejudiced, 
and to make them listen to a wider 
teaching, was by showing towards them the 
greatest kindness and love.  The example of our 
lives was of more value than words.  
 
             Converse with Departed Persons 
 
     The question was asked if it were possible to 
establish communication with the dead, and 
whether it was wise or advisable to attend &amp;seances 
or to engage in table-turning, spirit-rapping, etc.  
     The Master said these rappings, etc., were all 
material things, and of the body.  What is needed 
is to rise above the material to the realms of the 
purely Spiritual.  Table-turning and such like 
 
+P73 
were material, a natural result, and not spiritual.  
     But it was possible to communicate with the 
dead through the condition of the character and 
the heart.  
 
            Are Superstitions Useful 
 
     A lady enquired whether some superstitions 
might not be good for ignorant people, who, if 
they were without them might perhaps be without 
beliefs of any kind?  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha replied that superstitions were of 
two kinds; those that were harmful and 
dangerous, and those that were harmless and 
produced certain good effects.  
     For example, there were some poor people who 
believed that misfortunes and punishments were 
caused by a Great Angel with a sword in his 
hand, who struck down those who stole, and 
committed murder and crimes.  
     They thought the flashes of lightning were the 
weapons of this angel, and that if they did wrong 
they would be struck by lightning.  This belief 
caused them to refrain from evil actions.  
     The Chinese held a superstition that if they 
burn certain pieces of paper this will drive the 
devils away; they sometimes burnt these pieces of 
paper on board ships when they were travelling in 
order to drive away devils, and by so doing they 
set fire to the ships and destroyed many lives.  
This was a type of dangerous and harmful 
superstition.  
 
+P74 
                The Life After Death 
 
     Mrs. S. asked some questions with reference to 
the conditions of existence in the next world, and 
the life after death; she said that having recently 
lost a very near relative, she had given much 
thought to this subject.  Many thought that 
re-union with those we had loved, and who had 
passed on to the future life, would only take place 
after a long period of time had elapsed.  She 
wished to know whether one would be re-united 
with those who had gone before immediately after 
death.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha answered that this would depend 
upon the respective stations of the two.  If both 
had the same degree of development, they would 
be re-united immediately after death.  The 
questioner then said, how could this state of 
development be acquired?  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha replied, 
by unceasing effort, striving to do right, and to 
attain spiritual qualities.  
     The questioner remarked that many differing 
opinions were held as to the conditions of the 
future life.  Some thought that all would have 
exactly the same perfections and virtues; that all 
would be equal and alike.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said there would be variety, and 
differing degrees of attainment, as in this world.  
     The question was then asked as to how it would 
be possible with no material bodies or environment 
to recognize different entities and characters, 
when all would be in the same conditions 
and on the same plane of existence.  
 
+P75 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said if several people look into a 
mirror at the same moment, they behold all the 
different personalities, their characteristics and 
movements; the glass of the mirror into which 
they look is one.  In your mind you have a variety 
of thoughts, but all these thoughts are separate 
and distinct.  Also you may perhaps have 
hundreds of friends; but when you call them 
before your memory you do not confuse them one 
with another:  each one is separate and distinct, 
having their own individualities and characteristics.  
     Replying to another questioner, he said that 
when two people, husband and wife for instance, 
have been completely united in this life their souls 
being as one soul, then after one of them has 
passed away, this union of heart and soul would 
remain unbroken.  
 
               Spiritual Relationship 
 
     In the evening of September 28th, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
was with a number of assembled guests.  
     He said all of you here are sisters.  Bodily 
relationships may pass; even two sisters may be 
inimical to each other, but the spiritual 
relationship is eternal, and brings about mutual 
love and service.  
     Be always kind to everyone and a refuge for 
          those who are without shelter.  
     Be daughters to those who are older than you.  
     Be sisters to those who are of your own age.  
 
+P76 
     Be mothers to those who are younger than 
          yourselves.  
     Be nurses to the sick, treasurers for the poor, 
          and supply heavenly food to the hungry.  
     A Persian doctor from &amp;Qazvin said this was a 
great work of God that the East and the West had 
become so united, and we must always thank God 
that the &amp;Baha'i cause had produced such great 
harmony and union between us.  The result of this 
visit of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to the West would be very 
great.  
 
+P77 
                A &amp;Baha'i Wedding 
 
     QUITE an oriental note was struck 
toward the end of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
London visit, by the marriage of a 
young Persian couple who had sought 
his presence for the ceremony, the bride 
journeying from Baghdad accompanied by her 
uncle in order to meet her fiance here and be 
married before &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's departure.  The 
bride's father and grandfather had been followers 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah during the time of his banishment.  
     We hesitate to alter the bridegroom's description 
of the service and therefore print it in his own simple 
and beautiful language.  It will serve to show a side 
not touched on elsewhere, and without which no 
idea of his visit is complete.  We refer to the attitude 
of reverence with which people from the East who 
came to see &amp;Abdu'l-Baha regard their great 
teacher.  They invariably rise and stand with bowed 
heads whenever he enters the room.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Dawud writes:--
     On Sunday morning, the 1st of October, 1911, 
A.D., equal to the 9th Tishi 5972 (Hebrew Era), 
Regina &amp;Nur &amp;Mahal &amp;Khanum, and &amp;Mirza 
Yuhanna &amp;Dawud were admitted into the holy 
presence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:  may my life be a 
sacrifice to Him!  
     After receiving us, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said, "You are 
very welcome and it makes me happy to see you 
here in London."  
 
+P78 
     Looking at me he said, "Never have I united 
anyone in marriage before, except my own 
daughters, but as I love you much, and you have 
rendered a great service to the Kingdom of &amp;Abha, 
both in this country and in other lands, I will 
perform your marriage ceremony today.  It is my 
hope that you may both continue in the blessed 
path of service."  
     Then, first, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha took &amp;Nur &amp;Mahal 
&amp;Khanum into the next room and said to her, "Do 
you love &amp;Mirza Yuhanna &amp;Dawud with all your 
heart and soul?"  She answered, "Yes, I do."  
     Then &amp;Abdu'l-Baha called me to him and put a 
similar question, that is to say, "Do you love &amp;Nur 
&amp;Mahal &amp;Khanum with all your heart and soul?"  I 
answered "Yes, I do."  We re-entered the room 
together and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha took the right hand of 
the bride and gave it into that of the bridegroom 
and asked us to say after him, "We do all to 
please God."  
     We all sat down and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha continued; 
"Marriage is a holy institution and much 
encouraged in this blessed cause.  Now you two 
are no longer two, but one.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's wish is 
that all men be of one mind and consider 
themselves of one great household, that the mind 
of mankind be not divided against itself.  
     "It is my wish and hope that you may be 
blessed in your life.  May God help you to render 
great service to the kingdom of &amp;Abha and may 
you become a means of its advancement.  
     "May joy be increased to you as the years go 
by, and may you become thriving trees bearing 
 
+P79 
delicious and fragrant fruits which are the 
blessings in the path of service."  
     When we came out, all the assembled friends 
both of Persia and London congratulated us on 
the great honour that had been bestowed upon us, 
and we were invited to dine by the kind hostess.  
     After a little while we gathered around the 
table with him.  During the meal one of the friends 
asked &amp;Abdu'l-Baha how he enjoyed his stay in 
London, and what he thought of the English 
people.  I acted as interpreter.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
replied:  "I have enjoyed London very much and 
the bright faces of the friends have delighted my 
heart.  I was drawn here by their unity and love.  
In the world of existence there is no more 
powerful magnet than the magnet of love.  These 
few days will pass away, but their import shall be 
remembered by God's friends in all ages and in all 
lands.  
     There are living nations and dead nations.  
Syria lost its civilization through lethargy of 
spirit.  The English nation is a living one, and 
when in this spiritual springtime the divine truth 
come forth with renewed vitality, the English will 
be like fruitful trees, and the Holy Spirit will 
enable them to flourish in abundance.  Then will 
they gain not only materially, but in that which is 
far more important, spiritual progress, which will 
enable them to render a greater service to the 
world of humanity."  
     Another asked why the teachings of all religions 
are expressed largely by parables and metaphors 
and not in the plain language of the people.  
 
+P80 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha replied:--"Divine things are too 
deep to be expressed by common words.  The 
heavenly teachings are expressed in parable in 
order to be understood and preserved for ages to 
come.  When the spiritually minded dive deeply 
into the ocean of their meaning they bring to the 
surface the pearls of their inner significance.  
There is no greater pleasure than to study God's 
Word with a spiritual mind."  
     "The object of God's teaching to man is that 
man may know himself in order to comprehend 
the greatness of God.  The Word of God is for 
agreement and concord.  If you go to Persia where 
the friends of &amp;Abha are many, you will at once 
realize the unifying force of God's work.  They are 
doing their utmost to strengthen this bond of 
amity.  There, people of different nationalities 
gather in one meeting and chant the divine tablets 
with one accord.  It might be supposed that they 
were all brethren.  We do not consider anyone a 
stranger, for it is said by &amp;Baha'u'llah `Ye are all 
the rays of one sun; the fruits of one tree; and the 
leaves of one branch.'  We desire the true 
brotherhood of humanity.  This shall be so, and it 
has already begun.  Praise to be God, the Helper, 
the Pardoner!"  
 
+P81 
               The visit to Bristol 
 
     &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA spent the week end of 
September 23rd to 25th, at the Clifton 
Guest House at Clifton, Bristol.  
     On the first afternoon, while driving, 
he expressed much interest in rural England, 
marvelling at the century-old trees, and the vivid 
green of the woods and downs, so unlike the arid 
East.  "Though it is autumn it seems like spring," 
he said.  The houses with their little plots of 
ground, suggested a quotation which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
gave from &amp;Baha'u'llah's writings in which 
the latter alludes to each family having a house 
with a piece of land.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha likened the 
country to the soul and the city to the body of 
man, saying, "The body without the soul cannot 
live.  It is good," he remarked, "to live under the 
sky, in the sunshine and fresh air."  Observing a 
young woman who rode by on horseback with her 
hair flying free and several who bicycled past on 
their bicycles unattended, he said, "This is the 
age of woman.  She should receive the same 
education as her brother and enjoy the same 
privilege; for all souls are equal before God.  Sex, 
in its relation to the exigencies of the physical 
plane, has no connection with the Spirit.  In this 
age of spiritual awakening, the world has entered 
upon the path of progress into the arena of 
development, where the power of the spirit 
surpasses that of the body.  Soon the spirit will 
have dominion over the world of humanity."  
 
+P82 
     In the evening greetings were cabled to the 
&amp;Baha'is of &amp;Tihran informing them of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
presence in Bristol.  He sent his love and 
wished them to know that he was well and happy 
with the Clifton friends.  This was sent in reply to 
a cablegram previously received from &amp;Tihran 
congratulating the people of the Guest House on 
his prospective visit.  
     Later on a general reception was held, ninety 
people coming to meet &amp;Abdu'l-Baha who spoke to 
them with impressive earnestness.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said, "You are very welcome.  I 
have come far to see you.  I praise God that after 
forty years of waiting I am permitted at last to 
come and bring my message.  This is an assembly 
full of spirituality.  Those who are present have 
turned their hearts towards God.  They are 
looking and longing for glad tidings.  We have 
gathered here by the power of the Spirit, therefore 
our hearts are stirred with thanksgiving.  `Send 
out Thy Light and Thy Truth O God:  Let them 
lead us to the Holy Mountains!'  May we be 
refreshed by the holy springs that are renewing 
the life of the world!  As day follows night, and 
after sunset comes the dawn, so Jesus Christ 
appeared on the horizon of this world like a Sun of 
Truth; even so when the people--after forgetting 
the teachings of Christ and His example of love to 
all humanity--had again grown tired of material 
things, a heavenly Star shone once more in Persia, 
a new illumination appeared and now a great 
light is spreading throughout all lands.  
     "Men keep their possessions for their own 
 
+P83 
enjoyment and do not share sufficiently with 
others the bounty received from God.  Spring is 
thus changed into the winter of selfishness and 
egotism.  Jesus Christ said `Ye must be born 
again' so that divine Life may spring anew within 
you.  Be kind to all around and serve one another; 
love to be just and true in all your dealings; pray 
always and so live your life that sorrow cannot 
touch you.  Look upon the people of your own race 
and those of other races as members of one 
organism; sons of the same Father; let it be known 
by your behaviour that you are indeed the people 
of God.  Then wars and disputes shall cease and 
over the world will spread the Most Great 
Peace."  
     After &amp;Abdu'l-Baha had retired Tamaddun'ul-Mulk 
and Mr. W. Tudor Pole gave short 
addresses in which references were made to the 
martyrdom of the faithful in Persia, special 
mention being made of the eminent poetess 
&amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn.  
     The next day was a bright Sunday and 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha went out with his friends driving 
and walking on the downs.  Afterwards he 
gathered the servants of the house together, spoke 
of the dignity of labour and thanked them for 
their service, giving to each some remembrance of 
his visit.  He went over the Guest house and 
blessed it as a centre for pilgrims from every part 
of the world, and said it would become indeed a 
House of Rest.  
     On the morning of the third day, a Canon of 
the Anglican Church met him at breakfast.  The 
 
+P84 
conversation turned on the reluctance of the rich 
to part with their possessions, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
quoting the saying of Jesus, "How hardly shall 
they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of 
Heaven."  He remarked that only when the true 
seeker finds that attachments to the material are 
keeping him from his spiritual heritage, will he 
gladly enter the way of renunciation.  Then will 
the rich man joyfully share his worldly possessions 
with the needy.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha contrasted the 
unpretentious hospitality before him with the 
costly banquets of the wealthy, who too often sit 
at their feasts forgetting the hungry multitudes.  
     He urged his hearers to spread the light in their 
own homes so that finally it would illuminate the 
whole community.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha then returned to London.  It was 
the earnest wish of those who had the privilege of 
meeting him that his followers in other lands 
should know how much the Clifton people 
appreciated his visit and realized his spiritual 
power and love.  
                               Thomas Pole.  
+P85 
                 At Byfleet.  
 
     ON the afternoon of September 9th, a 
number of working women of the 
Passmore Edwards' Settlement, who 
were spending their holidays with Miss 
Schepel and Miss Buckton at Vanners, in Byfleet, 
a village some twenty miles out of London, had 
the great privilege of meeting &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  They 
wrote a short record of his sayings to keep for 
themselves.  The following is an extract:--
     We gathered round him in a circle, and he 
made us sit beside him in the window seat.  One of 
the members, who was ill, had a specially 
beautiful greeting from him.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha began 
by saying, as he seated himself:  "Are you happy?" 
and our faces must have shown him that we 
were.  He then said:  "I love you all, you are the 
children of the Kingdom, and you are accepted of 
God.  Though you may be poor here, you are rich 
in the treasures of the Kingdom.  I am the Servant 
of the poor.  Remember how His Holiness Jesus 
said:  `Blessed are the poor!'  If all the queens of the 
earth were gathered here, I could not be more 
glad!"  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha knew that we had a treasury 
box from which we try to help people less 
fortunate than ourselves.  Presently he rose, and 
said:  "You are dear to me.  I want to do 
something for you!  I cannot cook for you (he had 
previously seen us busy in the kitchen) but here 
 
+P86 
is something for your fund."  He went round the 
circle to each, with a beautiful smile, shaking 
hands with all, and giving the &amp;Baha'i greeting:  
"&amp;Allah'u'Abha!"  
     Later on he walked in the village, and many 
poor children came to him, and mothers with sick 
babies and men out of work.  He spoke to them all, 
through an interpreter.  At tea-time other friends 
joined us.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha liked the cottage garden 
at Vanners, the little orchard and the roses.  He 
said:  "This is like a Persian garden.  The air is 
very pure."  
     On leaving for London he presented every one 
with a purple heartsease from the garden, and 
said again and again:  "Good-bye" in English.  
     On the 28th September, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha again 
visited Vanners, the little farm house on the old 
royal manor that dates back to the time of 
Edward II.  He motored down from London and 
stayed over night, returning on the evening of the 
second day.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was much struck during the drive 
by two detachments of Boy Scouts tramping the 
road.  When told of the Scouts' motto, "Be 
Prepared," and that an act of kindness each day is 
one of their laws and that some of these boys had 
put out a fire and assisted at a recent railway 
accident, he said.  "This makes me very happy."  
     Arriving at Vanners, he found a large, 
strangely mixed crowd, assembled about the gate 
to welcome him, from the quite poor to the 
wealthy who had motored over from their country 
places.  A great number followed him and as many 
 
+P87 
as could do so pressed into the garden and sat 
down around him.  The silence was most 
impressive.  The same attention and eagerness to 
hear was noticed among the people each time 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha appeared in the village.  
     After expressing his joy at being with them, he 
began to speak to the little group in answer to a 
question about the elaborate civilization of the 
West.  
 
              The Captivity of Man 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:--"Luxuries cut off the 
freedom of communication.  One who is imprisoned 
by desires is always unhappy; the children of 
the Kingdom have unchained themselves from 
their desires.  Break all fetters and seek for 
spiritual joy and enlightenment; then, though you 
walk on this earth, you will perceive yourselves to 
be within the divine horizon.  To man alone is this 
possible.  When we look about us we see every 
other creature captive to his environment.  
     "The bird is a captive in the air and the fish a 
captive in the sea.  Man alone stands apart and 
says to the elements, I will make you my servants!  
I can govern you!  He takes electricity, and 
through his ingenuity imprisons it and makes of it 
a wonderful power for lighting, and a means of 
communication to a distance of thousands of 
miles.  But man himself may become a captive to 
the things he has invented.  His true second birth 
occurs when he is freed from all material things:  
 
+P88 
for he only is free who is not a captive to his 
desires.  He has then as Jesus has said, become 
captive to the Holy Spirit."  
 
                The Power of God 
 
     A friend asked &amp;Abdu'l-Baha how far the 
individual could attain to that Christ consciousness 
in himself of which St. Paul speaks as our 
hope of Glory.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha turned with a look of great joy 
and said with an impressive gesture:  "The bounty 
and power of God is limitless for each human 
soul.  Consider what was the quickening power of 
the Christ when He was on earth.  Look at His 
disciples!  They were poor and uncultured men.  
Out of the rough fisherman He made the great 
Peter, and out of the poor village girl of Magdala 
He made one who is a power in all the world 
today.  Many queens have reigned who are 
remembered by their dates in history, and 
nothing more is known of them.  But Mary the 
Magdalene is greater than them all.  It was she 
whose love strengthened the disciples when their 
faith was failing.  What she did for the world 
cannot be measured.  See what a divine power was 
enkindled in her by the power of God!"  
 
              Inspired Messengers 
 
     When asked if it would be always necessary for 
prophets to come from time to time--"would not 
 
+P89 
the world in the course of events through progress 
reach to a full realization of God?"--&amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
replied:  "Mankind needs a universal motive 
power to quicken it.  The inspired messenger who 
is directly assisted by the power of God brings 
about universal results.  &amp;Baha'u'llah rose as a light 
in Persia and now that light is going out to the 
whole world."  
     "Is this what is meant by the Second Coming of 
Christ?"  "Christ is an Expression of the Divine 
Reality, the Single Essence and Heavenly Entity, 
which hath no beginning or ending.  It has 
appearance, arising, and manifestation and 
setting in each one of the Cycles."  
     Those who have been with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha notice 
how, often, after speaking earnestly with people, 
he will suddenly turn and walk away to be alone.  
At such times no one follows him.  On this 
occasion, when he finished speaking and went out 
through the orchard gate into the village, all were 
struck with his free and wonderful walk which has 
been described by one of our American friends as 
that of a shepherd or a king.  
     As he passed along the ragged children 
clustered about him by dozens, the boys saluting 
him as they had been taught in school, showing 
how instinctively they felt the greatness of his 
presence.  Most noticeable was the silence of even 
the roughest men when &amp;Abdu'l-Baha appeared.  
One poor tramp exclaimed "He is a good man," 
and added, "Ay, he's suffered!"  
     He took particular interest in the sick, crippled 
and poorly nourished children.  Mothers carrying 
 
+P90 
their little ones followed him, and a friend 
explained that this great visitor had come over 
the seas from the Holy Land where Jesus was 
born.  
     All day long people of every condition gathered 
about the gate for a chance of seeing him, and 
more than sixty drove or cycled to Vanners to see 
him, many wishing to question him on some 
special subject.  Among them were the clergy of 
several denominations, a head master of a boys' 
public school, a member of Parliament, a doctor, 
a famous political writer, the vice-chancellor of a 
University, several journalists, a well known poet, 
and a magistrate from London.  
     He will long be remembered as he sat in the 
bow window in the afternoon sunshine, his arm 
round a very ragged but very happy little boy, 
who had come to ask &amp;Abdu'l-Baha for sixpence 
for his money box and for his invalid mother, 
whilst round him in the room were gathered men 
and women discussing Education, Socialism, the 
first Reform Bill, and the relation of submarines 
and wireless telegraphy to the new era on which 
man is entering.  
     During the evening a young betrothed couple 
in the village, who had read some of the &amp;Baha'i 
books, begged permission to come to him.  They 
entered shyly, the man, led by the girl.  
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha rose to greet them, and made them 
take a place in the circle.  He talked earnestly to 
them upon the sacredness of marriage, the beauty 
of a real union, and the importance of the little 
child and its education.  Before they left he blessed 
 
+P91 
them, and touched their hair and foreheads with a 
Persian perfume.  
 
                   Education 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha laid great stress on Education.  
He said "The girl's education is of more 
importance today than the boy's, for she is the 
mother of the future race.  It is the duty of all to 
look after the children.  Those without children 
should, if possible, make themselves responsible 
for the education of a child."  
     The condition of the destitute in the country 
villages as well as in London impressed 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha greatly.  In an earnest talk with the 
Rector of a Parish, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  "I find 
England awake; there is spiritual life here.  But 
your poor are so very poor!  This should not be.  On 
the one hand you have wealth, and great luxury; 
on the other hand men and women are living in 
the extremities of hunger and want.  This great 
contrast of life is one of the blots on the 
civilization of this enlightened age.  
     "You must turn attention more earnestly to the 
betterment of the conditions of the poor.  Do not 
be satisfied until each one with whom you are 
concerned is to you as a member of your family.  
Regard each one either as a father, or as a 
brother, or as a sister, or as a mother, or as a 
child.  If you can attain to this, your difficulties 
will vanish, you will know what to do.  This is the 
teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
+P92 
                The Change of Heart 
 
     To one who spoke of the people's desire to 
possess the land, and of the strong under-current 
of rebellion on the part of the labouring classes, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha said: " Fighting, and the employment 
of force, even for the right cause, will not 
bring about good results.  The oppressed who 
have right on their side, must not take that right 
by force; the evil would continue.  Hearts must be 
changed.  The rich must wish to give!  Life in man 
should be like a flame, warming all with whom it 
comes into contact.  The spiritually awakened are 
like to bright torches in the sight of God, they give 
light and comfort to their fellows."  
     When asked if he did not find the manners of 
the English rude and awkward, compared with 
those of the East, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said he had not 
felt this.  As a nation increases in spirituality, the 
the manners become different.  
 
             Christ and &amp;Baha'u'llah 
 
     A friend asked how the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
contrasted with the teachings of Jesus Christ.  
"The teachings are the same." declared &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; 
"It is the same foundation and the same 
temple.  Truth is one, and without division.  The 
teachings of Jesus are in a concentrated form.  
Men do not agree to this day as to the meaning of 
many of His sayings.  His teachings are as a flower 
in the bud.  Today, the bud is unfolding into a 
 
+P93 
flower!  &amp;Baha'u'llah has expanded and fulfilled 
the teachings, and has applied them in detail to 
the whole world.  
     "There are no solitaries and no hermits among 
the &amp;Baha'is.  Man must work with his fellows.  
Everyone should have some trade, or art or 
profession, be he rich or poor, and with this he 
must serve humanity.  This service is acceptable 
as the highest form of worship."  
 
                      Art 
 
     A painter asked: "Is art a worthy vocation?"  
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha turning to her impressively, said:  
"Art is worship."  
     An actor mentioned the drama, and its 
influence.  "The drama is of the utmost importance." 
said &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  "It has been a great 
educational power in the past; it will be so again."  
He described how as a young boy he witnessed 
the Mystery Play of &amp;Ali's Betrayal and Passion, 
and how it affected him so deeply that he wept 
and could not sleep for many nights.  
 
                   Symbols 
 
     Someone wished to know if it were a good 
custom to wear a symbol, as, for instance, a cross.  
He said:  "You wear the cross for remembrance, it 
concentrates your thoughts; it has no magical 
power.  &amp;Baha'is often wear a stone with the 
 
+P94 
greatest name engraved on it:  there is no magical 
influence in the stone; it is a reminder, and 
companion.  If you are about to do some selfish or 
hasty action, and your glance falls on the ring on 
your hand, you will remember and change your 
intention."  
 
                  Esperanto 
 
     A friend enquired concerning &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
prophecy in the Words of Paradise, that a universal 
language would be formed, and desired to know if 
Esperanto would be the language chosen.  
     "The love and effort put into Esperanto will not 
be lost," he answered, "but no one person can 
construct a Universal Language.  It must be made 
by a Council representing all countries, and must 
contain words from different languages.  It will be 
governed by the simplest rules, and there will be 
no exceptions; neither will there be gender, nor 
extra and silent letters.  Everything indicated will 
have but one name.  In Arabic there are hundreds 
of names for the camel!  In the schools of each 
nation the mother tongue will be taught, as well 
as the revised Universal Language."  
 
                 Tolstoy 
 
     The same questioner said:  "I have read much 
of Tolstoy and I see a parallel between his 
teachings and yours.  In one of his books he speaks 
 
+P95 
of the Enigma of Life, and describes how life is 
wasted in our endeavour to find the Key.  But 
Tolstoy goes on to say:  `There is a man in Persia 
who holds the secret.'"  
     "Yes," said &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "I received a letter 
from Tolstoy, and in it he said that he wished to 
write a book upon &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
 
                  Healing 
 
     A friend interested in healing quoted the words 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah:  "If one is sick, let him go to the 
greatest physician."  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  "There is but one power 
which heals--that is God.  The state or condition 
through which the healing takes place is the 
confidence of the heart.  By some this state is 
reached through pills, powders, and physicians.  
By others through hygiene, fasting, and prayer.  
By others through direct perception."  
     On another occasion &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said with 
regard to the same subject, "All that we see 
around us is the work of mind.  It is mind in the 
herb and in the mineral that acts on the human 
body, and changes its condition."  The talk 
developed into a learned dissertation on the 
Philosophy of Aristotle.  
 
                   Death 
 
     A friend asked:  "How should one look forward 
to death?"  
 
+P96 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha answered:  "How does one look 
forward to the goal of any journey?  With hope 
and with expectation.  It is even so with the end of 
this earthly journey.  In the next world, man will 
find himself freed from many of the disabilities 
under which he now suffers.  Those who have 
passed on through death, have a sphere of their 
own.  It is not removed from ours; their work, the 
work of the Kingdom, is ours; but it is sanctified 
from what we call `time and place.'  Time with us 
is measured by the sun.  When there is no more 
sunrise, and no more sunset, that kind of time 
does not exist for man.  Those who have ascended 
have different attributes from those who are still 
on earth, yet there is no real separation.  
     "In prayer there is a mingling of station, a 
mingling of condition.  Pray for them as they pray 
for you!  When you do not know it, and are in a 
receptive attitude, they are able to make 
suggestions to you, if you are in difficulty.  This 
sometimes happens in sleep.  but there is no 
phenomenal intercourse!  That which seems like 
phenomenal intercourse has another explanation."  
The questioner exclaimed; "But I have 
heard a voice!"  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  "Yes, that is 
possible; we hear voices clearly in dreams.  It is 
not with the physical ear that you heard; the spirit 
of those that have passed on are freed from 
sense-life, and do not use physical means.  It is not 
possible to put these great matters into human 
words; the language of man is the language of 
children, and man's explanation often leads 
astray."  
 
+P97 
     Someone present asked how it was that in 
prayer and meditation the heart often turns with 
instinctive appeal to some friend who has passed 
into the next life.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha answered:  "It is a law of God's 
creation that the weak should lean upon the 
strong.  Those to whom you turn may be the 
mediators of God's power to you, even as when on 
earth.  But it is the One Holy Spirit that 
strengthens all men."  Hereupon another friend 
referred to the communing of Jesus on the Mount 
of Transfiguration with Moses and Elijah; and 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha said:  "The faithful are ever 
sustained by the presence of the Supreme 
Concourse.  In the Supreme Concourse are Jesus, 
and Moses, and Elijah, and &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
other supreme Souls:  there, also, are the 
martyrs."  
     When asked about the individual persistence of 
the animal's personality after death, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
said:  "Even the most developed dog has not the 
immortal soul of the man; yet the dog is perfect in 
its own place.  You do not quarrel with a rose-tree 
because it cannot sing!"  
 
                A True &amp;Baha'i 
 
     A student of the modern methods of the higher 
criticism asked &amp;Abdu'l-Baha if he would do well 
to continue in the church with which he had been 
associated all his life, and whose language was full 
of meaning to him.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha answered:  "You 
must not dissociate yourself from it.  Know this; 
 
+P98 
the Kingdom of God is not in any Society; some 
seekers go through many Societies as a traveller 
goes through many cities till he reach his 
destination.  If you belong to a Society already do 
not forsake your brothers.  You can be a 
&amp;Baha'i-Christian, a &amp;Baha'i-Freemason, a &amp;Baha'i-Jew, 
a &amp;Baha'i-Muhammadan.  The number nine 
contains eight, and seven, and all the other 
numbers, and does not deny any of them.  Do not 
distress or deny anyone by saying `He is not a 
&amp;Baha'i!'  He will be known by his deeds.  There are 
no secrets among &amp;Baha'is; a &amp;Baha'i does not hide 
anything."  
 
               Spreading the Teaching 
 
     When asked by an American friend:  "Which is 
the best way to spread the teaching?" he said:  
"By deeds.  This way is open to all, and deeds are 
understood by all.  Join yourselves to those who 
work for the poor, the weak and the unfortunate; 
this is greatly to be commended.  To teach by 
words requires the skill of a wise physician.  He 
does not offer help to those who do not want 
treatment.  Do not press help on those who do not 
need your help.  The work of teaching is not for 
all."  
     The following incident shows how &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
attention is given to the smallest details 
where others are involved.  On hearing that some 
of his friends had come down from London, and 
had planned to stop the night in the village so as 
 
+P99 
to be near him &amp;Abdu'l-Baha immediately made 
them his guests at the Inn, and being concerned 
for their comfort, went over personally to inspect 
the rooms, as the nights were getting cold.  
 
               At Brooklands 
 
     The morning of the second day, a neighbour 
sent over her car asking if &amp;Abdu'l-Baha would not 
like to take his guests to the Brooklands aviation 
ground.  Though it was windy, an aviator was on 
the track, when he heard who the visitor was 
offered to fly for him.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha left his friends 
and walked out into the middle of the course, 
where he stood alone watching the biplane 
making wide circles above him.  
     A Hindu who was learning to fly at the school 
joined &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's friends and asked:  "Who is 
the man in Eastern dress?"  
     When told, he exclaimed, "Oh I know him very 
well through his teachings, which I have 
studied," and immediately he went to meet 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     They talked together for some time in Arabic, 
the young man showing great joy at being in his 
presence.  He afterwards said that for many years 
he had longed for this moment.  
     While having tea out of doors, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and the young Hindu, sitting at the head of the 
long benches that has been arranged, talked 
merrily to everyone.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha noticed two of the airmen who 
 
+P100 
were wrestling on the grounds, and when they 
stopped, he went to them clapping his hands and 
crying in English, "Bravo!  Bravo! that is good 
exercise."  
     Since his return to Egypt, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has 
sent a kind message of remembrance to the people 
of Byfleet, saying that he will never forget them.  
 
+P101 
               Days in London 
 
     DURING &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's stay in 
Cadogan Gardens people arrived all 
day and every day, from early morning 
to nightfall, hoping for the privilege of 
seeing him and of hearing him talk.  Many were 
the gatherings round the board of that hospitable 
house and hundreds of people were made 
welcome.  Many came without introduction and 
no one was refused.  Among them were clergy of 
various denominations, members of Parliament, 
magistrates, and literary men.  
     The visitors were not only English; numerous 
Persians had journeyed from &amp;Tihran and other 
Eastern cities to meet freely one who had so long 
been withheld from them by his captivity.  
     The editor of a journal printed in Japan, 
altered his return route to Tokyo in order that he 
might spend the night near &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and a 
late visit was paid by a Zoroastrian physician of 
Bombay, on the eve of his return to India.  
 
              Woman's Work 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's interest in women's work and 
progress is well known, and among the notable 
leaders who came to see him, may be mentioned 
Mrs. Annie Besant, President of the Theosophical 
Society, the organizers of various suffrage bodies, 
 
+P102 
civic and philanthropic workers, the principals of 
several woman's colleges and lady doctors.  
     A spirited conversation due to the visit of an 
ardent suffragist will be long remembered by 
those who had the privilege of being present.  The 
room was full of men and women, many Persians 
being seated in their familiar respectful attitude 
on the floor.  
     After contrasting the general position of the 
Eastern and the Western women, and then 
describing how in many respects the Eastern 
woman has the advantage of her Western sister, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha turned and said to the visitor:  "Give 
me your reasons for believing that woman today 
should have the vote?"  
     Answer:  "I believe that humanity is a divine 
humanity and that it must rise higher and higher; 
but it cannot soar with only one wing."  
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha expressed his pleasure at this 
answer, and smiling, replied:  "But what will you 
do if one wing is stronger than the other?"  Answer:  
"Then we must strengthen the weaker wing, 
otherwise the flight will always be hampered."  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha smiled and asked:  "What will 
you say if I prove to you that the woman is the 
stronger wing?"  
     The answer came in the same bright vein:  
"You will earn my eternal gratitude!" at which all 
the company made merry.  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha then continued more seriously:  
"The woman is indeed of the greater importance 
to the race.  She has the greater burden and the 
greater work.  Look at the vegetable and the 
 
+P103 
animal worlds.  The palm which carries the fruit is 
the tree most prized by the date grower.  The Arab 
knows that for a long journey the mare has the 
longest wind.  For her greater strength and 
fierceness, the lioness is more feared by the hunter 
than the lion.  
     "The mere size of the brain has been proved to 
be no measure of superiority.  The woman has 
greater moral courage than the man; she has also 
special gifts which enable her to govern in 
moments of danger and crisis.  If necessary she 
can become a warrior."  
 
                  Zenobia 
 
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha asked the company if they remembered 
the story of Zenobia and of the fall of 
Palmyra.  He then continued as follows, using his 
hands in the grave and simple gesticulations 
characteristic of him:  
     "There was once a Governor in Ancient Syria, 
who had a beautiful and clever wife.  She was so 
capable that when the Governor died, she was 
made ruler in his stead.  The land prospered 
under her sway, and men acknowledged that she 
was a better ruler than her husband.  After a time 
the legions of Rome invaded the country, but 
again and again she drove them out with great 
confusion.  She let down her beautiful hair, and 
herself rode at the head of her army, clad in a 
scarlet cloak, wearing a crown of gold, and 
wielding a two-edged sword in her hand.  The 
 
+P104 
Roman Caesar then withdrew his strength from 
five other provinces in order to subdue her.  After 
a long and brave fight Zenobia retired into the 
city of Palmyra, which she strengthened with 
wonderful fortifications, and there she endured a 
siege of four months, Caesar being unable to 
dislodge her.  The food she had stored within the 
walls at last was gone, and the misery of her 
starving and plague-stricken people compelled 
her to surrender.  
     "Caesar was full of admiration for this great 
woman, because of her courage and endurance, 
and he asked her to become his wife.  But she 
refused, saying that she would never consent to 
take as her husband the enemy of her people.  
Thereupon, Caesar was enraged, and determined 
to humble her.  He took her back with him in his 
ships to Rome.  For his triumphal entry a great 
procession was prepared, and the streets were 
filled with people.  In the procession came first 
elephants, after the elephants came the camels, 
after the camels came the tigers and the leopards, 
after the leopards came the monkeys, and lastly, 
after the monkeys, walked Zenobia with a gold 
chain round her neck.  Still she carried her head 
high, and was firm in her determination.  Nothing 
could break her spirit!  She refused to become the 
Empress of Caesar, so she was thrown into a 
dungeon, and eventually she died."  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha ceased.  Silence fell upon the 
room, and it was some time before it was broken.  
     Upon another occasion &amp;Abdu'l-Baha said to a 
group of friends around him:  "Taken in general, 
 
+P105 
women today have a stronger sense of religion 
than men.  The woman's intuition is more correct; 
she is more receptive and her intelligence is 
quicker.  The day is coming when woman will 
claim her superiority to man.  
     "Woman has everywhere been commended for 
her faithfulness.  After the Lord Christ suffered, 
the disciples wept, and gave way to their grief.  
They thought that their hopes were shattered, 
and that the Cause was utterly lost, till Mary 
Magdalene came to them and strengthened them 
saying:  `Do you mourn the body of Our Lord or 
His Spirit?  If you mourn His Spirit, you are 
mistaken, for Jesus lives!  His Spirit will never 
leave us!' Thus through her wisdom and 
encouragement the Cause of Christ was upheld 
for all the days to come.  Her intuition enabled her 
to grasp the spiritual fact."  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha then added:  "But in the sight of 
God sex makes no difference.  He or she is greatest 
who is nearest to God."  
     One morning &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, on entering the 
room looked about and said:  "It is just like a 
miracle, our being here together.  There is no 
racial, political or patriotic tie.  We are drawn 
together by the words of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and in like 
manner will all the races of the earth be drawn 
together.  Of this, rest assured!"  
 
                The True &amp;Baha'i 
 
     "I have never heard of &amp;Baha'u'llah," said a 
young man.  I have only recently read about this 
 
+P106 
movement, but I recognize the mission of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha and desire to be a disciple.  I have 
always believed in the brotherhood of man as the 
ultimate solvent of all our national and international 
difficulties."  
     "It makes no difference whether you have ever 
heard of &amp;Baha'u'llah or not," was the answer, 
"the man who lives the life according to the 
teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is already a &amp;Baha'i.  On 
the other hand a man may call himself a &amp;Baha'i 
for fifty years and if he does not live the life he is 
not a &amp;Baha'i.  An ugly man may call himself 
handsome, but he deceives no one, and a black 
man may call himself white yet he deceives no 
one:  not even himself!"  
 
               The Coming of Peace 
 
     "By what process" continued the questioner, 
"will this peace on earth be established?  Will it 
come at once after a universal declaration of the 
Truth?"  
     "No, it will come about gradually," said 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  "A plant that grows too quickly 
lasts but a short time.  You are my family" and he 
looked about with a smile, "my new children! if a 
family lives in unison, great results are obtained.  
Widen the circle; when a city lives in intimate 
accord greater results will follow, and a continent 
that is fully united will likewise unite all other 
continents.  Then will be the time of the greatest 
results, for all the inhabitants of the earth belong 
to one native land."  
 
+P107 
              The Pure Heart 
 
     When asked for a definition of a pure heart, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha said, "The pure heart is one that is 
entirely cut away from self.  To be selfless is to be 
pure."  
 
             True Spirituality 
 
     Another morning &amp;Abdu'l-Baha began at once 
to speak as he joined the group of seekers.  He 
said:  "Praise be to God, this century is a glorious 
century; may love increase every day; may it 
strike fire to light the candle in the darkness, like a 
gift and mercy of God.  
     "Know, O thou possessors of insight, that true 
spirituality is like unto a lake of clear water which 
reflects the divine.  Of such was the spirituality of 
Jesus Christ.  There is another kind which is like a 
mirage, seeming to be spiritual when it is not.  
That which is truly spiritual must light the path 
to God, and must result in deeds.  We cannot 
believe the call to be spiritual when there is no 
result.  Spirit is reality, and when the spirit in each 
of us seeks to join itself with the Great Reality, it 
must in turn give life.  The Jews in the time of 
Christ were dead, having no real life, and Jesus 
actually wafted a new breath into their bodies.  
Behold what has been accomplished since!"  
 
          Knowledge must result in Action 
 
     A representative from a well known society 
made reference to its meetings for the purpose of a 
 
+P108 
search into the reality of truth, and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
said "I know of your work.  I think a great deal of 
it.  I know your desire is to serve mankind, and to 
draw together Humanity under the banner of 
Oneness; but its members must beware less it 
become only a discussion.  Look about you.  How 
many committees have been formed, and living 
for a little while, have died!  Committees and 
Societies can not create or give life.  
     "People get together and talk, but it is God's 
Word alone that is powerful in its results.  
Consider for a moment:  you would not trade 
together if you had no income from it and derived 
no benefit!  Look at the followers of Christ.  Their 
power was due to their ardour and their deeds.  
Every effort must have its result, else it is not a 
true effort.  You must become the means of 
lighting the world of humanity.  This is the 
infallible proof and sign.  Every progress depends 
on two things, knowledge and practice.  First 
acquire knowledge, and, when conviction is 
reached, put it into practice.  
     "Once a learned man journeyed to see me to 
receive my blessing, saying he knew and 
comprehended the &amp;Baha'i teachings.  When I told 
him that he could receive the blessings of the Holy 
Spirit at any time when he put himself in a 
receptive attitude to accept them, he said he was 
always in a receptive attitude.  
     "`What would you do,' I asked `if I were to 
suddenly turn and strike you?'  He instantly flared 
with indignation and strode angrily about the 
room.  
 
+P109 
     "After a little I went over and took his arm, 
saying, `But you must return good for evil.  
Whether I honoured you or despised you, you 
should follow the teachings; now you merely read 
them.  Remember the words of Jesus who said, 
`The first shall be last, and the last first.'  The man 
turned, shook my hand and departed, and I have 
since heard of many kind acts he has done."  
     When &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was addressed by the 
name of prophet, he answered, "My name is 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the Servant of God" [literally, the 
Slave of Glory.]+F1  
 
              Visit to the Lord Mayor 
 
     At the express wish of the Lord Mayor, 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha paid him a visit early one morning 
at the Mansion House.  The talk turned chiefly 
upon the social conditions of great cities, and 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha said that London was the best 
regulated city he had seen.  
     He said:  "Every man walking in the street is 
free as if he were in his own kingdom.  There is a 
 
+F1 Compare:--"My Name is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  My Reality is 
+F1 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha:  and Service to all the human race is my perpetual 
+F1 Religion....  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is the Banner of the Most Great Peace 
+F1 ...The Herald of the Kingdom is he, so that he may awaken the 
+F1 people of the East and the West.  The Voice of Friendship, of 
+F1 Truth, and of Reconciliation is he, quickening all regions.  No 
+F1 name, no title will he ever have, except &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  This is my 
+F1 longing.  This is my Supreme height.  O ye friends of God!  
+F1 &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is the manifestation of Service, and not Christ.  The 
+F1 Servant of humanity is he, and not a chief.  Summon ye the people 
+F1 to the station of Service of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and not his Christhood."  
+F1 (From a letter sent to the friends in New York, January 1st, 1907.)  
 
+P110 
great spiritual light in London.  The effort made 
for justice is real and in this country the law is the 
same for the poor as for the rich."  He took great 
interest in hearing of the care that is taken of 
prisoners as they leave jail, and spoke of the land 
being happy where the magistrates are as fathers 
to the people.  
     Before &amp;Abdu'l-Baha left London, he went to an 
East-end hospital to visit there a young writer 
lying seriously ill, who was very anxious to see 
him.  
 
            Some Personal Characteristics 
 
     There is a note in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's character that 
has not been emphasized, and with which no idea 
of him is complete.  The impressive dignity which 
distinguishes his presence and bearing is occasionally 
lighted by a delicate and tactful humour, 
which is as unaffected as it is infectious and 
delightful.  
     On his last afternoon in London, a reporter 
called to ask him of his future plans, finding him 
surrounded by a number of friends who had 
called to bid him good-bye.  When, in answer to 
this query, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha told in perfect English of 
his intention to visit Paris and go from there to 
Alexandria, the press representative evinced 
surprise at his faultless pronunciation.  Thereupon 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha proceeded to march with a free 
stride up and down the flower-scented drawing 
room, his Oriental garb contrasting strangely 
 
+P111 
with his modern surroundings; and, to the 
amusement of the assembly, uttered a string of 
elaborate English words, laughingly ending, 
"Very difficult English words I speak!"  Then, a 
moment later, with the swift transition of one who 
knows both how to be grave and gay, he showed 
himself terribly in earnest.  
     He had left orders that none were to be turned 
away, but one who had twice vainly sought his 
presence, and was, through some oversight, 
prevented from seeing him, wrote a heartbreaking 
letter showing that he thought himself 
rebuffed.  It was translated by the Persian 
interpreter.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at once put on his coat, 
and, turning towards the door, said, with an 
expression of unspeakable sadness, "A friend of 
mine has been martyred, and I am very grieved.  I 
go out alone." and he swept down the steps.  One 
could then see how well the title of "Master"  
became him.  
     Another phase of his character which none who 
saw him could ever forget was his attitude 
towards children who were brought to him.  Many 
of his talks were given as he sat with his arm 
encircling one of them.  
     He invariably admonished the parents thus:  
"Give this child a good education; make every 
effort that it may have the best you can afford, so 
that it may be enabled to enjoy the advantage of 
this glorious age.  Do all you can to encourage 
spirituality in them."  
     One who sought the presence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
realized the father-like sympathy which is his.  
 
+P112 
Speaking of his and others' love for &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
the reply was:  "I know that you love me, I can see 
that it is so.  I will pray for you that you may be 
firm and serve in the Cause, becoming a true 
servant to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Though I go away I will 
always be present with you all."  These words 
were spoken with the greatest loving sympathy 
and understanding of difficulties; during the 
moments of this little talk &amp;Abdu'l-Baha held and 
stroked the speaker's hands, and at the end took 
his head and with a gentle touch drew it to him 
kissing the forehead of the young man, who felt 
that he had found a father and a friend.  
 
+P113 
              The Farewell 
 
     ON the last morning of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
stay in London many friends gathered 
both at Cadogan Gardens and at the 
station to bid him farewell.  An 
impressive and interesting ceremony was performed 
at the house by a Zoroastrian (a 
physician), who sent an elaborate telegram to 
some &amp;Parsis in Bombay, saying:  "The Torch of 
Truth has been lighted again in the East and the 
West by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha."  Instructed by his 
brethren, this follower of one of the most ancient 
religions in the world had brought with him a 
sacred oil of a rare perfume, with which he 
anointed the head and breast of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
afterwards touching the hands of all present.  He 
then placed around &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's neck and 
shoulders an exquisite garland of rose-buds and 
lilies.  
     The last glimpse which the friends had at 
Victoria Station was that of the venerable face 
and form standing at the window, gazing out with 
a look of benevolence and wonderful tenderness 
on those he was leaving.  
 
+P114 
     From an Interview given by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
             to the Weekly Budget.  
             September 23rd, 1911.  
 
        SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES OF HIS 
           FORTY YEARS IMPRISONMENT 
 
     IN an apartment in Cadogan Gardens sits 
a spiritually illumined Oriental, whose 
recent advent in London marks the 
latest junction of the East and West.  
     The teaching of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has already 
brought about the commingling of thousands of 
Englishmen and Englishwomen with Orientals 
from every quarter of the East.  Upon the basis of 
mutual help and friendship and the worship of 
God, regardless of creed and denomination, they 
have joined hands with an earnestness and 
brotherly love contrary to the theories of certain 
cynical poets and philosophers.  
     Most of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's life has been spent in an 
Eastern prison, which he gladly endured rather 
than abjure his faith, one of the tenets of which is 
the absolute equality of souls regardless of 
physical differences, such as sex and colour.  He 
recognizes no class distinctions except those 
conferred by service and the spirit of brotherly 
love.  For this and other like doctrines he was held 
prisoner for forty years in the fortress city of &amp;Akka, 
in Palestine.  When I requested to talk with him, I 
was told to come early, and called, according, at 
nine o'clock, for an interview.  It was already 
 
+P115 
mid-day to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha who rises at four, and 
who had seen eighteen people before his breakfast 
at half-past six.  
     Representatives of many languages and 
nationalities awaited him in the drawing room.  
     We sat in a circle facing &amp;Abdu'l-Baha who 
inquired if there were any questions we would like 
to ask.  I said my editor had sent me to ascertain 
something of his prison life, and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha at 
once related in a simple impersonal way one of 
the most remarkable stories conceivable.  
     "At nine years of age, I accompanied my 
father, &amp;Baha'u'llah, in his journey of exile to 
&amp;Baghdad, seventy of his disciples going with us.  
This decree of exile, after persistent persecution, 
was intended to effectively stamp out of Persia 
what the authorities considered a dangerous 
religion.  &amp;Baha'u'llah, with his family and 
followers, was banished, and travelled from one 
place to another.  When I was about twenty-five 
years old, we were moved from Constantinople to 
Adrianople, and from there went with a guard of 
soldiers to the fortressed city of &amp;Akka, where we 
were imprisoned and closely guarded."  
 
               The First Summer 
 
     "We had no communication whatever with the 
out-side world.  Each loaf of bread was cut open 
by the guard to see that it contained no message.  
All who believed in the &amp;Baha'i manifestation, 
children, men and women, were imprisoned with 
us.  There were one-hundred and fifty of us 
 
+P116 
together in two rooms and no one was allowed to 
leave the place with the exceptions of four persons, 
who went to the bazaar to market each morning, 
under guard.  The first summer was dreadful.  
&amp;Akka is a fever-ridden town.  It was said that a 
bird attempting to fly over it would drop dead.  
The food was poor and insufficient, the water was 
drawn from a fever-infected well and the climate 
and conditions were such, that even the natives of 
the town fell ill.  Many soldiers succumbed and 
eight out of ten of our guard died.  During the 
intense heat, malaria, typhoid and dysentery 
attacked the prisoners, so that all, men, women 
and children, were sick at one time.  There were 
no doctors, no medicines, no proper food, and no 
treatment of any kind.  
     "I used to make broth for the people, and as I 
had much practice, I make good broth," said 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha laughingly.  
     At this point one of the Persians explained to 
me that it was on account of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
wonderful patience, helpfulness, and endurance 
that he was always called "The Master."  One 
could easily feel his mastership in his complete 
severance from time and place, and absolute 
detachment from all that even a Turkish prison 
could inflict.  
 
             Better Conditions 
 
     "After two years of the strictest confinement 
permission was granted me to find a house so that 
we could live outside the prison walls but still 
 
+P117 
within the fortifications.  Many believers came 
from Persia to join us but they were not allowed to 
do so.  Nine years passed.  Sometimes we were 
better off and sometimes very much worse.  It 
depended on the governor, who, if he happened to 
be a kind and lenient ruler, would grant us 
permission to leave the fortification, and would 
allow the believers free access to visit the house; 
but when the governor was more rigorous, extra 
guards were placed around us, and often pilgrims 
who had come from afar were turned away."  
     I learned, afterwards, from a Persian, who, 
during these troublous times, was a member of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's household, that the Turkish 
government could not credit the fact that the 
interest of the English and American visitors was 
purely spiritual and not political.  Often these 
pilgrims were refused permission to see him, and, 
many times, the whole trip from America would 
be rewarded merely by a glimpse of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
from his prison window.  
     The Government thought that the tomb of the 
&amp;Bab, an imposing building on Mount Carmel, 
was a fortification erected with the aid of 
American money, and that it was being armed 
and garrisoned secretly.  Suspicion grew with each 
new arrival, resulting in extra spies and guards.  
 
             &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid's Committee 
 
     "One year before &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid was 
dethroned, he sent an extremely overbearing, 
treacherous and insulting committee of investigation.  
 
+P118 
The chairman was one of the governor's 
staff, &amp;Arif Bey, and with him were three army 
commanders varying in rank.  
     "Immediately upon his arrival, &amp;Arif Bey 
proceeded to denounce me and tried to get proof 
strong enough to warrant sending me to &amp;Fizan, or 
throwing me into the sea.  &amp;Fizan is a caravan 
station on the boundary of Tripoli where there are 
no houses and no water.  It is a month's journey 
by camel route from &amp;Akka.  
     "The committee twice sent for me to hear what 
I had to say in my own defence and twice I sent 
back word:  `I know your purpose, I have nothing 
to say.'  
     "This so infuriated &amp;Arif Bey that he declared 
he would return to Constantinople and bring 
back an order from the &amp;Sultan to have me hanged 
at the gate of &amp;Akka.  He and his committee set sail 
with their report containing the following 
accusations:--&amp;Abdu'l-Baha is establishing a new 
nation of which he is to be the king; &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
is uplifting the banner of a new religion;

fortifications in Haifa, a neighbouring village, and 
is buying up all the surrounding lands.'  
     "About this time an Italian ship appeared in 
the harbour sent by order of the Italian Consul.  It 
had been planned that I was to escape on it by 
night.  The &amp;Baha'is in &amp;Akka implored me to go but 
I sent this message to the captain:  `The &amp;Bab did 
not run away: &amp;Baha'u'llah did not run away; I 
shall not run away, so the ship sailed away after 
waiting three days and three nights.

     "It was while the &amp;Sultan's committee of 
investigation was homeward bound that the first 
shell was dropped into &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid's camp 
and the first gun of freedom was fired into the 
home of despotism.  That was God's gun," said 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, with one of his wonderful smiles.  
     "When the committee reached the Turkish 
capital, they had more urgent things to think of.  
The city was in a state of uproar and rebellion, 
and the committee, as members of the government 
staff, were delegated to investigate the 
insurrection.  Meanwhile the people were establishing 
a constitutional government and &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid 
was given no chance to act."  
 
                The Release 
 
     "With the advent of the Young Turks' 
supremacy, realized through the Society of Union 
and Progress, all the political prisoners of the 
Ottoman Empire were set free.  Events took the 
chains from my neck and placed them about 
&amp;Hamid's; &amp;Abdu'l-Baha came out of prison and 
&amp;Abdu'l-Hamid went in!"  
     "What became of the committee?"  asked 
someone, breaking the deep silence that followed 
the recital of this thrilling page of history.  "&amp;Arif 
Bey," continued &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "was shot with 
three bullets, the general was exiled, the next in 
rank died, and the third ran away to Cairo, where 
he sought and received help from the &amp;Baha'is."  
     "Will you tell us how you felt while in prison 
 
+P120 
and how you regard your freedom?" I asked.  "We 
are glad that you are free."  
     "Thank you," he said graciously, and continuing--
     "Freedom is not a matter of place.  It is a 
condition.  I was thankful for the prison, and the 
lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those 
days were passed in the path of service, under the 
utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and 
results.  
     "Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will 
not attain.  To me prison is freedom, troubles rest 
me, death is life, and to be despised is honour.  
Therefore, I was happy all that time in prison.  
When one is released from the prison of self, that 
is indeed release, for that is the greater prison.  
When this release takes place, then one cannot be 
outwardly imprisoned.  When they put my feet in 
stocks, I would say to the guard, `You cannot 
imprison me, for here I have light and air and 
bread and water.  There will come a time when 
my body will be in the ground, and I shall have 
neither light nor air nor food nor water, but even 
then I shall not be imprisoned.'  The afflictions 
which come to humanity sometimes tend to 
centre the consciousness upon the limitations, 
and this is a veritable prison.  Release comes by 
making of the will a Door through which the 
confirmations of the Spirit come."  
     This sounded so like the old theology that the 
modern in me rose doubting if the discipline could 
be compensated for by the effort.  "What do you 
mean by the confirmations of the Spirit?"  
 
+P121 
     "The confirmations of the Spirit are all those 
powers and gifts which some are born with (and 
which men sometimes call genius), but for which 
others have to strive with infinite pains.  They 
come to that man or woman who accepts his life 
with radiant acquiescence."  
     Radiant acquiescence--that was the quality 
with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha bade us good-bye.  
     It was a remarkable experience, hearing one 
who had passed along the prison path for forty 
years declare "There is no prison but the prison 
self;" and it drove conviction to one's mind as this 
white-robed messenger from the East pointed the 
way out,--not by the path called "Renunciation," 
but "Unattachment;" Radiant Acquiescence--
the Shining Pathway out of the "greater prison of 
self" as &amp;Abdu'l-Baha so beautifully terms those 
bars that keep us from our fulfillment.

          A Loving Farewell Greeting.  
 
     After leaving London and during his 
two months stay in Paris, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
frequently sent back messages to his 
English friends, some of whom journeyed 
over to take advantage of the conferences 
there.  On the eve of his departure for Alexandria, 
he gave the following admonitory farewell to the 
people of England and France.  
     "Work," he said unceasingly, "for the day of 
Universal Peace.  Strive always that you may be 
united.  Kindness and love in the path of service 
must be your means.  
     "I bid a loving farewell to the people of France 
and England.  I am very much pleased with them.  
I counsel them that they may day by day 
strengthen the bond of love and amity to this 
end,--that they may become the sympathetic 
embodiment of one nation.--That they may 
extend themselves to a Universal Brotherhood to 
guard and protect the interests and rights of all 
the nations of the East,--that they may unfurl the 
Divine Banner of justice,--that they may treat 
each nation as a family composed of the 
individual children of God and may know that 
before the sight of God the rights of all are equal.  
For all of us are the children of one Father.  God is 
at peace with all his children; why should they 
engage in strife and warfare among themselves?  
God is showering down kindness; why should the 
 
+P123 
inhabitants of this world exchange unkindness 
and cruelty?"  
     "I will pray for you that you may be illumined 
with the Light of the Eternal."  
 
+P124 
          Greetings by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha from Paris to 
                  London.  October 1911.  
 
Spoken to Mrs. Enthoven for conveyance to all the friends, 
                and now written from memory.  
 
     &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA sent his greetings to all, 
begging all to go on acquiring strength in 
their belief and courage in its proclamation.  
     He spoke much of the pleasure he had felt in 
the atmosphere of England.  He said there was a 
strength of purpose in the English people and a 
firmness which he liked and admired, There was 
honesty and uprightness.  They were slow in 
starting a new idea, but, when they did, it was 
only because their minds and common-sense had 
told them that the idea was sound.  
     The English as a nation had pleased him 
greatly.  
     Believers, he added, must show their belief in 
their daily lives, so that the world might see the 
light shining in their faces.  A bright and happy 
face cheers people on their way.  If you are sad, 
and pass a child who is laughing, the child, seeing 
your sad face, will cease to laugh, not knowing 
why.  If the day be dark, how much a gleam of 
sunshine is prized; so let believers wear smiling 
happy faces, gleaming like sunshine in the 
darkness.  Let the Light of Truth and Honesty 
shine from them, so that all who behold them may 
 
+P125 
know that their word in business or pleasure will 
be a word to trust and depend upon.  
     Forget self and work for the whole race.  
Remember always that one is working for the 
world, not for a town or even for a country; 
because, as all are brethren, so every country is, 
as it were, one's own.  
     Remember, above all, the teaching of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
concerning gossip and unseemly talk 
about others.  Stories repeated about others are 
seldom good.  A silent tongue is the safest.  Even 
good may be harmful, if spoken at the wrong 
time, or to the wrong person.  
     Finally &amp;Abdu'l-Baha sent his greetings and 
blessings to all, and assured me he was constantly 
thinking and praying for all.  
     To a gentleman who was questioning him, he 
remarked "The beginnings of all great religions 
were pure; but priests, taking possession of the 
minds of the people, filled them with dogmas and 
superstitions, so that religion became gradually 
corrupt.  I come to teach no new religion.  `My 
only desire is, through the blessing of God, to 
show the road to the Great Light."  Touching the 
gentleman gently on his shoulder, as a loving 
father might touch a son, he went on to say, "I am 
no Prophet, only a man like yourself."
