              Revealed on March 26, 1916,
         in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's room at the house
     in &amp;Bahji, addressed to the &amp;Baha'is of nine
      Northeastern States of the United States:
         Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
         Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont,
               Pennsylvania, New Jersey
                     and New York.

     O ye heavenly heralds:
 
                                                                         +N2
     THESE are the days of &amp;Naw-Ruz.  I am always thinking
of those kind friends!  I beg for each and all of
you confirmations and assistance from the threshold of
oneness, so that those gatherings may become ignited
like unto candles, in the republics of America, enkindling
the light of the love of God in the hearts; thus the
rays of the heavenly teachings may begem and brighten
the states of America like the infinitude of immensity
with the stars of the Most Great Guidance.
                                                                         +N3
     The Northeastern States on the shores of the Atlantic
--Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and New York--in some of these states believers are
found, but in some of the cities of these states up to this
date people are not yet illumined with the lights of the
Kingdom and are not aware of the heavenly teachings;
therefore, whenever it is possible for each one of you,
hasten ye to those cities and shine forth like unto the
stars with the light of the Most Great Guidance.  God
says in the glorious &amp;Qur'an:  "The soil was black and
 
+P6{~
dried.  Then we caused the rain to descend upon it and
immediately it became green, verdant, and every kind
of plant sprouted up luxuriantly."+F1  In other words, He
says the earth is black, but when the spring showers descend
upon it that black soil is quickened, and variegated
flowers are pushed forth.  This means the souls of humanity
belonging to the world of nature are black like
unto the soil.  But when the heavenly outpourings descend
and the radiant effulgences appear, the hearts are
resuscitated, are liberated from the darkness of nature
and the flowers of divine mysteries grow and become
luxuriant.  Consequently man must become the cause of
the illumination of the world of humanity and propagate
the holy teachings revealed in the sacred books
through the divine inspiration.  It is stated in the blessed
Gospel:  Travel ye toward the East and toward the West
and enlighten the people with the light of the Most
Great Guidance, so that they may take a portion and
share of eternal life.+F2  Praise be to God, that the Northeastern
States are in the utmost capacity.  Because the
ground is rich, the rain of the divine outpouring is descending.
Now you must become heavenly farmers and
scatter pure seeds in the prepared soil.  The harvest of
every other seed is limited, but the bounty and the blessing
of the seed of the divine teachings is unlimited.
Throughout the coming centuries and cycles many harvests
will be gathered.  Consider the work of former generations.
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 22:5.
+F2 Cf. Mark 16:15.
 
+P7{~
During the lifetime of Jesus Christ the believing,
firm souls were few and numbered, but the heavenly
blessings descended so plentifully that in a number
of years countless souls entered beneath the shadow
of the Gospel.  God has said in the &amp;Qur'an:  "One grain
will bring forth seven sheaves, and every sheaf shall contain
one hundred grains."+F3  In other words, one grain will
become seven hundred; and if God so wills He will double
these also.  It has often happened that one blessed soul
has become the cause of the guidance of a nation.  Now
we must not consider our ability and capacity, nay,
rather, we must fix our gaze upon the favors and bounties
of God, in these days, Who has made of the drop a
sea, and of the atom a sun.
                                                                         +N4
     Upon you be greeting and praise!

+P10{~
              Revealed on March 27, 1916,
       in the garden adjacent to the Shrine of
     &amp;Baha'u'llah, addressed to the &amp;Baha'is of
    sixteen Southern States of the United States:
         Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West
      Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
       Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
            Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana,
             Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.

     O ye heralds of the Kingdom of God:
 
                                                                         +N2
     A FEW days ago an epistle was written to those divine
believers, but because these days are the days of
&amp;Naw-Ruz, you have come to my mind and I am sending
you this greeting for this glorious feast.  All the days
are blessed, but this feast is the national &amp;fete of Persia.
The Persians have been holding it for several thousand
years past.  In reality every day which man passes in the{~
mention of God, the diffusion of the fragrances of God
and calling the people to the Kingdom of God, that day
is his feast.  Praise be to God that you are occupied in the
service of the Kingdom of God and are engaged in the
promulgation of the religion of God by day and by
night.  Therefore all your days are feast days.  There is no
doubt that the assistance and the bestowal of God shall
descend upon you.
                                                                         +N3
     In the Southern States of the United States, the
friends are few, that is, in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,{~
West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
 
+P12{~
Consequently you must either go yourselves or send a
number of blessed souls to those states, so that they may
guide the people to the Kingdom of Heaven.  One of the
holy Manifestations, addressing a believing soul, has
said that, if a person become the cause of the illumination
of one soul, it is better than a boundless treasury.
"O &amp;Ali!  If God guide, through thee, one soul, it is better
for thee than all the riches!"  Again He says, "Direct
us to the straight path!"+F1 that is, Show us the right road.
It is also mentioned in the Gospel:  Travel ye to all parts
of the world and give ye the glad tidings of the appearance
of the Kingdom of God.+F2{~
                                                                         +N4
     In brief, I hope you will display in this respect the
greatest effort and magnanimity.  It is assured that you
will become assisted and confirmed.  A person declaring
the glad tidings of the appearance of the realities and
significances of the Kingdom is like unto a farmer who
scatters pure seeds in the rich soil.  The spring cloud will
pour upon them the rain of bounty, and unquestionably
the station of the farmer will be raised in the estimation
of the lord of the village, and many harvests will be gathered.
                                                                         +N5
     Therefore, ye friends of God!  Appreciate ye the{~
value of this time and be ye engaged in the sowing of
the seeds, so that you may find the heavenly blessing and
the lordly bestowal.  Upon you be &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!

+P14{~
              Revealed on March 29, 1916,
    outside the house in &amp;Bahji, and addressed to
     the &amp;Baha'is of twelve Central States of the
    United States:  Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,
       Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
              North Dakota, South Dakota,
                 Nebraska and Kansas.

     O ye heavenly souls, O ye spiritual
     assemblies, O ye lordly meetings:
 
                                                                         +N2
     FOR some time past correspondence has been delayed,
and this has been on account of the difficulty of
mailing and receiving letters.  But because at present a
number of facilities are obtainable, therefore, I am engaged
in writing you this brief epistle so that my heart
and soul may obtain joy and fragrance through the remembrance
of the friends.  Continually this wanderer
supplicates and entreats at the threshold of His Holiness
the One and begs assistance, bounty and heavenly confirmations
in behalf of the believers.  You are always in{~
my thoughts.  You are not nor shall you ever be forgotten.
I hope by the favor of His Holiness the Almighty
that day by day you may add to your faith, assurance,
firmness and steadfastness, and become instruments for
the promotion of the holy fragrances.
                                                                         +N3
     Although in the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio,
Michigan and Minnesota--praise be to God--believers
are found who are associating with each other in the
utmost firmness and steadfastness--day and night they
 
+P16{~
have no other intention save the diffusion of the fragrances
of God, they have no other hope except the promotion
of the heavenly teachings, like the candles they
are burning with the light of the love of God, and like
thankful birds are singing songs, spirit-imparting, joy-creating,
in the rose garden of the knowledge of God--
yet in the states of Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas few of the
believers exist.  So far the summons of the Kingdom of
God and the proclamation of the oneness of the world
of humanity has not been made in these states systematically
and enthusiastically.  Blessed souls and detached
teachers have not traveled through these parts repeatedly;
therefore these states are still in a state of heedlessness.
Through the efforts of the friends of God souls
must be likewise enkindled in these states, with the fire{~
of the love of God and attracted to the Kingdom of
God, so that section may also become illumined and the
soul imparting breeze of the rose garden of the Kingdom
may perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants.  Therefore,
if it is possible, send to those parts teachers who are severed
from all else save God, sanctified and pure.  If these
teachers be in the utmost state of attraction, in a short
time great results will be forthcoming.  The sons and
daughters of the kingdom are like unto the real farmers.
Through whichever state or country they pass they display
self-sacrifice and sow divine seeds.  From that seed
harvests are produced.  On this subject it is revealed in
the glorious Gospel:  When the pure seeds are scattered
in the good ground heavenly blessing and benediction
 {~
+P17{~
is obtained.+F1  I hope that you may become assisted and
confirmed, and never lose courage in the promotion of
the divine teachings.  Day by day may you add to your
effort, exertion, and magnanimity.
                                                                         +N4

     in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's room at the house in &amp;Bahji,

       States of the United States:  New Mexico,

     O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom:
 
                                                                         +N2
     DAY and night I have no other occupation than
the remembrance of the friends, praying from the depth
of my heart in their behalf, begging for them confirmation
from the Kingdom of God and supplicating the
direct effect of the breaths of the Holy Spirit.  I am hopeful
from the favors of His Highness the Lord of Bestowals,
that the friends of God during such a time may become
the secret cause of the illumination of the hearts
of humanity, breathing the breath of life upon the spirits
--whose praiseworthy results may become conducive
to the glory and exaltation of humankind throughout
all eternity.  Although in some of the Western States, like
California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, the fragrances
of holiness are diffused, numerous souls have
taken a share and a portion from the fountain of everlasting
life, they have obtained heavenly benediction,{~
have drunk an overflowing cup from the wine of the love
of God and have hearkened to the melody of the Supreme
Concourse--yet in the states of New Mexico,
Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Nevada,
 
+P22{~
the lamp of the love of God is not ignited in a befitting
and behooving manner, and the call of the Kingdom
of God has not been raised.  Now, if it is possible,
show ye an effort in this direction.  Either travel yourselves,
personally, throughout those states or choose others
and send them, so that they may teach the souls.  For
the present those states are like unto dead bodies:  they
must breathe into them the breath of life and bestow
upon them a heavenly spirit.  Like unto the stars they
must shine in that horizon and thus the rays of the Sun
of Reality may also illumine those states.
                                                                         +N3
     God says in the great &amp;Qur'an:  "Verily God is the
helper of those who have believed.  He will lead them
from darkness into light."+F1  This means:  God loves the
believers, consequently He will deliver them from darkness
and bring them into the world of light.
                                                                         +N4
     It is also recorded in the blessed Gospel:  Travel
ye throughout the world and call ye the people to the
Kingdom of God.+F2  Now this is the time that you may
arise and perform this most great service and become{~
the cause of the guidance of innumerable souls.  Thus
through this superhuman service the rays of peace and
conciliation may illumine and enlighten all the regions
and the world of humanity may find peace and composure.
                                                                         +N5
     During my stay in America I cried out in every
meeting and summoned the people to the propagation
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 2:257.
+F2 Cf. Mark 16:15.
 
+P23{~
of the ideals of universal peace.  I said plainly that the
continent of Europe had become like unto an arsenal
and its conflagration was dependent upon one spark,
and that in the coming years, or within two years, all
that which is recorded in the Revelation of John and the
Book of Daniel would become fulfilled and come to
pass.  This matter, in all probability, was published in the
San Francisco Bulletin, October 12, 1912.  You may refer
to it, so that the truth may become clear and manifest;
thus ye may fully realize that this is the time for the
diffusion of the fragrances.
                                                                         +N6
     The magnanimity of man must be heavenly or, in
other words, it must be assisted by the divine confirmation,
so that he may become the cause of the illumination
of the world of humanity.

     ALTHOUGH in most of the states and cities of the
United States, praise be to God, His fragrances are
diffused, and souls unnumbered are turning their faces
and advancing toward the Kingdom of God, yet in some
of the states the Standard of Unity is not yet upraised as
it should be, nor are the mysteries of the Holy Books,
such as the Bible, the Gospel, and the &amp;Qur'an, unraveled.
Through the concerted efforts of all the friends the
Standard of Unity must needs be unfurled in those
states, and the divine teachings promoted, so that these
states may also receive their portion of the heavenly bestowals
and a share of the Most Great Guidance.  Likewise
in the provinces of Canada, such as Newfoundland,
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta,
British Columbia, Ungava, Keewatin, Mackenzie,
Yukon, and the Franklin Islands in the Arctic Circle
--the believers of God must become self-sacrificing and
like unto the candles of guidance become ignited in the
 {~
+P28{~
provinces of Canada.  Should they show forth such a
magnanimity, it is assured that they will obtain universal
divine confirmations, the heavenly cohorts will reinforce
them uninterruptedly, and a most great victory
will be obtained.  God willing, the call of the Kingdom
may reach the ears of the Eskimos, the inhabitants of the
Islands of Franklin in the north of Canada, as well as
Greenland.  Should the fire of the love of God be kindled
in Greenland, all the ice of that country will be melted,
and its cold weather become temperate--that is, if the
hearts be touched with the heat of the love of God, that
territory will become a divine rose garden and a heavenly
paradise, and the souls, even as fruitful trees, will
acquire the utmost freshness and beauty.  Effort, the utmost
effort, is required.  Should you display an effort, so
that the fragrances of God may be diffused among the
Eskimos, its effect will be very great and far-reaching.
God says in the great &amp;Qur'an:  A day will come wherein
the lights of unity will enlighten all the world.  "The
earth will be irradiated with the light of its Lord."+F1  In
other words, the earth will become illumined with the
light of God.  That light is the light of unity.  "There is
no God but God."  The continent and the islands of Eskimos
are also parts of this earth.  They must similarly
receive a portion of the bestowals of the Most Great
Guidance.

     He is God!
     O ye blessed souls:
 
                                                                         +N2
     I DESIRE for you eternal success and prosperity and
beg perfect confirmation for each one in the divine
world.  My hope for you is that each one may shine forth
like unto the morning star from the horizon of the world
and in this Garden of God become a blessed tree, producing
everlasting fruits and results.
                                                                         +N3
     Therefore I direct you to that which is conducive
to your heavenly confirmation and illumination in the
Kingdom of God!
                                                                         +N4
     It is this:  Alaska is a vast country; although one of
the maidservants of the Merciful has hastened to those
parts, serving as a librarian in the public library, and according
to her ability is not failing in teaching the
Cause, yet the call of the Kingdom of God is not yet
raised through that spacious territory.
                                                                         +N5
     His Holiness Christ says:  Travel ye to the East and
to the West of the world and summon the people to the
Kingdom of God.+F1  Hence the mercy of God must encompass
 
+F1 Cf. Mark 16:15.
 {~
+P32{~
all humanity.  Therefore do ye not think it permissible
to leave that region deprived of the breezes of
the Morn of Guidance.  Consequently, strive as far as ye
are able to send to those parts fluent speakers, who are
detached from aught else save God, attracted with the
fragrances of God, and sanctified and purified from all
desires and temptations.  Their sustenance and food
must consist of the teachings of God.  First they must
themselves live in accordance with those principles, then
guide the people.  Perchance, God willing, the lights of
the Most Great Guidance will illuminate that country,
and the breezes of the rose garden of the love of God will
perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of Alaska.  Should
you be aided to render such a service, rest ye assured that
your heads shall be crowned with the diadem of everlasting
sovereignty, and at the threshold of oneness you
will become the favored and accepted servants.
                                                                         +N6
     Likewise the republic of Mexico is very important.
The majority of the inhabitants of that country are devoted
Catholics.  They are totally unaware of the reality
of the Bible, the Gospel and the new divine teachings.
They do not know that the basis of the religions of God
is one and that the holy Manifestations are like unto the
Sun of Truth, rising from the different dawning-places.
Those souls are submerged in the sea of dogmas.  If one
breath of life be blown over them, great results will issue
therefrom.  But it is better for those who intend to go to
Mexico to teach, to be familiar with the Spanish language.
                                                                         +N7
     Similarly, the six Central American republics, situated
south of Mexico--Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador,{~
 
+P33{~
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the seventh
country Belize or British Honduras.  The teachers going
to those parts must also be familiar with the Spanish language.
                                                                         +N8
     Attach great importance to the indigenous population
of America.  For these souls may be likened unto
the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who,
prior to the Mission of &amp;Muhammad, were like unto savages.
When the light of &amp;Muhammad shone forth in their
midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine
the world.  Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated
and guided, there can be no doubt that they will
become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world.
                                                                         +N9
     All the above countries have importance, but especially
the Republic of Panama, wherein the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans come together through the Panama Canal.
It is a center for travel and passage from America to
other continents of the world, and in the future it will
gain most great importance.
                                                                        +N10
     Likewise the islands of the West Indies, such as
Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the islands of the
Lesser Antilles, Bahama Islands, even the small Watling
Island, have great importance; especially the two black
republics, Haiti and Santo Domingo, situated in the
cluster of the Greater Antilles.  Likewise the cluster of the
islands of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean have importance.
                                                                        +N11
     In a similar way, the republics of the continent of
South America--Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, British
Guiana, Dutch Guiana, French Guiana, Bolivia,
Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela; also{~
 
+P34{~
the islands to the north, east and west of South America,
such as Falkland Islands, the &amp;Galapagos, Juan Fernandez,
Tobago and Trinidad.  Likewise the city of Bahia,
situated on the eastern shore of Brazil.  Because it is some
time that it has become known by this name, its efficacy
will be most potent.
                                                                        +N12
     In short, O ye believers of God!  Exalt your effort
and magnify your aims.  His Holiness Christ says:  Blessed
are the poor, for theirs shall be the Kingdom of
Heaven.+F2  In other words:  Blessed are the nameless and
traceless poor, for they are the leaders of mankind.  Likewise
it is said in the &amp;Qur'an:  "And We desire to show
favor to those who were brought low in the land, and to
make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make
of them Our heirs."+F3  Or, we wish to grant a favor to the
impotent souls and suffer them to become the inheritors
of the Messengers and Prophets.
                                                                        +N13
     Now is the time for you to divest yourselves of the
garment of attachment to this world that perisheth,
to be wholly severed from the physical world, become
heavenly angels, and travel to these countries.  I swear by
Him, besides Whom there is none other God, that each
one of you will become an &amp;Israfil of Life, and will blow
the Breath of Life into the souls of others.
                                                                        +N14

     PRAISE be to His Highness the Desired One that
ye have become confirmed in the promotion of divine
teachings in that vast Continent, raised the call of the
Kingdom of God in that region and announced the glad
tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts and
His Highness the Promised One.  Thanks be unto the
Lord that ye have become assisted and confirmed in this
aim.  This is purely through the confirmations of the
Lord of Hosts and the breaths of the Holy Spirit.  The
full measure of your success is as yet unrevealed, its significance
still unapprehended.  Erelong ye will, with your
own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, even
as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your
country the light of divine Guidance, and will bestow
upon its people the glory of an everlasting life.
                                                                         +N3
     Consider!  The station and the confirmation of the
apostles in the time of Christ was not known, and no
one looked on them with the feeling of importance--
nay, rather, they persecuted and ridiculed them.  Later
on it became evident what crowns studded with the brilliant
 
+P40{~
jewels of guidance were placed on the heads of the
apostles, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
John.
                                                                         +N4
     The range of your future achievements still remains
undisclosed.  I fervently hope that in the near future
the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the
results of your achievements.  The hope, therefore, which
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you is that the same success
which has attended your efforts in America may crown
your endeavors in other parts of the world, that through
you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused
throughout the East and the West and the advent of the
Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the
five continents of the globe.
                                                                         +N5
     The moment this divine Message is carried forward
by the American believers from the shores of America and
is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia,
of Africa and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of
the Pacific, this community will find itself securely established
upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.
Then will all the peoples of the world witness that this
community is spiritually illumined and divinely guided.
Then will the whole earth resound with the praises of
its majesty and greatness.  A party speaking their languages,
severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love
of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the
three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean--Polynesia,
Micronesia and Melanesia, and the islands attached
to these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo,
Java, Sumatra, Philippine Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji
Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia,
 
+P41{~
Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, Friendly Islands,
Samoa Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands,
Low Archipelago, Marquesas, Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert
Islands, Moluccas, Marshall Islands, Timor and the
other islands.  With hearts overflowing with the love of
God, with tongues commemorating the mention of
God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they
must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the
Lord of Hosts to all the people.  Know ye of a certainty
that whatever gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy
Spirit are surging over it, and the heavenly grace of the
Blessed Beauty encompasseth that gathering.
                                                                         +N6
     Consider ye, that Miss Agnes Alexander, the daughter
of the Kingdom, the beloved maidservant of the
Blessed Perfection, traveled alone to the Hawaiian Islands,
to the Island of Honolulu, and now she is gaining
spiritual victories in Japan!  Reflect ye how this
daughter was confirmed in the Hawaiian Islands.  She
became the cause of the guidance of a gathering of people.
                                                                         +N7
     Likewise Miss Knobloch traveled alone to Germany.
To what a great extent she became confirmed!  Therefore,
know ye of a certainty that whosoever arises in this
day to diffuse the divine fragrances, the cohorts of the
Kingdom of God shall confirm him and the bestowals
and the favors of the Blessed Perfection shall encircle
him.
                                                                         +N8
     O that I could travel, even though on foot and in
the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call
of "&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha" in cities, villages, mountains, deserts
and oceans, promote the divine teachings!  This,
 
+P42{~
alas, I cannot do.  How intensely I deplore it!  Please God,
ye may achieve it.
                                                                         +N9
     At this time, in the Hawaiian Islands, through
the efforts of Miss Alexander, a number of souls have
reached the shore of the sea of faith!  Consider ye, what
happiness, what joy is this!  I declare by the Lord of Hosts
that had this respected daughter founded an empire,
that empire would not have been so great!  For this sovereignty
is eternal sovereignty and this glory is everlasting glory.
                                                                        +N10
     Likewise, if some teachers go to other islands and
other parts, such as the continent of Australia, New
Zealand, Tasmania, also to Japan, Asiatic Russia, Korea,
French Indochina, Siam, Straits Settlements, India,
Ceylon and Afghanistan, most great results will be forthcoming.
How good would it be were there any possibility
of a commission composed of men and women, to
travel together through China and Japan--so that this
bond of love may become strengthened, and through
this going and coming they may establish the oneness
of the world of humanity, summon the people to the
Kingdom of God and spread the teachings.
                                                                        +N11
     Similarly, if possible, they should travel to the continent
of Africa, Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands,
Madeira Islands, &amp;Reunion Islands, St. Helena, Zanzibar,
Mauritius, etc., and in those countries summon the
people to the Kingdom of God and raise the cry of "&amp;Ya
&amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!"  They must also upraise the flag of the
oneness of the world of humanity in the island of Madagascar.
                                                                        +N12
     Books and pamphlets must be either translated or
 
+P43{~
composed in the languages of these countries and islands,
to be circulated in every part and in all directions.
                                                                        +N13
     It is said that in South Africa, a diamond mine is
discovered.  Although this mine is most valuable, yet after
all it is stone.  Perchance, God willing, the mine of
humanity may be discovered and the brilliant pearls of
the Kingdom be found.
                                                                        +N14
     In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a
conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it.
In all the countries of the world the longing for universal
peace is taking possession of the consciousness of
men.  There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord
and peace.  A most wonderful state of receptivity is
being realized.  This is through the consummate wisdom
of God, so that capacity may be created, the standard of
the oneness of the world of humanity be upraised, and
the fundamental of universal peace and the divine principles
be promoted in the East and the West.
                                                                        +N15
     Therefore, O ye believers of God!  Show ye an effort
and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine
teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany,
Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland,
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal,
Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece,
Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Monaco, San Marino,
Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta,
Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides
and Orkney Islands.
                                                                        +N16
     In all these countries, like unto the morning stars
shine ye forth from the horizon of guidance.  Thus far
ye have been untiring in your labors.  Let your exertions
 
+P44{~
henceforth increase a thousandfold.  Summon the people
in these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and
churches to enter the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  The scope of your
exertions must needs be extended.  The wider its range,
the more striking will be the evidence of divine assistance.
                                                                        +N17
     You have observed that while &amp;Abdu'l-Baha was in
the utmost bodily weakness and feebleness, while he was
indisposed, and had not the power to move--notwithstanding
this physical state he traveled through many
countries, in Europe and America, and in churches,
meetings and conventions was occupied with the promotion
of the divine principles and summoned the people
to the manifestation of the Kingdom of &amp;Abha.  You
have also observed how the confirmations of the Blessed
Perfection encompassed all.  What result is forthcoming
from material rest, tranquillity, luxury and attachment
to this corporeal world?  It is evident that the man who
pursues these things will in the end become afflicted
with regret and loss.
                                                                        +N18
     Consequently, one must close his eyes wholly to
these thoughts, long for eternal life, the sublimity of the
world of humanity, the celestial developments, the Holy
Spirit, the promotion of the Word of God, the guidance
of the inhabitants of the globe, the promulgation of
universal peace and the proclamation of the oneness of
the world of humanity!  This is the work!  Otherwise
like unto other animals and birds one must occupy himself
with the requirements of this physical life, the satisfaction
of which is the highest aspiration of the animal
 
+P45{~
kingdom, and one must stalk across the earth like unto
the quadrupeds.
                                                                        +N19
     Consider ye!  No matter how much man gains
wealth, riches and opulence in this world, he will not
become as independent as a cow.  For these fattened cows
roam freely over the vast tableland.  All the prairies and
meadows are theirs for grazing, and all the springs and
rivers are theirs for drinking!  No matter how much they
graze, the fields will not be exhausted!  It is evident that
they have earned these material bounties with the utmost
facility.
                                                                        +N20
     Still more ideal than this life is the life of the bird.
A bird, on the summit of a mountain, on the high, waving
branches, has built for itself a nest more beautiful
than the palaces of the kings!  The air is in the utmost
purity, the water cool and clear as crystal, the panorama
charming and enchanting.  In such glorious surroundings,
he expends his numbered days.  All the harvests of
the plain are his possessions, having earned all this
wealth without the least labor.  Hence, no matter how
much man may advance in this world, he shall not attain
to the station of this bird!  Thus it becomes evident
that in the matters of this world, however much man
may strive and work to the point of death, he will be
unable to earn the abundance, the freedom and the independent
life of a small bird.  This proves and establishes
the fact that man is not created for the life of this
ephemeral world--nay, rather, is he created for the acquirement
of infinite perfections, for the attainment to
the sublimity of the world of humanity, to be drawn
 
+P46{~
nigh unto the divine threshold, and to sit on the throne
of everlasting sovereignty!
                                                                        +N21
     Upon you be &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!
 
                                                                        +N22
     Whoever sets out on a teaching journey to any
place, let him recite this prayer day and night during his
travels in foreign lands:
 
                                                                        +N23
     O GOD, my God!  Thou seest me enraptured and
attracted toward Thy glorious kingdom, enkindled with
the fire of Thy love amongst mankind, a herald of Thy
kingdom in these vast and spacious lands, severed from
aught else save Thee, relying on Thee, abandoning rest
and comfort, remote from my native home, a wanderer
in these regions, a stranger fallen upon the ground,
humble before Thine exalted threshold, submissive toward
the heaven of Thine omnipotent glory, supplicating
Thee in the dead of night and at the break of dawn,
entreating and invoking Thee at morn and at eventide
to graciously aid me to serve Thy Cause, to spread abroad
Thy teachings and to exalt Thy Word throughout
the East and the West.
                                                                        +N24
     O Lord!  Strengthen my back, enable me to serve
Thee with the utmost endeavor, and leave me not to
myself, lonely and helpless in these regions.
                                                                        +N25
     O Lord!  Grant me communion with Thee in my
loneliness, and be my companion in these foreign lands.
                                                                        +N26
     Verily, Thou art the Confirmer of whomsoever
Thou willest in that which Thou desirest, and, verily,
Thou art the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.

 on April 20, in the pilgrims' quarters of the house
  in &amp;Bahji; on April 22, in the garden adjacent to
     the Shrine of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and addressed to
          the &amp;Baha'is of the United States
                     and Canada.
 
+P49{~
                                                                         +N1
     He is God!
     O ye Apostles of &amp;Baha'u'llah!
     May my life be sacrificed for you!
 
                                                                         +N2
     THE BLESSED Person of the Promised One is interpreted
in the Holy Book as the Lord of Hosts--the
heavenly armies.  By heavenly armies those souls are intended
who are entirely freed from the human world,
transformed into celestial spirits and have become divine
angels.  Such souls are the rays of the Sun of Reality
who will illumine all the continents.  Each one is holding
in his hand a trumpet, blowing the breath of life over
all the regions.  They are delivered from human qualities
and the defects of the world of nature, are characterized
with the characteristics of God, and are attracted with
the fragrances of the Merciful.  Like unto the apostles of
Christ, who were filled with Him, these souls also have
become filled with His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah; that is, the
love of &amp;Baha'u'llah has so mastered every organ, part
and limb of their bodies, as to leave no effect from the
promptings of the human world.
                                                                         +N3
     These souls are the armies of God and the conquerors
of the East and the West.  Should one of them
turn his face toward some direction and summon the
 
+P50{~
people to the Kingdom of God, all the ideal forces and
lordly confirmations will rush to his support and reinforcement.
He will behold all the doors open and all the
strong fortifications and impregnable castles razed to the
ground.  Singly and alone he will attack the armies of the
world, defeat the right and left wings of the hosts of all
the countries, break through the lines of the legions of
all the nations and carry his attack to the very center of
the powers of the earth.  This is the meaning of the Hosts
of God.
                                                                         +N4
     Any soul from among the believers of &amp;Baha'u'llah
who attains to this station will become known as the
Apostle of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Therefore strive ye with heart
and soul so that ye may reach this lofty and exalted position,
be established on the throne of everlasting glory,
and crown your heads with the shining diadem of the
Kingdom, whose brilliant jewels may irradiate upon
centuries and cycles.
                                                                         +N5
     O ye kind friends!  Uplift your magnanimity and
soar high toward the apex of heaven so that your blessed
hearts may become illumined more and more, day by
day, through the rays of the Sun of Reality, that is, His
Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah; at every moment the spirits may
obtain a new life, and the darkness of the world of nature
may be entirely dispelled; thus you may become
incarnate light and personified spirit, become entirely
unaware of the sordid matters of this world and in touch
with the affairs of the divine world.
                                                                         +N6
     Behold the portals which &amp;Baha'u'llah hath opened
before you!  Consider how exalted and lofty is the station
you are destined to attain; how unique the favors
 
+P51{~
with which you have been endowed.  Should we become
intoxicated with this cup, the sovereignty of this globe
of earth will become lower in our estimation than children's
play.  Should they place in the arena the crown of
the government of the whole world, and invite each one
of us to accept it, undoubtedly we shall not condescend,
and shall refuse to accept it.
                                                                         +N7
     To attain to this supreme station is, however, dependent
on the realization of certain conditions:
                                                                         +N8
     The first condition is firmness in the Covenant of
God.  For the power of the Covenant will protect the
Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah from the doubts of the people of
error.  It is the fortified fortress of the Cause of God and
the firm pillar of the religion of God.  Today no power
can conserve the oneness of the &amp;Baha'i world save the
Covenant of God; otherwise differences like unto a most
great tempest will encompass the &amp;Baha'i world.  It is evident
that the axis of the oneness of the world of humanity
is the power of the Covenant and nothing else.  Had
the Covenant not come to pass, had it not been revealed
from the Supreme Pen and had not the Book of the
Covenant, like unto the ray of the Sun of Reality, illuminated
the world, the forces of the Cause of God
would have been utterly scattered and certain souls who
were the prisoners of their own passions and lusts would
have taken into their hands an axe, cutting the root of
this Blessed Tree.  Every person would have pushed forward
his own desire and every individual aired his own
opinion!  Notwithstanding this great Covenant, a few
negligent souls galloped with their chargers into the
battlefield, thinking perchance they might be able to
 
+P52{~
weaken the foundation of the Cause of God:  but praise
be to God all of them were afflicted with regret and loss,
and erelong they shall see themselves in poignant despair.
Therefore, in the beginning the believers must
make their steps firm in the Covenant so that the confirmations
of &amp;Baha'u'llah may encircle them from all sides,
the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse may become
their supporters and helpers, and the exhortations and
advices of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, like unto the pictures engraved
on stone, may remain permanent and ineffaceable in the
tablets of all hearts.
                                                                         +N9
     The second condition:  Fellowship and love amongst
the believers.  The divine friends must be attracted to
and enamored of each other and ever be ready and willing
to sacrifice their own lives for each other.  Should one
soul from amongst the believers meet another, it must
be as though a thirsty one with parched lips has reached
to the fountain of the water of life, or a lover has met his
true beloved.  For one of the greatest divine wisdoms regarding
the appearance of the holy Manifestations is
this:  The souls may come to know each other and become
intimate with each other; the power of the love of
God may make all of them the waves of one sea, the
flowers of one rose garden, and the stars of one heaven.
This is the wisdom for the appearance of the holy Manifestations!
When the most great bestowal reveals itself
in the hearts of the believers, the world of nature will be
transformed, the darkness of the contingent being will
vanish, and heavenly illumination will be obtained.
Then the whole world will become the Paradise of &amp;Abha,
 
+P53{~
every one of the believers of God will become a blessed
tree, producing wonderful fruits.
                                                                        +N10
     O ye friends!  Fellowship, fellowship!  Love, love!
Unity, unity!--so that the power of the &amp;Baha'i Cause
may appear and become manifest in the world of existence.
My thoughts are turned towards you, and my
heart leaps within me at your mention.  Could ye know
how my soul glows with your love, so great a happiness
would flood your hearts as to cause you to become enamored
with each other.
                                                                        +N11
     The third condition:  Teachers must continually
travel to all parts of the continent, nay, rather, to all
parts of the world, but they must travel like &amp;Abdu'l-Baha,
who journeyed throughout the cities of America.
He was sanctified and free from every attachment and
in the utmost severance.  Just as His Holiness Christ says:
Shake off the very dust from your feet.+F1
                                                                        +N12
     You have observed that while in America many
souls in the utmost of supplication and entreaty desired
to offer some gifts, but this servant, in accord with the
exhortations and behests of the Blessed Perfection, never
accepted a thing, although on certain occasions we were
in most straitened circumstances.  But on the other
hand, if a soul for the sake of God, voluntarily and out
of his pure desire, wishes to offer a contribution (toward
the expenses of a teacher) in order to make the contributor
 
+F1 Cf. Matthew 10:14.
 
+P54{~
happy, the teacher may accept a small sum, but must
live with the utmost contentment.
                                                                        +N13
     The aim is this:  The intention of the teacher must
be pure, his heart independent, his spirit attracted, his
thought at peace, his resolution firm, his magnanimity
exalted and in the love of God a shining torch.  Should
he become as such, his sanctified breath will even affect
the rock; otherwise there will be no result whatsoever.
As long as a soul is not perfected, how can he efface the
defects of others?  Unless he is detached from aught else
save God, how can he teach severance to others?
                                                                        +N14
     In short, O ye believers of God!  Endeavor ye, so
that you may take hold of every means in the promulgation
of the religion of God and the diffusion of the fragrances
of God.
                                                                        +N15
     Amongst other things is the holding of the meetings
for teaching so that blessed souls and the old ones
from amongst the believers may gather together the
youths of the love of God in schools of instruction and
teach them all the divine proofs and irrefragable arguments,
explain and elucidate the history of the Cause,
and interpret also the prophecies and proofs which are
recorded and are extant in the divine books and epistles
regarding the manifestation of the Promised One, so
that the young ones may go in perfect knowledge in all
these degrees.
                                                                        +N16
     Likewise, whenever it is possible a committee must
be organized for the translation of the Tablets.  Wise
souls who have mastered and studied perfectly the Persian,
Arabic, and other foreign languages, or know one
of the foreign languages, must commence translating
 
+P55{~
Tablets and books containing the proofs of this Revelation,
and publishing those books, circulate them
throughout the five continents of the globe.
                                                                        +N17
     Similarly, the magazine, the Star of the West, must
be edited with the utmost regularity, but its contents
must be the promulgation of the Cause of God that
both East and West may become informed of the most
important events.
                                                                        +N18
     In short, in all the meetings, whether public or private,
nothing should be discussed save that which is
under consideration, and all the articles be centered
around the Cause of God.  Promiscuous talk must not
be dragged in and contention is absolutely forbidden.
                                                                        +N19
     The teachers traveling in different directions must
know the language of the country in which they will
enter.  For example, a person being proficient in the Japanese
language may travel to Japan, or a person knowing
the Chinese language may hasten to China, and so
forth.
                                                                        +N20
     In short, after this universal war, the people have
obtained extraordinary capacity to hearken to the divine
teachings, for the wisdom of this war is this:  That it may
become proven to all that the fire of war is world-consuming,
whereas the rays of peace are world-enlightening.
One is death, the other is life; this is extinction, that
is immortality; one is the most great calamity, the other
is the most great bounty; this is darkness, that is light;
this is eternal humiliation and that is everlasting glory;
one is the destroyer of the foundation of man, the other
is the founder of the prosperity of the human race.
                                                                        +N21
     Consequently, a number of souls may arise and act
 
+P56{~
in accordance with the aforesaid conditions, and hasten
to all parts of the world, especially from America to
Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through
Japan and China.  Likewise, from Germany teachers
and believers may travel to the continents of America,
Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel
through all the continents and islands of the globe.  Thus
in a short space of time, most wonderful results will be
produced, the banner of universal peace will be waving
on the apex of the world and the lights of the oneness of
the world of humanity may illumine the universe.
                                                                        +N22
     In brief, O ye believers of God!  The text of the divine
Book is this:  If two souls quarrel and contend about
a question of the divine questions, differing and disputing,
both are wrong.  The wisdom of this incontrovertible
law of God is this:  That between two souls from
amongst the believers of God, no contention and dispute
may arise; that they may speak with each other
with infinite amity and love.  Should there appear the
least trace of controversy, they must remain silent, and
both parties must continue their discussions no longer,
but ask the reality of the question from the Interpreter.
This is the irrefutable command!
                                                                        +N23
     Upon you be &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!
 
                                                                        +N24
                    Supplication
 
                                                                        +N25
     O GOD, my God!  Thou seest how black darkness
is enshrouding all regions, how all countries are burning
with the flame of dissension, and the fire of war and
carnage is blazing throughout the East and the West.
 
+P57{~
Blood is flowing, corpses bestrew the ground, and severed
heads are fallen on the dust of the battlefield.
                                                                        +N26
     O Lord!  Have pity on these ignorant ones and look
upon them with the eye of forgiveness and pardon.  Extinguish
this fire, so that these dense clouds which obscure
the horizon may be scattered, the Sun of Reality
shine forth with the rays of conciliation, this intense
gloom be dispelled and the resplendent light of peace
shed its radiance upon all countries.
                                                                        +N27
     O Lord!  Draw up the people from the abyss of the
ocean of hatred and enmity, and deliver them from this
impenetrable darkness.  Unite their hearts, and brighten
their eyes with the light of peace and reconciliation.
Deliver them from the depths of war and bloodshed,
and free them from the darkness of error.  Remove the
veil from their eyes, and enlighten their hearts with the
light of guidance.  Treat them with Thy tender mercy
and compassion, and deal not with them according to
Thy justice and wrath which cause the limbs of the
mighty to quake.
                                                                        +N28
     O Lord!  Wars have persisted.  Distress and anxiety
have waxed great and every flourishing region is laid
waste.
                                                                        +N29
     O Lord!  Hearts are heavy, and souls are in anguish.
Have mercy on these poor souls and do not leave them
to the excesses of their own desires.
                                                                        +N30
     O Lord!  Make manifest in Thy lands humble and
submissive souls, their faces illumined with the rays of
guidance, severed from the world, extolling Thy Name,
uttering Thy praise, and diffusing the fragrance of Thy
holiness amongst mankind.
 
 
+P58{~
                                                                        +N31
     O Lord!  Strengthen their backs, gird up their loins,
and enrapture their hearts with the most mighty signs
of Thy love.
                                                                        +N32
     O Lord!  Verily, they are weak, and Thou art the
Powerful and the Mighty; they are impotent, and Thou
art the Helper and the Merciful.
                                                                        +N33
     O Lord!  The ocean of rebellion is surging, and these
tempests will not be stilled save through Thy boundless
grace which hath embraced all regions.
                                                                        +N34
     O Lord!  Verily, the people are in the abyss of passion,
and naught can save them but Thine infinite bounties.
                                                                        +N35
     O Lord!  Dispel the darkness of these corrupt desires,
and illumine the hearts with the lamp of Thy love
through which all countries will erelong be enlightened.
Confirm, moreover, Thy loved ones, those who, leaving
their homelands, their families and their children,
have, for the love of Thy Beauty, traveled to foreign
countries to diffuse Thy fragrances and promulgate Thy
teachings.  Be Thou their companion in their loneliness,
their helper in a strange land, the remover of their sorrows,
their comforter in calamity.  Be Thou a refreshing
draught for their thirst, a healing medicine for their ills

                    TO THE &amp;BAHA'IS
                        OF THE
                  NORTHEASTERN STATES
 
+P60{~
              Revealed on February 2, 1917,
         in &amp;Isma'il &amp;Aqa's room at the house of
       &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Haifa, and addressed to the
       &amp;Baha'is of the nine Northeastern States of
        the United States:  Maine, Massachusetts,
        New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
            Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
                       and New York.
 
+P61{~
                                                                         +N1
     He is God!
     O ye real friends:
 
                                                                         +N2
     ALL countries, in the estimation of the one true
God, are but one country, and all cities and villages are
on an equal footing.  Neither holds distinction over another.
All of them are the fields of God and the habitation
of the souls of men.  Through faith and certitude,
and the precedence achieved by one over another, however,
the dweller conferreth honor upon the dwelling,
some of the countries achieve distinction, and attain a
preeminent position.  For instance, notwithstanding
that some of the countries of Europe and of America are
distinguished by, and surpass other countries in, the salubrity
of their climate, the wholesomeness of their water,
and the charm of their mountains, plains and prairies,
yet Palestine became the glory of all nations inasmuch
as all the holy and divine Manifestations, from
the time of Abraham until the appearance of the Seal of
the Prophets (&amp;Muhammad), have lived in, or migrated
to, or traveled through, that country.  Likewise, Mecca
and Medina have achieved illimitable glory, as the light
 
+P62{~
of Prophethood shone forth therein.  For this reason Palestine
and &amp;Hijaz have been distinguished from all other
countries.
                                                                         +N3
     Likewise, the continent of America is, in the eyes
of the one true God, the land wherein the splendors of
His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries of His
Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide
and the free assemble.  Therefore, every section thereof
is blessed:  but because these nine states have been favored
in faith and assurance, hence through this precedence
they have obtained spiritual privilege.  They must
realize the value of this bounty; because they have obtained
such a favor and in order to render thanksgiving
for this most great bestowal, they must arise in the diffusion
of divine fragrances so that the blessed verse of the
&amp;Qur'an, "God is the light of heaven and earth:  the similitude
of His light is a niche in a wall, wherein a lamp
is placed, and the lamp enclosed in a case of glass; the
glass appears as if it were a shining star.  It is lighted with
the oil of a Blessed Tree, an olive neither of the East, nor
of the West; it wanteth little but that the oil thereof
would give light, although no fire touched it.  This is the
light added unto light.  God will direct unto His light
whom He pleaseth"+F1--may be realized.
                                                                         +N4
     He says:  The world of nature is the world of darkness,
because it is the origin of a thousand depravities;
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 24:35.
 
+P63{~
nay, rather, it is darkness upon darkness.  The illumination
of the world of nature is dependent upon the splendor
of the Sun of Reality.  The grace of guidance is
like unto the candle which is enkindled in the glass of
knowledge and wisdom and that glass of knowledge and
wisdom is the mirror of the heart of humanity.  The oil
of that luminous lamp is from the fruits of the Blessed
Tree and that oil is so refined that it will burn without
light.  When the intensity of the light and the translucency
of the glass and the purity of the mirror are brought
together, it will become light upon light.
                                                                         +N5
     In brief, in these nine blessed states &amp;Abdu'l-Baha
journeyed and traveled from place to place, explained
the wisdom of the heavenly books and diffused the fragrances.
In most of these states he founded the divine
Edifice and opened the door of teaching.  In those states
he sowed pure seeds and planted blessed trees.
                                                                         +N6
     Now the believers of God and the maidservants of
the Merciful must irrigate these fields and with the utmost
power engage themselves in the cultivation of these
heavenly plantations so that the seeds may grow and
develop, prosperity and blessing be realized and many
rich and great harvests be gathered in.
                                                                         +N7
     The Kingdom of God is like unto a farmer who
comes into possession of a piece of pure and virgin soil.
Heavenly seeds are scattered therein, the clouds of divine
providence pour down and the rays of the Sun of
Reality shine forth.
                                                                         +N8
     Now all these bounties exist and appear in full in
these nine states.  The divine Gardener passed by that
 
+P64{~
holy ground and scattered pure seeds from the lordly
teachings in that field; the rain of the bounties of God
poured down and the heat of the Sun of Reality--that
is, the merciful confirmations--shone with the utmost
splendor.  It is my hope that each one of those blessed
souls may become a peerless and unique irrigator and
the East and the West of America may become like unto
a delectable paradise so that all of you may hear from the
Supreme Concourse the cry of "Blessed are you, and
again blessed are you!"
                                                                         +N9
     Upon you be greeting and praise!
 
                                                                        +N10
     The following supplication is to be read by the
teachers and friends daily:
 
                                                                        +N11
     O THOU kind Lord!  Praise be unto Thee that Thou
hast shown us the highway of guidance, opened the
doors of the kingdom and manifested Thyself through
the Sun of Reality.  To the blind Thou hast given sight;
to the deaf Thou hast granted hearing; Thou hast resuscitated
the dead; Thou hast enriched the poor; Thou
hast shown the way to those who have gone astray; Thou
hast led those with parched lips to the fountain of guidance;
Thou hast suffered the thirsty fish to reach the
ocean of reality; and Thou hast invited the wandering
birds to the rose garden of grace.
                                                                        +N12
     O Thou Almighty!  We are Thy servants and Thy
poor ones; we are remote and yearn for Thy presence,
are athirst for the water of Thy fountain, are ill, longing
for Thy healing.  We are walking in Thy path and have
 
+P65{~
no aim or hope save the diffusion of Thy fragrance, so
that all souls may raise the cry:  O God, "Guide us to the
straight path."+F2  May their eyes be opened to behold the
light, and may they be freed from the darkness of ignorance.
May they gather around the lamp of Thy guidance.
May every portionless one receive a share.  May the
deprived become the confidants of Thy mysteries.
                                                                        +N13
     O Almighty!  Look upon us with the glance of mercifulness.
Grant us heavenly confirmation.  Bestow upon
us the breath of the Holy Spirit, so that we may be assisted
in Thy service and, like unto brilliant stars, shine
in these regions with the light of Thy guidance.
                                                                        +N14
     Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the
Wise and the Seeing.

                      SOUTHERN STATES
 
+P68{~
               Revealed on February 3, 1917,
            in Haifa in &amp;Isma'il &amp;Aqa's room, and
          addressed to the &amp;Baha'is of the sixteen
            Southern States of the United States:
        Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,
          North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
          Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee,
               Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas,
                     Oklahoma and Texas.
 
+P69{~
                                                                         +N1
     O ye blessed, respected souls:
 
                                                                         +N2
     THE philosophers of the ancients, the thinkers
of the Middle Ages and the scientists of this and the former
centuries have all agreed upon the fact that the best
and the most ideal region for the habitation of man is
the temperate zone, for in this belt the intellects and
thoughts rise to the highest stage of maturity, and the
capability and ability of civilization manifest themselves
in full efflorescence.  When you read history critically
and with a penetrating eye, it becomes evident that the
majority of the famous men have been born, reared and
have done their work in the temperate zone, while very,
very few have appeared from the torrid and frigid zones.
                                                                         +N3
     Now these sixteen Southern States of the United
States are situated in the temperate zone, and in these
regions the perfections of the world of nature have been
fully revealed.  For the moderation of the weather, the
beauty of the scenery and the geographical configuration
of the country display a great effect in the world of
minds and thoughts.  This fact is well demonstrated
through observation and experience.
 
+P70{~
                                                                         +N4
     Even the holy, divine Manifestations have had a
nature in the utmost equilibrium, the health and wholesomeness
of their bodies most perfect, their constitutions
endowed with physical vigor, their powers functioning
in perfect order, and the outward sensations
linked with the inward perceptions, working together
with extraordinary momentum and coordination.
                                                                         +N5
     Therefore in these sixteen states, because they
are contiguous to other states and their climate being in
the utmost of moderation, unquestionably the divine
teachings must reveal themselves with a brighter effulgence,
the breaths of the Holy Spirit must display a penetrating
intensity, the ocean of the love of God must be
stirred with higher waves, the breezes of the rose garden
of the divine love be wafted with higher velocity, and the
fragrances of holiness be diffused with swiftness and rapidity.
                                                                         +N6
     Praise be to God that the divine outpourings are
infinite, the melody of the lordly principles is in the utmost
efficacy, the most great Orb shining with perfect
splendor, the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse are attacking
with invincible power, the tongues are sharper
than the swords, the hearts are more brilliant than the
light of electricity, the magnanimity of the friends precedes
all the magnanimities of the former and subsequent
generations, the souls are divinely attracted, and
the fire of the love of God is enkindled.
                                                                         +N7
     At this time and at this period we must avail ourselves
of this most great opportunity.  We must not sit
inactive for one moment; we must sever ourselves from
composure, rest, tranquillity, goods, property, life and
 
+P71{~
attachment to material things.  We must sacrifice everything
to His Highness, the Possessor of existence, so that
the powers of the Kingdom may show greater penetration
and the brilliant effulgence in this New Cycle may
illumine the worlds of minds and ideals.
                                                                         +N8
     It is about twenty-three years that the fragrances of
God have been diffused in America, but no adequate
and befitting motion has been realized, and no great acclamation
and acceleration has been witnessed.  Now it
is my hope that through the heavenly power, the fragrances
of the Merciful, the attraction of consciousness,
the celestial outpourings, the heavenly cohorts and the
gushing forth of the fountain of divine love, the believers
of God may arise and in a short time the greatest
good may unveil her countenance, the Sun of Reality
may shine forth with such intensity that the darkness of
the world of nature may become entirely dispelled and
driven away; from every corner a most wonderful melody
may be raised, the morning birds may break into
such a song that the world of humanity may be quickened
and moved, the solid bodies may become liquefied,
and the souls who are like unto adamantine rocks
may open their wings and through the heat of the love
of God fly heavenward.
                                                                         +N9
     Nearly two thousand years ago, Armenia was enveloped
with impenetrable darkness.  One blessed soul
from among the disciples of Christ hastened to that
part, and through his effort, erelong that province became
illumined.  Thus it has become evident how the
power of the Kingdom works!
                                                                        +N10
     Therefore, rest ye assured in the confirmations of
 
+P72{~
the Merciful and the assistance of the Most High; become
ye sanctified above and purified from this world
and the inhabitants thereof; suffer your intentions to
work for the good of all; cut your attachment to the
earth and like unto the essence of the spirit become ye
light and delicate.  Then with a firm resolution, a pure
heart, a rejoiced spirit, and an eloquent tongue, engage
your time in the promulgation of the divine principles
so that the oneness of the world of humanity may pitch
her canopy in the apex of America and all the nations of
the world may follow the divine policy.  This is certain,
that the divine policy is justice and kindness toward
all mankind.  For all the nations of the world are the
sheep of God, and God is the kind shepherd.  He has created
these sheep.  He has protected them, sustained and
trained them.  What greater kindness than this?  And
every moment we must render a hundred thousand
thanksgivings that, praise be to God, we are freed from
all the ignorant prejudices, are kind to all the sheep of
God, and our utmost hope is to serve each and all, and
like unto a benevolent father educate every one.
                                                                        +N11
     Upon you be greeting and praise!
 
                                                                        +N12
     Every soul who travels through the cities, villages
and hamlets of these states and is engaged in the diffusion
of the fragrances of God, should peruse this commune
every morning:
 
                                                                        +N13
     O MY God!  O my God!  Thou seest me in my lowliness
and weakness, occupied with the greatest undertaking,
determined to raise Thy word among the masses
 
+P73{~
and to spread Thy teachings among Thy peoples.  How
can I succeed unless Thou assist me with the breath of
the Holy Spirit, help me to triumph by the hosts of Thy
glorious kingdom, and shower upon me Thy confirmations,
which alone can change a gnat into an eagle, a
drop of water into rivers and seas, and an atom into
lights and suns?  O my Lord!  Assist me with Thy triumphant
and effective might, so that my tongue may utter
Thy praises and attributes among all people and my soul
overflow with the wine of Thy love and knowledge.
                                                                        +N14

Thou willest.

+P76{~
               Revealed on February 8, 1917,
       in &amp;Baha'u'llah's room at the house of &amp;Abbud
       in &amp;Akka, and addressed to the &amp;Baha'is of the
        twelve Central States of the United States:
          Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,
              Ohio, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,

     He is God!
     O ye old believers and intimate friends:
 
                                                                         +N2
     GOD says in the great &amp;Qur'an:  "He specializes for
His Mercy whomsoever He willeth."+F1
                                                                         +N3
     These twelve Central States of the United States are
like unto the heart of America, and the heart is connected
with all the organs and parts of man.  If the heart
is strengthened, all the organs of the body are reinforced,
and if the heart is weak all the physical elements are subjected
to feebleness.
                                                                         +N4
     Now praise be to God that Chicago and its environs
from the beginning of the diffusion of the fragrances
of God have been a strong heart.  Therefore,
through divine bounty and providence it has become
confirmed in certain great matters.
                                                                         +N5
     First:  The call of the Kingdom was in the very beginning
raised from Chicago.  This is indeed a great
privilege, for in future centuries and cycles, it will be as
an axis around which the honor of Chicago will revolve.
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 2:105, 3:74.
 
+P78{~
                                                                         +N6
     Second:  A number of souls with the utmost firmness
and steadfastness arose in that blessed spot in the
promotion of the Word of God and even to the present
moment, having purified and sanctified the heart from
every thought, they are occupied with the promulgation
of the teachings of God.  Hence the call of praise is raised
uninterruptedly from the Supreme Concourse.
                                                                         +N7
     Third:  During the American journey &amp;Abdu'l-Baha
several times passed through Chicago and associated
with the friends of God.  For some time he sojourned
in that city.  Day and night he was occupied
with the mention of the True One and summoned the
people to the Kingdom of God.
                                                                         +N8
     Fourth:  Up to the present time, every movement
initiated in Chicago, its effect was spread to all parts and
to all directions, just as everything that appears in and

     Fifth:  The first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in America was
instituted in Chicago, and this honor and distinction is
infinite in value.  Out of this &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, without
doubt, thousands of &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars will be
born.
                                                                        +N10
     Likewise (were instituted in Chicago) the general
Annual Conventions, the foundation of the Star of
the West, the Publishing Society for the publication of
books and Tablets and their circulation in all parts of
America, and the preparations now under way for the
celebration of the Golden Centenary Anniversary of the
Kingdom of God.  I hope that this Jubilee and this Exhibition
may be celebrated in the utmost perfection so
 
+P79{~
that the call to the world of unity, "There is no God but
One God, and all the Messengers, from the beginning
to the Seal of the Prophets (&amp;Muhammad) were sent on
the part of the True One!" may be raised; the flag of the
oneness of the world of humanity be unfurled, the
melody of universal peace may reach the ears of the East
and the West, all the paths may be cleared and straightened,
all the hearts may be attracted to the Kingdom of
God, the tabernacle of unity be pitched on the apex of
America, the song of the love of God may exhilarate and
rejoice all the nations and peoples, the surface of the
earth may become the eternal paradise, the dark clouds
may be dispelled and the Sun of Truth may shine forth
with the utmost intensity.
                                                                        +N11
     O ye friends of God!  Exert ye with heart and soul,
so that association, love, unity and agreement be obtained
between the hearts, all the aims may be merged
into one aim, all the songs become one song and the
power of the Holy Spirit may become so overwhelmingly
victorious as to overcome all the forces of the world
of nature.  Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably
glorious.  Should success crown your enterprise, America
will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of
spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the
Kingdom of God will, in the plentitude of its majesty
and glory, be firmly established.
                                                                        +N12
     This phenomenal world will not remain in an unchanging
condition even for a short while.  Second after
second it undergoes change and transformation.  Every
foundation will finally become collapsed; every glory
and splendor will at last vanish and disappear, but the
 
+P80{~
Kingdom of God is eternal and the heavenly sovereignty
and majesty will stand firm, everlasting.  Hence in the estimation
of a wise man the mat in the Kingdom of God
is preferable to the throne of the government of the
world.
                                                                        +N13
     Continually my ear and eye are turned toward the
Central States; perchance a melody from some blessed
souls may reach my ears--souls who are the dawning-places
of the love of God, the stars of the horizon of
sanctification and holiness--souls who will illumine
this dark universe and quicken to life this dead world.
The joy of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha depends upon this!  I hope that
you may become confirmed therein.
                                                                        +N14
     Consequently, those souls who are in a condition
of the utmost severance, purified from the defects of the
world of nature, sanctified from attachment to this
earth, vivified with the breaths of eternal life--with luminous
hearts, with heavenly spirit, with attraction of
consciousness, with celestial magnanimity, with eloquent
tongues and with clear explanations--such souls
must hasten and travel through all parts of the Central
States.  In every city and village they must occupy themselves
with the diffusion of the divine exhortations and advices,
guide the souls and promote the oneness of the
world of humanity.  They must play the melody of international
conciliation with such power that every deaf
one may attain hearing, every extinct person may be set
aglow, every dead one may obtain new life and every indifferent
soul may find ecstasy.  It is certain that such will
be the consummation.

     Let the spreaders of the fragrances of God recite
this prayer every morning:
 
                                                                        +N16
     O LORD, my God!  Praise and thanksgiving be unto
Thee for Thou hast guided me to the highway of the
kingdom, suffered me to walk in this straight and far-stretching
path, illumined my eye by beholding the
splendors of Thy light, inclined my ear to the melodies
of the birds of holiness from the kingdom of mysteries
and attracted my heart with Thy love among the righteous.
                                                                        +N17
     O Lord!  Confirm me with the Holy Spirit, so that
I may call in Thy Name amongst the nations, and give
the glad tidings of the manifestation of Thy kingdom
amongst mankind.
                                                                        +N18
     O Lord!  I am weak, strengthen me with Thy power
and potency.  My tongue falters, suffer me to utter
Thy commemoration and praise.  I am lowly, honor me
through admitting me into Thy kingdom.  I am remote,
cause me to approach the threshold of Thy mercifulness.
O Lord!  Make me a brilliant lamp, a shining star and a
blessed tree, adorned with fruit, its branches overshadowing
all these regions.  Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the
Powerful and Unconstrained.

                      WESTERN STATES
 
+P84{~
               Revealed on February 15, 1917,
        in &amp;Baha'u'llah's room at the house of &amp;Abbud
        in &amp;Akka, and addressed to the &amp;Baha'is of the
         eleven Western States of the United States:
            New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada,
              California, Wyoming, Utah, Montana,
                 Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

     He is God!
     O ye friends and the maidservants of the
     Merciful, the chosen ones of the Kingdom:
 
                                                                         +N2
     THE BLESSED state of California bears the utmost
similarity to the Holy Land, that is, the country of Palestine.
The air is of the utmost temperance, the plain
very spacious, and the fruits of Palestine are seen in that
state in the utmost of freshness and delicacy.  When
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha was traveling and journeying through
those states, he found himself in Palestine, for from every
standpoint there was a perfect likeness between this
region and that state.  Even the shores of the Pacific
Ocean, in some instances, show perfect resemblance to
the shores of the Holy Land--even the flora of the Holy
Land have grown on those shores--the study of which
had led to much speculation and wonder.
                                                                         +N3
     Likewise, in the state of California and other Western
states, wonderful scenes of the world of nature,
which bewilder the minds of men, are manifest.  Lofty
mountains, deep canyons, great and majestic waterfalls,
and giant trees are witnessed on all sides, while its soil is
in the utmost fertility and richness.  That blessed state
 
+P86{~
is similar to the Holy Land and that region and that
country like unto a delectable paradise, is in many ways
identical with Palestine.  Now just as there are natural resemblances,
heavenly resemblances must also be acquired.
 
                                                                         +N4
     The lights of the divine traces are manifest in Palestine.
The majority of the Israelitish Prophets raised the
call of the Kingdom of God in this holy ground.  Having
spread the spiritual teachings, the nostrils of the
spiritually-minded ones became fragrant, the eyes of
the illumined souls became brightened, the ears were
thrilled through this song, the hearts obtained eternal
life from the soul-refreshing breeze of the Kingdom of
God and gained supreme illumination from the splendor
of the Sun of Reality.  Then from this region the light
was spread to Europe, America, Asia, Africa and Australia.
                                                                         +N5
     Now California and the other Western States must
earn an ideal similarity with the Holy Land, and from
that state and that region the breaths of the Holy Spirit
be diffused to all parts of America and Europe, that the
call of the Kingdom of God may exhilarate and rejoice
all the ears, the divine principles bestow a new life, the
different parties may become one party, the divergent
ideas may disappear and revolve around one unique center,
the East and the West of America may embrace each
other, the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity
may confer a new life upon all the children of
men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched
on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may
 
+P87{~
become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit,
this world may become another world, the body politic
may attain to a new exhilaration, and just as in the state
of California and other Western States the marvelous
scenes of the world of nature are evident and manifest,
the great signs of the Kingdom of God may also be unveiled
so that the body may correspond with the spirit,
the outward world may become a symbol of the inward
world, and the mirror of the earth may become the
mirror of the Kingdom, reflecting the ideal virtues of
heaven.
                                                                         +N6
     During My journey and traveling in those parts, I
beheld wonderful scenes and beautiful panoramas of
nature, orchards and rivers; national parks and general
conclaves; deserts, plains, meadows and prairies; and the
grains and fruits of that region greatly attracted My attention;
even to the present moment they are in My
mind.
                                                                         +N7
     Particularly was I greatly pleased with the meetings
in San Francisco and Oakland, the gatherings in Los
Angeles, and the believers who came from the cities of
other states.  Whenever their faces cross My memory,
immediately infinite happiness is realized.
                                                                         +N8
     Therefore I hope that the divine teachings like
unto the rays of the sun may be diffused in all the Western
States, and the blessed verse of the &amp;Qur'an, "It is a
good City and the Lord is the Forgiver!"+F1 may become
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 34:15.
 
+P88{~
realized.  Likewise, the significance of another Qur'anic
verse, "Do ye not travel through the land?"+F2 and of the
verse, "Behold the traces of the Mercy of God!"+F3 become
revealed in the utmost effulgence.
                                                                         +N9
     Praise be to God that through the divine bounty
and providence, in that region the field of service is vast,
the minds are in the utmost degree of intelligence and
progress, sciences and arts are being promoted, the
hearts like unto mirrors are in the utmost state of purity
and translucency, and the friends of God are in perfect
attraction.  Therefore it is hoped that meetings for teaching
will be organized and instituted, and for the diffusion
of the fragrances of God wise teachers may be sent
to cities, even to villages.
                                                                        +N10
     The teachers of the Cause must be heavenly, lordly
and radiant.  They must be embodied spirit, personified
intellect, and arise in service with the utmost firmness,
steadfastness and self-sacrifice.  In their journeys they
must not be attached to food and clothing.  They must
concentrate their thoughts on the outpourings of the
Kingdom of God and beg for the confirmations of the
Holy Spirit.  With a divine power, with an attraction of
consciousness, with heavenly glad tidings and celestial
holiness they must perfume the nostrils with the fragrances
of the Paradise of &amp;Abha.

     The following commune is to be read by them every

     O GOD!  O God!  This is a broken-winged bird and
his flight is very slow--assist him so that he may fly toward
the apex of prosperity and salvation, wing his way
with the utmost joy and happiness throughout the illimitable
space, raise his melody in Thy Supreme Name in
all the regions, exhilarate the ears with this call, and
brighten the eyes by beholding the signs of guidance.
                                                                        +N13
     O Lord!  I am single, alone and lowly.  For me there
is no support save Thee, no helper except Thee and no
sustainer beside Thee.  Confirm me in Thy service, assist
me with the cohorts of Thine angels, make me victorious
in the promotion of Thy Word and suffer me to
speak out Thy wisdom amongst Thy creatures.  Verily,
Thou art the helper of the weak and the defender of the
little ones, and verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty

+P92{~
               Revealed on February 21, 1917,
          in &amp;Baha'u'llah's room at the house of
           &amp;Abbud in &amp;Akka, and addressed to the

     He is God!
     O ye kind friends and the maidservants
     of the Merciful:
 
                                                                         +N2
     IN THE great &amp;Qur'an, God says:  "Thou shalt see no
difference in the creatures of God."+F1  In other words, He
says:  From the ideal standpoint, there is no variation
between the creatures of God, because they are all created
by Him.  From the above premise, a conclusion is
drawn, that there is no difference between countries.
The future of the Dominion of Canada, however, is very
great, and the events connected with it infinitely glorious.
It shall become the object of the glance of providence,
and shall show forth the bounties of the All-Glorious.
                                                                         +N3
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during his journey and sojourn
through that Dominion obtained the utmost joy.  Before
My departure, many souls warned Me not to travel to
Montreal, saying, the majority of the inhabitants are
Catholics, and are in the utmost fanaticism, that they
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 67:3.
 
+P94{~
are submerged in the sea of imitations, that they have
not the capability to hearken to the call of the Kingdom
of God, that the veil of bigotry has so covered the eyes
that they have deprived themselves from beholding the
signs of the Most Great Guidance, and that the dogmas
have taken possession of the hearts entirely, leaving no
trace of reality.  They asserted that should the Sun of Reality
shine with perfect splendor throughout that Dominion,
the dark, impenetrable clouds of superstitions
have so enveloped the horizon that it would be utterly
impossible for anyone to behold its rays.
                                                                         +N4
     But these stories did not have any effect on the
resolution of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  He, trusting in God, turned
his face toward Montreal.  When he entered that city he
observed all the doors open, he found the hearts in the
utmost receptivity and the ideal power of the Kingdom
of God removing every obstacle and obstruction.  In the
churches and meetings of that Dominion he called men
to the Kingdom of God with the utmost joy, and scattered
such seeds which will be irrigated with the hand of
divine power.  Undoubtedly those seeds will grow, becoming
green and verdant, and many rich harvests will
be gathered.  In the promotion of the divine principles
he found no antagonist and no adversary.  The believers
he met in that city were in the utmost spirituality, and
attracted with the fragrances of God.  He found that
through the effort of the maidservant of God Mrs. Maxwell
a number of the sons and daughters of the Kingdom
in that Dominion were gathered together and associated
with each other, increasing this joyous exhilaration
day by day.  The time of sojourn was limited to a
 
+P95{~
number of days, but the results in the future are inexhaustible.
When a farmer comes into the possession of
a virgin soil, in a short time he will bring under cultivation
a large field.  Therefore I hope that in the future
Montreal may become so stirred, that the melody of
the Kingdom may travel to all parts of the world from
that Dominion and the breaths of the Holy Spirit may
spread from that center to the East and the West of
America.
                                                                         +N5
     O ye believers of God!  Be not concerned with the
smallness of your numbers, neither be oppressed by
the multitude of an unbelieving world.  Five grains of
wheat will be endued with heavenly blessing, whereas a
thousand tons of tares will yield no results or effect.
One fruitful tree will be conducive to the life of society,
whereas a thousand forests of wild trees offer no fruits.
The plain is covered with pebbles, but precious stones
are rare.  One pearl is better than a thousand wildernesses
of sand, especially this pearl of great price, which is endowed
with divine blessing.  Erelong thousands of other
pearls will be born from it.  When that pearl associates
and becomes the intimate of the pebbles, they also all
change into pearls.
                                                                         +N6
     Again I repeat that the future of Canada, whether
from a material or a spiritual standpoint, is very great.
Day by day civilization and freedom shall increase.  The
clouds of the Kingdom will water the seeds of guidance
which have been sown there.  Consequently, rest ye not,
seek ye no composure, attach not yourselves to the luxuries
of this ephemeral world, free yourselves from every
attachment, and strive with heart and soul to become
 
+P96{~
fully established in the Kingdom of God.  Gain ye the
heavenly treasures.  Day by day become ye more illumined.
Draw ye nearer and nearer unto the threshold of
oneness.  Become ye the manifestors of spiritual favors
and the dawning-places of infinite lights!  If it is possible,
send ye teachers to other portions of Canada; likewise,
dispatch ye teachers to Greenland and the home of the
Eskimos.
                                                                         +N7
     As regards the teachers, they must completely divest
themselves from the old garments and be invested
with a new garment.  According to the statement of
Christ, they must attain to the station of rebirth--that
is, whereas in the first instance they were born from the
womb of the mother, this time they must be born from
the womb of the world of nature.  Just as they are now
totally unaware of the experiences of the fetal world,
they must also forget entirely the defects of the world of
nature.  They must be baptized with the water of life, the
fire of the love of God and the breaths of the Holy Spirit;
be satisfied with little food, but take a large portion from
the heavenly table.  They must disengage themselves
from temptation and covetousness, and be filled with
the spirit.  Through the effect of their pure breath, they
must change the stone into the brilliant ruby and the
shell into pearl.  Like unto the cloud of vernal shower,
they must transform the black soil into the rose garden
and orchard.  They must make the blind seeing, the deaf
hearing, the extinguished one enkindled and set aglow,
and the dead quickened.
                                                                         +N8
     Upon you be greeting and praise!
 
+P97{~
                                                                         +N9
     PRAISE be to Thee, O my God!  These are Thy servants
who are attracted by the fragrances of Thy mercifulness,
are enkindled by the fire burning in the tree of
Thy singleness, and whose eyes are brightened by beholding

Thy oneness.

     O Lord!  Loose their tongues to make mention of
Thee amongst Thy people, suffer them to speak forth
Thy praise through Thy grace and loving-kindness, assist
them with the cohorts of Thine angels, strengthen
their loins in Thy service, and make them the signs of
Thy guidance amongst Thy creatures.
                                                                        +N11
     Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted,
the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

     The spreaders of the fragrances of God should recite
this prayer every morning:
 
                                                                        +N13
     O GOD, my God!  Thou beholdest this weak one
begging for celestial strength, this poor one craving Thy
heavenly treasures, this thirsty one longing for the fountain
of eternal life, this afflicted one yearning for Thy
promised healing through Thy boundless mercy which
Thou hast destined for Thy chosen servants in Thy
kingdom on high.
                                                                        +N14
     O Lord!  I have no helper save Thee, no shelter besides
Thee, and no sustainer except Thee.  Assist me with
Thine angels to diffuse Thy holy fragrances and to
spread abroad Thy teachings amongst the choicest of
Thy people.

     O my Lord!  Suffer me to be detached from aught
else save Thee, to hold fast to the hem of Thy bounty,
to be wholly devoted to Thy Faith, to remain fast and
firm in Thy love and to observe what Thou hast prescribed
in Thy Book.
                                                                        +N16

     He is God!
     O ye heavenly souls, sons and daughters
     of the Kingdom:
 
                                                                         +N2
     GOD says in the &amp;Qur'an:  "Take ye hold of the Cord
of God, all of you, and become ye not disunited."+F1
                                                                         +N3
     In the contingent world there are many collective
centers which are conducive to association and unity
between the children of men.  For example, patriotism
is a collective center; nationalism is a collective center;
identity of interests is a collective center; political alliance
is a collective center; the union of ideals is a collective
center, and the prosperity of the world of humanity
is dependent upon the organization and promotion of
the collective centers.  Nevertheless, all the above institutions
are, in reality, the matter and not the substance,
accidental and not eternal--temporary and not everlasting.
With the appearance of great revolutions and upheavals,
all these collective centers are swept away.  But
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 3:103.
 
+P102{~
the Collective Center of the Kingdom, embodying the
institutions and divine teachings, is the eternal Collective
Center.  It establishes relationship between the East
and the West, organizes the oneness of the world of humanity,
and destroys the foundation of differences.  It
overcomes and includes all the other collective centers.
Like unto the ray of the sun, it dispels entirely the darkness
encompassing all the regions, bestows ideal life, and
causes the effulgence of divine illumination.  Through
the breaths of the Holy Spirit it performs miracles; the
Orient and the Occident embrace each other, the North
and South become intimates and associates, conflicting
and contending opinions disappear, antagonistic aims
are brushed aside, the law of the struggle for existence is
abrogated, and the canopy of the oneness of the world
of humanity is raised on the apex of the globe, casting
its shade over all the races of men.  Consequently, the real
Collective Center is the body of the divine teachings,
which include all the degrees and embrace all the universal
relations and necessary laws of humanity.
                                                                         +N4
     Consider!  The people of the East and the West
were in the utmost strangeness.  Now to what a high
degree they are acquainted with each other and united
together!  How far are the inhabitants of Persia from the
remotest countries of America!  And now observe how
great has been the influence of the heavenly power, for
the distance of thousands of miles has become identical
with one step!  How various nations that have had no
relations or similarity with each other are now united
and agreed through this divine potency!  Indeed to God
 
+P103{~
belongs power in the past and in the future!  And verily
God is powerful over all things!
                                                                         +N5
     Consider the flowers of a garden.  Though differing
in kind, color, form, and shape, yet, inasmuch as
they are refreshed by the waters of one spring, revived
by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one
sun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth
unto their beauty.  How unpleasing to the eye if all the
flowers and plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits,
the branches and the trees of that garden were all of the
same shape and color!  Diversity of hues, form and
shape, enricheth and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth
the effect thereof.  In like manner, when divers
shades of thought, temperament and character, are
brought together under the power and influence of one
central agency, the beauty and glory of human perfection
will be revealed and made manifest.  Naught but the
celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and
transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing
the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and
convictions of the children of men.
                                                                         +N6
     Therefore, the believers of God throughout all the
republics of America, through the divine power, must
become the cause of the promotion of heavenly teachings
and the establishment of the oneness of humanity.
Every one of the important souls must arise, blowing
over all parts of America the breath of life, conferring
upon the people a new spirit, baptizing them with the
fire of the love of God, the water of life, and the breaths
of the Holy Spirit so that the second birth may become
 
+P104{~
realized.  For it is written in the Gospel:  "That which is
born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit."+F2
                                                                         +N7
     Therefore, O ye believers of God in the United
States and Canada!  Select ye important personages, or
else they by themselves, becoming severed from rest and
composure of the world, may arise and travel throughout
Alaska, the republic of Mexico, and south of Mexico
in the Central American republics, such as Guatemala,
Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama
and Belize; and through the great South American republics,
such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil,
French Guiana, Dutch Guiana, British Guiana, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile; also in the
group of the West Indies islands, such as Cuba, Haiti,
Puerto Rico, Jamaica and Santo Domingo, and the
group of islands of the Lesser Antilles, the Islands of
Bahama and the Islands of Bermuda; likewise to the islands
to the east, west and north of South America, such
as Trinidad, Falkland Islands, &amp;Galapagos Islands, Juan
Fernandez and Tobago.  Visit ye especially the city of Bahia,
on the eastern shore of Brazil.  Because in the past
years this city was christened with the name, BAHIA,
there is no doubt that it has been through the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit.
                                                                         +N8
     Consequently, the believers of God must display
the utmost effort, upraise the divine melody throughout
 
+F2 John 3:6.
 
+P105{~
those regions, promulgate the heavenly teachings
and waft over all the spirit of eternal life, so that those
republics may become so illumined with the splendors
and the effulgences of the Sun of Reality that they may
become the objects of the praise and commendation of
all other countries.  Likewise, ye must give great attention
to the Republic of Panama, for in that point the
Occident and the Orient find each other united through
the Panama Canal, and it is also situated between the
two great oceans.  That place will become very important
in the future.  The teachings, once established there,
will unite the East and the West, the North and the
South.
                                                                         +N9
     Hence the intention must be purified, the effort
ennobled and exalted, so that you may establish affinity
between the hearts of the world of humanity.  This glorious
aim will not become realized save through the
promotion of divine teachings which are the foundations
of the holy religions.
                                                                        +N10
     Consider how the religions of God served the world
of humanity!  How the religion of Torah became conducive
to the glory and honor and progress of the Israelitish
nation!  How the breaths of the Holy Spirit of His
Holiness Christ created affinity and unity between divergent
communities and quarreling families!  How the
sacred power of His Holiness &amp;Muhammad became the
means of uniting and harmonizing the contentious
tribes and the different clans of Peninsular Arabia--to
such an extent that one thousand tribes were welded
into one tribe; strife and discord were done away with;
all of them unitedly and with one accord strove in advancing
 
+P106{~
the cause of culture and civilization, and thus
were freed from the lowest degree of degradation, soaring
toward the height of everlasting glory!  Is it possible
to find a greater Collective Center in the phenomenal
world than this?  In comparison to this divine Collective
Center, the national collective center, the patriotic collective
center, the political collective center and the cultural
and intellectual collective center are like child's
play!
                                                                        +N11
     Now strive ye that the Collective Center of the sacred
religions--for the inculcation of which all the
Prophets were manifested and which is no other than
the spirit of the divine teachings--be spread in all parts
of America, so that each one of you may shine forth
from the horizon of reality like unto the morning star,
divine illumination may overcome the darkness of nature,
and the world of humanity may become enlightened.
This is the most great work!  Should you become
confirmed therein, this world will become another world,
the surface of the earth will become the delectable paradise,
and eternal Institutions be founded.
 
                                                                        +N12
     Let whosoever travels to different parts to teach,
peruse over mountain, desert, land and sea this supplication:
 
                                                                        +N13
     O GOD!  O God!  Thou seest my weakness, lowliness
and humility before Thy creatures; nevertheless, I
have trusted in Thee and have arisen in the promotion
of Thy teachings among Thy strong servants, relying on
Thy power and might.
 
+P107{~
                                                                        +N14
     O Lord!  I am a broken-winged bird and desire to
soar in Thy limitless space.  How is it possible for me
to do this save through Thy providence and grace, Thy
confirmation and assistance.
                                                                        +N15
     O Lord!  Have pity on my weakness, and strengthen
me with Thy power.  O Lord!  Have pity on my impotence,
and assist me with Thy might and majesty.
                                                                        +N16
     O Lord!  Should the breath of the Holy Spirit confirm
the weakest of creatures, he would attain all to
which he aspireth and would possess anything he desireth.
Indeed, Thou hast assisted Thy servants in the past
and, though they were the weakest of Thy creatures, the
lowliest of Thy servants and the most insignificant of
those who lived upon the earth, through Thy sanction
and potency they took precedence over the most glorious
of Thy people and the most noble of mankind.
Whereas formerly they were as moths, they became as
royal falcons, and whereas before they were as brooks,
they became as seas, through Thy bestowal and Thy
mercy.  They became, through Thy most great favor,
stars shining on the horizon of guidance, birds singing
in the rose gardens of immortality, lions roaring in the
forests of knowledge and wisdom, and whales swimming
in the oceans of life.
                                                                        +N17
     Verily, Thou art the Clement, the Powerful, the
Mighty, and the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p></body>
