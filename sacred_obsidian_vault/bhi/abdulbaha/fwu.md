                         THE TRUE MODERNISM 
 
     All created things have their degree or stage of maturity.  The 
period of maturity in the life of a tree is the time of its fruit-bearing.  
The maturity of a plant is the time of its blossoming 
and flower.  The animal attains a stage of full growth and completeness, 
and in the human kingdom man reaches his maturity when the lights 
of intelligence have their greatest power and development.  
     From the beginning to the end of his life man passes through 
certain periods or stages each of which is marked by certain conditions 
peculiar to itself.  For instance during the period of childhood his conditions 
and requirements are characteristic of that degree of intelligence 
and capacity.  After a time he enters the period of youth in 
which his former conditions and needs are superseded by new requirements 
applicable to the advance in his degree.  His faculties of observation 
are broadened and deepened, his intelligent capacities are trained 
and awakened, the limitations and environment of childhood no 
longer restrict his energies and accomplishments.  At last he passes out 
of the period of youth and enters the stage or station of maturity 
which necessitates another transformation and corresponding advance 
in his sphere of life-activity.  New powers and perceptions clothe him, 
teaching and training commensurate with his progression occupy his 
mind, special bounties and bestowals descend in proportion to his increased 
capacities and his former period of youth and its conditions 
will no longer satisfy his matured view and vision.  
     Similarly there are periods and stages in the life of the aggregate 
world of humanity which at one time was passing through its degree of 
childhood, at another its time of youth but now has entered its long 
presaged period of maturity, the evidences of which are everywhere 
visible and apparent.  Therefore the requirements and conditions of 
former periods have changed and merged into exigencies which distinctly 
characterize the present age of the world of mankind.  That 
which was applicable to human needs during the early history of the 
race could neither meet nor satisfy the demands of this day and period 
of newness and consummation.  Humanity has emerged from its 
former degrees of limitation and preliminary training.  Man must now 
become imbued with new virtues and powers, new moralities, new 
capacities.  New bounties, bestowals and perfections are awaiting and 
already descending upon him.  The gifts and graces of the period of 
youth although timely and sufficient during the adolescence of the 
 
+P10 
world of mankind, are now incapable of meeting the requirements of 
its maturity.  The playthings of childhood and infancy no longer 
satisfy or interest the adult mind.  
     From every standpoint the world of humanity is undergoing a 
re-formation.  The laws of former governments and civilizations are in 
process of revision, scientific ideas and theories are developing and 
advancing to meet a new range of phenomena, invention and discovery 
are penetrating hitherto unknown fields revealing new wonders and 
hidden secrets of the material universe; industries have vastly wider 
scope and production; everywhere the world of mankind is in the 
throes of evolutionary activity indicating the passing of the old conditions 
and advent of the new age of re-formation.  Old trees yield no 
fruitage; old ideas and methods are obsolete and worthless now.  Old 
standards of ethics, moral codes and methods of living in the past will 
not suffice for the present age of advancement and progress.  
     This is the cycle of maturity and re-formation in religion as well.  
Dogmatic imitations of ancestral beliefs are passing.  They have been 
the axis around which religion revolved but now are no longer fruitful; 
on the contrary, in this day they have become the cause of human 
degradation and hindrance.  Bigotry and dogmatic adherence to 
ancient beliefs have become the central and fundamental source of 
animosity among men, the obstacle to human progress, the cause of 
warfare and strife, the destroyer of peace, composure and welfare in 
the world.  Consider conditions in the Balkans today+F1; fathers, mothers, 
children in grief and lamentation, the foundations of life overturned, 
cities laid waste and fertile lands made desolate by the ravages of war.  
These conditions are the outcome of hostility and hatred between 
nations and peoples of religion who imitate and adhere to the forms 
and violate the spirit and reality of the divine teachings.  
     While this is true and apparent, it is likewise evident that the 
Lord of mankind has bestowed infinite bounties upon the world in 
this century of maturity and consummation.  The ocean of divine 
mercy is surging, the vernal showers are descending, the Sun of 
Reality is shining gloriously.  Heavenly teachings applicable to the 
advancement in human conditions have been revealed in this merciful 
age.  This re-formation and renewal of the fundamental reality of 
religion constitute the true and outworking spirit of modernism, the 
unmistakable light of the world, the manifest effulgence of the Word 
of God, the divine remedy for all human ailment and the bounty of 
eternal life to all mankind.

+P11 
                         THE SOURCE OF REALITY 
 
     In our solar system, the center of illumination is the sun itself.  
Through the will of God this central luminary is the one source 
of the existence and development of all phenomenal things.  When 
we observe the organisms of the material kingdoms we find that their 
growth and training are dependent upon the heat and light of the 
sun.  Without this quickening impulse there would be no growth of 
tree or vegetation, neither would the existence of animal or human 
being be possible; in fact no forms of created life would be manifest 
upon the earth.  But if we reflect deeply we will perceive that the great 
bestower and giver of life is God; the sun is the intermediary of His 
will and plan.  Without the bounty of the sun therefore the world 
would be in darkness.  All illumination of our planetary system proceeds 
or emanates from the solar center.  
     Likewise in the spiritual realm of intelligence and idealism there 
must be a center of illumination, and that center is the everlasting, 
ever-shining Sun, the Word of God.  Its lights are the lights of reality 
which have shone upon humanity, illumining the realm of thought and 
morals, conferring the bounties of the divine world upon man.  These 
lights are the cause of the education of souls and the source of the 
enlightenment of hearts, sending forth in effulgent radiance the message 
of the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God.  In brief, the moral and 
ethical world and the world of spiritual regeneration are dependent 
for their progressive being upon that heavenly center of illumination.  
It gives forth the light of religion and bestows the life of the spirit, 
imbues humanity with archetypal virtues and confers eternal splendors.  
This Sun of Reality, this center of effulgences is the prophet or Manifestation 
of God.  Just as the phenomenal sun shines upon the material 
world producing life and growth, likewise the spiritual or prophetic 
Sun confers illumination upon the human world of thought and intelligence, 
and unless it rose upon the horizon of human existence the 
kingdom of man would become dark and extinguished.  
     The Sun of Reality is one Sun but it has different dawning-places, 
just as the phenomenal sun is one although it appears at various 
points of the horizon.  During the time of spring the luminary of the 
physical world rises far to the north of the equinoctial; in summer it 
dawns midway and in winter it appears in the most southerly point of 
its zodiacal journey.  These day-springs or dawning-points differ widely 
but the sun is ever the same sun whether it be the phenomenal or 
 
+P12 
spiritual luminary.  Souls who focus their vision upon the Sun of 
Reality will be the recipients of light no matter from what point it 
rises, but those who are fettered by adoration of the dawning-point 
are deprived when it appears in a different station upon the spiritual 
horizon.  
     Furthermore, just as the solar cycle has its four seasons, the cycle 
of the Sun of Reality has its distinct and successive periods.  Each 
brings its vernal season or springtime.  When the Sun of Reality returns 
to quicken the world of mankind a divine bounty descends from 
the heaven of generosity.  The realm of thoughts and ideals is set in 
motion and blessed with new life.  Minds are developed, hopes brighten, 
aspirations become spiritual, the virtues of the human world appear 
with freshened power of growth and the image and likeness of God 
become visible in man.  It is the springtime of the inner world.  After 
the spring, summer comes with its fullness and fruitage spiritual; 
autumn follows with its withering winds which chill the soul; the Sun 
seems to be going away until at last the mantle of winter overspreads 
and only faint traces of the effulgence of that divine Sun remain.  Just 
as the surface of the material world becomes dark and dreary, the soil 
dormant, the trees naked and bare and no beauty or freshness remain 
to cheer the darkness and desolation, so the winter of the spiritual 
cycle witnesses the death and disappearance of divine growth and 
extinction of the light and love of God.  But again the cycle begins and 
a new springtime appears.  In it the former springtime has returned, 
the world is resuscitated, illumined and attains spirituality; religion 
is renewed and reorganized, hearts are turned to God, the summons of 
God is heard and life is again bestowed upon man.  For a long time the 
religious world had been weakened and materialism had advanced; 
the spiritual forces of life were waning, moralities were becoming degraded, 
composure and peace had vanished from souls and satanic 
qualities were dominating hearts; strife and hatred overshadowed 
humanity, bloodshed and violence prevailed.  God was neglected; the 
Sun of Reality seemed to have gone completely; deprivation of the 
bounties of heaven was a fact; and so the season of winter fell upon 
mankind.  But in the generosity of God a new springtime dawned, the 
lights of God shone forth, the effulgent Sun of Reality returned and 
became manifest, the realm of thoughts and kingdom of hearts became 
exhilarated, a new spirit of life breathed into the body of the 
world and continuous advancement became apparent.  
     I hope that the lights of the Sun of Reality will illumine the whole 
world so that no strife and warfare, no battles and bloodshed remain.  
May fanaticism and religious bigotry be unknown, all humanity enter 
the bond of brotherhood, souls consort in perfect agreement, the 
 
+P13 
nations of earth at last hoist the banner of truth and the religions of 
the world enter the divine temple of oneness, for the foundations of 
the heavenly religions are one reality.  Reality is not divisible; it does 
not admit multiplicity.  All the holy Manifestations of God have proclaimed 
and promulgated the same reality.  They have summoned 
mankind to reality itself and reality is one.  The clouds and mists of 
imitations have obscured the Sun of Truth.  We must forsake these 
imitations, dispel these clouds and mists and free the Sun from the 
darkness of superstition.  Then will the Sun of Truth shine most 
gloriously; then all the inhabitants of the world will be united, the 
religions will be one, sects and denominations will reconcile, all 
nationalities will flow together in the recognition of one fatherhood and 
all degrees of humankind gather in the shelter of the same tabernacle, 
under the same banner.  
     Until the heavenly civilization is founded, no result will be forthcoming 
from material civilization, even as you observe.  See what 
catastrophes overwhelm mankind.  Consider the wars which disturb 
the world.  Consider the enmity and hatred.  The existence of these 
wars and conditions indicates and proves that the heavenly civilization 
has not yet been established.  If the civilization of the Kingdom 
be spread to all the nations, this dust of disagreement will be dispelled, 
these clouds will pass away and the Sun of Reality in its 
greatest effulgence and glory will shine upon mankind.  
 
+P14 
                         THE DAWN OF PEACE 
 
     The fatherhood of God, His loving-kindness and beneficence 
are apparent to all.  In His mercy he provides fully and amply 
for His creatures and if any soul sins He does not suspend His 
bounty.  All created things are visible manifestations of His fatherhood, 
mercy and heavenly bestowals.  Human brotherhood is likewise 
as clear and evident as the sun, for all are servants of one God, belong 
to one humankind, inhabit the same globe, are sheltered beneath the 
overshadowing dome of heaven and submerged in the sea of divine 
mercy.  Human brotherhood and dependence exist because mutual 
helpfulness and cooperation are the two necessary principles underlying 
human welfare.  This is the physical relationship of mankind.  
There is another brotherhood, the spiritual, which is higher, holier and 
superior to all others.  It is heavenly; it emanates from the breaths of 
the Holy Spirit and the effulgence of merciful attributes; it is founded 
upon spiritual susceptibilities.  This brotherhood is established by the 
Manifestations of the Holy One.  
     The divine Manifestations since the day of Adam have striven 
to unite humanity so that all may be accounted as one soul.  The 
function and purpose of a shepherd is to gather and not disperse his 
flock.  The prophets of God have been divine shepherds of humanity.  
They have established a bond of love and unity among mankind, 
made scattered peoples one nation and wandering tribes a mighty 
kingdom.  They have laid the foundation of the oneness of God and 
summoned all to universal peace.  All these holy, divine Manifestations 
are one.  They have served one God, promulgated the same 
truth, founded the same institutions and reflected the same light.  
Their appearances have been successive and correlated; each one has 
announced and extolled the one who was to follow and all laid the 
foundation of reality.  They summoned and invited the people to love 
and made the human world a mirror of the Word of God.  Therefore 
the divine religions they established have one foundation; their teachings, 
proofs and evidences are one; in name and form they differ but 
in reality they agree and are the same.  These holy Manifestations 
have been as the coming of springtime in the world.  Although the 
springtime of this year is designated by another name according to 
the changing calendar, yet as regards its life and quickening it is the 
same as the springtime of last year.  For each spring is the time of a 
new creation, the effects, bestowals, perfections and life-giving forces 
 
+P15 
of which are the same as those of the former vernal seasons although 
the names are many and various.  This is 1912, last year's was 1911 
and so on, but in fundamental reality no difference is apparent.  The 
sun is one but the dawning-points of the sun are numerous and changing.  
The ocean is one body of water but different parts of it have 
particular designation, Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean, Antarctic, 
etc.  If we consider the names, there is differentiation, but the water, 
the ocean itself is one reality.  
     Likewise the divine religions of the holy Manifestations of God 
are in reality one though in name and nomenclature they differ.  Man 
must be a lover of the light no matter from what day-spring it may 
appear.  He must be a lover of the rose no matter in what soil it may 
be growing.  He must be a seeker of the truth no matter from what 
source it come.  Attachment to the lantern is not loving the light.  
Attachment to the earth is not befitting but enjoyment of the rose 
which develops from the soil is worthy.  Devotion to the tree is profitless 
but partaking of the fruit is beneficial.  Luscious fruits no matter 
upon what tree they grow or where they may be found must be enjoyed.  
The word of truth no matter which tongue utters it must be 
sanctioned.  Absolute verities no matter in what book they be recorded 
must be accepted.  If we harbor prejudice it will be the cause of deprivation 
and ignorance.  The strife between religions, nations and 
races arises from misunderstanding.  If we investigate the religions to 
discover the principles underlying their foundations we will find they 
agree, for the fundamental reality of them is one and not multiple.  
By this means the religionists of the world will reach their point of 
unity and reconciliation.  They will ascertain the truth that the purpose 
of religion is the acquisition of praiseworthy virtues, betterment of 
morals, spiritual development of mankind, the real life and divine 
bestowals.  All the prophets have been the promoters of these principles; 
none of them has been the promoter of corruption, vice or evil.  They 
have summoned mankind to all good.  They have united people in the 
love of God, invited them to the religions of the unity of mankind and 
exhorted them to amity and agreement.  For example, we mention 
Abraham and Moses.  By this mention we do not mean the limitation 
implied in the mere names but intend the virtues which these names 
embody.  When we say "Abraham" we mean thereby a Manifestation 
of divine guidance, a center of human virtues, a source of heavenly 
bestowals to mankind, a dawning-point of divine inspiration and 
perfections.  These perfections and graces are not limited to names 
and boundaries.  When we find these virtues, qualities and attributes 
in any personality, we recognize the same reality shining from within 
and bow in acknowledgment of the Abrahamic perfections.  Similarly 
 
+P16 
we acknowledge and adore the beauty of Moses.  Some souls were 
lovers of the name Abraham, loving the lantern instead of the light 
and when they saw this same light shining from another lantern they 
were so attached to the former lantern that they did not recognize its 
later appearance and illumination.  Therefore those who were attached 
and held tenaciously to the name Abraham were deprived when the 
Abrahamic virtues reappeared in Moses.  Similarly the Jews were believers 
in His Holiness Moses, awaiting the coming of the Messiah.  
The virtues and perfections of Moses became apparent in His Holiness 
Jesus Christ most effulgently but the Jews held to the name Moses, 
not adoring the virtues and perfections manifest in him.  Had they 
been adoring these virtues and seeking these perfections they would 
assuredly have believed in His Holiness Jesus Christ when the same 
virtues and perfections shone in him.  If we are lovers of the light we 
adore it in whatever lamp it may become manifest but if we love the 
lamp itself and the light is transferred to another lamp we will neither 
accept nor sanction it.  Therefore we must follow and adore the virtues 
revealed in the messengers of God whether in Abraham, Moses, Jesus 
or other prophets but we must not adhere to and adore the lamp.  We 
must recognize the sun no matter from what dawning-point it may 
shine forth, be it Mosaic, Abrahamic or any personal point of orientation 
whatever, for we are lovers of sunlight and not of orientation.  
We are lovers of illumination and not of lamps and candles.  We are 
seekers for water no matter from what rock it may gush forth.  We are 
in need of fruit in whatsoever orchard it may be ripened.  We long for 
rain it matters not which cloud pours it down.  We must not be fettered.  
If we renounce these fetters we shall agree, for all are seekers of reality.  
The counterfeit or imitation of true religion has adulterated human 
belief and the foundations have been lost sight of.  The variance of 
these imitations has produced enmity and strife, war and bloodshed.  
Now the glorious and brilliant twentieth century has dawned and the 
divine bounty is radiating universally.  The Sun of Truth is shining 
forth in intense enkindlement.  This is verily the century when these 
imitations must be forsaken, superstitions abandoned and God alone 
worshiped.  We must look at the reality of the prophets and their 
teachings in order that we may agree.  
     Praise be to God! the springtime of God is at hand.  This century 
is verily the spring season.  The world of mind and the kingdom of 
soul have become fresh and verdant by its bestowals.  It has resuscitated 
the whole realm of existence.  On one hand the lights of reality are 
shining; on the other the clouds of divine mercy are pouring down the 
fullness of heavenly bounty.  Wonderful material progress is evident 
and great spiritual discoveries are being made.  Truly this can be called 
 
+P17 
the miracle of centuries for it is replete with manifestations of the 
miraculous.  The time has come when all mankind shall be united, 
when all races shall be loyal to one fatherland, all religions become one 
religion and racial and religious bias pass away.  It is a day in which 
the oneness of humankind shall uplift its standard and international 
peace like the true morning flood the world with its light.  Therefore 
we offer supplications to God, asking him to dispel these gloomy 
clouds and uproot these imitations in order that the East and West 
may become radiant with love and unity; that the nations of the 
world shall embrace each other and the ideal spiritual brotherhood 
illumine the world like the glorious sun of the high heavens.  
 
+P18 
                         THE CAUSE OF STRIFE 
 
     In the estimation of historians this radiant century is equivalent 
to one hundred centuries of the past.  If comparison be made with 
the sum total of all former human achievements it will be found 
that the discoveries, scientific advancement and material civilization 
of this present century have equaled, yea far exceeded the progress 
and outcome of one hundred former centuries.  The production of 
books and compilations of literature alone bear witness that the output 
of the human mind in this century has been greater and more 
enlightening than all the past centuries together.  It is evident therefore 
that this century is of paramount importance.  Reflect upon the 
miracles of accomplishment which have already characterized it, the 
discoveries in every realm of human research, inventions, scientific 
knowledge, ethical reforms and regulations established for the welfare 
of humanity, mysteries of nature explored, invisible forces brought 
into visibility and subjection, a veritable wonder-world of new 
phenomena and conditions heretofore unknown to man now open to 
his uses and further investigation.  The East and West can communicate 
instantly.  A human being can soar in the skies or speed in submarine 
depths.  The power of steam has linked the continents.  Trains cross 
the deserts and pierce the barriers of mountains; ships find unerring 
pathways upon the trackless oceans.  Day by day discoveries are increasing.  
What a wonderful century this is!  It is an age of universal 
re-formation.  Laws and statutes of governments civil and federal are in 
process of change and transformation.  Sciences and arts are being 
moulded anew.  Thoughts are metamorphosed.  The foundations of 
human society are changing and strengthening.  Today sciences of the 
past are useless.  The ptolemaic system of astronomy, numberless other 
systems and theories of scientific and philosophical explanation are 
discarded, known to be false and worthless.  Ethical precedents and 
principles cannot be applied to the needs of the modern world.  
Thoughts and theories of past ages are fruitless now.  Thrones and 
governments are crumbling and falling.  All conditions and requisites 
of the past unfitted and inadequate for the present time, are undergoing 
radical reform.  
     It is evident therefore that counterfeit and spurious religious 
teaching, antiquated forms of belief and ancestral imitations which 
are at variance with the foundations of divine reality must also pass 
away and be re-formed.  They must be abandoned and new conditions 
 
+P19 
be recognized.  The morals of humanity must undergo change.  New 
remedy and solution for human problems must be adopted.  Human 
intellects themselves must change and be subject to the universal reformation.  
Just as the thoughts and hypotheses of past ages are fruitless 
today, likewise dogmas and codes of human invention are obsolete 
and barren of product in religion.  Nay, it is true that they are the 
cause of enmity and conducive to strife in the world of humanity; 
war and bloodshed proceed from them and the oneness of mankind 
finds no recognition in their observance.  Therefore it is our duty in 
this radiant century to investigate the essentials of divine religion, 
seek the realities underlying the oneness of the world of humanity and 
discover the source of fellowship and agreement which will unite mankind 
in the heavenly bond of love.  This unity is the radiance of eternity, 
the divine spirituality, the effulgence of God and the bounty of the 
Kingdom.  We must investigate the divine source of these heavenly 
bestowals and adhere unto them steadfastly.  For if we remain fettered 
and restricted by human inventions and dogmas, day by day the 
world of mankind will be degraded, day by day warfare and strife will 
increase and satanic forces converge toward the destruction of the 
human race. 
     If love and agreement are manifest in a single family, that family 
will advance, become illumined and spiritual; but if enmity and 
hatred exist within it destruction and dispersion are inevitable.  This 
is likewise true of a city.  If those who dwell within it manifest a spirit 
of accord and fellowship it will progress steadily and human conditions 
become brighter whereas through enmity and strife it will be 
degraded and its inhabitants scattered.  In the same way the people 
of a nation develop and advance toward civilization and enlightenment 
through love and accord, and are disintegrated by war and strife.  
Finally, this is true of humanity itself in the aggregate.  When love is 
realized and the ideal spiritual bonds unite the hearts of men, the 
whole human race will be uplifted, the world will continually grow 
more spiritual and radiant and the happiness and tranquillity of mankind 
be immeasurably increased.  Warfare and strife will be uprooted, 
disagreement and dissension pass away and universal peace unite the 
nations and peoples of the world.  All mankind will dwell together as 
one family, blend as the waves of one sea, shine as stars of one firmament 
and appear as fruits of the same tree.  This is the happiness and 
felicity of humankind.  This is the illumination of man, the glory 
eternal and life everlasting; this is the divine bestowal.  I desire this 
station for you and I pray God that the people of America may 
achieve this great end in order that the virtue of this democracy may 
be insured and their names be glorified eternally.  
 
+P20 
                         UNIVERSAL PEACE 
 
     Today there is no greater glory for man than that of service in 
the cause of the "Most Great Peace".  Peace is light whereas 
war is darkness.  Peace is life; war is death.  Peace is guidance; 
war is error.  Peace is the foundation of God; war is satanic institution.  
Peace is the illumination of the world of humanity; war is the destroyer 
of human foundations.  When we consider outcomes in the 
world of existence we find that peace and fellowship are factors of 
upbuilding and betterment whereas war and strife are the causes of 
destruction and disintegration.  All created things are expressions of 
the affinity and cohesion of elementary substances, and non-existence 
is the absence of their attraction and agreement.  Various elements 
unite harmoniously in composition but when these elements become 
discordant, repelling each other, decomposition and non-existence 
result.  Everything partakes of this nature and is subject to this 
principle, for the creative foundation in all its degrees and kingdoms is 
an expression or outcome of love.  Consider the restlessness and 
agitation of the human world today because of war.  Peace is health 
and construction; war is disease and dissolution.  When the banner of 
truth is raised, peace becomes the cause of the welfare and advancement 
of the human world.  In all cycles and ages war has been a factor 
of derangement and discomfort whereas peace and brotherhood have 
brought security and consideration of human interests.  This distinction 
is especially pronounced in the present world conditions, for 
warfare in former centuries had not attained the degree of savagery 
and destructiveness which now characterizes it.  If two nations were 
at war in olden times, ten or twenty thousand would be sacrificed 
but in this century the destruction of one hundred thousand lives in a 
day is quite possible.  So perfected has the science of killing become 
and so efficient the means and instruments of its accomplishment that 
a whole nation can be obliterated in a short time.  Therefore comparison 
with the methods and results of ancient warfare is out of the 
question.  
     According to an intrinsic law, all phenomena of being attain to a 
summit and degree of consummation, after which a new order and 
condition is established.  As the instruments and science of war have 
reached the degree of thoroughness and proficiency, it is hoped that 
the transformation of the human world is at hand and that in the 
coming centuries all the energies and inventions of man will be utilized 
 
+P21 
in promoting the interests of peace and brotherhood.  Therefore may 
this esteemed and worthy society for the establishment of international 
peace+F1 be confirmed in its sincere intentions and empowered 
by God.  Then will it hasten the time when the banner of universal 
agreement will be raised and international welfare will be proclaimed 
and consummated so that the darkness which now encompasses the 
world shall pass away....  
     The powers of earth cannot withstand the privileges and bestowals 
which God has ordained for this great and glorious century.  
It is a need and exigency of the time.  Man can withstand anything 
except that which is divinely intended and indicated for the age and 
its requirements.  Now, Praise be to God! in all countries of the 
world, lovers of peace are to be found and these principles are being 
spread among mankind, especially in this country.  Praise be to God!  
this thought is prevailing and souls are continually arising as defenders 
of the oneness of humanity, endeavoring to assist and establish international 
peace.  There is no doubt that this wonderful democracy will 
be able to realize it and the banner of international agreement will be 
unfurled here to spread onward and outward among all the nations 
of the world.  I give thanks to God that I find you imbued with such 
susceptibilities and lofty aspirations and I hope that you will be the 
means of spreading this light to all men.  Thus may the Sun of Reality 
shine upon the East and West.  The enveloping clouds shall pass away 
and the heat of the divine rays will dispel the mist.  The reality of man 
shall develop and come forth as the image of God his creator.  The 
thoughts of man shall take such upward flight that former accomplishments 
shall appear as the play of children;--for the ideas and 
beliefs of the past and the prejudices regarding race and religion have 
ever been lowering and destructive to human evolution.  I am most 
hopeful that in this century these lofty thoughts shall be conducive 
to human welfare.  Let this century be the sun of previous centuries 
the effulgences of which shall last forever, so that in times to come they 
shall glorify the twentieth century, saying the twentieth century was 
the century of lights, the twentieth century was the century of life, 
the twentieth century was the century of international peace, the 
twentieth century was the century of divine bestowals and the 
twentieth century has left traces which shall last forever.

                    THE PROPHETS AND WAR 
 
     When we review history from the beginning down to the 
present day we find that strife and warfare have prevailed 
throughout the human world.  Wars, religious, racial or 
political, have arisen from human ignorance, misunderstanding and 
lack of education.  We will first consider religious strife and conflict.  
     It is evident that the divine prophets have appeared in the world 
to establish love and agreement among mankind.  They have been 
the shepherds and not the wolves.  The shepherd comes forth to gather 
and lead his flock and not to disperse them by creating strife.  Every 
divine shepherd has assembled a flock which had formerly been 
scattered.  Among the shepherds was His Holiness Moses.  At a time 
when the tribes of Israel were wandering and dispersed, he assembled, 
united and educated them to higher degrees of capacity and progress 
until they passed out of the wilderness of discipline into the holy land 
of possession.  He transformed their degradation into glory, changed 
their poverty into wealth and replaced their vices by virtues until 
they rose to such a zenith that the splendor of the sovereignty of 
Solomon was made possible and the fame of their civilization extended 
to the East and the West.  It is evident therefore that His 
Holiness was a divine shepherd for he gathered the tribes of Israel 
together and united them in the power and strength of a great nationhood.  
     When the Messianic star of Jesus Christ dawned, he declared 
he had come to gather together the lost tribes or scattered sheep of 
Moses.  He not only shepherded the flock of Israel, but brought together 
people of Chaldea, Egypt, Syria, ancient Assyria and Phoenicia.  
These people were in a state of utmost hostility, thirsting for the 
blood of each other with the ferocity of animals; but His Holiness 
Jesus Christ brought them together, cemented and united them in 
his cause and established such a bond of love among them that enmity 
and warfare were abandoned.  It is evident therefore that the 
divine teachings are intended to create a bond of unity in the human 
world and establish the foundations of love and fellowship among 
mankind.  Divine religion is not a cause for discord and disagreement.  
If religion becomes the source of antagonism and strife, the absence of 
religion is to be preferred.  Religion is meant to be the quickening life 
of the body politic; if it be the cause of death to humanity, its nonexistence 
would be a blessing and benefit to man.  Therefore in this 
 
+P23 
day the divine teachings must be sought, for they are the remedies 
for the present conditions of the world of humanity.  
     At a time when the Arabian tribes and nomadic peoples were 
widely separated, living in the deserts under lawless conditions, strife 
and bloodshed continual among them, no tribe free from the menace 
of attack and destruction by another,--at such a critical time Mohammed 
appeared.  He gathered these wild tribes of the desert together, 
reconciled, united and caused them to agree so that enmity 
and warfare ceased.  The Arabian nation immediately advanced until 
its dominion extended westward to Spain and Andalusia.  
     From these facts and premises we may conclude that the establishing 
of the divine religions is for peace, not for war and the 
shedding of blood.  Inasmuch as all are founded upon one reality which 
is love and unity, the wars and dissensions which have characterized 
the history of religion have been due to imitations and superstitions 
which arise afterward.  Religion is reality and reality is one.  The 
fundamentals of the religion of God are therefore one in reality.  There 
is neither difference nor change in the fundamentals.  Variance is 
caused by blind imitations, prejudices and adherence to forms which 
appear later, and inasmuch as these differ, discord and strife result.  
If the religions of the world would forsake these causes of difficulty 
and seek the fundamentals, all would agree, and strife and dissension 
would pass away; for religion and reality are one and not multiple.  
     Other wars are caused by purely imaginary racial differences; 
for humanity is one kind, one race and progeny inhabiting the same 
globe.  In the creative plan there is no racial distinction and separation 
such as Frenchman, Englishman, American, German, Italian or 
Spaniard; all belong to one household.  These boundaries and distinctions 
are human and artificial, not natural and original.  All mankind 
are the fruits of one tree, flowers of the same garden, waves of one 
sea.  In the animal kingdom no such distinction and separation are 
observed.  The sheep of the East and the sheep of the West would 
associate peacefully.  The oriental flock would not look surprised as if 
saying, "These are sheep of the Occident; they do not belong to our 
country."  All would gather in harmony and enjoy the same pasture 
without evidence of local or racial distinction.  The birds of different 
countries mingle in friendliness.  We find these virtues in the animal 
kingdom.  Shall man deprive himself of these virtues?  Man is endowed 
with superior reasoning power and the faculty of perception; he is the 
manifestation of divine bestowals.  Shall racial ideas prevail and obscure 
the creative purpose of unity in his kingdom?  Shall he say, "I am 
a German," "I am a Frenchman," or an "Englishman" and declare 
war because of this imaginary and human distinction?  God forbid!  
 
+P24 
This earth is one household and the nativity of all humanity; therefore 
the human race should ignore distinctions and boundaries which 
are artificial and conducive to disagreement and hostility.  We have 
come from the East.  Praise be to God! we find this continent prosperous, 
the climate salubrious and delightful, the inhabitants genial and 
courteous, the government equable and just.  Shall we entertain any 
other thought and feeling than that of love for you?  Shall we say, 
"This is not our native land, therefore everything is objectionable?"  
This would be gross ignorance to which man must not subject himself.  
Man is endowed with powers to investigate reality, and the reality is 
that humanity is one in kind and equal in the creative plan.  Therefore 
false distinctions of race and nativity which are factors and causes of 
warfare must be abandoned.  
     Consider what is happening+F1 in Tripoli; how the poor are being 
killed and the blood of the helpless is being shed upon both sides; 
children made fatherless, fathers lamenting the death of their sons, 
mothers bewailing the loss of dear ones.  And what is the benefit after 
all?  Nothing conceivable.  Is it therefore justifiable?  The domestic 
animals do not manifest hatred and cruelty toward each other; that is 
the attribute of the wild and ferocious beasts.  In a flock of one thousand 
sheep you will witness no bloodshed.  Numberless species of birds are 
peaceful in flocks.  Wolves, lions, tigers are ferocious because it is their 
natural and necessary means for obtaining food.  Man has no need of 
such ferocity; his food is provided in other ways.  Therefore it is 
evident that warfare, cruelty and bloodshed in the kingdom of man 
are caused by human greed, hatred and selfishness.  The kings and 
rulers of nations enjoy luxury and ease in their palaces and send the 
common people to the battlefield; offer them as the food and targets 
of cannon.  Each day they invent new instruments for the more complete 
destruction of the foundations of the human race.  They are 
callous and merciless toward their fellow-creatures.  What shall atone 
for the sufferings and grief of mothers who have so tenderly cared for 
their sons?  What sleepless nights they have spent and what days of 
devotion and love they have given to bring their children to maturity!  
Yet the savagery of these warring rulers causes great numbers of their 
victims to be torn and mutilated in a day.  What ignorance and degradation, 
yea even greater than the ferocious beasts themselves!  For 
a wolf will carry away and devour one sheep at a time whereas an 
ambitious tyrant may cause the death of one hundred thousand men 
in a battle and glory in his military prowess saying, "I am commander-in-chief; 
I have won this mighty victory."  Consider the ignorance and 
inconsistency of the human race.  If a man kills another, no matter 
 
+F1 1912.  
 
+P25 
what the cause may be, he is pronounced a murderer, imprisoned or 
executed; but the brutal oppressor who has slain one hundred thousand 
is idolized as a hero, conqueror or military genius.  A man steals a 
small sum of money; he is called a thief and sent to the penitentiary; 
but the military leader who invades and pillages a whole kingdom is 
acclaimed heroic and a mighty man of valor.  How base and ignorant 
is man!  
     In Persia previous to the middle of the nineteenth century, 
among the various tribes and peoples, sects and denominations there 
existed the greatest animosity, strife and hatred.  At that time too all 
the other nations of the East were in the same condition.  Religionists 
were hostile and bigoted, sects were at enmity, races hated each other, 
tribes were constantly at war; everywhere antagonism and conflict 
prevailed.  Men shunned and were suspicious of each other.  The man 
who could kill a number of his fellow-creatures was glorified for his 
heroism and strength.  Among religionists it was esteemed a praiseworthy 
deed to take the life of one who held an opposite belief.  At this 
time &amp;Baha'u'llah arose and declared his mission.  He founded the oneness 
of the world of humanity, proclaimed that all are servants of the 
loving and merciful God who has created, nourished and provided 
for all, therefore why should men be unjust and unkind to each other, 
showing forth that which is contrary to God?  As He loves us why 
should we entertain animosity and hate?  If God did not love all He 
would not have created, trained and provided for all.  Loving-kindness 
is the divine policy.  Shall we consider human policy and attitude 
superior to the wisdom and policy of God?  This would be inconceivable, 
impossible.  Therefore we must emulate and follow the divine 
policy, dealing with each other in the utmost love and tenderness.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah declared the "Most Great Peace" and international 
arbitration.  He voiced these principles in numerous epistles which 
were circulated broadcast throughout the East.  He wrote to all the 
kings and rulers encouraging, advising and admonishing them in 
regard to the establishment of peace; making it evident by conclusive 
proofs that the happiness and glory of humanity can only be assured 
through disarmament and arbitration.  This was nearly fifty years ago.  
Because he promulgated the message of Universal Peace and international 
agreement, the kings of the Orient arose against him for they 
did not find their personal and national benefits advanced by his 
admonition and teaching.  They persecuted him bitterly, inflicted 
upon him every torment, imprisoned, bastinadoed, banished him and 
eventually confined him in a fortress.  Then they arose against his 
followers.  For the establishment of international peace the blood of 
twenty thousand &amp;Baha'is was spilt.  Their homes were destroyed, their 
 
+P26 
children made captives and their possessions pillaged yet none of these 
people waxed cold or wavered in devotion.  Even to this day the 
&amp;Baha'is are persecuted and quite recently a number were killed, for 
wherever they are found they put forth the greatest efforts to establish 
the peace of the world.  They not only promulgate principles; they are 
people of action.  
     In Persia today through the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah you will 
find people of various religious beliefs and denominations living together 
in the utmost peace and agreement.  The former enmities and 
hatred have passed away and they exercise the utmost love toward all 
mankind for they realize and know that all are the creatures and 
servants of one God.  This is directly due to the divine teachings.  At 
most it is simply this; that the ignorant must be educated, the ailing 
must be healed, those who are as children in the scale of development 
must be helped to reach the age of maturity.  We must not be unfriendly 
to any one because of ignorance, neither must we reject the 
immature or turn away from the sick but administer the remedy for 
each human need until all are united in the providence of God.  Therefore 
it is evident that the essential foundations of the divine religions 
are unity and love.  If religion be productive of discord among mankind 
it is a destroyer and not divine for religion implies unity and 
binding together and not separation.  Mere knowledge of principles 
is not sufficient.  We all know and admit that justice is good but there 
is need of volition and action to carry out and manifest it.  For example, 
we might think it good to build a church but simply thinking 
of it as a good thing will not help its erection.  The ways and means 
must be provided; we must will to build it and then proceed with the 
construction.  All of us know that international peace is good, that it is 
conducive to human welfare and the glory of man but volition and 
action are necessary before it can be established.  Action is the essential.  
Inasmuch as this century is a century of light, capacity for action is 
assured to mankind.  Necessarily the divine principles will be spread 
among men until the time of action arrives.  Surely this has been so and 
truly the time and conditions are ripe for action now.  All men know 
that verily war is the destroyer of human foundations and in every 
country of the world this is admitted and apparent.  I find the United 
States of America an exceedingly progressive nation, the government 
just, the people in a state of readiness and the principle of equality 
established to an extraordinary degree.  Therefore it is my hope that 
inasmuch as the standard of international peace must be upraised it 
may be upraised upon this continent, for this nation is more deserving 
and has greater capacity for such an initial step than any other.  If 
other nations should attempt to do this the motive will be misunderstood.  
 
+P27 
For instance, if Great Britain should declare for international 
peace it will be said that it has been done to insure the safety of her 
colonies.  If France should hoist the standard other nations will declare 
some hidden diplomatic policy underlies the action; Russia would be 
suspected of national designs if the first step were taken by that 
people, and so on with all the European and eastern governments.  
But the United States of America could not be accused of any such 
selfish interest.  Your government has, strictly speaking, no colonies to 
protect.  You are not endeavoring to extend your domain nor have you 
need of territorial expansion.  Therefore if America takes the first step 
toward the establishing of world peace it is certain to be ascribed to 
unselfishness and altruism.  The world will say, "There is no other 
motive than altruism and service to humanity in this action by the 
United States."  Therefore it is my hope that you may stand forth as 
the first herald of peace and hoist this banner; for this banner will be 
hoisted.  Raise it aloft, for you are the most qualified and deserving of 
nations.  The other countries await this summons, expect this call to 
the standard of reconciliation, for the whole world is distressed because 
of the excessive burden and irreparable damage of war.  Taxes 
are levied to meet its drain.  Every year the burden increases and the 
people have come to their end.  Just now+F1 Europe is a battlefield of 
ammunition ready for a spark; and one spark will set aflame the whole 
world.  Before these complications and cataclysmic events happen, 
take the step to prevent it.  
     The foundations of all the divine religions are peace and agreement, 
but misunderstandings and ignorance have developed.  If these 
are caused to disappear you will see that all the religious agencies will 
work for peace and promulgate the oneness of humankind.  For the 
foundation of all is reality and reality is not multiple or divisible.  
His Holiness Moses founded it, His Holiness Jesus raised its tent, and 
its brilliant light has shone forth in all the religions.  His Holiness 
&amp;Baha'u'llah proclaimed this one reality and spread the message of the 
"Most Great Peace".  Even in prison he rested not until he lighted 
this lamp in the East.  Praise be to God! all who have accepted his 
teachings are lovers of peace, peacemakers ready to sacrifice their lives 
and expend their possessions for it.  Now let this standard be upraised 
in the West and many will respond to the call.  America has become 
renowned for her discoveries, inventions and artistic skill, famous for 
equity of government and stupendous undertakings; now may she 
also become noted and celebrated as the herald and messenger of 
Universal Peace.  Let this be her mission and undertaking and may its 
blessed impetus spread to all countries.  I pray for all of you that you 
may render this service to the world of humanity.  
 
+F1 1912.  
 
+P28 
                    FOUNDATIONS OF WORLD UNITY 
 
     There is not one soul whose conscience does not testify that 
in this day there is no more important matter in the world 
than that of Universal Peace.  Every just one bears witness 
to this and adores that esteemed Assembly+F1 because its aim is that this 
darkness may be turned into light, this bloodthirstiness into kindness, 
this torment into bliss, this hardship into ease and this enmity and 
hatred into fellowship and love.  Therefore the effort of those esteemed 
souls is worthy of praise and commendation.  
     But the wise souls who are aware of the essential relationships 
emanating from the realities of things consider that one single matter 
cannot, by itself, influence the human reality as it ought and should, 
for until the minds of men become united, no important matter can 
be accomplished.  At present Universal Peace is a matter of great importance, 
but unity of conscience is essential, so that the foundation 
of this matter may become secure, its establishment firm and its edifice 
strong.  
     Therefore His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah fifty years ago, expounded 
this question of Universal Peace at a time when he was confined in the 
fortress of Akka and was wronged and imprisoned.  He wrote about 
this matter of Universal Peace to all the great sovereigns of the world, 
and established it among his friends in the Orient.  The horizon of the 
East was in utter darkness, nations displayed the utmost hatred and 
enmity towards each other, religions thirsted for each other's blood, 
and it was darkness upon darkness.  At such a time His Holiness 
&amp;Baha'u'llah shone forth like the sun from the horizon of the East and 
illumined Persia with the light of these teachings.  
     Among his teachings was the declaration of Universal Peace.  
People of different nations, religions and sects, who followed him, 
came together to such an extent that remarkable gatherings were 
instituted, consisting of the various nations and religions of the East.  
Every soul who entered those gatherings saw but one nation, one 
pathway, one teaching, one order; for the teachings of His Holiness 
&amp;Baha'u'llah were not limited to the establishment of Universal Peace.  
They embraced many teachings which supplemented and supported 
that of Universal Peace.  
     Among these teachings is the independent investigation of reality, 
 
+F1 The members of the Central Organization for a Durable Peace, The Hague; to 
+F1 whom this Tablet was sent in reply to several letters.  
 
+P29 
so that the world of humanity might be saved from the darkness of 
imitation and attain to the truth; might tear off and cast away this 
ragged and outworn garment of one thousand years ago and put on 
the robe woven in the utmost purity and holiness in the loom of 
reality.  As reality is one and cannot admit of multiplicity, therefore 
different opinions must ultimately become fused into one.  
     And among the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah is the 
oneness of the world of humanity; that all human beings are the 
sheep of God and He is the kind Shepherd.  This Shepherd is kind to 
all the sheep, because He created them all, trained them, provided for 
them and protected them.  There is no doubt that the Shepherd is 
kind to all the sheep; and should there be among these sheep ignorant 
ones, they must be educated; if there be children, they must be 
trained until they reach maturity; if there be sick ones, they must be 
healed.  There must be no hatred and enmity, for as by a kind physician 
these ignorant, sick ones should be treated.  
     And among the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah is that 
religion must be the cause of fellowship and love.  If it becomes the 
cause of estrangement, then it is not needed, for religion is like a 
remedy:  if it aggravates the disease, then it becomes unnecessary.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that religious, racial, 
political, economic and patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of 
humanity.  As long as these prejudices prevail, the world of humanity 
will have no rest.  For a period of six thousand years history informs 
us about the world of humanity.  During these six thousand years the 
world of humanity has not been free from war, strife, murder and 
bloodthirstiness.  In every period war has been waged in one country or 
another, and that war was due to either religious prejudice, racial 
prejudice, political prejudice or patriotic prejudice.  It has, therefore, 
been ascertained and proved that all prejudices are destructive of the 
human edifice.  As long as these prejudices persist, the struggle for 
existence must remain dominant, and bloodthirstiness and rapacity 
continue.  Therefore, even as was the case in the past, the world of 
humanity cannot be saved from the darkness of nature, and cannot 
attain illumination, except through the abandonment of prejudices 
and the acquisition of the morals of the Kingdom....  
     And among the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah is the 
origination of one language that may be spread universally among 
the people.  This teaching was revealed from the pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in order that this universal language may eliminate misunderstandings 
from among mankind.  
     And among the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah is the 
equality of women and men.  The world of humanity has two wings--
 
+P30 
one is woman and the other man.  Not until both wings are equally 
developed can the bird fly.  Should one wing remain weak, flight is 
impossible.  Not until the world of woman becomes equal to the world 
of man in the acquisition of virtues and perfections, can success and 
prosperity be attained as they ought to be.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is voluntary sharing of 
one's property with others among mankind.  This voluntary sharing 
is greater than equality, and consists in this:  that man should not 
prefer himself to others, but rather should sacrifice his life and property 
for others.  But this should not be introduced by coercion so that 
it becomes a law and man is compelled to follow it.  Nay, rather should 
man voluntarily and of his own choice sacrifice his property and life 
for others, and spend willingly for the poor, just as is done in Persia 
among the &amp;Baha'is.  
     And among the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah is man's 
freedom:  that through the Ideal Power he should be emancipated 
and free from the captivity of the world of nature; for as long as man is 
captive to nature he is a ferocious animal, as the struggle for existence 
is one of the exigencies of the world of nature.  This matter of the 
struggle for existence is the fountain-head of all calamities, and is the 
supreme affliction.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that religion is a 
mighty bulwark.  If the edifice of religion shakes and totters, commotion 
and chaos will ensue and the order of things will be utterly 
upset, for in the world of mankind there are two safeguards that 
protect man from wrongdoing.  One is the law which punishes the 
criminal; but the law prevents only the manifest crime and not the 
concealed sin; whereas the ideal safeguard, namely, the religion of 
God, prevents both the manifest and the concealed crime, trains man, 
educates morals, compels the adoption of virtues and is the all-inclusive 
power which guarantees the felicity of the world of mankind.  
But by religion is meant that which is ascertained by investigation 
and not that which is based on mere imitation, the foundation of 
divine religions and not human imitations.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is that although material 
civilization is one of the means for the progress of the world 
of mankind, yet until it becomes combined with divine civilization 
the desired result, which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained.  
Consider!  These battleships that reduce a city to ruins within the 
space of an hour are the result of material civilization; likewise the 
Krupp guns, the Mauser rifles, dynamite, submarines, torpedo boats, 
armed aircraft and bombing aeroplanes--all these weapons of war are 
malignant fruits of material civilization.  Had material civilization 
 
+P31 
been combined with divine civilization, these fiery weapons would 
never have been invented.  Nay, rather human energy would have 
been wholly devoted to useful inventions and concentrated on praiseworthy 
discoveries.  Material civilization is like a globe of glass.  
Divine civilization is the light itself, and the glass without the light is 
dark.  Material civilization is like the body.  No matter how infinitely 
graceful, elegant and beautiful it may be, it is dead.  Divine civilization 
is like the spirit, and the body gets its life from the spirit, otherwise it 
becomes a corpse.  It has thus been made evident that the world of 
mankind is in need of the breaths of the Holy Spirit.  Without the 
spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, and without this light the 
world of mankind is in utter darkness.  For the world of nature is an 
animal world.  Until man is born again from the world of nature--that 
is to say, becomes detached from the world of nature, he is essentially 
an animal, and it is the teachings of God which convert this animal 
into a human soul.  
     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the promotion of 
education.  Every child must be instructed in sciences as much as is 
necessary.  If the parents are able to provide the expenses of this 
education, it is all right; otherwise the community must provide the 
means for the teaching of that child.  
     And among the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah are justice 
and right.  Until these are realized on the plane of existence, all things 
will be in disorder and remain imperfect.  The world of mankind is a 
world of oppression and cruelty, and a realm of aggression and error.  
     In fine, such teachings are numerous.  These manifold principles, 
which constitute the greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and are 
of the bounties of the Merciful, must be added to the matter of 
Universal Peace and combined with it, so that results may accrue.  
Otherwise the realization of Universal Peace in the world of mankind 
is difficult.  As the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah are combined 
with Universal Peace, they are like a table provided with every kind 
of fresh and delicious food.  Every soul can find at that table of infinite 
bounty that which he desires.  If the question is restricted to 
Universal Peace alone, the remarkable results which are expected and 
desired will not be attained.  The scope of Universal Peace must be 
such that all the communities and religions may find their highest 
wish realized in it.  At present the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah 
are such that all the communities of the world, whether religious, 
political or ethical, ancient or modern, find in the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
the expression of their highest wish.  
     For example, the people of religions find, in the teachings of His 
Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah, the establishment of Universal Religion--a 
 
+P32 
religion that perfectly conforms with present conditions, which in 
reality effects the immediate cure of the incurable disease, which 
relieves every pain and bestows the infallible antidote for every deadly 
poison.  For if we wish to arrange and organize the world of mankind 
in accordance with the present religious imitations and thereby to 
establish the felicity of mankind, it is impossible and impracticable:  
for example, the enforcement of the laws of the Old Testament and 
also of the other religions in accordance with present imitations.  But 
the essential basis of all the divine religions which pertains to the 
virtues of the world of mankind and is the foundation of the welfare 
of the world of man, is found in the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in the most perfect presentation.  
     Similarly, with regard to the people who clamor for freedom:  the 
moderate freedom which guarantees the welfare of the world of man, 
is found in the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     So with regard to political parties:  that which is the greatest 
policy directing the world of mankind, nay, rather the divine policy, 
is found in the teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Likewise with regard to the party of "equality" which seeks the 
solution of the economic problems:  until now all proposed solutions 
have proved impracticable except the economic proposals in the 
teachings of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah, which are practicable and cause 
no distress to society.  
     So with the other parties:  when ye look deeply into this matter, 
ye will discover that the highest aims of those parties are found in the 
teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  These teachings constitute the all-inclusive 
power among all men, and are practicable....  
     For example, the question of Universal Peace, about which His 
Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah says that the Supreme Tribunal must be established; 
although the League of Nations has been brought into 
existence, yet it is incapable of establishing Universal Peace.  But the 
Supreme Tribunal which His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah has described will 
fulfill this sacred task with the utmost might and power.  And his plan 
is this:  that the national assemblies of each country and nation--that 
is to say, their parliaments--should elect two or three persons who 
are the choicest men of that nation, and are well informed concerning 
international laws and the relations between governments and aware 
of the essential needs of the world of humanity in this day.  The number 
of these representatives should be in proportion to the number of 
inhabitants of that country.  The election of these souls who are 
chosen by the national assembly--that is, the parliament--must be 
confirmed by the upper house, the congress and the cabinet and also 
by the president or monarch so that these persons may be the elected 
 
+P33 
ones of all the nation and the government.  From among these people 
the members of the Supreme Tribunal will be elected, and all mankind 
will thus have a share therein, for every one of these delegates is fully 
representative of his nation.  When the Supreme Tribunal gives a 
ruling on any international question, either unanimously or by majority 
rule, there will no longer be any pretext for the plaintiff or 
ground of objection for the defendant.  In case any of the governments 
or nations, in the execution of the irrefutable decision of the Supreme 
Tribunal, be negligent or dilatory, the rest of the nations will rise up 
against it, because all the governments and nations of the world are 
the supporters of this Supreme Tribunal.  Consider what a firm 
foundation this is!  But by a limited and restricted League the purpose 
will not be realized as it ought and should.  This is the truth about the 
situation which has been stated....  
     Today nothing but the power of the Word of God which encompasses 
the realities of things can bring the thoughts, minds, hearts 
and spirits under the shade of one Tree.  He is the potent in all things, 
the vivifier of souls, the preserver and the controller of the world of 
mankind.  Praise be to God, in this day the light of the Word of God 
has shone forth upon all regions; and from all sects, communities, 
nations, tribes, peoples, religions and denominations, souls have 
gathered together under the shadow of the Word of Oneness, and have 
in the utmost fellowship united and harmonized!

                         RACIAL HARMONY 
 
     Today I am most happy, for I see here+F1 a gathering of the 
servants of God.  I see the white and colored people together.  
In the estimation of God there is no distinction of color; all 
are one in the color and beauty of servitude to Him.  Color is not important; 
the heart is all-important.  It matters not what the exterior 
may be if the heart be pure and white within.  God does not behold 
differences of hue and complexion; He looks at the hearts.  He whose 
morals and virtues are praiseworthy is preferred in the presence of 
God; he who is devoted to the Kingdom is most beloved.  In the realm 
of genesis and creation the question of color is of least importance.  
     The mineral kingdom abounds with many-colored substances 
and compositions but we find no strife among them on that account.  
In the kingdom of the plant and vegetable, distinct and variegated 
hues exist but the fruit and flowers are not in conflict for that reason.  
Nay, rather, the very fact that there is difference and variety lends a 
charm to the garden.  If all were of the same color the effect would be 
monotonous and depressing.  When you enter a rose-garden the wealth 
of color and variety of floral forms spread before you a picture of 
wonder and beauty.  The world of humanity is like a garden and the 
various races are the flowers which constitute its adornment and 
decoration.  In the animal kingdom also we find variety of color.  See 
how the doves differ in beauty yet they live together in perfect peace, 
and love each other.  They do not make difference of color a cause of 
discord and strife.  They view each other as the same species and kind.  
They know they are one in kind.  Often a white dove soars aloft with a 
black one.  Throughout the animal kingdom we do not find the 
creatures separated because of color.  They recognize unity of species 
and oneness of kind.  If we do not find color distinction drawn in a 
kingdom of lower intelligence and reason, how can it be justified among 
human beings, especially when we know that all have come from the 
same source and belong to the same household?  In origin and intention 
of creation mankind is one.  Distinctions of race and color have arisen 
afterward.  
     Therefore today I am exceedingly glad that both white and colored 
people have gathered here and I hope the time will come when 
they shall live together in the utmost peace, unity and friendship.  I 
wish to say one thing of importance to both in order that the white 
 
+F1 Howard University.  
 
+P35 
race may be just and kind to the colored and that the colored race 
may in turn be grateful and appreciative toward the white.  The great 
proclamation of liberty and emancipation from slavery was made 
upon this continent.  A long bloody war was fought by white men 
for the sake of colored people.  These white men forfeited their possessions 
and sacrificed their lives by thousands in order that colored 
men might be freed from bondage.  The colored population of the 
United States of America are possibly not fully informed of the wide-reaching 
effect of this freedom and emancipation upon their colored 
brethren in Asia and Africa where even more terrible conditions of 
slavery existed.  Influenced and impelled by the example of the United 
States, the European powers proclaimed universal liberty to the 
colored race and slavery ceased to exist.  This effort and accomplishment 
by the white nations should never be lost sight of.  Both races 
should rejoice in gratitude, for the institution of liberty and equality 
here became the cause of liberating your fellow-beings elsewhere.  The 
colored people of this country are especially fortunate, for, Praise be to 
God! conditions here are so much higher than in the East and comparatively 
few differences exist in the possibility of equal attainments 
with the white race.  May both develop toward the highest degree of 
equality and altruism.  May you be drawn together in friendship and 
may extraordinary development make brotherhood a reality and truth.  
I pray in your behalf that there shall be no name other than that of 
humanity among you.  
     Therefore strive earnestly and put forth your greatest endeavor 
toward the accomplishment of this fellowship and the cementing of 
this bond of brotherhood between you.  Such an attainment is not 
possible without will and effort on the part of each; from one, expressions 
of gratitude and appreciation; from the other kindliness and 
recognition of equality.  Each one should endeavor to develop and 
assist the other toward mutual advancement.  This is possible only 
by conjoining of effort and inclination.  Love and unity will be fostered 
between you, thereby bringing about the oneness of mankind.  For 
the accomplishment of unity between the colored and whites will be 
an assurance of the world's peace.  Then racial prejudice, national prejudice, 
limited patriotism and religious bias will pass away and remain 
no longer.  I am pleased to see you at this gathering, white and dark, and 
I praise God that I have had this opportunity of seeing you loving 
each other, for this is the means of the glory of humanity.  This is the 
means of the good-pleasure of God and of eternal bliss in His Kingdom.  
Therefore I pray in your behalf that you may attain to the 
fullest of love and that the day may come when all differences between 
you may disappear.  
 
+P36 
                    THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE 
 
     What could be better before God than thinking of the poor?  
For the poor are beloved by our heavenly Father.  When His 
Holiness Christ came upon the earth those who believed in 
him and followed him were the poor and lowly, showing the poor 
were near to God.  When a rich man believes and follows the Manifestation 
of God it is a proof that his wealth is not an obstacle and does 
not prevent him from attaining the pathway of salvation.  After he has 
been tested and tried it will be seen whether his possessions are a 
hindrance in his religious life.  But the poor are especially beloved of 
God.  Their lives are full of difficulties, their trials continual, their 
hopes are in God alone.  Therefore you must assist the poor as much 
as possible, even by sacrifice of yourself.  No deed of man is greater 
before God than helping the poor.  Spiritual conditions are not dependent 
upon the possession of worldly treasures or the absence of 
them.  When physically destitute, spiritual thoughts are more likely.  
Poverty is stimulus toward God.  Each one of you must have great 
consideration for the poor and render them assistance.  Organize in an 
effort to help them and prevent increase of poverty.  The greatest 
means for prevention is that whereby the laws of the community will 
be so framed and enacted that it will not be possible for a few to be 
millionaires and many destitute.  One of &amp;Baha'u'llah's teachings is the 
adjustment of means of livelihood in human society.  Under this adjustment 
there can be no extremes in human conditions as regards 
wealth and sustenance.  For the community needs financier, farmer 
merchant and laborer just as an army must be composed of commander, 
officers and privates.  All cannot be commanders; all cannot 
be officers or privates.  Each in his station in the social fabric must be 
competent; each in his function according to ability; but justness of 
opportunity for all.  
     Lycurgus, king of Sparta, who lived long before the day of Christ, 
conceived the idea of absolute equality in government.  He proclaimed 
laws by which all the people of Sparta were classified into certain 
divisions.  Each division had its separate rights and function.  First, 
farmers and tillers of the soil.  Second, artisans and merchants.  Third, 
leaders or grandees.  Under the laws of Lycurgus the latter were not 
required to engage in any labor or vocation but it was incumbent 
upon them to defend the country in case of war and invasion.  Then he 
divided Sparta into nine thousand equal parts or provinces, appointing 
 
+P37 
nine thousand leaders or grandees to protect them.  In this way the 
farmers of each province were assured of protection but each farmer 
was compelled to pay a tax to support the grandee of that province.  
The farmers and merchants were not obliged to defend the country.  
In lieu of labor the grandees received the taxes.  Lycurgus in order to 
establish this forever as a law, brought nine thousand grandees together, 
told them he was going upon a long journey and wished this 
form of government to remain effective until his return.  They swore an 
oath to protect and preserve his law.  He then left his kingdom, went 
into voluntary exile and never came back.  No man ever made such a 
sacrifice to insure equality among his fellowmen.  A few years passed 
and the whole system of government he had founded collapsed, 
although established upon such a just and wise basis.  
     Difference of capacity in human individuals is fundamental.  It is 
impossible for all to be alike, all to be equal, all to be wise.  &amp;Baha'u'llah 
has revealed principles and laws which will accomplish the adjustment 
of varying human capacities.  He has said that whatsoever is 
possible of accomplishment in human government will be effected 
through these principles.  When the laws he has instituted are carried 
out there will be no millionaires possible in the community and likewise 
no extremely poor.  This will be effected and regulated by adjusting 
the different degrees of human capacity.  The fundamental basis 
of the community is agriculture, tillage of the soil.  All must be producers.  
Each person in the community whose income is equal to his 
individual producing capacity shall be exempt from taxation.  But if 
his income is greater than his needs he must pay a tax until an adjustment 
is effected.  That is to say, a man's capacity for production and 
his needs will be equalized and reconciled through taxation.  If his 
production exceeds he will pay no tax; if his necessities exceed his 
production he shall receive an amount sufficient to equalize or adjust.  
Therefore taxation will be proportionate to capacity and production 
and there will be no poor in the community.  
 
+P38 
                         COOPERATION 
 
     It seems as though all creatures can exist singly and alone.  For 
example, a tree can exist solitary and alone on a given prairie 
or in a valley or on the mountainside.  An animal upon a mountain 
or a bird soaring in the air might live a solitary life.  They are not in 
need of cooperation or solidarity.  Such animated beings enjoy the 
greatest comfort and happiness in their respective solitary lives.  
     On the contrary, man cannot live singly and alone.  He is in need 
of continuous cooperation and mutual help.  For example, a man 
living alone in the wilderness will eventually starve.  He can never, 
singly and alone, provide himself with all the necessities of existence.  
Therefore, he is in need of cooperation and reciprocity.  
     The mystery of this phenomenon, the cause thereof is this, that 
mankind has been created from one single origin, has branched off 
from one family.  Thus in reality all mankind represents one family.  
God has not created any difference.  He has created all as one that thus 
this family might live in perfect happiness and well-being.  
     Regarding reciprocity and cooperation:  each member of the body 
politic should live in the utmost comfort and welfare because each 
individual member of humanity is a member of the body politic and if 
one member of the members be in distress or be afflicted with some 
disease all the other members must necessarily suffer.  For example, a 
member of the human organism is the eye.  If the eye should be 
affected that affliction would affect the whole nervous system.  Hence, 
if a member of the body politic becomes afflicted, in reality, from the 
standpoint of sympathetic connection, all will share that affliction 
since this (one afflicted) is a member of the group of members, a part 
of the whole.  Is it possible for one member or part to be in distress and 
the other members to be at ease?  It is impossible!  Hence God has 
desired that in the body politic of humanity each one shall enjoy perfect 
welfare and comfort.  
     Although the body politic is one family yet because of lack of 
harmonious relations some members are comfortable and some in 
direst misery, some members are satisfied and some are hungry, some 
members are clothed in most costly garments and some families are in 
need of food and shelter.  Why?  Because this family lacks the necessary 
reciprocity and symmetry.  This household is not well arranged.  This 
household is not living under a perfect law.  All the laws which are 
legislated do not ensure happiness.  They do not provide comfort.  
 
+P39 
Therefore a law must be given to this family by means of which all 
the members of this family will enjoy equal well-being and happiness.  
     Is it possible for one member of a family to be subjected to the 
utmost misery and to abject poverty and for the rest of the family to 
be comfortable?  It is impossible unless those members of the family 
be senseless, atrophied, inhospitable, unkind.  Then they would say, 
"Though these members do belong to our family--let them alone.  Let 
us look after ourselves.  Let them die.  So long as I am comfortable, I 
am honored, I am happy--this my brother--let him die.  If he be in 
misery let him remain in misery, so long as I am comfortable.  If he is 
hungry let him remain so; I am satisfied.  If he is without clothes, so 
long as I am clothed, let him remain as he is.  If he is shelterless, homeless, 
so long as I have a home, let him remain in the wilderness."  
     Such utter indifference in the human family is due to lack of 
control, to lack of a working law, to lack of kindness in its midst.  If 
kindness had been shown to the members of this family surely all the 
members thereof would have enjoyed comfort and happiness.  
     His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah has given instructions regarding every 
one of the questions confronting humanity.  He has given teachings 
and instructions with regard to every one of the problems with which 
man struggles.  Among them are (the teachings) concerning the question 
of economics that all the members of the body politic may enjoy 
through the working out of this solution the greatest happiness, welfare 
and comfort without any harm or injury attacking the general 
order of things.  Thereby no difference or dissension will occur.  No 
sedition or contention will take place.  This solution is this:  
     First and foremost is the principle that to all the members of the 
body politic shall be given the greatest achievements of the world of 
humanity.  Each one shall have the utmost welfare and well-being.  
To solve this problem we must begin with the farmer; there will we 
lay a foundation for system and order because the peasant class and 
the agricultural class exceed other classes in the importance of their 
service.  In every village there must be established a general storehouse 
which will have a number of revenues.  
     The first revenue will be that of the tenth or tithes.  
     The second revenue (will be derived) from the animals.  
     The third revenue, from the minerals, that is to say, every mine 
prospected or discovered, a third thereof will go to this vast storehouse.  
     The fourth is this:  whosoever dies without leaving any heirs all 
his heritage will go to the general storehouse.  
     Fifth, if any treasures shall be found on the land they should be 
devoted to this storehouse.  
 
+P40 
     All these revenues will be assembled in this storehouse.  
     As to the first, the tenths or tithes:  we will consider a farmer, one 
of the peasants.  We will look into his income.  We will find out, for 
instance, what is his annual revenue and also what are his expenditures.  
Now, if his income be equal to his expenditures, from such a farmer 
nothing whatever will be taken.  That is, he will not be subjected to 
taxation of any sort, needing as he does all his income.  Another farmer 
may have expenses running up to one thousand dollars we will say, 
and his income is two thousand dollars.  From such an one a tenth will 
be required, because he has a surplus.  But if his income be ten thousand 
dollars and his expenses one thousand dollars or his income 
twenty thousand dollars, he will have to pay as taxes, one-fourth.  If 
his income be one hundred thousand dollars and his expenses five 
thousand, one-third will he have to pay because he has still a surplus 
since his expenses are five thousand and his income one hundred 
thousand.  If he pays, say, thirty-five thousand dollars, in addition 
to the expenditure of five thousand he still has sixty thousand left.  
But if his expenses be ten thousand and his income two hundred 
thousand then he must give an even half because ninety thousand 
will be in that case the sum remaining.  Such a scale as this will determine 
allotment of taxes.  All the income from such revenues will go 
to this general storehouse.  
     Then there must be considered such emergencies as follows:  a 
certain farmer whose expenses run up to ten thousand dollars and 
whose income is only five thousand, he will receive necessary expenses 
from the storehouse.  Five thousand dollars will be allotted to him so he 
will not be in need.  
     Then the orphans will be looked after, all of whose expenses will 
be taken care of.  The cripples in the village--all their expenses will be 
looked after.  The poor in the village--their necessary expenses will 
be defrayed.  And other members who for valid reasons are incapacitated
--the blind, the old, the deaf--their comfort must be looked 
after.  In the village no one will remain in need or in want.  All will live 
in the utmost comfort and welfare.  Yet no schism will assail the 
general order of the body politic.  
     Hence the expenses or expenditures of the general storehouse are 
now made clear and its activities made manifest.  The income of this 
general storehouse has been shown.  Certain trustees will be elected 
by the people in a given village to look after these transactions.  The 
farmers will be taken care of and if after all these expenses are defrayed 
any surplus is found in the storehouse it must be transferred 
to the national treasury.  
     This system is all thus ordered so that in the village the very 
 
+P41 
poor will be comfortable, the orphans will live happily and well; in a 
word, no one will be left destitute.  All the individual members of the 
body politic will thus live comfortably and well.  
     For larger cities, naturally, there will be a system on a larger 
scale.  Were I to go into that solution the details thereof would be very 
lengthy.  
     The result of this (system) will be that each individual member of 
the body politic will live most comfortably and happily under obligation 
to no one.  Nevertheless, there will be preservation of degree because 
in the world of humanity there must needs be degrees.  The 
body politic may well be likened to an army.  In this army there must 
be a general, there must be a sergeant, there must be a marshal, there 
must be the infantry; but all must enjoy the greatest comfort and 
welfare.  
     God is not partial and is no respecter of persons.  He has made 
provision for all.  The harvest comes forth for everyone.  The rain 
showers upon everybody and the heat of the sun is destined to warm 
everyone.  The verdure of the earth is for everyone.  Therefore there 
should be for all humanity the utmost happiness, the utmost comfort, 
the utmost well-being.  
     But if conditions are such that some are happy and comfortable 
and some in misery; some are accumulating exorbitant wealth and 
others are in dire want--under such a system it is impossible for man 
to be happy and impossible for him to win the good pleasure of God.  
God is kind to all.  The good pleasure of God consists in the welfare 
of all the individual members of mankind.  
     A Persian king was one night in his palace, living in the greatest 
luxury and comfort.  Through excessive joy and gladness he addressed 
a certain man, saying:  "Of all my life this is the happiest moment.  
Praise be to God, from every point prosperity appears and fortune 
smiles!  My treasury is full and the army is well taken care of.  My 
palaces are many; my land unlimited; my family is well off; my 
honor and sovereignty are great.  What more could I want!"  
     The poor man at the gate of his palace spoke out, saying:  "O 
kind king!  Assuming that you are from every point of view so happy, 
free from every worry and sadness--do you not worry for us?  You 
say that on your own account you have no worries--but do you never 
worry about the poor in your land?  Is it becoming or meet that you 
should be so well off and we in such dire want and need?  In view of 
our needs and troubles how can you rest in your palace, how can you 
even say that you are free from worries and sorrows?  As a ruler you 
must not be so egoistic as to think of yourself alone but you must 
think of those who are your subjects.  When we are comfortable then 
 
+P42 
you will be comfortable; when we are in misery how can you, as a king, 
be in happiness?"  
     The purport is this that we are all inhabiting one globe of earth.  
In reality we are one family and each one of us is a member of this 
family.  We must all be in the greatest happiness and comfort, under 
a just rule and regulation which is according to the good pleasure of 
God, thus causing us to be happy, for this life is fleeting.  
     If man were to care for himself only he would be nothing but an 
animal for only the animals are thus egoistic.  If you bring a thousand 
sheep to a well to kill nine hundred and ninety-nine the one remaining 
sheep would go on grazing, not thinking of the others and worrying 
not at all about the lost, never bothering that its own kind had 
passed away, or had perished or been killed.  To look after one's self 
only is therefore an animal propensity.  It is the animal propensity to 
live solitary and alone.  It is the animal proclivity to look after one's 
own comfort.  But man was created to be a man--to be fair, to be just, 
to be merciful, to be kind to all his species, never to be willing that 
he himself be well off while others are in misery and distress--this is an 
attribute of the animal and not of man.  Nay, rather, man should be 
willing to accept hardships for himself in order that others may enjoy 
wealth; he should enjoy trouble for himself that others may enjoy 
happiness and well-being.  This is the attribute of man.  This is becoming 
of man.  Otherwise man is not man--he is less than the animal.  
     The man who thinks only of himself and is thoughtless of others 
is undoubtedly inferior to the animal because the animal is not possessed 
of the reasoning faculty.  The animal is excused; but in man 
there is reason, the faculty of justice, the faculty of mercifulness.  
Possessing all these faculties he must not leave them unused.  He who 
is so hard-hearted as to think only of his own comfort, such an one 
will not be called man.  
     Man is he who forgets his own interests for the sake of others.  
His own comfort he forfeits for the well-being of all.  Nay, rather, his 
own life must he be willing to forfeit for the life of mankind.  Such a 
man is the honor of the world of humanity.  Such a man is the glory 
of the world of mankind.  Such a man is the one who wins eternal bliss.  
Such a man is near to the threshold of God.  Such a man is the very 
manifestation of eternal happiness.  Otherwise, men are like animals, 
exhibiting the same proclivities and propensities as the world of animals.  
What distinction is there?  What prerogatives, what perfections?  
None whatever!  Animals are better even--thinking only of themselves 
and negligent of the needs of others.  
     Consider how the greatest men in the world--whether among 
prophets or philosophers--all have forfeited their own comfort, have 
 
+P43 
sacrificed their own pleasure for the well-being of humanity.  They 
have sacrificed their own lives for the body politic.  They have sacrificed 
their own wealth for that of the general welfare.  They have 
forfeited their own honor for the honor of mankind.  Therefore it 
becomes evident that this is the highest attainment for the world of 
humanity.  
     We ask God to endow human souls with justice so that they may 
be fair, and may strive to provide for the comfort of all, that each 
member of humanity may pass his life in the utmost comfort and 
welfare.  Then this material world will become the very paradise of 
the Kingdom, this elemental earth will be in a heavenly state and all 
the servants of God will live in the utmost joy, happiness and gladness.  
We must all strive and concentrate all our thoughts in order 
that such happiness may accrue to the world of humanity.  
 
                      ------------------- 
 
     The question of socialization is very important.  It will not be 
solved by strikes for wages.  All the governments of the world must be 
united and organize an assembly the members of which should be 
elected from the parliaments and the nobles of the nations.  These 
must plan with utmost wisdom and power so that neither the capitalist 
suffer from enormous losses nor the laborers become needy.  In the 
utmost moderation they should make the law; then announce to the 
public that the rights of the working people are to be strongly preserved.  
Also the rights of the capitalists are to be protected.  When 
such a general plan is adopted by the will of both sides, should a 
strike occur, all the governments of the world collectively should resist 
it.  Otherwise, the labor problem will lead to much destruction, especially 
in Europe.  Terrible things will take place.  
     For instance, the owners of properties, mines and factories should 
share their incomes with their employees and give a fairly certain 
percentage of their products to their workingmen in order that the 
employees may receive, beside their wages, some of the general income 
of the factory so that the employee may strive with his soul in 
the work.  
     No more trusts will remain in the future.  The question of the 
trusts will be wiped away entirely.  Also, every factory that has ten 
thousand shares will give two thousand shares of these ten thousand 
to its employees and will write the shares in their names, so that they 
may have them, and the rest will belong to the capitalists.  Then at 
the end of the month or year whatever they may earn after the expenses 
and wages are paid, according to the number of shares, should 
be divided among both.  In reality, so far great injustice has befallen 
 
+P44 
the common people.  Laws must be made because it is impossible for 
the laborers to be satisfied with the present system.  They will strike 
every month and every year.  Finally, the capitalists will lose.  In 
ancient times a strike occurred among the Turkish soldiers.  They said 
to the government:  "Our wages are very small and they should be 
increased."  The government was forced to give them their demands.  
Shortly afterwards they struck again.  Finally all the incomes went 
to the pockets of the soldiers to the extent that they killed the king, 
saying:  "Why didst thou not increase the income so that we might 
have received more?"  
     It is impossible for a country to live properly without laws.  To 
solve this problem rigorous laws must be made, so that all the governments 
of the world will be the protectors thereof.  
     In the Bolshevistic principles equality is effected through force.  
The masses who are opposed to the people of rank and to the wealthy 
class desire to partake of their advantages.  
     But in the divine teachings equality is brought about through a 
ready willingness to share.  It is commanded as regards wealth that 
the rich among the people, and the aristocrats should, by their own 
free will and for the sake of their own happiness, concern themselves 
with and care for the poor.  This equality is the result of the lofty 
characteristics and noble attributes of mankind.  
 
+P45 
                    THE CRITERIONS OF TRUTH 
 
     During my visit to London and Paris last year+F1 I had many 
talks with the materialistic philosophers of Europe.  The basis 
of all their conclusions is that the acquisition of knowledge 
of phenomena is according to a fixed, invariable law,--a law mathematically 
exact in its operation through the senses.  For instance, 
the eye sees a chair; therefore there is no doubt of the chair's existence.  
The eye looks up into the heavens and beholds the sun; I see flowers 
upon this table; I smell their fragrance; I hear sounds outside, etc., 
etc.  This, they say, is a fixed mathematical law of perception and 
deduction, the operation of which admits of no doubt whatever; for 
inasmuch as the universe is subject to our sensing, the proof is self-evident 
that our knowledge of it must be gained through the avenues 
of the senses.  That is to say, the materialists announce that the 
criterion and standard of human knowledge is sense perception.  Among 
the Greeks and Romans the criterion of knowledge was reason; that 
whatever is provable and acceptable by reason must necessarily be 
admitted as true.  A third standard or criterion is the opinion held by 
theologians that traditions or prophetic statement and interpretations 
constitute the basis of human knowing.  There is still another, a fourth 
criterion upheld by religionists and metaphysicians who say that the 
source and channel of all human penetration into the unknown is 
through inspiration.  Briefly then, these four criterions according to 
the declarations of men are:  First--Sense Perception; Second--Reason; 
Third--Traditions; Fourth--Inspiration.  
     In Europe I told the philosophers and scientists of materialism 
that the criterion of the senses is not reliable.  For instance, consider 
a mirror and the images reflected in it.  These images have no actual 
corporeal existence.  Yet if you had never seen a mirror you would 
firmly insist and believe that they were real.  The eye sees a mirage 
upon the desert as a lake of water but there is no reality in it.  As we 
stand upon the deck of a steamer the shore appears to be moving, yet 
we know the land is stationary and we are moving.  The earth was 
believed to be fixed and the sun revolving about it but although this 
appears to be so, the reverse is now known to be true.  A whirling torch 
makes a circle of fire appear before the eye, yet we realize there is but 
one point of light.  We behold a shadow moving upon the ground but 
 
+F1 1911.  
 
+P46 
it has no material existence, no substance.  In deserts the atmospheric 
effects are particularly productive of illusions which deceive the eye.  
Once I saw a mirage in which a whole caravan appeared traveling upward 
into the sky.  In the far north other deceptive phenomena appear 
and baffle human vision.  Sometimes three or four suns called by 
scientists "mock suns" will be shining at the same time whereas we 
know the great solar orb is one and that it remains fixed and single.  
In brief, the senses are continually deceived and we are unable to 
separate that which is reality from that which is not.  
     As to the second criterion--reason--this likewise is unreliable 
and not to be depended upon.  This human world is an ocean of varying 
opinions.  If reason is the perfect standard and criterion of knowledge, 
why are opinions at variance and why do philosophers disagree 
so completely with each other?  This is a clear proof that human 
reason is not to be relied upon as an infallible criterion.  For instance, 
great discoveries and announcements of former centuries are continually 
upset and discarded by the wise men of today.  Mathematicians, 
astronomers, chemical scientists continually disprove and reject the 
conclusions of the ancients; nothing is fixed, nothing final; everything 
continually changing because human reason is progressing along new 
roads of investigation and arriving at new conclusions every day.  In 
the future much that is announced and accepted as true now will be 
rejected and disproved.  And so it will continue ad infinitum.  
     When we consider the third criterion--traditions--upheld by 
theologians as the avenue and standard of knowledge, we find this 
source equally unreliable and unworthy of dependence.  For religious 
traditions are the report and record of understanding and interpretation 
of the Book.  By what means has this understanding, this interpretation 
been reached?  By the analysis of human reason.  When we 
read the Book of God the faculty of comprehension by which we form 
conclusions is reason.  Reason is mind.  If we are not endowed with 
perfect reason, how can we comprehend the meanings of the Word of 
God?  Therefore human reason, as already pointed out, is by its very 
nature finite and faulty in conclusions.  It cannot surround the Reality 
Itself, the Infinite Word.  Inasmuch as the source of traditions and 
interpretations is human reason, and human reason is faulty, how 
can we depend upon its findings for real knowledge?  
     The fourth criterion I have named is inspiration through which 
it is claimed the reality of knowledge is attainable.  What is inspiration?  
It is the influx of the human heart.  But what are satanic promptings 
which afflict mankind?  They are the influx of the heart also.  How 
shall we differentiate between them?  The question arises, How shall 
we know whether we are following inspiration from God or satanic 
 
+P47 
promptings of the human soul?  Briefly, the point is that in the human 
material world of phenomena these four are the only existing criterions 
or avenues of knowledge, and all of them are faulty and unreliable.  
What then remains?  How shall we attain the reality of knowledge?  
By the breaths and promptings of the Holy Spirit which is light and 
knowledge itself.  Through it the human mind is quickened and 
fortified into true conclusions and perfect knowledge.  This is conclusive 
argument showing that all available human criterions are erroneous 
and defective, but the divine standard of knowledge is infallible.  
Therefore man is not justified in saying "I know because I perceive 
through my senses"; or "I know because it is proved through my 
faculty of reason"; or "I know because it is according to tradition and 
interpretation of the holy book"; or "I know because I am inspired."  
All human standard of judgment is faulty, finite.  
 
+P48 
                         MAN AND NATURE 
 
     If we look with a perceiving eye upon the world of creation, we 
find that all existing things may be classified as follows:  First--
Mineral--that is to say matter or substance appearing in various 
forms of composition.  Second--Vegetable--possessing the virtues of 
the mineral plus the power of augmentation or growth, indicating a 
degree higher and more specialized than the mineral.  Third--Animal
--possessing the attributes of the mineral and vegetable plus the 
power of sense perception.  Fourth--Human--the highest specialized 
organism of visible creation, embodying the qualities of the mineral, 
vegetable and animal plus an ideal endowment absolutely minus and 
absent in the lower kingdoms--the power of intellectual investigation 
into the mysteries of outer phenomena.  The outcome of this intellectual 
endowment is science which is especially characteristic of man.  This 
scientific power investigates and apprehends created objects and the 
laws surrounding them.  It is the discoverer of the hidden and mysterious 
secrets of the material universe and is peculiar to man alone.  
The most noble and praiseworthy accomplishment of man therefore 
is scientific knowledge and attainment.  
     Science may be likened to a mirror wherein the images of the 
mysteries of outer phenomena are reflected.  It brings forth and exhibits 
to us in the arena of knowledge all the product of the past.  
It links together past and present.  The philosophical conclusions of 
bygone centuries, the teachings of the prophets and wisdom of former 
sages are crystallized and reproduced in the scientific advancement of 
today.  Science is the discoverer of the past.  From its premises of past 
and present we deduce conclusions as to the future.  Science is the 
governor of nature and its mysteries, the one agency by which man 
explores the institutions of material creation.  All created things are 
captives of nature and subject to its laws.  They cannot transgress the 
control of these laws in one detail or particular.  The infinite starry 
worlds and heavenly bodies are nature's obedient subjects.  The earth 
and its myriad organisms, all minerals, plants and animals are thralls 
of its dominion.  But man through the exercise of his scientific, intellectual 
power can rise out of this condition, can modify, change and 
control nature according to his own wishes and uses.  Science, so to 
speak, is the "breaker" of the laws of nature.  
      Consider, for example, that man according to natural law should 
dwell upon the surface of the earth.  By overcoming this law and 
 
+P49 
restriction however he sails in ships over the ocean, mounts to the 
zenith in aeroplanes and sinks to the depths of the sea in submarines.  
This is against the fiat of nature and a violation of her sovereignty 
and dominion.  Nature's laws and methods, the hidden secrets and 
mysteries of the universe, human inventions and discoveries, all our 
scientific acquisitions should naturally remain concealed and unknown, 
but man through his intellectual acumen searches them out of the 
plane of the invisible, draws them into the plane of the visible, exposes 
and explains them.  For instance, one of the mysteries of nature is 
electricity.  According to nature this force, this energy should remain 
latent and hidden, but man scientifically breaks through the very 
laws of nature, arrests it and even imprisons it for his use.  
     In brief, man through the possession of this ideal endowment 
of scientific investigation is the most noble product of creation, the 
governor of nature.  He takes the sword from nature's hand and uses 
it upon nature's head.  According to natural law, night is a period of 
darkness and obscurity, but man by utilizing the power of electricity, 
by wielding this electric sword overcomes the darkness and dispels 
the gloom.  Man is superior to nature and makes nature do his bidding.  
Man is a sensitive being; nature is minus sensation.  Man has memory 
and reason; nature lacks them.  Man is nobler than nature.  There are 
powers within him of which nature is devoid.  It may be claimed that 
these powers are from nature itself and that man is a part of nature.  
In answer to this statement we will say that if nature is the whole and 
man is a part of that whole, how could it be possible for a part to 
possess qualities and virtues which are absent in the whole.  Undoubtedly 
the part must be endowed with the same qualities and 
properties as the whole.  For example, the hair is a part of the human 
anatomy.  It cannot contain elements which are not found in other 
parts of the body, for in all cases the component elements of the body 
are the same.  Therefore it is manifest and evident that man, although 
in body a part of nature, nevertheless in spirit possesses a power 
transcending nature; for if he were simply a part of nature and 
limited to material laws he could possess only the things which 
nature embodies.  God has conferred upon and added to man a distinctive 
power, the faculty of intellectual investigation into the 
secrets of creation, the acquisition of higher knowledge, the greatest 
virtue of which is scientific enlightenment.  
     This endowment is the most praiseworthy power of man, for 
through its employment and exercise, the betterment of the human 
race is accomplished, the development of the virtues of mankind is 
made possible and the spirit and mysteries of God become manifest.  
     As material and physical sciences are taught here+F1 and are constantly 
 
+F1 Columbia University, New York City.  
 
+P50 
unfolding in wider vistas of attainment, I am hopeful that 
spiritual development may also follow and keep pace with these outer 
advantages.  As material knowledge is illuminating those within the 
walls of this great temple of learning, so also may the light of the 
spirit, the inner and divine light of the real philosophy glorify this 
institution.  The most important principle of divine philosophy is the 
oneness of the world of humanity, the unity of mankind, the bond 
conjoining East and West, the tie of love which blends human hearts.  
     Therefore it is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and 
summon all our energies in order that the bonds of unity and accord 
may be established among mankind.  For thousands of years we have 
had bloodshed and strife.  It is enough; it is sufficient.  Now is the time 
to associate together in love and harmony.  For thousands of years we 
have tried the sword and warfare; let mankind for a time at least 
live in peace.  Review history and consider how much savagery, how 
much bloodshed and battle the world has witnessed.  It has been 
either religious warfare, political warfare or some other clash of human 
interests.  The world of humanity has never enjoyed the blessing of 
Universal Peace.  Year by year the implements of warfare have been 
increased and perfected.  Consider the wars of past centuries; only ten, 
fifteen or twenty thousand at the most were killed but now it is 
possible to kill one hundred thousand in a single day.  In ancient 
times warfare was carried on with the sword; today it is the smokeless 
gun.  Formerly battleships were sailing vessels; today they are dreadnoughts.  
Consider the increase and improvement in the weapons of 
war.  God has created us all human and all countries of the world are 
parts of the same globe.  We are all his servants.  He is kind and just 
to all.  Why should we be unkind and unjust to each other?  He provides 
for all.  Why should we deprive one another?  He protects and preserves 
all.  Why should we kill our fellow-creatures?  If this warfare and strife 
be for the sake of religion, it is evident that it violates the spirit and 
basis of all religion.  All the divine Manifestations have proclaimed 
the oneness of God and the unity of mankind.  They have taught that 
men should love and mutually help each other in order that they 
might progress.  Now if this conception of religion be true, its essential 
principle is the oneness of humanity.  The fundamental truth of the 
Manifestations is peace.  This underlies all religion, all justice.  The 
divine purpose is that men should live in unity, concord and agreement 
and should love one another.  Consider the virtues of the human 
world and realize that the oneness of humanity is the primary foundation 
of them all.  Read the gospel and the other holy books.  You will 
find their fundamentals are one and the same.  
 
+P51 
                    THE MICROCOSM AND THE MACROCOSM 
 
     When we ponder over the reality of the microcosm, we 
discover that in the microcosm there are deposited three 
realities.  Man is endowed with an outer or physical reality.  
It belongs to the material realm, the animal kingdom, because it has 
sprung from the material world.  This animalistic reality of man he 
shares in common with the animals.  
     The human body is like animals subject to nature's laws.  But 
man is endowed with a second reality, the rational or intellectual 
reality; and the intellectual reality of man predominates over nature.  
     All these sciences which we enjoy were the hidden and recondite 
secrets of nature, unknowable to nature, but man was enabled to 
discover these mysteries, and out of the plane of the unseen he brought 
them into the plane of the seen.  
     Yet there is a third reality in man, the spiritual reality.  Through 
its medium one discovers spiritual revelations, a celestial faculty 
which is infinite as regards the intellectual as well as physical realms.  
That power is conferred upon man through the breath of the Holy 
Spirit.  It is an eternal reality, an indestructible reality, a reality 
belonging to the divine, supernatural kingdom; a reality whereby the 
world is illumined, a reality which grants unto man eternal life.  This 
third, spiritual reality it is which discovers past events and looks 
along the vistas of the future.  It is the ray of the Sun of Reality.  The 
spiritual world is enlightened through it, the whole of the Kingdom is 
being illumined by it.  It enjoys the world of beatitude, a world which 
had not beginning and which shall have no end.  
     That celestial reality, the third reality of the microcosm, delivers 
man from the material world.  Its power causes man to escape 
from nature's world.  Escaping, he will find an illuminating reality, 
transcending the limited reality of man and causing him to attain to 
the infinitude of God, abstracting him from the world of superstitions 
and imaginations, and submerging him in the sea of the rays of the 
Sun of Reality.  
     This fact is proved from scientific as well as spiritual evidence.  
     When we ponder over the conditions of phenomena, we observe 
that all phenomena are composed of single elements.  This singular 
cell-element travels and has its coursings through all the grades of 
existence.  I wish you to ponder carefully over this.  This cellular 
element has at some time been in the mineral kingdom.  While staying 
 
+P52 
in the mineral kingdom it has had its coursings and transformations 
through myriads of images and forms.  Having perfected its journey 
in the mineral kingdom, it has ascended to the vegetable kingdom; 
and in the vegetable kingdom it has again had journeys and transformations 
through myriads of conditions.  Having accomplished its 
functions in the vegetable kingdom, the cellular element ascends to 
the animal kingdom.  
     In the animal kingdom again it goes through the composition of 
myriads of images, and then we have it in the human kingdom.  In 
the human kingdom likewise it has its transformations and coursings 
through multitudes of forms.  In short, this single primordial atom has 
had its great journeys through every stage of life, and in every stage 
it was endowed with a special and particular virtue or characteristic.  
     Consequently, the great divine philosophers have had the following 
epigram:  All things are involved in all things.  For every single 
phenomenon has enjoyed the postulates of God, and in every form of 
these infinite electrons it has had its characteristics of perfection.  
     Thus this flower once upon a time was of the soil.  The animal eats 
the flower or its fruit, and it thereby ascends to the animal kingdom.  
Man eats the meat of the animal, and there you have its ascent into 
the human kingdom, because all phenomena are divided into that 
which eats and that which is eaten.  Therefore, every primordial atom 
of these atoms, singly and indivisible, has had its coursings throughout 
all the sentient creation, going constantly into the aggregation 
of the various elements.  Hence do you have the conservation of energy 
and the infinity of phenomena, the indestructibility of phenomena, 
changeless and immutable, because life cannot suffer annihilation but 
only change.  
     The apparent annihilation is this:  that the form, the outward 
image, goes through all these changes and transformations.  Let us 
again take the example of this flower.  The flower is indestructible.  
The only thing that we can see, this outer form, is indeed destroyed, 
but the elements, the indivisible elements which have gone into the 
composition of this flower are eternal and changeless.  Therefore the 
realities of all phenomena are immutable.  Extinction or mortality is 
nothing but the transformation of pictures and images, so to speak--
the reality back of these images is eternal.  And every reality of the 
realities is one of the bounties of God.  
     Some people believe that the divinity of God had a beginning.  
They say that before this particular beginning man had no knowledge 
of the divinity of God.  With this principle they have limited the 
operation of the influences of God.  
     For example, they think there was a time when man did not exist, 
 
+P53 
and that there will be a time in the future when man will not exist.  
Such a theory circumscribes the power of God, because how can we understand 
the divinity of God except through scientifically understanding 
the manifestations of the attributes of God?  
     How can we understand the nature of fire except from its heat, 
its light?  Were not heat and light in this fire, naturally we could not 
say that the fire existed.  
     Thus, if there was a time when God did not manifest His qualities, 
then there was no God, because the attributes of God presuppose the 
creation of phenomena.  For example, by present consideration we say 
that God is the creator.  Then there must always have been a creation
--since the quality of creator cannot be limited to the moment when 
some man or men realize this attribute.  The attributes that we discover 
one by one--these attributes themselves necessarily anticipated 
our discovery of them.  Therefore, God has no beginning and no ending; 
nor is His creation limited ever as to degree.  Limitations of time 
and degree pertain to things created, never to the creation as a whole.  
They pertain to the forms of things, not to their realities.  The effulgence 
of God cannot be suspended.  The sovereignty of God cannot be 
interrupted.  
     As long as the sovereignty of God is immemorial, therefore the 
creation of our world throughout infinity is presupposed.  When we 
look at the reality of this subject, we see that the bounties of God are 
infinite, without beginning and without end.  
     The greatest bounties of God in this phenomenal world are His 
Manifestations.  This is the greatest postulate.  These Manifestations 
are the Suns of Reality.  For it is through the Manifestation that the 
reality becomes known and established for man.  History proves to us 
that apart from the influence of the Manifestations, man sinks back 
into his animal condition, using even his intellectual power to subserve 
an animal purpose.  Therefore there is no cessation whatsoever in the 
future for the appearance of the Manifestation of God, because God is 
infinite and His purpose cannot be limited in any way.  If we ever dare 
to limit and circumscribe God's purpose within any bounds, then of 
necessity we have dared to set limitations to the omnipotence of God.  
The created has dared to define his Creator!  
     Consequently, the perfect man ever beholds the rays of the Sun 
of Truth.  The perfect man ever awaits and expects the coming of the 
effulgence of God, he ever ponders over the methods and purposes of 
God, knowing that of certainty the realities of the Divine are not finite, 
the Divine names and attributes are not finite.  God's graces and bounties 
are without limit, and the coming of the Manifestations of God are 
not circumscribed by time.  
 
+P54 
                         THE UNIVERSAL CYCLES 
 
     Each one of the luminous bodies in this limitless firmament has 
a cycle of revolution which is of a different duration, and every 
one revolves in its own orbit, and again begins a new cycle.  So 
the earth, every three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight 
minutes and a fraction, completes a revolution; and then it 
begins a new cycle, that is to say, the first cycle is again renewed.  In 
the same way, for the whole universe, whether for the heavens or for 
men, there are cycles of great events, of important facts and occurrences.  
When a cycle is ended, a new cycle begins, and the old one, on account 
of the great events which take place, is completely forgotten, and not a 
trace or record of it will remain.  As you see, we have no records of 
twenty thousand years ago, although we have before proved by argument 
that life on this earth is very ancient.  It is not one hundred 
thousand, or two hundred thousand, or one million or two million 
years old; it is very ancient, and the ancient records and traces are 
entirely obliterated.  
     Each of the Divine Manifestations has likewise a cycle, and during 
the cycle his laws and commandments prevail and are performed.  
When his cycle is completed by the appearance of a new Manifestation, 
a new cycle begins.  In this way cycles begin, end, and are renewed, 
until a universal cycle is completed in the world, when important 
events and great occurrences will take place which entirely efface 
every trace and every record of the past; then a new universal cycle 
begins in the world, for this universe has no beginning.  We have 
before stated proofs and evidences concerning this subject; there is no 
need of repetition.  
     Briefly, we say a universal cycle in the world of existence signifies 
a long duration of time, and innumerable and incalculable periods and 
epochs.  In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendor in 
the realm of the visible, until a great and universal Manifestation 
makes the world the center of his radiance.  His appearance causes 
the world to attain to maturity, and the extension of his cycle is very 
great.  Afterwards other Manifestations will arise under his shadow, 
who according to the needs of the time will renew certain commandments 
relating to material questions and affairs, while remaining 
under his shadow.  
     We are in the cycle which began with Adam, and its universal 
Manifestation is &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P55 
                         EDUCATION 
 
     According to the statement of philosophers the difference 
in degree of humankind from lowest to highest is due to education.  
The proofs they advance are these:  The civilization of 
Europe and America is an evidence and outcome of education whereas 
the semi-civilized and barbarous peoples of Africa bear witness in 
their condition that they have been deprived of its advantages.  
Education makes the ignorant wise, the tyrant just, promotes happiness, 
strengthens the mind, develops the will and makes fruitless 
trees of humanity fruitful.  Therefore in the human world some have 
attained lofty degrees while others grope in the abyss of despair.  
Nevertheless the highest attainment is possible for every member of 
the human race even to the station of the prophets.  This is the statement 
and reasoning of the philosophers.  
     The prophets of God are the first educators.  They bestow universal 
education upon man and cause him to rise from lowest levels 
of savagery to the highest pinnacles of spiritual development.  The 
philosophers too are educators along lines of intellectual training.  At 
most they have only been able to educate themselves and a limited 
number about them, to improve their own morals and, so to speak, 
civilize themselves; but they have been incapable of universal education.  
They have failed to cause an advancement for any given nation 
from savagery to civilization.  
     It is evident that although education improves the morals of 
mankind, confers the advantages of civilization and elevates man 
from lowest degrees to the station of sublimity, there is nevertheless a 
difference in the intrinsic or natal capacity of individuals.  Ten children 
of the same age, with equal station of birth, taught in the same school, 
partaking of the same food, in all respects subject to the same environment, 
their interests equal and in common, will evidence separate and 
distinct degrees of capability and advancement; some exceedingly 
intelligent and progressive, some of mediocre ability, others limited 
and incapable.  One may become a learned professor while another 
under the same course of education proves dull and stupid.  From all 
standpoints the opportunities have been equal but the results and outcomes 
vary from the highest to lowest degree of advancement.  It is 
evident therefore that mankind differs in natal capacity and intrinsic 
 
+P56 
intellectual endowment.  Nevertheless although capacities are not the 
same, every member of the human race is capable of education.  
      His Holiness Jesus Christ was an educator of humanity.  His 
teachings were altruistic; his bestowal universal.  He taught mankind 
by the power of the Holy Spirit and not through human agency, for 
the human power is limited whereas the divine power is illimitable and 
infinite.  The influence and accomplishment of Christ will attest this.  
Galen, the Greek physician and philosopher, who lived in the second 
century A.D., wrote a treatise upon the civilization of nations.  He was 
not a Christian but he has borne testimony that religious beliefs exercise 
an extraordinary effect upon the problems of civilization.  In 
substance he says, "There are certain people among us, followers of 
Jesus the Nazarene who was killed in Jerusalem.  These people are 
truly imbued with moral principles which are the envy of philosophers.  
They believe in God and fear Him.  They have hopes in His favors, therefore 
they shun all unworthy deeds and actions and incline to praiseworthy 
ethics and morals.  Day and night they strive that their deeds 
may be commendable and that they may contribute to the welfare of 
humanity; therefore each one of them is virtually a philosopher, for 
these people have attained unto that which is the essence and purport 
of philosophy.  These people have praiseworthy morals even though 
they may be illiterate."  
     The purpose of this is to show that the holy Manifestations of 
God, the divine prophets, are the first teachers of the human race.  They 
are universal educators and the fundamental principles they have laid 
down are the causes and factors of the advancement of nations.  
 
+P57 
                         THE HOLY SPIRIT 
 
     The elemental atoms which constitute all phenomenal existence 
and being in this illimitable universe are in perpetual 
motion, undergoing continuous degrees of progression.  For instance, 
let us conceive of an atom in the mineral kingdom progressing 
upward to the kingdom of the vegetable by entering into the composition 
and fibre of a tree or plant.  From thence it is assimilated and 
transferred into the kingdom of the animal and finally by the law and 
process of composition becomes a part of the body of man.  That is to 
say, it has traversed the intermediate degrees and stations of phenomenal 
existence, entering into the composition of various organisms in 
its journey.  This motion or transference is progressive and perpetual, 
for after disintegration of the human body into which it has entered, 
it returns to the mineral kingdom whence it came, and will continue to 
traverse the kingdoms of phenomena as before.  This is an illustration 
designed to show that the constituent elemental atoms of phenomena 
undergo progressive transference and motion throughout the material 
kingdoms.  
     In its ceaseless progression and journeyings the atom becomes 
imbued with the virtues and powers of each degree or kingdom it traverses.  
In the degree of the mineral it possessed mineral affinities; in 
the kingdom of the vegetable it manifested the virtue augmentative 
or power of growth; in the animal organism it reflected the intelligence 
of that degree, and in the kingdom of man it was qualified with human 
attributes or virtues.  
     Furthermore, the forms and organisms of phenomenal being and 
existence in each of the kingdoms of the universe are myriad and numberless.  
The vegetable plane or kingdom for instance has its infinite 
variety of types and material structures of plant life, each distinct and 
different within itself, no two exactly alike in composition and detail, 
for there are no repetitions in nature, and the virtue augmentative cannot 
be confined to any given image or shape.  Each leaf has its own particular 
identity, so to speak, its own individuality as a leaf.  Therefore 
each atom of the innumerable elemental atoms, during its ceaseless 
motion through the kingdoms of existence as a constituent of organic 
composition, not only becomes imbued with the powers and virtues of 
the kingdoms it traverses but also reflects the attributes and qualities 
of the forms and organisms of those kingdoms.  As each of these forms 
has its individual and particular virtue, therefore each elemental atom 
 
+P58 
of the universe has the opportunity of expressing an infinite variety 
of those individual virtues.  No atom is bereft or deprived of this opportunity 
or right of expression.  Nor can it be said of any given atom 
that it is denied equal opportunities with other atoms; nay, all are 
privileged to possess the virtues existent in these kingdoms and to reflect 
the attributes of their organisms.  In the various transformations 
or passages from kingdom to kingdom, the virtues expressed by the 
atoms in each degree are peculiar to that degree.  For example, in the 
world of the mineral, the atom does not express the vegetable form and 
organism, and when through the process of transmutation it assumes 
the virtues of the vegetable degree, it does not reflect the attributes of 
animal organisms, and so on.  
     It is evident then that each elemental atom of the universe is 
possessed of a capacity to express all the virtues of the universe.  This 
is a subtle and abstract realization.  Meditate upon it, for within it lies 
the true explanation of pantheism.  From this point of view and perception, 
pantheism is a truth, for every atom in the universe possesses 
or reflects all the virtues of life, the manifestation of which is effected 
through change and transformation.  Therefore the origin and outcome 
of phenomena is verily the omnipresent God for the reality of all phenomenal 
existence is through Him.  There is neither reality nor the manifestation 
of reality without the instrumentality of God.  Existence is 
realized and possible through the bounty of God, just as the ray or 
flame emanating from this lamp is realized through the bounty of the 
lamp from which it originates.  Even so all phenomena are realized 
through the divine bounty, and the explanation of true pantheistic 
statement and principle is that the phenomena of the universe find 
realization through the one power animating and dominating all 
things; and all things are but manifestations of its energy and bounty.  
The virtue of being and existence is through no other agency.  Therefore 
in the words of &amp;Baha'u'llah the first teaching is the oneness of the 
world of humanity....  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah has announced that no matter how far the world of 
humanity may advance in material civilization, it is nevertheless in 
need of spiritual virtues and the bounties of God.  The spirit of man is 
not illumined and quickened through material sources.  It is not resuscitated 
by investigating phenomena of the world of matter.  The spirit 
of man is in need of the protection of the Holy Spirit.  Just as he advances 
by progressive stages from the mere physical world of being into 
the intellectual realm, so must he develop upward in moral attributes 
and spiritual graces.  In the process of this attainment he is ever in 
need of the bestowals of the Holy Spirit.  Material development may 
be likened to the glass of a lamp whereas divine virtues and spiritual 
 
+P59 
susceptibilities are the light within the glass.  The lamp chimney is 
worthless without the light; likewise man in his material condition requires 
the radiance and vivification of the divine graces and merciful 
attributes.  Without the presence of the Holy Spirit he is lifeless.  Although 
physically and mentally alive he is spiritually dead.  His Holiness 
Christ announced, "That which is born of flesh is flesh and that 
which is born of spirit is spirit," meaning that man must be born again.  
As the babe is born into the light of this physical world so must the 
physical and intellectual man be born into the light of the world of 
divinity.  In the matrix of the mother the unborn child was deprived 
and unconscious of the world of material existence but after its birth it 
beheld the wonders and beauties of a new realm of life and being.  In 
the world of the matrix it was utterly ignorant and unable to conceive 
of these new conditions but after its transformation it discovers the 
radiant sun, trees, flowers and an infinite range of blessings and bounties 
awaiting it.  In the human plane and kingdom man is a captive of 
nature and ignorant of the divine world until born of the breaths of the 
Holy Spirit out of physical conditions of limitation and deprivation.  
Then he beholds the reality of the spiritual realm and kingdom, realizes 
the narrow restrictions of the mere human world of existence and 
becomes conscious of the unlimited and infinite glories of the world of 
God.  Therefore no matter how man may advance upon the physical 
and intellectual plane he is ever in need of the boundless virtues of 
divinity, the protection of the Holy Spirit and the face of God.  
 
+P60 
                              SCIENCE 
 
     The virtues of humanity are many but science is the most noble 
of them all.  The distinction which man enjoys above and beyond 
the station of the animal is due to this paramount virtue.  
It is a bestowal of God; it is not material, it is divine.  Science is an 
effulgence of the Sun of Reality, the power of investigating and discovering 
the verities of the universe, the means by which man finds a 
pathway to God.  All the powers and attributes of man are human and 
hereditary in origin, outcomes of nature's processes, except the intellect, 
which is supernatural.  Through intellectual and intelligent 
inquiry science is the discoverer of all things.  It unites present and 
past, reveals the history of bygone nations and events, and confers 
upon man today the essence of all human knowledge and attainment 
throughout the ages.  By intellectual processes and logical deductions 
of reason, this super-power in man can penetrate the mysteries of the 
future and anticipate its happenings.  
     Science is the first emanation from God toward man.  All created 
beings embody the potentiality of material perfection, but the power 
of intellectual investigation and scientific acquisition is a higher virtue 
specialized to man alone.  Other beings and organisms are deprived of 
this potentiality and attainment.  God has created or deposited this 
love of reality in man.  The development and progress of a nation is 
according to the measure and degree of that nation's scientific attainments.  
Through this means, its greatness is continually increased and 
day by day the welfare and prosperity of its people are assured.  
     All blessings are divine in origin but none can be compared with 
this power of intellectual investigation and research which is an eternal 
gift producing fruits of unending delight.  Man is ever partaking of 
these fruits.  All other blessings are temporary; this is an everlasting 
possession.  Even sovereignty has its limitations and overthrow; this 
is a kingship and dominion which none may usurp or destroy.  Briefly; 
it is an eternal blessing and divine bestowal, the supreme gift of God 
to man.  Therefore you should put forward your most earnest efforts 
toward the acquisition of sciences and arts.  The greater your attainment, 
the higher your standard in the divine purpose.  The man of 
science is perceiving and endowed with vision whereas he who is ignorant 
and neglectful of this development is blind.  The investigating 
mind is attentive, alive; the mind callous and indifferent is deaf and 
 
+P61 
dead.  A scientific man is a true index and representative of humanity, 
for through processes of inductive reasoning and research he is informed 
of all that appertains to humanity, its status, conditions and 
happenings.  He studies the human body politic, understands social 
problems and weaves the web and texture of civilization.  In fact, 
science may be likened to a mirror wherein the infinite forms and images 
of existing things are revealed and reflected.  It is the very foundation 
of all individual and national development.  Without this basis 
of investigation, development is impossible.  Therefore seek with diligent 
endeavor the knowledge and attainment of all that lies within 
the power of this wonderful bestowal.  
     We have already stated that science or the attribute of scientific 
penetration is supernatural and that all other blessings of God are 
within the boundary of nature.  What is the proof of this?  All created 
things except man are captives of nature.  The stars and suns swinging 
through infinite space, all earthly forms of life and existence whether 
mineral, vegetable or animal come under the dominion and control of 
natural law.  Man through scientific knowledge and power rules nature 
and utilizes her laws to do his bidding.  According to natural limitations 
he is a creature of earth restricted to life upon its surface, but through 
scientific utilization of material laws he soars in the sky, sails upon the 
ocean and dives beneath it.  The products of his invention and discovery 
so familiar to us in daily life were once mysteries of nature.  For 
instance, man has brought electricity out of the plane of the invisible 
into the plane of the visible, harnessed and imprisoned that mysterious 
natural agent and made it the servant of his needs and wishes.  Similar 
instances are many but we will not prolong.  Man as it were takes the 
sword out of nature's hand and with it for his sceptre of authority 
dominates nature itself.  Nature is without the crown of human faculties 
and attributes.  Man possesses conscious intelligence and reflection; 
nature is minus.  This is an established fundamental among philosophers.  
Man is endowed with volition and memory; nature has neither.  
Man can seek out the mysteries latent in nature whereas nature is not 
conscious of her own hidden phenomena.  Man is progressive; nature is 
stationary, without the power of progression or retrogression.  Man is 
endowed with ideal virtues, for example intellection, volition,--among 
them faith, confession and acknowledgment of God, while nature is 
devoid of all these.  The ideal faculties of man, including the capacity 
of scientific acquisition are beyond nature's ken.  These are powers 
whereby man is differentiated and distinguished from all other forms 
of life.  This is the bestowal of divine idealism, the crown adorning 
human heads.  Notwithstanding the gift of this supernatural power, it 
is most amazing that materialists still consider themselves within the 
 
+P62 
bounds and captivity of nature.  The truth is that God has endowed 
man with virtues, powers and ideal faculties of which nature is entirely 
bereft and by which man is elevated, distinguished and superior.  We 
must thank God for these bestowals, for these powers He has given us, 
for this crown He has placed upon our heads.  
     How shall we utilize these gifts and expend these bounties?  By 
directing our efforts toward the unification of the human race.  We 
must use these powers in establishing the oneness of the world of humanity; 
appreciate these virtues by accomplishing the unity of the 
white and colored races; devote this divine intelligence to the perfecting 
of amity and accord among all branches of the human family, so 
that under the protection and providence of God, the East and West 
may hold each other's hands and become as lovers.  Then will mankind 
be as one nation, one race and kind; as waves of one ocean.  Although 
these waves may differ in form and shape, they are waves of the same 
sea.  Flowers may be variegated in colors but they are all flowers of one 
garden.  Trees differ though they grow in the same orchard.  All are 
nourished and quickened into life by the bounty of the same rain; all 
grow and develop by the heat and light of the one sun; all are refreshed 
and exhilarated by the same breeze; that they may bring forth varied 
fruits.  This is according to the creative wisdom.  If all trees bore the 
same kind of fruit it would cease to be delicious.  In their never ending 
variety man finds enjoyment instead of monotony.  
     And now as I look into your faces I am reminded of trees varying 
in color and form but all bearing luscious and delectable fruits, fragrant 
and delightful to the inner and outer senses.  The radiance and 
spirituality of this meeting is through the favor of God.  Our hearts are 
uplifted in thankfulness to Him.  Praise be to God! you are living upon 
the great continent of the West enjoying the perfect liberty, security 
and peace of this just government.  There is no cause for sorrow or unhappiness 
anywhere; every means of happiness and enjoyment is 
about you, for in this human world there is no greater blessing than 
liberty.  You do not know.  I who for forty years have been a prisoner, 
do know.  I do know the value and blessing of liberty.  For you have 
been and are now living in freedom and you have no fear of anybody.  
Is there a greater blessing than this?  Freedom!  Liberty!  Security!  
These are the great bestowals of God.  Therefore praise God!  
 
+P63 
                         SPIRITUAL SPRINGTIME 
 
     In the world of existence man has traversed successive degrees 
until he has attained the human kingdom.  In each degree of his 
progression he has developed capacity for advancement to the next 
station and condition.  While in the kingdom of the mineral he was attaining 
the capacity for promotion into the degree of the vegetable.  In 
the kingdom of the vegetable he underwent preparation for the world 
of the animal and from thence he has come onward to the human degree 
or kingdom.  Throughout this journey of progression he has ever 
and always been potentially man.  
     In the beginning of his human life man was embryonic in the 
world of the matrix.  There he received capacity and endowment for 
the reality of human existence.  The forces and powers necessary for 
this world were bestowed upon him in that limited condition.  In this 
world he needed eyes; he received them potentially in the other.  He 
needed ears; he obtained them there in readiness and preparation for 
his new existence.  The powers requisite in this world were conferred 
upon him in the world of the matrix, so that when he entered this realm 
of real existence he not only possessed all necessary functions and 
powers but found provision for his material sustenance awaiting him.  
     Therefore in this world he must prepare himself for the life beyond.  
That which he needs in the world of the Kingdom must be 
obtained here.  Just as he prepared himself in the world of the matrix 
by acquiring forces necessary in this sphere of existence, so likewise 
the indispensable forces of the divine existence must be potentially 
attained in this world.  
     What is he in need of in the Kingdom which transcends the life 
and limitation of this mortal sphere?  That world beyond is a world 
of sanctity and radiance; therefore it is necessary that in this world 
he should acquire these divine attributes.  In that world there is need 
of spirituality, faith, assurance, the knowledge and love of God.  These 
he must attain in this world so that after his ascension from the 
earthly to the heavenly Kingdom he shall find all that is needful in 
that life eternal ready for him.  
     That divine world is manifestly a world of lights; therefore man 
has need of illumination here.  That is a world of love; the love of God 
is essential.  It is a world of perfections; virtues or perfections must be 
acquired.  That world is vivified by the breaths of the Holy Spirit; 
 
+P64 
in this world we must seek them.  That is the Kingdom of life everlasting; 
it must be attained during this vanishing existence.  
     By what means can man acquire these things?  How shall he 
obtain these merciful gifts and powers?  First, through the knowledge 
of God.  Second, through the love of God.  Third, through faith.  
Fourth, through philanthropic deeds.  Fifth, through self-sacrifice.  
Sixth, through severance from this world.  Seventh, through sanctity 
and holiness.  Unless he acquires these forces and attains to these 
requirements he will surely be deprived of the life that is eternal.  But 
if he possesses the knowledge of God, becomes ignited through the fire 
of the love of God, witnesses the great and mighty signs of the Kingdom, 
becomes the cause of love among mankind, and lives in the utmost 
state of sanctity and holiness, he shall surely attain to second 
birth, be baptized by the Holy Spirit and enjoy everlasting existence.  
     Is it not astonishing that although man has been created for the 
knowledge and love of God, for the virtues of the human world, for 
spirituality, heavenly illumination and life eternal, nevertheless he 
continues ignorant and negligent of all this?  Consider how he seeks 
knowledge of everything except knowledge of God.  For instance, his 
utmost desire is to penetrate the mysteries of the lowest strata of the 
earth.  Day by day he strives to know what can be found ten metres 
below the surface, what he can discover within the stone, what he can 
learn by archaeological research in the dust.  He puts forth arduous 
labors to fathom terrestrial mysteries but is not at all concerned about 
knowing the mysteries of the Kingdom, traversing the illimitable fields 
of the eternal world, becoming informed of the divine realities, 
discovering the secrets of God, attaining the knowledge of God, witnessing 
the splendors of the Sun of Truth and realizing the glories of 
everlasting life.  He is unmindful and thoughtless of these.  How much 
he is attracted to the mysteries of matter and how completely unaware 
he is of the mysteries of divinity!  Nay, he is utterly negligent and oblivious 
of the secrets of divinity.  How great his ignorance!  How conducive 
to his degradation!  It is as if a kind and loving father had 
provided a library of wonderful books for his son in order that he 
might be informed of the mysteries of creation; at the same time 
surrounding him with every means of comfort and enjoyment; but 
the son amuses himself with pebbles and playthings, neglectful of all 
his father's gifts and provision.  How ignorant and heedless is man!  
The Father has willed for him glory eternal and he is content with 
blindness and deprivation.  The Father has built for him a royal palace 
but he is playing with the dust; prepared for him garments of silk but 
he prefers to remain unclothed; provided for him delicious foods and 
fruits while he seeks sustenance in the grasses of the field.  
 
+P65 
     Praise be to God! you have heard the call of the Kingdom.  Your 
eyes are opened; you have turned to God.  Your purpose is the good-pleasure 
of God, the understanding of the mysteries of the heart and 
investigation of the realities.  Day and night you must strive that you 
may attain to the significances of the heavenly kingdom, perceive 
the signs of divinity, acquire certainty of knowledge and realize that 
this world has a creator, a vivifier, a provider, an architect,--knowing 
this through proofs and evidences and not through susceptibilities,--
nay, rather, through decisive arguments and real vision; that is to 
say, visualizing it as clearly as the outer eye beholds the sun.  In this 
way may you behold the presence of God and attain to the knowledge 
of the holy, divine Manifestations.  
 
+P66 
                         ETERNAL UNITY 
 
     What is real unity?  When we observe the human world we 
find various collective expressions of unity therein.  For 
instance, man is distinguished from the animal by his degree 
or kingdom.  This comprehensive distinction includes all the 
posterity of Adam and constitutes one great household or human 
family which may be considered the fundamental or physical unity of 
mankind.  Furthermore, a distinction exists between various groups of 
humankind according to lineage, each group forming a racial unity 
separate from the others.  There is also the unity of tongue among 
those who use the same language as a means of communication; 
national unity where various peoples live under one form of government 
such as French, German, British, etc.; and political unity which 
conserves the civil rights of parties or factions of the same government.  
All these unities are imaginary and without real foundation, for no 
real result proceeds from them.  The purpose of true unity is real and 
divine outcomes.  From these limited unities mentioned only limited 
outcomes proceed whereas unlimited unity produces unlimited result.  
For instance, from the limited unity of race or nationality the results 
at most are limited.  It is like a family living alone and solitary; there 
are no unlimited or universal outcomes from it.  
     The unity which is productive of unlimited results is first a unity 
of mankind which recognizes that all are sheltered beneath the overshadowing 
glory of the All-Glorious; that all are servants of one God; 
for all breathe the same atmosphere, live upon the same earth, move 
beneath the same heavens, receive effulgence from the same sun and 
are under the protection of one God.  This is the most great unity, and 
its results are lasting if humanity adheres to it; but mankind has 
hitherto violated it, adhering to sectarian or other limited unities 
such as racial, patriotic or unity of self-interests; therefore no great 
results have been forthcoming.  Nevertheless it is certain that the 
radiance and favors of God are encompassing, minds have developed, 
perceptions have become acute, sciences and arts are widespread and 
capacity exists for the proclamation and promulgation of the real and 
ultimate unity of mankind which will bring forth marvelous results.  
It will reconcile all religions, make warring nations loving, cause 
hostile kings to become friendly and bring peace and happiness to the 
human world.  It will cement together the Orient and Occident, remove 
forever the foundations of war and upraise the ensign of the "Most 
 
+P67 
Great Peace".  These limited unities are therefore signs of that great 
unity which will make all the human family one by being productive 
of the attractions of conscience in mankind.  
     Another unity is the spiritual unity which emanates from the 
breaths of the Holy Spirit.  This is greater than the unity of mankind.  
Human unity or solidarity may be likened to the body whereas unity 
from the breaths of the Holy Spirit is the spirit animating the body.  
This is a perfect unity.  It creates such a condition in mankind that 
each one will make sacrifices for the other and the utmost desire will 
be to forfeit life and all that pertains to it in behalf of another's good.  
This is the unity which existed among the disciples of His Holiness 
Jesus Christ and bound together the prophets and holy souls of the 
past.  It is the unity which through the influence of the divine spirit is 
permeating the &amp;Baha'is so that each offers his life for the other and 
strives with all sincerity to attain his good-pleasure.  This is the unity 
which caused twenty thousand people in Persia to give their lives in 
love and devotion to it.  It made the Bab the target of a thousand 
arrows and caused &amp;Baha'u'llah to suffer exile and imprisonment forty 
years.  This unity is the very spirit of the body of the world.  It is 
impossible for the body of the world to become quickened with life without 
its vivification.  His Holiness Jesus Christ--may my life be a 
sacrifice to him!--promulgated this unity among mankind.  Every soul 
who believed in Jesus Christ became revivified and resuscitated through 
this spirit, attained to the zenith of eternal glory, realized the life 
everlasting, experienced the second birth and rose to the acme of good 
fortune.  
     In the Word of God there is still another unity, the oneness of the 
Manifestations of God, His Holiness Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, 
Mohammed, the Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah.  This is a unity divine, heavenly, 
radiant, merciful; the one reality appearing in its successive manifestations.  
For instance, the sun is one and the same but its points of 
dawning are various.  During the summer season it rises from the 
northern point of the ecliptic; in winter it appears from the southern 
point of rising.  Each month between it appears from a certain zodiacal 
position.  Although these dawning-points are different, the sun is the 
same sun which has appeared from them all.  The significance is the 
reality of prophethood which is symbolized by the sun, and the holy 
Manifestations are the dawning-places or zodiacal points.  
     There is also the divine unity or entity which is sanctified above 
all concept of humanity.  It cannot be comprehended nor conceived 
because it is infinite reality and cannot become finite.  Human minds 
are incapable of surrounding that reality because all thoughts and 
conceptions of it are finite, intellectual creations and not the reality 
 
+P68 
of divine being which alone knows itself.  For example, if we form a 
conception of divinity as a living, almighty, self-subsisting, eternal 
being, this is only a concept apprehended by a human intellectual 
reality.  It would not be the outward, visible reality which is beyond 
the power of human mind to conceive or encompass.  We ourselves have 
an external, visible entity but even our concept of it is the product of 
our own brain and limited comprehension.  The reality of divinity is 
sanctified above this degree of knowing and realization.  It has ever 
been hidden and secluded in its own holiness and sanctity above our 
comprehending.  Although it transcends our realization, its lights, 
bestowals, traces and virtues have become manifest in the realities of 
the prophets, even as the sun becomes resplendent in various mirrors.  
These holy realities are as reflectors, and the reality of divinity is as 
the sun which although it is reflected from the mirrors, and its virtues 
and perfections become resplendent therein, does not stoop from its 
own station of majesty and glory and seek abode in the mirrors; it 
remains in its heaven of sanctity.  At most it is this, that its lights become 
manifest and evident in its mirrors or manifestations.  Therefore 
its bounty proceeding from them is one bounty but the recipients of 
that bounty are many.  This is the unity of God; this is oneness;--unity 
of divinity, holy above ascent or descent, embodiment, comprehension 
or idealization;--divine unity--the prophets are its mirrors; its lights 
are revealed through them; its virtues become resplendent in them, 
but the Sun of Reality never descends from its own highest point and 
station.  This is unity, oneness, sanctity; this is glorification whereby 
we praise and adore God.  
 
+P69 
                         THE DARKENED LIGHTS 
 
     From the time of the creation of Adam to this day there have 
been two pathways in the world of humanity; one the natural 
or materialistic, the other the religious or spiritual.  The pathway 
of nature is the pathway of the animal realm.  The animal acts in 
accordance with the requirements of nature, follows its own instincts 
and desires.  Whatever its impulses and proclivities may be it has the 
liberty to gratify them; yet it is a captive of nature.  It cannot deviate 
in the least degree from the road nature has established.  It is utterly 
minus spiritual susceptibilities, ignorant of divine religion and without 
knowledge of the Kingdom of God.  The animal possesses no power of 
ideation or conscious intelligence; it is a captive of the senses and 
deprived of that which lies beyond them.  It is subject to what the eye 
sees, the ear hears, the nostrils sense, the taste detects and touch 
reveals.  These sensations are acceptable and sufficient for the animal.  
But that which is beyond the range of the senses, that realm of 
phenomena through which the conscious pathway to the Kingdom of 
God leads, the world of spiritual susceptibilities and divine religion,--
of these the animal is completely unaware, for in its highest station 
it is a captive of nature.  
     One of the strangest things witnessed is that the materialists of 
today are proud of their natural instincts and bondage.  They state 
that nothing is entitled to belief and acceptance except that which is 
sensible or tangible.  By their own statements they are captives of 
nature, unconscious of the spiritual world, uninformed of the divine 
kingdom and unaware of heavenly bestowals.  If this be a virtue the 
animal has attained it to a superlative degree, for the animal is absolutely 
ignorant of the realm of spirit and out of touch with the inner 
world of conscious realization.  The animal would agree with the 
materialist in denying the existence of that which transcends the 
senses.  If we admit that being limited to the plane of the senses is a 
virtue the animal is indeed more virtuous than man, for it is entirely 
bereft of that which lies beyond, absolutely oblivious of the Kingdom 
of God and its traces whereas God has deposited within the human 
creature an illimitable power by which he can rule the world of nature.  
     Consider how all other phenomenal existence and beings are 
captives of nature.  The sun, that colossal center of our solar system, 
the giant stars and planets, the towering mountains, the earth itself 
and its kingdoms of life lower than the human,--all are captives of 
 
+P70 
nature except man.  No other created thing can deviate in the slightest 
degree from obedience to natural law.  The sun in its glory and greatness 
millions of miles away is held prisoner in its orbit of universal 
revolution, captive of universal natural control.  Man is the ruler of 
nature.  According to natural law and limitation he should remain 
upon the earth, but behold how he violates this command and soars 
above the mountains in aeroplanes.  He sails in ships upon the surface 
of the ocean and dives into its depths in submarines.  Man makes 
nature his servant; harnesses the mighty energy of electricity for 
instance and imprisons it in a small lamp for his uses and conveniences.  
He speaks from the East to the West through a wire.  He is able to store 
and preserve his voice in a phonograph.  Though he is a dweller upon 
earth he penetrates the mysteries of starry worlds inconceivably 
distant.  He discovers latent realities within the bosom of the earth, 
uncovers treasures, penetrates secrets and mysteries of the phenomenal 
world and brings to light that which according to nature's jealous 
laws should remain hidden, unknown and unfathomable.  Through an 
ideal inner power man brings these realities forth from the invisible 
plane to the visible.  This is contrary to nature's law.  
     It is evident therefore that man is ruler over nature's sphere and 
province.  Nature is inert, man is progressive.  Nature has no consciousness, 
man is endowed with it.  Nature is without volition and 
acts perforce whereas man possesses a mighty will.  Nature is incapable 
of discovering mysteries or realities whereas man is especially fitted 
to do so.  Nature is not in touch with the realm of God, man is attuned 
to its evidences.  Nature is uninformed of God, man is conscious of 
Him.  Man acquires divine virtues, nature is denied them.  Man can 
voluntarily discontinue vices, nature has no power to modify the influence 
of its instincts.  Altogether it is evident that man is more 
noble and superior; that in him there is an ideal power surpassing 
nature.  He has consciousness, volition, memory, intelligent power, 
divine attributes and virtues of which nature is completely deprived, 
bereft and minus; therefore man is higher and nobler by reason of the 
ideal and heavenly force latent and manifest in him.  
     How strange then it seems that man, notwithstanding his endowment 
with this ideal power, will descend to a level beneath him 
and declare himself no greater than that which is manifestly inferior 
to his real station.  God has created such a conscious spirit within him 
that he is the most wonderful of all contingent beings.  In ignoring these 
virtues he descends to the material plane, considers matter the ruler 
of existence and denies that which lies beyond.  Is this virtue?  In its 
fullest sense this is animalistic, for the animal realizes nothing more.  
In fact from this standpoint the animal is the greater philosopher because 
 
+P71 
it is completely ignorant of the Kingdom of God, possesses no 
spiritual susceptibilities and is uninformed of the heavenly world.  
In brief, this is a view of the pathway of nature.  
     The second pathway is that of religion, the road of the divine 
Kingdom.  It involves the acquisition of praiseworthy attributes, 
heavenly illumination and righteous actions in the world of humanity.  
This pathway is conducive to the progress and uplift of the world.  
It is the source of human enlightenment, training and ethical improvement; 
the magnet which attracts the love of God because of the 
knowledge of God it bestows.  This is the road of the holy Manifestations 
of God for they are in reality the foundation of the divine religion 
of oneness.  There is no change or transformation in this pathway.  
It is the cause of human betterment, the acquisition of heavenly 
virtues and the illumination of mankind.  
     Alas! that humanity is completely submerged in imitations and 
unrealities notwithstanding the truth of divine religion has ever remained 
the same.  Superstitions have obscured the fundamental 
reality, the world is darkened and the light of religion is not apparent.  
This darkness is conducive to differences and dissensions; rites and 
dogmas are many and various; therefore discord has arisen among the 
religious systems whereas religion is for the unification of mankind.  
True religion is the source of love and agreement amongst men, the 
cause of the development of praiseworthy qualities; but the people are 
holding to the counterfeit and imitation, negligent of the reality which 
unifies; so they are bereft and deprived of the radiance of religion.  
They follow superstitions inherited from their fathers and ancestors.  
To such an extent has this prevailed that they have taken away the 
heavenly light of divine truth and sit in the darkness of imitations and 
imaginations.  That which was meant to be conducive to life has become 
the cause of death; that which should have been an evidence of 
knowledge is now a proof of ignorance; that which was a factor in the 
sublimity of human nature has proved to be its degradation.  Therefore 
the realm of the religionist has gradually narrowed and darkened and 
the sphere of the materialist has widened and advanced; for the religionist 
has held to imitation and counterfeit, neglecting and discarding 
holiness and the sacred reality of religion.  When the sun sets 
it is the time for bats to fly.  They come forth because they are creatures 
of the night.  When the lights of religion become darkened the materialists 
appear.  They are the bats of night.  The decline of religion is their 
time of activity; they seek the shadows when the world is darkened 
and clouds have spread over it.  
 
+P72 
                    THE NEED OF DIVINE EDUCATION 
 
     In the books of the prophets certain glad-tidings are recorded 
which are absolutely true and free from doubt.  The East has ever 
been the dawning-point of the Sun of Reality.  All the prophets of 
God have appeared there.  The religions of God have been promulgated, 
the teachings of God have been spread and the law of God 
founded in the East.  The Orient has always been the center of lights.  
The West has acquired illumination from the East but in some respects 
the reflection of the light has been greater in the Occident.  This is 
especially true of Christianity.  His Holiness Christ appeared in 
Palestine and his teachings were founded there.  Although the doors of 
the Kingdom were opened in that country and the bestowals of divinity 
were spread broadcast from its center, the people of the West have 
embraced and promulgated Christianity more fully than those in the 
East.  The Sun of Reality shone forth from the horizon of the East but 
its heat and ray are most resplendent in the West where the radiant 
standard of His Holiness Christ has been upraised.  I have great hopes 
that the lights of &amp;Baha'u'llah's appearance may also find the fullest 
manifestation and reflection in these western regions; for the teachings 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah are especially applicable to the conditions of the people 
here.  The western nations are endowed with the capability of understanding 
the rational and peerless words of &amp;Baha'u'llah and realizing 
that the essence of the teachings of all the former prophets can be 
found in his utterance.  
     The teachings of His Holiness Christ have been promulgated 
by His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah who has also revealed new teachings 
applicable to present conditions in the world of humanity.  He has 
trained the people of the East through the power and protection of 
the Holy Spirit, cemented the souls of humanity together and established 
the foundations of international unity.  
     Through the power of his words the hearts of the people of all 
religions have been attuned in harmony.  For instance, among the 
&amp;Baha'is in Persia there are Christians, Mohammedans, Zoroastrians, 
Jews and many others of varying denominations and beliefs who 
have been brought together in unity and love in the cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Although these people were formerly hostile and antagonistic, 
filled with hatred and bitterness toward each other, blood-thirsty 
and pillaging, considering that animosity and attack were the means 
of attaining the good-pleasure of God, they have now become loving 
 
+P73 
and filled with the radiant zeal of fellowship and brotherhood, the 
purpose of them all being service to the world of humanity, promotion 
of international peace, the unification of the divine religions and deeds 
of universal philanthropy.  By their words and actions they are 
proving the verity of His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Consider the animosity and hatred existing today between the 
various nations of the world.  What disagreements and hostilities 
arise, what warfare and contention, how much bloodshed, what injustice 
and tyranny!  Just now there is war in eastern Turkey, also war 
between Turkey and Italy.  Nations are devoted to conquest and 
bloodshed, filled with the animus of religious hatred, seeking the 
good-pleasure of God by killing and destroying those whom they consider 
enemies in their blindness.  How ignorant they are!  That which is forbidden 
by God they consider acceptable to Him.  God is love; God 
seeketh fellowship, purity, sanctity and long-suffering; these are the 
attributes of divinity.  Therefore these warring, raging nations have 
arisen against divinity, imagining they are serving God.  What gross 
ignorance this is!  What injustice, blindness and lack of realization!  
Briefly; we must strive with heart and soul in order that this darkness 
of the contingent world may be dispelled, that the lights of the Kingdom 
shall shine upon all the horizons, the world of humanity become 
illumined, the image of God become apparent in human mirrors, the 
law of God be well established and that all regions of the world shall 
enjoy peace, comfort and composure beneath the equitable protection 
of God.  My admonition and exhortation to you is this:  Be kind to 
all people, love humanity, consider all mankind as your relations and 
servants of the most high God.  Strive day and night that animosity 
and contention may pass away from the hearts of men, that all religions 
shall become reconciled and the nations love each other, so 
that no racial, religious or political prejudice may remain and the 
world of humanity behold God as the beginning and end of all existence.  
God has created all and all return to God.  Therefore love 
humanity with all your heart and soul.  If you meet a poor man, assist 
him; if you see the sick, heal him; reassure the affrighted one, render 
the cowardly noble and courageous, educate the ignorant, associate 
with the stranger.  Emulate God.  Consider how kindly, how lovingly 
He deals with all and follow His example.  You must treat people in 
accordance with the divine precepts; in other words, treat them as 
kindly as God treats them, for this is the greatest attainment possible 
for the world of humanity.  
     Furthermore, know ye that God has created in man the power of 
reason whereby man is enabled to investigate reality.  God has not 
intended man to blindly imitate his fathers and ancestors.  He has 
 
+P74 
endowed him with mind or the faculty of reasoning by the exercise of 
which he is to investigate and discover the truth; and that which he 
finds real and true, he must accept.  He must not be an imitator or 
blind follower of any soul.  He must not rely implicitly upon the opinion 
of any man without investigation; nay, each soul must seek intelligently 
and independently, arriving at a real conclusion and bound only by 
that reality.  The greatest cause of bereavement and disheartening in 
the world of humanity is ignorance based upon blind imitation.  It is 
due to this that wars and battles prevail; from this cause hatred and 
animosity arise continually among mankind.  Through failure to investigate 
reality the Jews rejected His Holiness Jesus Christ.  They 
were expecting his coming; by day and night they mourned and 
lamented, saying, "O God! hasten thou the day of the advent of 
Christ," expressing most intense longing for the Messiah but when 
His Holiness Christ appeared they denied and rejected him, treated 
him with arrogant contempt, sentenced him to death and finally 
crucified him.  Why did this happen?  Because they were blindly following 
imitations, believing that which had descended to them as a 
heritage from their fathers and ancestors; tenaciously holding to it 
and refusing to investigate the reality of Christ.  Therefore they were 
deprived of the bounties of His Holiness whereas if they had forsaken 
imitations and investigated the reality of the Messiah they would 
have surely been guided to believing in him.  Instead of this, they said, 
"We have heard from our fathers and have read in the old testament 
that His Holiness Christ must come from an unknown place; now we 
find that this one has come from Nazareth."  Steeped in the literal 
interpretation and imitating the beliefs of fathers and ancestors they 
failed to understand the fact that although the body of Jesus came 
from Nazareth, the reality of the Christ came from the unknown place 
of the divine Kingdom.  They also said that the sceptre of His Holiness 
Christ would be of iron, that is to say he should wield a sword.  When 
His Holiness Christ appeared, he did possess a sword but it was the 
sword of his tongue with which he separated the false from the true; 
but the Jews were blind to the spiritual significance and symbolism 
of the prophetic words.  They also expected that the Messiah would 
sit upon the throne of David whereas His Holiness the Christ had 
neither throne nor semblance of sovereignty; nay, rather, he was a 
poor man, apparently abject and vanquished; therefore how could he 
be the veritable Christ?  This was one of their most insistent objections 
based upon ancestral interpretation and teaching.  In reality His Holiness 
Christ was glorified with an eternal sovereignty and everlasting 
dominion, spiritual and not temporal.  His throne and kingdom were 
established in human hearts where he reigns with power and authority 
 
+P75 
without end.  Notwithstanding the fulfillment of all the prophetic 
signs in His Holiness, the Jews denied him and entered the period of 
their deprivation because of their allegiance to imitations and ancestral 
forms.  
     Among other objections, they said, "We are promised through 
the tongue of the prophets that His Holiness Christ at the time of 
his coming would proclaim the law of the torah whereas now we see 
this person abrogating the commands of the pentateuch, disturbing 
our blessed sabbath and abolishing the law of divorce.  He has left 
nothing of the ancient law of Moses, therefore he is the enemy of 
Moses."  In reality His Holiness Christ proclaimed and completed the 
law of Moses.  He was the very helper and assister of Moses.  He spread 
the book of Moses throughout the world and established anew the 
fundamentals of the law revealed by him.  He abolished certain unimportant 
laws and forms which were no longer compatible with the 
exigencies of the time, such as divorce and plurality of wives.  The 
Jews did not comprehend this, and the cause of their ignorance was 
blind and tenacious adherence to imitations of ancient forms and 
teachings; therefore they finally sentenced His Holiness to death.  
     They likewise said, "Through the tongues of the prophets it was 
announced that during the time of Christ's appearance the justice of 
God would prevail throughout the world, tyranny and oppression 
would be unknown, justice would even extend to the animal kingdom, 
ferocious beasts would associate in gentleness and peace, the wolf and 
the lamb would drink from the same spring, the lion and the deer meet 
in the same meadow, the eagle and quail dwell together in the same 
nest; but instead of this, we see that during the time of this supposed 
Christ the Romans have conquered Palestine and are ruling it with 
extreme tyranny, justice is nowhere apparent and signs of peace in the 
kingdom are conspicuously absent."  These statements and attitudes 
of the Jews were inherited from their fathers; blind allegiance to 
literal expectations which did not come to pass during the time of 
Jesus Christ.  The real purport of these prophetic statements was that 
various peoples symbolized by the wolf and lamb between whom love 
and fellowship were impossible would come together during Messiah's 
reign, drink from the same fountain of life in his teachings and become 
his devoted followers.  This was realized when peoples of all 
religions, nationalities and dispositions became united in their beliefs 
and followed Christ in humility, associating in love and brotherhood 
under the shadow of his divine protection.  The Jews, being blind to 
this and holding to their bigoted imitations, were insolent and arrogant 
toward His Holiness and crucified him.  Had they investigated the 
reality of Christ they would have beheld his beauty and truth.  
 
+P76 
     God has given man the eye of investigation by which he may see 
and recognize truth.  He has endowed man with ears that he may hear 
the message of reality and conferred upon him the gift of reason by 
which he may discover things for himself.  This is his endowment and 
equipment for the investigation of reality.  Man is not intended to see 
through the eyes of another, hear through another's ears nor comprehend 
with another's brain.  Each human creature has individual endowment, 
power and responsibility in the creative plan of God.  Therefore 
depend upon your own reason and judgment and adhere to the 
outcome of your own investigation; otherwise you will be utterly submerged 
in the sea of ignorance and deprived of all the bounties of 
God.  Turn to God, supplicate humbly at His threshold, seeking 
assistance and confirmation, that God may rend asunder the veils 
that obscure your vision.  Then will your eyes be filled with illumination, 
face to face you will behold the reality of God and your heart 
become completely purified from the dross of ignorance, reflecting the 
glories and bounties of the Kingdom.  
     Holy souls are like soil which has been plowed and tilled with 
much earnest labor; the thorns and thistles cast aside and all weeds 
uprooted.  Such soil is most fruitful and the harvest from it will prove 
full and plenteous.  In this same way man must free himself from the 
weeds of ignorance, thorns of superstitions and thistles of imitations, 
that he may discover reality in the harvests of true knowledge.  Otherwise 
the discovery of reality is impossible, contention and divergence 
of religious belief will always remain and mankind, like ferocious 
wolves will rage and attack each other in hatred and antagonism.  We 
supplicate God that He may destroy the veils which limit our vision 
and that these becloudings which darken the way of the manifestation 
of the shining lights may be dispelled in order that the effulgent Sun 
of Reality may shine forth.  We implore and invoke God, seeking His 
assistance and confirmation.  Man is a child of God; most noble, lofty 
and beloved by God his creator.  Therefore he must ever strive that the 
divine bounties and virtues bestowed upon him may prevail and 
control him.  Just now the soil of human hearts seems like black earth, 
but in the innermost substance of this dark soil there are thousands 
of fragrant flowers latent.  We must endeavor to cultivate and awaken 
these potentialities, discover the secret treasure in this very mine and 
depository of God, bring forth these resplendent powers long hidden 
in human hearts.  Then will the glories of both worlds be blended and 
increased and the quintessence of human existence be made manifest.  
     We must not be content with simply following a certain course 
because we find our fathers pursued that course.  It is the duty of 
everyone to investigate reality, and investigation of reality by another 
 
+P77 
will not do for us.  If all in the world were rich and one man poor, of 
what use are these riches to that man?  If all the world be virtuous and 
a man steeped in vice, what good results are forthcoming from him?  
If all the world be resplendent and a man blind, where are his benefits?  
If all the world be in plenty and a man hungry, what sustenance does 
he derive?  Therefore every man must be an investigator for himself.  
Ideas and beliefs left by his fathers and ancestors as a heritage will 
not suffice, for adherence to these are but imitations and imitations 
have ever been a cause of disappointment and misguidance.  Be investigators 
of reality, that you may attain the verity of truth and life.  
     You have asked why it was necessary for the soul that was from 
God to make this journey back to God.  Would you like to understand 
the reality of this question just as I teach it or do you wish to hear it 
as the world teaches it?--for if I should answer you according to the 
latter way, this would be but imitation and would not make the 
subject clear.  
     The reality underlying this question is that the evil spirit, Satan 
or whatever is interpreted as evil, refers to the lower nature in man.  
This baser nature is symbolized in various ways.  In man there are two 
expressions, one is the expression of nature, the other the expression 
of the spiritual realm.  The world of nature is defective.  Look at it 
clearly, casting aside all superstition and imagination.  If you should 
leave a man uneducated and barbarous in the wilds of Africa, would 
there be any doubt about his remaining ignorant?  God has never 
created an evil spirit; all such ideas and nomenclature are symbols 
expressing the mere human or earthly nature of man.  It is an essential 
condition of the soil of earth that thorns, weeds and fruitless trees 
may grow from it.  Relatively speaking, this is evil; it is simply the 
lower state and baser product of nature.  
     It is evident therefore that man is in need of divine education 
and inspiration; that the spirit and bounties of God are essential to 
his development.  That is to say, the teachings of Christ and the 
prophets are necessary for his education and guidance.  Why?  Because 
they are the divine gardeners who till the earth of human hearts and 
minds.  They educate man, uproot the weeds, burn the thorns and remodel 
the waste places into gardens and orchards where fruitful trees 
grow.  The wisdom and purpose of their training is that man must 
pass from degree to degree of progressive unfoldment until perfection 
is attained.  For instance, if a man should live his entire life in one city, 
he cannot gain a knowledge of the whole world.  To become perfectly 
informed he must visit other cities, see the mountains and valleys, 
cross the rivers and traverse the plains.  In other words, without 
progressive and universal education, perfection will not be attained.  
 
+P78 
     Man must walk in many paths and be subjected to various processes 
in his evolution upward.  Physically he is not born in full stature 
but passes through consecutive stages of foetus, infant, childhood, 
youth, maturity and old age.  Suppose he had the power to remain 
young throughout his life.  He then would not understand the meaning 
of old age and could not believe it existed.  If he could not realize the 
condition of old age he would not know that he was young.  He would 
not know the difference between young and old without experiencing 
the old.  Unless you have passed through the state of infancy how 
would you know this was an infant beside you?  If there was no wrong 
how would you recognize the right?  If it were not for sin how would 
you appreciate virtue?  If evil deeds were unknown how could you 
commend good actions?  If sickness did not exist how would you 
understand health?  Evil is non-existent; it is the absence of good; 
sickness is the loss of health; poverty the lack of riches.  When wealth 
disappears you are poor; you look within the treasure box but find 
nothing there.  Without knowledge there is ignorance; therefore 
ignorance is simply the lack of knowledge.  Death is the absence of 
life.  Therefore on the one hand we have existence; on the other, nonexistence, 
negation or absence of existence.  
     Briefly; the journey of the soul is necessary.  The pathway of 
life is the road which leads to divine knowledge and attainment.  
Without training and guidance the soul could never progress beyond 
the conditions of its lower nature which is ignorant and defective.  
 
+P79 
                         RELIGION:  
               ESSENTIAL AND NON-ESSENTIAL 
 
     The world of existence is an emanation of the merciful attribute 
of God.  God has shone forth upon the phenomena of being 
through His effulgence of mercy and He is clement and kind 
to all His creation.  Therefore the world of humanity must ever be the 
recipient of bounties from the eternal Lord; even as His Holiness 
Christ has declared, "Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in 
heaven."  For His bounties like the light and heat of the sun in the 
material heavens descend alike upon all mankind.  Consequently man 
must learn the lesson of kindness and beneficence from God Himself.  
Just as God is kind to all humanity, man also must be kind to his 
fellow creatures.  If his attitude is just and loving toward his fellow 
men, toward all creation, then indeed is he worthy of being pronounced 
the image and likeness of God.  
     Brotherhood or fraternity is of different kinds.  It may be family 
association, the intimate relationship of the household.  This is limited 
and subject to change and disruption.  How often it happens that in a 
family, love and agreement are changed into enmity and antagonism.  
Another form of fraternity is manifest in patriotism.  Man loves his 
fellow-men because they belong to the same nativity.  This is also 
limited and subject to change and disintegration, as for instance 
when sons of the same fatherland are opposed to each other in war, 
bloodshed and battle.  Still another brotherhood or fraternity is that 
which arises from racial unity, the oneness of racial origin, producing 
ties of affinity and association.  This likewise has its limitation and 
liability to change, for often war and deadly strife have been witnessed 
between people and nations of the same racial lineage.  There is a 
fourth kind of brotherhood, the attitude of man toward humanity 
itself, the altruistic love of humankind and recognition of the fundamental 
human bond.  Although this is unlimited it is nevertheless 
susceptible to change and destruction.  Even from this universal 
fraternal bond the looked-for result does not appear.  What is the 
looked-for result?  Loving-kindness among all human creatures and a 
firm, indestructible brotherhood which includes all the divine possibilities 
and significances in humanity.  Therefore it is evident that 
fraternity, love and kindness based upon family, nativity, race or an 
attitude of altruism are neither sufficient nor permanent since all of 
 
+P80 
them are limited, restricted and liable to change and disruption.  For 
in the family there is discord and alienation; among sons of the same 
fatherland strife and internecine warfare are witnessed; between those 
of a given race, hostility and hatred are frequent; and even among 
the altruists varying aspects of opinion and lack of unselfish devotion 
give little promise of permanent and indestructible unity among 
mankind.  
     Therefore the Lord of mankind has caused His holy divine 
Manifestations to come into the world.  He has revealed His heavenly 
books in order to establish spiritual brotherhood, and through the 
power of the Holy Spirit has made it practicable for perfect fraternity 
to be realized among mankind.  And when through the breaths of the 
Holy Spirit this perfect fraternity and agreement are established 
amongst men, this brotherhood and love being spiritual in character, 
this loving-kindness being heavenly, these constraining bonds being 
divine, a unity appears which is indissoluble, unchanging and never 
subject to transformation.  It is ever the same and will forever remain 
the same.  For example consider the foundation of the brotherhood laid 
by His Holiness Christ.  Observe how that fraternity was conducive 
to unity and accord and how it brought various souls to a plane of 
uniform attainment where they were willing to sacrifice their lives for 
each other.  They were content to renounce possessions and ready to 
joyously forfeit life itself.  They lived together in such love and 
fellowship that even Galen, the famous Greek philosopher, who was 
not a Christian, in his work entitled "The Progress of the Nations" 
says that religious beliefs are greatly conducive to the foundation of 
real civilization.  As a proof thereof he says, "A certain number of 
people contemporaneous with us are known as Christians.  These enjoy 
the superlative degree of moral civilization.  Each one of them is a 
great philosopher because they live together in the utmost love and 
good-fellowship.  They sacrifice life for each other.  They offer worldly 
possessions for each other.  You can say of the Christian people that 
they are as one person.  There is a bond amongst them that is indissoluble 
in character."  
     It is evident therefore that the foundation of real brotherhood, 
the cause of loving co-operation and reciprocity and the source of real 
kindness and unselfish devotion is none other than the breaths of the 
Holy Spirit.  Without this influence and animus it is impossible.  We 
may be able to realize some degrees of fraternity through other motives 
but these are limited associations and subject to change.  When human 
brotherhood is founded upon the Holy Spirit, it is eternal, changeless, 
unlimited.  
     In various parts of the Orient there was a time when brotherhood, 
 
+P81 
loving-kindness and all the praiseworthy qualities of mankind seemed 
to have disappeared.  There was no evidence of patriotic, religious or 
racial fraternity but conditions of bigotry, hatred and prejudice prevailed 
instead.  The adherents of each religion were violent enemies of 
the others, filled with the spirit of hostility and eager for shedding of 
blood.  The present war in the Balkans furnishes a parallel of these 
conditions.  Consider the bloodshed, ferocity and oppression manifested 
there even in this enlightened century; all of it based fundamentally 
upon religious prejudice and disagreement.  For the nations 
involved belong to the same races and nativities, nevertheless they are 
savage and merciless toward each other.  Similar deplorable conditions 
prevailed in Persia in the nineteenth century.  Darkness and ignorant 
fanaticism were widespread; no trace of fellowship or brotherhood 
existed amongst the races.  On the contrary, human hearts were filled 
with rage and hatred; darkness and gloom were manifest in human 
lives and conditions everywhere.  At such a time as this His Holiness 
&amp;Baha'u'llah appeared upon the divine horizon, even as the glory of 
the sun, and in that gross darkness and hopelessness of the human 
world there shone a great light.  He founded the oneness of the world 
of humanity, declaring that all mankind are as sheep and that God is 
the real and true shepherd.  The shepherd is one and all people are of 
his flock.  
     The world of humanity is one and God is equally kind to all.  
What then is the source of unkindness and hatred in the human 
world?  This real shepherd loves all his sheep.  He leads them in green 
pastures.  He rears and protects them.  What then is the source of 
enmity and alienation among humankind?  Whence this conflict and 
strife?  The real underlying cause is lack of religious unity and association 
for in each of the great religions we find superstition, blind imitation 
of creeds, and theological formulae adhered to instead of the 
divine fundamentals, causing difference and divergence among mankind 
instead of agreement and fellowship.  Consequently strife, hatred 
and warfare have arisen, based upon this divergence and separation.  
If we investigate the foundations of the divine religions, we find them 
to be one, absolutely changeless and never subject to transformation.  
For example each of the divine religions contains two kinds of laws or 
ordinances.  One division concerns the world of morality and ethical 
institutions.  These are the essential ordinances.  They instill and 
awaken the knowledge and love of God, love for humanity, the virtues 
of the world of mankind, the attributes of the divine kingdom, rebirth 
and resurrection from the kingdom of nature.  These constitute 
one kind of divine law which is common to all and never subject to 
change.  From the dawn of the Adamic cycle to the present day this 
 
+P82 
fundamental law of God has continued changeless.  This is the foundation 
of divine religion.  
     The second division comprises laws and institutions which provide 
for human needs and conditions according to exigencies of time 
and place.  These are accidental, of no essential importance and should 
never have been made the cause and source of human contention.  For 
example during the time of His Holiness Moses--Upon him be peace!
--according to the exigencies of that period, divorce was permissible.  
During the cycle of His Holiness Christ inasmuch as divorce was not 
in conformity with the time and conditions His Holiness Jesus Christ 
abrogated it.  In the cycle of Moses plurality of wives was permissible 
but during the time of His Holiness Christ the exigency which had 
sanctioned it did not exist, therefore it was forbidden.  His Holiness 
Moses lived in the wilderness and desert of Sinai; therefore his ordinances 
and commandments were in conformity with those conditions.  
The penalty for theft was to cut off a man's hand.  An ordinance 
of this kind was in keeping with desert life but not compatible 
with conditions of the present day.  Such ordinances therefore 
constitute the second or non-essential division of the divine religions 
and are not of importance for they deal with human transactions 
which are ever changing according to the requirements of time and 
place.  Therefore the intrinsic foundations of the divine religions are 
one.  As this is true, why should hostility and strife exist among them?  
Why should this hatred and warfare, ferocity and bloodshed continue?  
Is this allowable and justified?  God forbid!  
 
+P83 
                         RELIGION RENEWED 
 
     Creation is the expression of motion.  Motion is life.  A moving 
object is a living object whereas that which is motionless and 
inert is as dead.  All created forms are progressive in their 
planes or kingdoms of existence under the stimulus of the power or 
spirit of life.  The universal energy is dynamic.  Nothing is stationary 
in the material world of outer phenomena or in the inner world of 
intellect and consciousness.  
     Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality.  Therefore 
it must be living, vitalized, moving and progressive.  If it be without 
motion and non-progressive it is without the divine life; it is dead.  
The divine institutes are continuously active and evolutionary; therefore 
the revelation of them must be progressive and continuous.  All 
things are subject to re-formation.  This is a century of life and renewal.  
Sciences and arts, industry and invention have been reformed.  
Law and ethics have been reconstituted, reorganized.  The world of 
thought has been regenerated.  Sciences of former ages and philosophies 
of the past are useless today.  Present exigencies demand new methods 
of solution; world problems are without precedent.  Old ideas and 
modes of thought are fast becoming obsolete.  Ancient laws and archaic 
ethical systems will not meet the requirements of modern conditions, 
for this is clearly the century of a new life, the century of the revelation 
of the reality and therefore the greatest of all centuries.  Consider 
how the scientific developments of fifty years have surpassed and 
eclipsed the knowledge and achievements of all the former ages combined.  
Would the announcements and theories of ancient astronomers 
explain our present knowledge of the sun-worlds and planetary 
systems?  Would the mask of obscurity which beclouded mediaeval 
centuries meet the demand for clear-eyed vision and understanding which 
characterizes the world today?  In view of this, shall blind imitations of 
ancestral forms and theological interpretations continue to guide and 
control the religious life and spiritual development of humanity today?  
Shall man gifted with the power of reason unthinkingly follow 
and adhere to dogma, creeds and hereditary beliefs which will not 
bear the analysis of reason in this century of effulgent reality?  
Unquestionably this will not satisfy men of science, for when they find 
premise or conclusion contrary to present standards of proof and without 
real foundation, they reject that which has been formerly accepted 
as standard and correct and move forward from new foundations.  
 
+P84 
     The divine prophets have revealed and founded religion.  They 
have laid down certain laws and heavenly principles for the guidance 
of mankind.  They have taught and promulgated the knowledge of 
God, established praiseworthy ethical ideals and inculcated the 
highest standards of virtue in the human world.  Gradually these 
heavenly teachings and foundations of reality have been beclouded 
by human interpretations and dogmatic imitations of ancestral beliefs.  
The essential realities which the prophets labored so hard to 
establish in human hearts and minds while undergoing ordeals and 
suffering tortures of persecution, have now well nigh vanished.  Some 
of these heavenly messengers have been killed, some imprisoned; all 
of them despised and rejected while proclaiming the reality of divinity.  
Soon after their departure from this world, the essential truth of their 
teachings was lost sight of and dogmatic imitations adhered to.  
     Inasmuch as human interpretations and blind imitations differ 
widely, religious strife and disagreement have arisen among mankind, 
the light of true religion has been extinguished and the unity 
of the world of humanity destroyed.  The prophets of God voiced 
the spirit of unity and agreement.  They have been the founders of 
divine reality.  Therefore if the nations of the world forsake imitations 
and investigate the reality underlying the revealed Word of God they 
will agree and become reconciled.  For reality is one and not multiple.  
     The nations and religions are steeped in blind and bigoted imitations.  
A man is a Jew because his father was a Jew.  The Mohammedan 
follows implicitly the footsteps of his ancestors in belief and 
observance.  The Buddhist is true to his heredity as a Buddhist.  That 
is to say they profess religious belief blindly and without investigation, 
making unity and agreement impossible.  It is evident therefore that 
this condition will not be remedied without a re-formation in the 
world of religion.  In other words the fundamental reality of the divine 
religions must be renewed, reformed, revoiced to mankind.  
     From the seed of reality, religion has grown into a tree which 
has put forth leaves and branches, blossoms and fruit.  After a time 
this tree has fallen into a condition of decay.  The leaves and blossoms 
have withered and perished; the tree has become stricken and fruitless.  
It is not reasonable that man should hold to the old tree, claiming 
that its life forces are undiminished, its fruit unequalled, its existence 
eternal.  The seed of reality must be sown again in human hearts in 
order that a new tree may grow therefrom and new divine fruits refresh 
the world.  By this means the nations and peoples now divergent 
in religion will be brought into unity, imitations will be forsaken and a 
universal brotherhood in the reality itself will be established.  Warfare 
and strife will cease among mankind; all will be reconciled as servants 
 
+P85 
of God.  For all are sheltered beneath the tree of His providence and 
mercy.  God is kind to all; He is the giver of bounty to all alike, even as 
His Holiness Jesus Christ has declared that God "sendeth rain on the 
just and on the unjust;" that is to say, the mercy of God is universal.  
All humanity is under the protection of His love and favor, and unto 
all He has pointed the way of guidance and progress.  
     Progress is of two kinds, material and spiritual.  The former is 
attained through observation of the surrounding existence and constitutes 
the foundation of civilization.  Spiritual progress is through 
the breaths of the Holy Spirit and is the awakening of the conscious 
soul of man to perceive the reality of divinity.  Material progress insures 
the happiness of the human world.  Spiritual progress insures the 
happiness and eternal continuance of the soul.  The prophets of God 
have founded the laws of divine civilization.  They have been the root 
and fundamental source of all knowledge.  They have established the 
principles of human brotherhood or fraternity which is of various kinds, 
such as the fraternity of family, of race, of nation and of ethical 
motives.  These forms of fraternity, these bonds of brotherhood are 
merely temporal and transient in association.  They do not insure 
harmony and are usually productive of disagreement.  They do not 
prevent warfare and strife; on the contrary they are selfish, restricted 
and fruitful causes of enmity and hatred among mankind.  The spiritual 
brotherhood which is enkindled and established through the breaths 
of the Holy Spirit unites nations and removes the cause of warfare 
and strife.  It transforms mankind into one great family and establishes 
the foundations of the oneness of humanity.  It promulgates the spirit 
of international agreement and insures universal peace.  Therefore 
we must investigate the foundation reality of this heavenly fraternity.  
We must forsake all imitations and promote the reality of the 
divine teachings.  In accordance with these principles and actions 
and by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, both material and spiritual 
happiness shall become realized.  Until all nations and peoples become 
united by the bonds of the Holy Spirit in this real fraternity, 
until national and international prejudices are effaced in the reality 
of this spiritual brotherhood, true progress, prosperity and lasting 
happiness will not be attained by man.  This is the century of new and 
universal nationhood.  Sciences have advanced, industries have progressed, 
politics have been reformed, liberty has been proclaimed, 
justice is awakening.  This is the century of motion, divine stimulus 
and accomplishment; the century of human solidarity and altruistic 
service; the century of universal peace and the reality of the divine 
Kingdom.  
 
+P86 
                         DIVINE LOVE 
 
     Every subject presented to a thoughtful audience must be supported 
by rational proofs and logical arguments.  Proofs are 
of four kinds:  first, through sense-perception; second, through 
the reasoning faculty; third, from traditional or scriptural authority; 
fourth, through the medium of inspiration.  That is to say, there are 
four criterions or standards of judgment by which the human mind 
reaches its conclusions.  We will first consider the criterion of the senses.  
This is a standard still held to by the materialistic philosophers of 
the world.  They believe that whatever is perceptible to the senses is a 
verity, a certainty and without doubt existent.  For example, they say, 
"Here is a lamp which you see, and because it is perceptible to the 
sense of sight you cannot doubt its existence.  There is a tree; your 
sense of vision assures you of its reality which is beyond question.  
This is a man; you see that he is a man; therefore he exists."  In a 
word, everything confirmed by the senses is assumed to be as undoubted 
and unquestioned as the product of five multiplied by five; 
it cannot be twenty-six nor less than twenty-five.  Consequently the 
materialistic philosophers consider the criterion of the senses to be 
first and foremost.  
     But in the estimation of the divine philosophers this proof and 
assurance is not reliable; nay, rather, they deem the standard of the 
senses to be false because it is imperfect.  Sight, for instance, is one of 
the most important of the senses, yet it is subject to many aberrations 
and inaccuracies.  The eye sees the mirage as a body of water, regards 
images in the mirror as realities when they are but reflections.  A man 
sailing upon the river imagines that objects upon the shore are moving 
whereas he is in motion and they are stationary.  To the eye the earth 
appears fixed while the sun and stars revolve about it.  As a matter of 
fact the heavenly orbs are stationary and the earth turning upon its 
axis.  The colossal suns, planets and constellations which shine in the 
heavens appear small, nay, infinitesimal to human vision whereas in 
reality they are vastly greater than the earth in dimension and 
volume.  A whirling spark appears to the sight as a circle of fire.  There 
are numberless instances of this kind which show the error and inaccuracy 
of the senses.  Therefore the divine philosophers have considered 
this standard of judgment to be defective and unreliable.  
     The second criterion is that of the intellect.  The ancient philosophers 
in particular considered the intellect to be the most important 
 
+P87 
agency of judgment.  Among the wise men of Greece, Rome, Persia 
and Egypt the criterion of true proof was reason.  They held that every 
matter submitted to the reasoning faculty could be proved true or 
false and must be accepted or rejected accordingly.  But in the estimation 
of the people of insight this criterion is likewise defective and 
unreliable, for these same philosophers who held to reason or intellect 
as the standard of human judgment have differed widely among themselves 
upon every subject of investigation.  The statements of the 
Greek philosophers are contradictory to the conclusions of the Persian 
sages.  Even among the Greek philosophers themselves there is continual 
variance and lack of agreement upon any given subject.  Great 
difference of thought also prevailed between the wise men of Greece 
and Rome.  Therefore if the criterion of reason or intellect constituted 
a correct and infallible standard of judgment, those who tested and 
applied it should have arrived at the same conclusions.  As they differ 
and are contradictory in conclusions it is an evidence that the method 
and standard of test must have been faulty and insufficient.  
     The third criterion or standard of proof is traditional or scriptural, 
namely, that every statement of conclusion should be supported 
by traditions recorded in certain religious books.  When we come to 
consider even the holy books--the books of God--we are led to ask, 
"Who understands these books?  By what authority of explanation 
may these books be understood?"  It must be the authority of human 
reason, and if reason or intellect finds itself incapable of explaining 
certain questions, or if the possessors of intellect contradict each other 
in the interpretation of traditions, how can such a criterion be relied 
upon for accurate conclusions?  
     The fourth standard is that of inspiration.  In past centuries 
many philosophers have claimed illumination or revelation, prefacing 
their statements by the announcement that "this subject has been 
revealed through me" or "thus do I speak by inspiration."  Of this 
class were the philosophers of the Illuminati.  Inspirations are the 
promptings or susceptibilities of the human heart.  The promptings 
of the heart are sometimes satanic.  How are we to differentiate them?  
How are we to tell whether a given statement is an inspiration and 
prompting of the heart through the merciful assistance or through 
the satanic agency?  
     Consequently it has become evident that the four criterions or 
standards of judgment by which the human mind reaches its conclusions 
are faulty and inaccurate.  All of them are liable to mistake 
and error in conclusions.  But a statement presented to the mind accompanied 
by proofs which the senses can perceive to be correct, 
which the faculty of reason can accept, which is in accord with 
 
+P88 
traditional authority and sanctioned by the promptings of the heart, 
can be adjudged and relied upon as perfectly correct, for it has been 
proved and tested by all the standards of judgment and found to be 
complete.  When we apply but one test there are possibilities of mistake.  
This is self-evident and manifest.  
     We will now consider the subject of "Love" which has been 
suggested, submitting it to the four standards of judgment and thereby 
reaching our conclusions.  
     We declare that love is the cause of the existence of all phenomena 
and that the absence of love is the cause of disintegration or nonexistence.  
Love is the conscious bestowal of God, the bond of affiliation 
in all phenomena.  We will first consider the proof of this through 
sense-perception.  As we look upon the universe we observe that all 
composite beings or existing phenomena are made up primarily of 
single elements bound together by a power of attraction.  Through this 
power of attraction, cohesion has become manifest between atoms of 
these composing elements.  The resultant being is a phenomenon of the 
lower contingent type.  The power of cohesion expressed in the mineral 
kingdom is in reality love or affinity manifested in a low degree according 
to the exigencies of the mineral world.  We take a step higher 
into the vegetable kingdom where we find an increased power of attraction 
has become manifest among the composing elements which 
form phenomena.  Through this degree of attraction a cellular admixture 
is produced among these elements which make up the body of a 
plant.  Therefore in the degree of the vegetable kingdom there is love.  
We enter the animal kingdom and find the attractive power binding 
together single elements as in the mineral, plus the cellular admixture 
as in the vegetable, plus the phenomena of feelings or susceptibilities.  
We observe that the animals are susceptible to certain affiliation and 
fellowship, and that they exercise natural selection.  This elemental 
attraction, this admixture and selective affinity is love manifest in the 
degree of the animal kingdom.  
     Finally we come to the kingdom of man.  As this is the superior 
kingdom, the light of love is more resplendent.  In man we find the 
power of attraction among the elements which compose his material 
body, plus the attraction which produces cellular admixture or power 
augmentative, plus the attraction which characterizes the sensibilities 
of the animal kingdom, but still beyond and above all these lower 
powers we discover in the being of man the attraction of heart, the 
susceptibilities and affinities which bind men together, enabling them 
to live and associate in friendship and solidarity.  It is therefore 
evident that in the world of humanity the greatest king and sovereign 
is love.  If love were extinguished, the power of attraction dispelled, 
 
+P89 
the affinity of human hearts destroyed, the phenomena of human life 
would disappear.  
     This is a proof perceptible to the senses, acceptable to reason, 
in accord with traditions and teachings of the holy books and verified 
by the promptings of human hearts themselves.  It is a proof upon 
which we can absolutely rely and declare to be complete.  But these 
are only degrees of love which exist in the natural or physical world.  
Their manifestation is ever according to the requirement of natural 
conditions and standards.  
     Real love is the love which exists between God and His servants, 
the love which binds together holy souls.  This is the love of the 
spiritual world, not the love of physical bodies and organisms.  For 
example, consider and observe how the bestowals of God successively 
descend upon mankind; how the divine effulgences ever shine upon 
the human world.  There can be no doubt that these bestowals, these 
bounties, these effulgences emanate from love.  Unless love be the 
divine motive, it would be impossible for the heart of man to attain or 
receive them.  Unless love exists the divine blessing could not descend 
upon any object or thing.  Unless there be love the recipient of divine 
effulgence could not radiate and reflect that effulgence upon other 
objects.  If we are of those who perceive, we realize that the bounties 
of God manifest themselves continuously, even as the rays of the sun 
unceasingly emanate from the solar center.  The phenomenal world 
through the resplendent effulgence of the sun is radiant and bright.  
In the same way the realm of hearts and spirits is illumined and resuscitated 
through the shining rays of the Sun of Reality and the 
bounties of the love of God.  Thereby the world of existence, the kingdom 
of hearts and spirits is ever quickened into life.  Were it not for 
the love of God, hearts would be inanimate, spirits would wither and 
the reality of man would be bereft of the everlasting bestowals.  
     Consider to what extent the love of God makes itself manifest.  
Among the signs of His love which appear in the world are the dawning-point 
of His Manifestations.  What an infinite degree of love is 
reflected by the divine Manifestations toward mankind!  For the sake 
of guiding the people they have willingly forfeited their lives to 
resuscitate human hearts.  They have accepted the cross.  To enable 
human souls to attain the supreme degree of advancement, they have 
suffered during their limited years extreme ordeals and difficulties.  
If His Holiness Jesus Christ had not possessed love for the world of 
humanity, surely he would not have welcomed the cross.  He was 
crucified for the love of mankind.  Consider the infinite degree of that 
love.  Without love for humanity John the Baptist would not have 
offered his life.  It has been likewise with all the prophets and holy 
 
+P90 
souls.  If His Holiness the Bab had not manifested love for mankind, 
surely he would not have offered his breast for a thousand bullets.  If 
His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah had not been aflame with love for humanity 
he would not have willingly accepted forty years' imprisonment.  
     Observe how rarely human souls sacrifice their pleasure or comfort 
for others; how improbable that a man would offer his eye or 
suffer himself to be dismembered for the benefit of another.  Yet all 
the divine Manifestations suffered, offered their lives and blood, 
sacrificed their existence, comfort and all they possessed for the sake 
of mankind.  Therefore consider how much they love.  Were it not for 
their love for humanity, spiritual love would be mere nomenclature.  
Were it not for their illumination, human souls would not be radiant.  
How effective is their love!  This is a sign of the love of God; a ray of 
the Sun of Reality.  
     Therefore we must give praise unto God, for it is the light of His 
bounty which has shone upon us through His love which is everlasting.  
His divine Manifestations have offered their lives through love for us.  
Consider then what the love of God means.  Were it not for the love 
of God all the spirits would be inanimate.  The meaning of this is not 
physical death; nay, rather, it is that condition concerning which His 
Holiness Christ declared, "Let the dead bury their dead, for that which 
is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is 
spirit."  Were it not for the love of God the hearts would not be illumined.  
Were it not for the love of God the pathway of the Kingdom 
would not be opened.  Were it not for the love of God the holy books 
would not have been revealed.  Were it not for the love of God the divine 
prophets would not have been sent to the world.  The foundation of all 
these bestowals is the love of God.  Therefore in the human world there 
is no greater power than the love of God.  It is the love of God which 
has brought us together here tonight.  It is the love of God which is 
affiliating the East and the West.  It is the love of God which has 
resuscitated the world.  Now we must offer thanks to God that such a 
great bestowal and effulgence has been revealed to us.  
     We come to another aspect of our subject--Are the workings and 
effects of love confined to this world or do they extend on and on to 
another existence?  Will its influence affect our existence here only or 
will it extend to the life everlasting?  When we look upon the human 
kingdom we readily observe that it is superior to all others.  In the 
differentiation of life in the world of existence, there are four degrees 
or kingdoms,--the mineral, vegetable, animal, and human.  The 
mineral kingdom is possessed of a certain virtue which we term cohesion.  
The vegetable kingdom possesses cohesive properties plus the 
power of growth or power augmentative.  The animal kingdom is 
 
+P91 
possessed of the virtues of the mineral and vegetable plus the powers 
of the senses.  But the animal although gifted with sensibilities is utterly 
bereft of consciousness, absolutely out of touch with the world of 
consciousness and spirit.  The animal possesses no powers by which it 
can make discoveries which lie beyond the realm of the senses.  It has 
no power of intellectual origination.  For example, an animal located 
in Europe is not capable of discovering the continent of America.  It 
understands only phenomena which come within the range of its senses 
and instinct.  It cannot abstractly reason out anything.  The animal 
cannot conceive of the earth being spherical or revolving upon its 
axis.  It cannot apprehend that the little stars in the heavens are 
tremendous worlds vastly greater than the earth.  The animal cannot 
abstractly conceive of intellect.  Of these powers it is bereft.  Therefore 
these powers are peculiar to man and it is made evident that in the 
human kingdom there is a reality of which the animal is minus.  What 
is that reality?  It is the spirit of man.  By it man is distinguished above 
all the other phenomenal kingdoms.  Although he possesses all the 
virtues of the lower kingdoms he is further endowed with the spiritual 
faculty, the heavenly gift of consciousness.  
     All material phenomena are subject to nature.  All material 
organisms are captives of nature.  None of them can deviate in the 
slightest from the law of nature.  This earth, these great mountains, 
the animals with their wonderful powers and instincts cannot go beyond 
natural limitations.  All things are captives of nature except man.  
Man is the sovereign of nature; he breaks nature's laws.  Though an 
animal fitted by nature to live upon the surface of the earth he flies 
in the air like a bird, sails upon the ocean and dives deep beneath its 
waves in submarines.  Man is gifted with a power whereby he penetrates 
and discovers the laws of nature, brings them forth from the 
world of invisibility into the plane of visibility.  Electricity was once a 
latent force of nature.  According to nature's laws it should remain a 
hidden secret, but the spirit of man discovered it, brought it forth 
from its secret depository and made its phenomena visible.  It is 
evident and manifest that man is capable of breaking nature's laws.  
How does he accomplish it?  Through a spirit with which God has 
endowed him at creation.  This is a proof that the spirit of man 
differentiates and distinguishes him above all the lower kingdoms.  
It is this spirit to which the verse in the Old Testament refers when it 
states that man has been created "after the image and likeness of 
God".  The spirit of man alone penetrates the realities of God and 
partakes of the divine bounties.  
 
+P92 
                    THE FOUNDATION OF RELIGION 
 
     God is one; the effulgence of God is one; and humanity constitutes 
the servants of that one God.  God is kind to all.  He 
creates and provides for all; and all are under His care and 
protection.  The Sun of Truth, the Word of God shines upon all mankind; 
the divine cloud pours down its precious rain; the gentle zephyrs 
of His mercy blow and all humanity is submerged in the ocean of His 
eternal justice and loving-kindness.  
     But we have acted contrary to the will and good-pleasure of God.  
We have been the cause of enmity and disunion.  We have separated 
from each other and risen against each other in opposition and strife.  
How many have been the wars between peoples and nations!  What 
bloodshed!  Numberless are the cities and homes which have been laid 
waste.  All of this has been contrary to the good-pleasure of God for 
He hath willed love for humanity.  He is clement and merciful to all His 
creatures.  He hath ordained amity and fellowship amongst men.  
     Most regrettable of all is the state of difference and divergence 
we have created between each other in the name of religion imagining 
that a paramount duty in our religious belief is that of alienation and 
estrangement, that we should shun each other and consider each 
other contaminated with error and infidelity.  In reality the foundations 
of the divine religions are one and the same.  The differences 
which have arisen between us are due to blind imitations of dogmatic 
beliefs and adherence to ancestral forms of worship.  His Holiness 
Abraham was the founder of reality.  His Holiness Moses, His Holiness 
Christ, His Holiness Mohammed were the manifestations of reality.  
His Holiness &amp;Baha'u'llah was the glory of reality.  This is not simply 
an assertion; it will be proved.  
     Let me ask your closest attention in considering this subject.  
The divine religions embody two kinds of ordinances.  First, those 
which constitute essential or spiritual teachings of the Word of God.  
These are faith in God, the acquirement of the virtues which characterize 
perfect manhood, praiseworthy moralities, the acquisition of 
the bestowals and bounties emanating from the divine effulgences; in 
brief, the ordinances which concern the realm of morals and ethics.  
This is the fundamental aspect of the religion of God and this is of the 
highest importance because knowledge of God is the fundamental 
requirement of man.  Man must comprehend the oneness of divinity.  
He must come to know and acknowledge the precepts of God and 
 
+P93 
realize for a certainty that the ethical development of humanity is 
dependent upon religion.  He must get rid of all defects and seek the 
attainment of heavenly virtues in order that he may prove to be the 
image and likeness of God.  It is recorded in the holy bible that God 
said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."  It is self-evident 
that the image and likeness mentioned do not apply to the 
form and semblance of a human being because the reality of divinity 
is not limited to any form or figure.  Nay, rather the attributes and 
characteristics of God are intended.  Even as God is pronounced to be 
just, man must likewise be just.  As God is loving and kind to all men, 
man must likewise manifest loving-kindness to all humanity.  As God 
is loyal and truthful, man must show forth the same attributes in the 
human world.  Even as God exercises mercy toward all, man must 
prove himself to be the manifestation of mercy.  In a word, the "image 
and likeness of God" constitute the virtues of God, and man is intended 
to become the recipient of the effulgences of divine attributes.  
This is the essential foundation of all the divine religions, the reality 
itself, common to all.  His Holiness Abraham promulgated this; His 
Holiness Moses proclaimed it.  His Holiness Christ and all the prophets 
upheld this standard and aspect of divine religion.  
     Secondly:  Laws and ordinances which are temporary and non-essential.  
These concern human transactions and relations.  They are 
accidental and subject to change according to the exigencies of time 
and place.  These ordinances are neither permanent nor fundamental.  
For instance during the time of Noah it was expedient that sea foods 
be considered as lawful; therefore God commanded Noah to partake 
of all marine animal life.  During the time of Moses this was not in 
accordance with the exigencies of Israel's existence, therefore a second 
command was revealed partly abrogating the law concerning marine 
foods.  During the time of Abraham--Upon him be peace!--camel's 
milk was considered a lawful and acceptable food; likewise the flesh 
of the camel; but during Jacob's time because of a certain vow he 
made, this became unlawful.  These are non-essential temporary laws.  
In the holy bible there are certain commandments which according 
to those bygone times constituted the very spirit of the age, the very 
light of that period.  For example according to the law of the torah if a 
man committed theft of a certain amount they cut off his hand.  Is it 
practicable and reasonable in this present day to cut off a man's hand 
for the theft of a dollar?  In the torah there are ten ordinances concerning 
murder.  Could these be made effective today?  Unquestionably 
no; times have changed.  According to the explicit text of the bible if a 
man should change or break the law of the Sabbath or if he should 
touch fire on the Sabbath he must be killed.  Today such a law is 
 
+P94 
abrogated.  The torah declares that if a man should speak a disrespectful 
word to his father he should suffer the penalty of death.  Is this 
possible of enforcement now?  No; human conditions have undergone 
changes.  Likewise during the time of Christ certain minor ordinances 
conformable to that period were enforced.  
     It has been shown conclusively therefore that the foundation of 
the religion of God remains permanent and unchanging.  It is that 
fixed foundation which insures the progress and stability of the body 
politic and the illumination of humanity.  It has ever been the cause 
of love and justice amongst men.  It works for the true fellowship and 
unification of all mankind for it never changes and is not subject to 
supersedure.  The accidental or non-essential laws which regulate the 
transactions of the social body and everyday affairs of life are changeable 
and subject to abrogation.  
     Let me ask what is the purpose of prophethood?  Why has God 
sent the prophets?  It is self-evident that the prophets are the educators 
of men and the teachers of the human race.  They come to bestow 
universal education upon humanity, to give humanity training, to 
uplift the human race from the abyss of despair and desolation and 
enable man to attain the apogee of advancement and glory.  The people 
are in darkness; the prophets bring them into the realm of light.  They 
are in a state of utter imperfection; the prophets imbue them with 
perfections.  The purpose of the prophetic mission is no other than the 
education and guidance of the people.  Therefore we must regard and 
be on the lookout for the man who is thus qualified; that is to say any 
soul who proves to be the educator of mankind and the teacher of the 
human race is undoubtedly the prophet of his age.  
     For example let us review the events connected with the history 
of His Holiness Moses--Upon him be peace!  His Holiness dwelt in 
Midian at a time when the children of Israel were in captivity and 
bondage in the land of Egypt, subjected to every tyranny and severe 
oppression.  They were illiterate and ignorant, undergoing cruel ordeals 
and experiences.  They were in such a state of helplessness and impotence 
that it was proverbial to state that one Egyptian could overcome 
ten Israelites.  At such a time as this and under such forbidding 
conditions His Holiness Moses appeared and shone forth with a 
heavenly radiance.  He saved Israel from the bondage of Pharaoh 
and released them from captivity.  He led them out of the land of 
Egypt and into the Holy Land.  They had been scattered and broken; 
he unified and disciplined them; conferred upon them the blessing of 
wisdom and knowledge.  They had been slaves; he made them princes.  
They were ignorant; he made them learned; they were imperfect; he 
enabled them to attain perfection.  In a word--he led them out of their 
 
+P95 
condition of hopelessness and brought them to efficiency in the plane 
of confidence and valor.  They became renowned throughout the ancient 
world until finally in the zenith and splendor of their new civilization 
the glory of the sovereignty of Solomon was attained.  Through the 
guidance and training of His Holiness Moses these slaves and captives 
became the dominating people amongst the nations.  Not only in 
physical and military superiority were they renowned but in all the 
degrees of arts, letters and refinement their fame was widespread.  
Even the celebrated philosophers of Greece journeyed to Jerusalem 
in order to study with the Israelitish sages and many were the lessons 
of philosophy and wisdom they received.  Among these philosophers 
was the famous Socrates.  He visited the Holy Land and studied with 
the prophets of Israel, acquiring principles of their philosophical 
teaching and a knowledge of their advanced arts and sciences.  After 
his return to Greece he founded the system known as the unity of God.  
The Greek people rose against him and at last he was poisoned in the 
presence of the king.  Hippocrates and many other Greek philosophers 
sat at the feet of the learned Israelitish doctors and absorbed their 
expositions of wisdom and the inner truth.  
     Inasmuch as His Holiness Moses through the influence of his 
great mission was instrumental in releasing the Israelites from a low 
state of debasement and humiliation, establishing them in a station 
of prestige and glorification, disciplining and educating them, it is 
necessary for us to reach a fair and just judgment in regard to such a 
marvelous teacher.  For in this great accomplishment he stood single 
and alone.  Could he have made such a change and brought about such 
a condition among these people without the sanction and assistance 
of a heavenly power?  Could he have transformed a people from 
humiliation to glory without a holy and divine support?  
     No other than a divine power could have done this.  Therein lies 
the proof of prophethood because the mission of a prophet is education 
of the human race such as this personage accomplished, proving him 
to be a mighty prophet among the prophets, and his book the very 
Book of God.  This is a rational, direct and perfect proof.  
     In brief, His Holiness Moses--Upon whom be peace!--founded 
the law of God, purified the morals of the people of Israel and gave 
them an impetus toward nobler and higher attainments.  But after the 
departure of His Holiness Moses, following the decline of the glory of 
Solomon's era and during the reign of Jeroboam there came a great 
change in this nation.  The high ethical standards and spiritual perfections 
ceased to exist.  Conditions and morals became corrupt, religion 
was debased and the perfect principles of the Mosaic law were 
obscured in superstition and polytheism.  War and strife arose among

the tribes and their unity was destroyed.  The followers of Jeroboam 
declared themselves rightful and valid in kingly succession, and the 
supporters of Rehoboam made the same claim.  Finally the tribes were 
torn asunder by hostility and hatred, the glory of Israel was eclipsed 
and so complete was the degradation, that a golden calf was set up as 
an object of worship in the city of Tyre.  Thereupon God sent Elijah 
the prophet who redeemed the people, renewed the law of God and 
established an era of new life for Israel.  History shows a still later 
change and transformation when this oneness and solidarity were 
followed by another dispersion of the tribes.  Nebuchadnezzar, king 
of Babylon, invaded the Holy Land and carried away captive seventy 
thousand Israelites to Chaldea where the greatest reverses, trials and 
suffering afflicted these unfortunate people.  Then the prophets of God 
again reformed and re-established the law of God and the people in 
their humiliation again followed it.  This resulted in their liberation, 
and under the edict of Cyrus, king of Persia, there was a return to the 
holy city.  Jerusalem and the temple of Solomon were rebuilt and the 
glory of Israel was restored.  This lasted but a short time; the morality 
of the people declined and conditions reached an extreme degree until 
the Roman general Titus took Jerusalem and razed it to its foundations.  
Pillage and conquest completed the desolation; Palestine became 
a waste and wilderness and the Jews fled from the Holy Land of 
their ancestors.  The cause of this disintegration and dispersion was 
the departure of Israel from the foundation of the law of God revealed 
by Moses, namely the acquisition of divine virtues, morality, love, 
the development of arts and sciences and the spirit of the oneness of 
humanity.  
     I now wish you+F1 to examine certain facts and statements which 
are worthy of consideration.  My purpose and intention is to remove 
from the hearts of men the religious enmity and hatred which have 
fettered them and to bring all religions into agreement and unity.  
Inasmuch as this hatred and enmity, this bigotry and intolerance are 
outcomes of misunderstandings, the reality of religious unity will 
appear when these misunderstandings are dispelled.  For the foundation 
of the divine religions is one foundation.  This is the oneness of 
revelation or teaching; but alas! we have turned away from that 
foundation, holding tenaciously to various dogmatic forms and blind 
imitation of ancestral beliefs.  This is the real cause of enmity, hatred 
and bloodshed in the world; the reason of alienation and estrangement 
among mankind.  Therefore I wish you to be very just and fair in your 
judgment of the following statements.  
     During the time that the people of Israel were being tossed and 
 
+F1 The congregation of Eighth Street Temple, Washington, D.C.  
 
+P97 
afflicted by the conditions I have named, His Holiness Jesus Christ 
appeared among them.  Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew.  He was single 
and unaided, alone and unique.  He had no assistant.  The Jews at once 
pronounced him to be an enemy of Moses.  They declared that he was 
the destroyer of the Mosaic laws and ordinances.  Let us examine the 
facts as they are, investigate the truth and reality in order to arrive 
at a true opinion and conclusion.  For a completely fair opinion upon 
this question we must lay aside all we have and investigate independently.  
This personage Jesus Christ declared His Holiness Moses 
to have been the prophet of God and pronounced all the prophets of 
Israel as sent from God.  He proclaimed the torah the very Book of 
God, summoned all to conform to its precepts and follow its teachings.  
It is a historical fact that during a period of fifteen hundred years the 
kings of Israel were unable to promulgate broadcast the religion of 
Judaism.  In fact during that period the name and history of Moses 
were confined to the boundaries of Palestine and the torah was a book 
well known only in that country.  But through His Holiness Christ, 
through the blessing of the New Testament of Jesus Christ, the Old 
Testament, the torah, was translated into six hundred different tongues 
and spread throughout the world.  It was through Christianity that 
the torah reached Persia.  Before that time there was no knowledge in 
that country of such a book, but His Holiness Christ caused its spread 
and acceptance.  Through him the name of Moses was elevated and 
revered.  He was instrumental in publishing the name and greatness 
of the Israelitish prophets and he proved to the world that the Israelites 
constituted the people of God.  Which of the kings of Israel could 
have accomplished this?  Were it not for Jesus Christ would the bible, 
the torah, have reached this land of America?  Would the name of 
Moses be spread throughout the world?  Refer to history.  Everyone 
knows that when Christianity was spread, there was a simultaneous 
spread of the knowledge of Judaism and the torah.  Throughout the 
length and breadth of Persia there was not a single volume of the Old 
Testament until the religion of Jesus Christ caused it to appear everywhere, 
so that today the holy bible is a household book in that country.  
It is evident then that Christ was a friend of Moses, that he loved and 
believed in His Holiness Moses, otherwise he would not have commemorated 
his name and prophethood.  This is self-evident.  Therefore 
Christians and Jews should have the greatest love for each other because 
the founders of these two great religions have been in perfect 
agreement in book and teaching.  Their followers should be likewise.  
     We have already stated the valid proofs of prophethood.  We find 
the very evidences of the validity of His Holiness Moses were witnessed 
and duplicated in His Holiness Christ.  His Holiness Christ was 
 
+P98 
also a unique and single personage born of the lineage of Israel.  By 
the power of his Word he was able to unite people of the Roman, 
Greek, Chaldean, Egyptian and Assyrian nations.  Whereas they had 
been cruel, bloodthirsty and hostile, killing, pillaging and taking each 
other captive, he cemented them together in a perfect bond of unity 
and love.  He caused them to agree and become reconciled.  Such 
mighty effects were the results of the manifestation of one single soul.  
This proves conclusively that His Holiness Christ was assisted by 
God.  Today all Christians admit and believe that His Holiness Moses 
was a prophet of God.  They declare that his book was the Book of 
God, that the prophets of Israel were true and valid and that the 
people of Israel constituted the people of God.  What harm has come 
from this?  What harm could come from a statement by the Jews that 
Jesus was also a manifestation of the Word of God?  Have the Christians 
suffered for their belief in Moses?  Have they experienced any loss of 
religious enthusiasm or witnessed any defeat in their religious belief 
by declaring that His Holiness Moses was a prophet of God, that the 
torah was a Book of God and that all the prophets of Israel were 
prophets of God?  It is evident that no loss comes from this.  And now 
it is time for the Jews to declare that Christ was the Word of God and 
then this enmity between two great religions will pass away.  For two 
thousand years this enmity and religious prejudice have continued.  
Blood has been shed, ordeals have been suffered.  These few words will 
remedy the difficulty and unite two great religions.  What harm could 
follow this,--that just as the Christians glorify and praise the name of 
Moses, likewise the Jews should commemorate the name of Christ, 
declare him to be the Word of God and consider him as one of the 
chosen messengers of God?  
     A few words concerning the koran and the Mohammedans:  
When His Holiness Mohammed appeared he spoke of Moses as the 
great man of God.  In the koran he refers to the sayings of Moses in 
seven different places, proclaims him a prophet and the possessor of a 
Book, the founder of the law, and the spirit of God.  He said, "Whosoever 
believes in him is acceptable in the estimation of God and whosoever 
shuns him or any of the prophets is rejected of God."  Even in 
conclusion he calls upon his own relatives, saying, "Why have ye 
shunned and not believed in Moses?  Why have ye not acknowledged 
the torah?  Why have ye not believed in the Jewish prophets?"  In a 
certain surat of the koran he mentions the names of twenty-eight of 
the prophets of Israel, praising each and all of them.  To this great 
extent he has ratified and commended the prophets and religion of 
Israel.  The purport is this,--that Mohammed praised and glorified 
His Holiness Moses and confirmed Judaism.  He declared that whosoever 
 
+P99 
denies Moses is contaminated and even if he repents, his repentance 
will not be accepted.  He pronounced his own relatives infidels 
and impure because they had denied the prophets.  He said, 
"Because you have not believed in Christ, because you have not believed 
in Moses, because you have not believed in the gospels you are 
infidels and contaminated."  In this way Mohammed has praised the 
torah, Moses, Christ and the prophets of the past.  He appeared 
amongst the Arabs who were a people nomadic and illiterate, barbarous 
in nature and blood-thirsty.  He guided and trained them until 
they attained a high degree of development.  Through his education 
and discipline they rose from the lowest levels of ignorance to the 
heights of knowledge, becoming masters of erudition and philosophy.  
We see therefore that the proofs applicable to one prophet are equally 
applicable to another.  
     In conclusion; since the prophets themselves, the founders, have 
loved, praised and testified of each other, why should we disagree 
and be alienated?  God is one.  He is the shepherd of all.  We are his 
sheep and therefore should live together in love and unity.  We should 
manifest the spirit of justness and good-will toward each other.  Shall 
we do this or shall we censure and pronounce anathema, praising ourselves 
and condemning all others?  What possible good can come from 
such attitude and action?  On the contrary, nothing but enmity and 
hatred, injustice and inhumanity can possibly result.  Has not this 
been the greatest cause of bloodshed, woe and tribulation in the past?  
     Praise be to God!  You are living in a land of freedom.  You are 
blessed with men of learning, men who are well versed in the comparative 
study of religions.  You realize the need of unity and know 
the great harm which comes from prejudice and superstition.  I ask 
you, Is not fellowship and brotherhood preferable to enmity and 
hatred in society and community?  The answer is self-evident.  Love 
and fellowship are absolutely needful to win the good-pleasure of 
God which is the goal of all human attainment.  We must be united.  
We must love each other.  We must ever praise each other.  We must 
bestow commendation upon all people, thus removing the discord and 
hatred which have caused alienation amongst men.  Otherwise the 
conditions of the past will continue, praising ourselves and condemning 
others; religious wars will have no end and religious prejudice, the 
prime cause of this havoc and tribulation, will increase.  This must be 
abandoned, and the way to do it is to investigate the reality which 
underlies all the religions.  This underlying reality is the love of humanity.  
For God is one and humanity is one, and the only creed of the 
prophets is love and unity.  
 
+P100 
                    THE QUICKENING SPIRIT 
 
     Today the human world is in need of a great power by which 
these glorious principles and purposes may be executed.  The 
cause of peace is a very great cause; it is the cause of God, 
and all the forces of the world are opposed to it.  Governments for 
instance, consider militarism as the step to human progress, that 
division among men and nations is the cause of patriotism and honor, 
that if one nation attack and conquer another, gaining wealth, territory 
and glory thereby, this warfare and conquest, this bloodshed and 
cruelty are the cause of that victorious nation's advancement and 
prosperity.  This is an utter mistake.  Compare the nations of the 
world to the members of a family.  A family is a nation in miniature.  
Simply enlarge the circle of the household and you have the nation.  
Enlarge the circle of nations and you have all humanity.  The conditions 
surrounding the family surround the nation.  The happenings 
in the family are the happenings in the life of the nation.  Would it add 
to the progress and advancement of a family if dissensions should arise 
among its members, fighting, pillaging each other, jealous and revengeful 
of injury, seeking selfish advantage?  Nay, this would be 
the cause of the effacement of progress and advancement.  So it is 
in the great family of nations, for nations are but an aggregate of 
families.  Therefore as strife and dissension destroy a family and 
prevent its progress, so nations are destroyed and advancement 
hindered.  
     All the heavenly books, divine prophets, sages and philosophers 
agree that warfare is destructive to human development, and peace 
constructive.  They agree that war and strife strike at the foundations 
of humanity.  Therefore a power is needed to prevent war and to 
proclaim and establish the oneness of humanity.  
     But knowledge of the need of this power is not sufficient.  Realizing 
that wealth is desirable is not becoming wealthy.  The admission 
that scientific attainment is praiseworthy does not confer scientific 
knowledge.  Acknowledgment of the excellence of honor does not make 
a man honorable.  Knowledge of human conditions and the needed 
remedy for them is not the cause of their betterment.  To admit that 
health is good does not constitute health.  A skilled physician is needed 
to remedy existing human conditions.  As a physician is required to 
have complete knowledge of pathology, diagnosis, therapeutics and 
treatment, so this world physician must be wise, skillful and capable 
 
+P101 
before health will result.  His mere knowledge is not health; it must be 
applied and the remedy carried out.  
     The attainment of any object is conditioned upon knowledge, 
volition and action.  Unless these three conditions are forthcoming 
there is no execution or accomplishment.  In the erection of a house 
it is first necessary to know the ground and design the house suitable 
for it; second, to obtain the means or funds necessary for the construction; 
third, to actually build it.  Therefore a power is needed to 
carry out and execute what is known and admitted to be the remedy 
for human conditions; namely, the unification of mankind.  Furthermore, 
it is evident that this cannot be realized through material 
process and means.  The accomplishment of this unification cannot be 
through racial power, for races are different and diverse in tendencies.  
It cannot be through patriotic power, for nationalities are unlike.  Nor 
can it be effected through political power since the policies of governments 
and nations are various.  That is to say, any effort toward 
unification through these material means would benefit one and injure 
another because of unequal and individual interests.  Some may believe 
this great remedy can be found in dogmatic insistence upon 
imitations and interpretations.  This would likewise be without foundation 
and result.  Therefore it is evident that no means but an ideal 
means, a spiritual power, divine bestowals and the breaths of the 
Holy Spirit will heal this world sickness of war, dissension and discord.  
Nothing else is possible; nothing can be conceived of.  But through 
spiritual means and the divine power it is possible and practicable.  
     Consider history.  What has brought unity to nations, morality 
to peoples and benefits to mankind?  If we reflect upon it we will find 
that establishing the divine religions has been the greatest means 
toward accomplishing the oneness of humanity.  The foundation of 
divine reality in religion has done this; not imitations of ancestral 
religious forms.  Imitations are opposed to each other and have ever 
been the cause of strife, enmity, jealousy and war.  The divine religions 
are collective centers in which diverse standpoints may meet, agree 
and unify.  They accomplish oneness of nativities, races and policies.  
For instance, His Holiness Christ united various nations, brought 
peace to warring peoples and established the oneness of human kind.  
The conquering Greeks and Romans, the prejudiced Egyptians and 
Assyrians were all in a condition of strife, enmity and war but His 
Holiness gathered these varied peoples together and removed the 
foundations of discord; not through racial, patriotic or political power 
but through divine power, the power of the Holy Spirit.  This was not 
otherwise possible.  All other efforts of men and nations remain as 
mere mention in history, without accomplishment.  
 
+P102 
     As this great result is contingent upon divine power and bestowals, 
where shall the world obtain that power?  God is eternal and ancient; 
not a new God.  His sovereignty is of old, not recent; not merely 
existent these five or six thousand years.  This infinite universe is from 
everlasting.  The sovereignty, power, names and attributes of God are 
eternal, ancient.  His names presuppose creation and predicate His 
existence and will.  We say God is creator.  This name creator appears 
when we connote creation.  We say God is the provider.  This name presupposes 
and proves the existence of the provided.  God is love.  This 
name proves the existence of the beloved.  In the same way God is 
mercy, God is justice, God is life, etc., etc.  Therefore as God is creator, 
eternal and ancient, there were always creatures and subjects existing 
and provided for.  There is no doubt that divine sovereignty is eternal.  
Sovereignty necessitates subjects, ministers, trustees and others subordinate 
to sovereignty.  Could there be a king without country, subjects 
and armies?  If we conceive of a time when there were no creatures, 
no servants, no subjects of divine lordship we dethrone God and predicate 
a time when God was not.  It would be as if He had been recently 
appointed and man had given these names to Him.  The divine sovereignty 
is ancient, eternal.  God from everlasting was love, justice, 
power, creator, provider, the omniscient, the bountiful.  
     As the divine entity is eternal, the divine attributes are co-existent, 
co-eternal.  The divine bestowals are therefore without beginning, 
without end.  God is infinite; the works of God are infinite; 
the bestowals of God are infinite.  As His divinity is eternal, His lordship 
and perfections are without end.  As the bounty of the Holy 
Spirit is eternal, we can never say that His bestowals terminate, else 
He terminates.  If we think of the sun and then try to conceive of the 
cessation of the solar flame and heat, we have predicated the non-existence 
of the sun.  For separation of the sun from its rays and heat 
is inconceivable.  Therefore if we limit the bestowals of God we limit 
the attributes of God and limit God.  
     Let us then trust in the bounty and bestowal of God.  Let us be 
exhilarated with the divine breath, illumined and exalted by the 
heavenly glad-tidings.  God has ever dealt with man in mercy and 
kindness.  He who conferred the divine spirit in former times is 
abundantly able and capable at all times and periods to grant the 
same bestowals.  Therefore let us be hopeful.  The God who gave to the 
world formerly will do so now and in the future.  God who breathed 
the breath of the Holy Spirit upon His servants will breathe it upon 
them now and hereafter.  There is no cessation to His bounty.  The 
divine spirit is penetrating from eternity to eternity for it is the 
bounty of God and the bounty of God is eternal.  Can you conceive of 
 
+P103 
limitation of the divine power in atomic verities or cessation of the 
divine bounty in existing organisms?  Could you conceive the power 
now manifest in this glass in cohesion of its atoms, becoming non-existent?  
The energy by which the water of the sea is constituted, 
failing to exert itself and the sea disappearing?  A shower of rain today 
and no more showers afterward?  The effulgence of the sun 
terminated and no more light or heat?  
     When we observe that in the kingdom of minerals the divine 
bounties are continuous, how much more shall we expect and realize 
in the divine spiritual Kingdom!  How much greater the radiation of 
the lights of God and the bounty of life everlasting upon the soul of 
man!  As the body of the universe is continuous, indestructible, the 
bounties and bestowals of the divine spirit are everlasting.  
     I praise God that I am privileged to be present in this revered 
assembly+F1 which is quickened with spiritual susceptibilities and 
heavenly attraction; its members investigating the reality; their 
utmost hope the establishment of international peace and their 
greatest purpose service to the world of humanity.  
     When we observe the world of created phenomena we discover 
that each atom of the atoms of substance is moving through the 
various degrees and kingdoms of organic life.  For instance, consider 
the ethereal element which is penetrating and traveling through all 
the contingent realities.  When there is vibration or movement in the 
ethereal element, the eye is affected by that vibration and beholds 
what is known as light.  
     In the same manner the bestowals of God are moving and circulating 
throughout all created things.  This illimitable divine bounty 
has no beginning and will have no ending.  It is moving, circulating 
and becomes effective wherever capacity is developed to receive it.  
In every station there is a specialized capacity.  Therefore we must 
be hopeful that through the bounty and favor of God, this spirit of 
life infusing all created things shall quicken humanity and from its 
bestowals the human world become a divine world, this earthly kingdom 
the mirror of the realm of divinity, the virtues and perfections of 
the world of humanity become unveiled and the image and likeness 
of God be reflected from this temple.

                         THE LAW OF GOD 
 
     Surely for everything there is an all-comprehending wisdom; 
especially for the great and important affairs of life.  The supreme 
and most important happening in the human world is the Manifestation 
of God and the descent of the law of God.  The holy, divine 
Manifestations did not reveal themselves for the purpose of founding 
a nation, sect or faction.  They did not appear in order that a certain 
number might acknowledge their prophethood.  They did not declare 
their heavenly mission and message in order to lay the foundation for 
a religious belief.  Even His Holiness Christ did not become manifest 
that we should merely believe in him as the Christ, follow him and 
adore his mention.  All these are limited in scope and requirement 
whereas the Reality of Christ is an unlimited essence.  The infinite and 
unlimited Reality cannot be bounded by any limitation.  Nay, rather 
His Holiness Christ appeared in order to illumine the world of humanity, 
to render the earthly world celestial, to make the human 
kingdom a realm of angels, to unite the hearts, to enkindle the light 
of love in human souls, so that such souls might become independent, 
attaining complete unity and fellowship, turning to God, entering 
into the divine Kingdom, receiving the bounties and bestowals of God 
and partaking of the manna from heaven.  Through Christ they were 
intended to be baptized by the Holy Spirit, attain a new spirit and 
realize the life everlasting.  All the holy precepts and the announcements 
of prophetic laws were for these various and heavenly purposes.  
Therefore we offer thanks to God that although no earthly relation 
obtains among us, yet--Praise be to God!--ideal and divine bonds 
blend us together.  We have gathered here in this meeting, eagerly 
anticipating the showing forth of the divine bestowals.  
     In past centuries the nations of the world have imagined that 
the law of God demanded blind imitation of ancestral forms of belief 
and worship.  For example the Jews were captives of hereditary racial 
religious observances.  The Mohammedans likewise have been held in 
the bondage of traditionary forms and ceremonials.  The Christians also 
have been implicit followers of ancient tradition and hereditary 
teaching.  At the same time the basic foundation of the religion of 
God which was ever the principle of love, unity and the fellowship of 
humanity has been forsaken and cast aside, each religious system 
holding tenaciously to imitations of ancestral forms as the supreme 
essential.  Therefore hatred and hostility have appeared in the world 
 
+P105 
instead of the divine fruitage of unity and love.  By reason of this it 
has been impossible for the followers of religion to meet together in 
fellowship and agreement.  Even contact and communication have 
been considered contaminating and the outcome has been a condition 
of complete alienation and mutual bigotry.  There has been no investigation 
of the essential underlying basis of reality.  One whose 
father was a Jew, invariably proved to be a Jew; a Mohammedan 
was born of a Mohammedan; a Buddhist was a Buddhist because of 
the faith of his father before him; and so on.  In brief, religion was a 
heritage descending from father to son, ancestry to posterity without 
investigation of the fundamental reality; consequently all religionists 
were veiled, obscured and at variance.  
     Praise be to God!  We are living in this most radiant century 
wherein human perceptions have developed and investigations of 
real foundations characterize mankind.  Individually and collectively 
man is proving and penetrating into the reality of outer and inner conditions.  
Therefore it has come to pass that we are renouncing all that 
savors of blind imitation, and impartially and independently investigating 
truth.  Let us understand what constitutes the reality of 
the divine religions.  If a Christian sets aside traditionary forms and 
blind imitation of ceremonials and investigates the reality of the 
gospels, he will discover that the foundation principles of the teachings 
of His Holiness Christ were mercy, love, fellowship, benevolence, 
altruism, the resplendence or radiance of divine bestowals, acquisition 
of the breaths of the Holy Spirit and oneness with God.  Furthermore 
he will learn that His Holiness declared that the Father "maketh his 
sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just 
and on the unjust."  The meaning of this declaration is that the mercy 
of God encircles all mankind; that not a single individual is deprived 
of the mercy of God; and no soul is denied the resplendent bestowals 
of God.  The whole human race is submerged in the sea of the mercy 
of the Lord and we are all the sheep of the one divine shepherd.  Whatever 
shortcomings exist among us must be remedied.  For example 
those who are ignorant must be educated so that they may become 
wise; the sick must be treated until they recover; those who are immature 
must be trained in order to reach maturity; those asleep must 
be awakened.  All this must be accomplished through love and not 
through hatred and hostility.  Furthermore His Holiness Jesus Christ 
referring to the prophecy of Isaiah, spoke of those who "having eyes, 
see not, having ears, hear not, having hearts, understand not," yet 
they were to be healed.  Therefore it is evident that the bounties of 
Christ transformed the eye which was blind into a seeing one, rendered 
the ear which was formerly deaf, attentive, and made the hard, 
 
+P106 
callous heart tender and sensitive.  In other words the meaning is that 
although the people possess external eyes, yet the insight or perception 
of the soul is blind; although the outer ear hears, the spiritual 
hearing is deaf; although they possess conscious hearts they are without 
illumination; and the bounties of His Holiness Christ save souls 
from these conditions.  It is evident then that the manifestation of the 
Messiah was synonymous with universal mercy.  His providence was 
universal and his teachings were for all.  His lights were not restricted 
to a few.  Every "Christ" came to the world of mankind.  Therefore we 
must investigate the foundation of divine religion, discover its reality, 
re-establish it and spread its message throughout the world so that it 
may become the source of illumination and enlightenment to mankind, 
the spiritually dead become alive, the spiritually blind receive 
sight and those who are inattentive to God become awakened.  
 
+P107 
                    CONTINUITY OF REVELATION 
 
     Those who are uninformed of the world of reality, who do not 
comprehend existing things, who are without perception of the 
inner truth of creation, who do not penetrate the real mysteries 
of material and spiritual phenomena and who possess only a superficial 
idea of universal life and being are but embodiments of pure 
ignorance.  They believe only that which they have heard from their 
fathers and ancestors.  Of themselves they have no hearing, no sight, 
no reason, no intellect; they rely solely upon tradition.  Such persons 
imagine that the dominion of God is an accidental dominion or 
kingdom.  
     For instance they believe that this world of existence was created 
six or seven thousand years ago; as if God did not reign before that 
time and had no creation before that period.  They think that divinity 
is accidental, for to them divinity is dependent upon existing things 
whereas in reality as long as there has been a God there has been a 
creation.  As long as there has been light, there have been recipients 
of that light, for light cannot become manifest unless those things 
which perceive and appreciate it exist.  The world of divinity presupposes 
creation, presupposes recipients of bounty, presupposes the 
existence of worlds.  No divinity can be conceived as separate from 
creation, for otherwise it would be like imagining an empire without a 
people.  A king must needs have a kingdom, must needs have an army 
and subjects.  Is it possible to be a king and have no country, no army, 
no subjects?  This is an absurdity.  If we say that there was a time 
when there was no country, no army and no subjects, how then could 
there have been a king and ruler?  For these things are essential to a 
king.  
     Consequently just as the reality of divinity never had a beginning,
--that is, God has ever been a creator, God has ever been a provider, 
God has ever been a quickener, God has ever been a bestower,--so 
there never has been a time when the attributes of God have not had 
expression.  The sun is the sun because of its rays, because of its heat.  
Were we to conceive of a time when there was a sun without heat and 
light, it would imply that there had been no sun at all and that it 
became the sun afterward.  So likewise if we say there was a time when 
God had no creation or created beings, a time when there were no 
recipients of His bounties and that His names and attributes had not 
been manifested, this would be equivalent to a complete denial of 
 
+P108 
divinity, for it would mean that divinity is accidental.  To explain it 
still more clearly, if we think that fifty thousand years ago or one 
hundred thousand years ago there was no creation, that there were 
then no worlds, no human beings, no animals, this thought of ours 
would mean that previous to that period there was no divinity.  If we 
should say that there was a time when there was a king but there 
were no subjects, no army, no country for him to rule over, it would 
really be asserting that there was a time when no king existed and 
that the king is accidental.  It is therefore evident that inasmuch as 
the reality of divinity is without a beginning, creation is also without 
a beginning.  This is as clear as the sun.  When we contemplate this 
vast machinery of omnipresent power, perceive this illimitable space 
and its innumerable worlds it will become evident to us that the lifetime 
of this infinite creation is more than six thousand years; nay, it is 
very, very ancient.  
     Notwithstanding this, we read in Genesis in the Old Testament 
that the lifetime of creation is but six thousand years.  This has an 
inner meaning and significance; it is not to be taken literally.  For 
instance it is said in the Old Testament that certain things were 
created in the first day.  The narrative shows that at that time the sun 
was not yet created.  How could we conceive of a day if no sun existed 
in the heavens; for the day depends upon the light of the sun?  Inasmuch 
as the sun had not been made, how could the first day be realized?  
Therefore these statements have significances other than literal.  
     To be brief; our purpose is to show that the divine sovereignty, 
the Kingdom of God, is an ancient sovereignty; that it is not an 
accidental sovereignty; just as a kingdom presupposes the existence 
of subjects, of an army, of a country; for otherwise the state of 
dominion, authority and kingdom cannot be conceived of.  Therefore 
if we should imagine that the creation is accidental we would be 
forced to admit that the creator is accidental whereas the divine 
bounty is ever flowing and the rays of the Sun of Truth are continuously 
shining.  No cessation is possible to the divine bounty, just 
as no cessation is possible to the rays of the sun.  This is clear and 
obvious.  
     Thus there have been many holy Manifestations of God.  One 
thousand years ago, two hundred thousand years ago, one million 
years ago the bounty of God was flowing, the radiance of God was 
shining, the dominion of God was existing.  
     Why do these holy Manifestations of God appear?  What is the 
wisdom and purpose of their coming?  What is the outcome of their 
mission?  It is evident that human personality appears in two aspects,
--the image or likeness of God and the aspect of Satan.  The human 
 
+P109 
reality stands between these two,--the divine and the satanic.  It is 
manifest that beyond this material body, man is endowed with 
another reality which is the world of exemplars constituting the 
heavenly body of man.  In speaking, man says, "I saw," "I spoke," 
"I went."  Who is this "I"?  It is obvious that this "I" is different from 
this body.  It is clear that when man is thinking, it is as though he 
were consulting with some other person.  With whom is he consulting?  
It is evident that it is another reality or one aside from this body 
with whom he enters into consultation when he thinks, "Shall I do 
this work or not?"  "What will be the result of my doing this?"  Or 
when he questions the other reality, "What is the objection to this 
work if I do it?"  And then that reality in man communicates its 
opinion to him concerning the point at issue.  Therefore that reality 
in man is clearly and obviously other than his body, an ego with 
which man enters into consultation and whose opinion man seeks.  
     Often a man makes up his mind positively about a matter; for 
instance he determines to undertake a journey.  Then he thinks it 
over, that is, he consults his inner reality and finally concludes that 
he will give up his journey.  What has happened?  Why did he abandon 
his original purpose?  It is evident that he has consulted his inner 
reality which expresses to him the disadvantages of such a journey, 
therefore he defers to that reality and changes his original intention.  
     Furthermore man sees in the world of dreams.  He travels in the 
East, he travels in the West, although his body is stationary, his 
body is here.  It is that reality in him which makes the journey while 
the body sleeps.  There is no doubt that a reality exists other than the 
outward, physical reality.  Again for instance a person is dead, is 
buried in the ground.  Afterward you see him in the world of dreams 
and speak with him although his body is interred in the earth.  Who is 
the person you see in your dreams, talk to and who also speaks with 
you?  This again proves that there is another reality different from the 
physical one which dies and is buried.  Thus it is certain that in man 
there is a reality which is not the physical body.  Sometimes the body 
becomes weak but that other reality is in its own normal state.  The 
body goes to sleep, becomes as one dead but that reality is moving 
about, comprehending things, expressing them and is even conscious 
of itself.  
     This other and inner reality is called the heavenly body, the 
ethereal form which corresponds to this body.  This is the conscious 
reality which discovers the inner meaning of things, for the outer 
body of man does not discover anything.  The inner ethereal reality 
grasps the mysteries of existence, discovers scientific truths and indicates 
their technical application.  It discovers electricity, produces 
 
+P110 
the telegraph, the telephone and opens the door to the world of arts.  
If the outer material body did this, the animal would likewise be able 
to make scientific and wonderful discoveries, for the animal shares 
with man all physical powers and limitations.  What then is that power 
which penetrates the realities of existence and which is not to be found 
in the animal?  It is the inner reality which comprehends things, 
throws light upon the mysteries of life and being, discovers the 
heavenly Kingdom, unseals the mysteries of God and differentiates 
man from the brute.  Of this there can be no doubt.  
     As we have before indicated, this human reality stands between 
the higher and the lower in man, between the world of the animal 
and the world of divinity.  When the animal proclivity in man becomes 
predominant, he sinks even lower than the brute.  When the heavenly 
powers are triumphant in his nature, he becomes the noblest and most 
superior being in the world of creation.  All the imperfections found in 
the animal are found in man.  In him there is antagonism, hatred and 
selfish struggle for existence; in his nature lurk jealousy, revenge, 
ferocity, cunning, hypocrisy, greed, injustice and tyranny.  So to 
speak, the reality of man is clad in the outer garment of the animal, 
the habiliments of the world of nature, the world of darkness, imperfections 
and unlimited baseness.  
     On the other hand, we find in him justice, sincerity, faithfulness, 
knowledge, wisdom, illumination, mercy and pity coupled with intellect, 
comprehension, the power to grasp the realities of things and 
the ability to penetrate the truths of existence.  All these great perfections 
are to be found in man.  Therefore we say that man is a reality 
which stands between light and darkness.  From this standpoint of 
view, his nature is threefold, animal, human and divine.  The animal 
nature is darkness; the heavenly is light in light.  
     The holy Manifestations of God come into the world to dispel 
the darkness of the animal or physical nature of man, to purify him 
from his imperfections in order that his heavenly and spiritual nature 
may become quickened, his divine qualities awakened, his perfections 
visible, his potential powers revealed and all the virtues of the world 
of humanity latent within him may come to life.  These holy Manifestations 
of God are the educators and trainers of the world of 
existence, the teachers of the world of humanity.  They liberate man 
from the darkness of the world of nature, deliver him from despair, 
error, ignorance, imperfections and all evil qualities.  They clothe him 
in the garment of perfections and exalted virtues.  Men are ignorant; 
the Manifestations of God make them wise.  They are animalistic; the 
Manifestations make them human.  They are savage and cruel; the 
Manifestations lead them into kingdoms of light and love.  They are 
 
+P111 
unjust; the Manifestations cause them to become just.  Man is selfish; 
they sever him from self and desire.  Man is haughty; they make him 
meek, humble and friendly.  He is earthly; they make him heavenly.  
Men are material; the Manifestations transform them into semblance 
divine.  They are immature children; the Manifestations develop them 
into maturity.  Man is poor; they endow him with wealth.  Man is base, 
treacherous and mean; the Manifestations of God uplift him into 
dignity, nobility and loftiness.  
     These holy Manifestations liberate the world of humanity from 
the imperfections which beset it and cause men to appear in the 
beauty of heavenly perfections.  Were it not for the coming of these 
holy Manifestations of God all mankind would be found on the plane 
of the animal.  They would remain darkened and ignorant like those 
who have been denied schooling and who never had a teacher or 
trainer.  Undoubtedly such unfortunates will continue in their condition 
of need and deprivation.  
     If the mountains, hills and plains of the material world are left 
wild and uncultivated under the rule of nature, they will remain an 
unbroken wilderness; no fruitful tree to be found anywhere upon 
them.  A true cultivator changes this forest and jungle into a garden, 
training its trees to bring forth fruit and causing flowers to grow in 
place of thorns and thistles.  The holy Manifestations are the ideal 
gardeners of human souls, the divine cultivators of human hearts.  The 
world of existence is but a jungle of disorder and confusion, a state of 
nature producing nothing but fruitless, useless trees.  The ideal 
gardeners train these wild uncultivated human trees, cause them to 
become fruitful, water and cultivate them day by day so that they 
adorn the world of existence and continue to flourish in the utmost 
beauty.  
     Consequently we cannot say that the divine bounty has ceased, 
that the glory of divinity is exhausted or the Sun of Truth sunk into 
eternal sunset, into that darkness which is not followed by light, into 
that night which is not followed by a sunrise and dawn, into that 
death which is not followed by life, into that error which is not 
followed by truth.  Is it conceivable that the Sun of Reality should 
sink into an eternal darkness?  No! the sun was created in order that it 
may shed light upon the world and train all the kingdoms of existence.  
How then can the ideal Sun of Truth, the Word of God, set forever?  
For this would mean the cessation of the divine bounty, and the divine 
bounty by its very nature is continuous and ceaseless.  Its sun is ever 
shining, its cloud is ever producing rain, its breezes are ever blowing, 
its bestowals are all-comprehending, its gifts are ever perfect.  Consequently 
we must always anticipate, always be hopeful and pray to 
 
+P112 
God that he will send unto us his holy Manifestations in their most 
perfect might, with the divine penetrative power of his Word, so that 
these heavenly ones may be distinguished above all other beings in 
every respect, in every attribute, just as the glorious sun is distinguished 
above all stars.  
     Although the stars are scintillating and brilliant, the sun is 
superior to them in luminous effulgence.  Similarly these holy divine 
Manifestations are and must always be distinguished above all other 
beings in every attribute of glory and perfection, in order that it may 
be proven that the Manifestation is the true teacher and real trainer; 
that he is the Sun of Truth endowed with a supreme splendor and 
reflecting the beauty of God.  Otherwise it is not possible for us to 
train one human individual and then after training him, believe in 
him and accept him as the holy Manifestation of divinity.  The real 
Manifestation of God must be endowed with divine knowledge and 
not dependent upon learning acquired in schools.  He must be the 
educator, not the educated; his standard intuition instead of tuition.  
He must be perfect and not imperfect, great and glorious instead of 
being weak and impotent.  He must be wealthy in the riches of the 
spiritual world and not indigent.  In a word, the holy divine Manifestation 
of God must be distinguished above all others of mankind in 
every aspect and qualification, in order that he may be able to effectively 
train the human body politic, eliminate the darkness enshrouding 
the human world, uplift humanity from a lower to a higher kingdom, 
be able through the penetrative power of his Word to promote 
and spread broadcast the beneficent message of universal peace 
among men, bring about the unification of mankind in religious belief 
through a manifest divine power, harmonize all sects and denominations 
and convert all nativities and nationalities into one nativity and 
fatherland.  
     It is our hope that the bounties of God will encompass us all, the 
gifts of the divine become manifest, the lights of the Sun of Truth 
illumine our eyes, inspire our hearts, convey to our souls cheerful 
glad-tidings of God, cause our thoughts to become lofty and our efforts 
to be productive of glorious results.  In a word, it is our hope that we 
may attain to that which is the summit of human aspirations and 
wishes.
