&amp;Nabil-i-Akbar 
 
     There was, in the city of 
Najaf, among the disciples 
of the widely known mujtahid, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtada, a man 
without likeness or peer.  His name was &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-i-Qa'ini, 
and later on he would receive, from the Manifestation, 
the title of &amp;Nabil-i-Akbar.+F1  This eminent soul 
became the leading member of the mujtahid's company of 
disciples.  Singled out from among them all, he alone was 
given the rank of mujtahid--for the late &amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtada 
was never wont to confer this degree.  
     He excelled not only in theology but in other branches 
of knowledge, such as the humanities, the philosophy of 
the Illuminati, the teachings of the mystics and of the 
&amp;Shaykhi School.  He was a universal man, in himself alone 
a convincing proof.  When his eyes were opened to the 
light of Divine guidance, and he breathed in the fragrances 
of Heaven, he became a flame of God.  Then his heart 
leapt within him, and in an ecstasy of joy and love, he 
roared out like leviathan in the deep.  
     With praises showered upon him, he received his new 
rank from the mujtahid.  He then left Najaf and came to 
&amp;Baghdad, and here he was honored with meeting &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Here he beheld the light that blazed on Sinai in the 
Holy Tree.  Soon he was in such a state that he could rest 
neither day nor night.  
 
+F1 For the author of The Dawn-Breakers, see &amp;Nabil-i-Zarandi.  
 
+P2 
     One day, on the floor of the outer apartments reserved 
for the men, the honored &amp;Nabil was reverently kneeling 
in the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  At that moment &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan-'Amu, a trusted associate of the mujtahids of 
&amp;Karbila, came in with &amp;Zaynu'l-'Abidin &amp;Khan, the &amp;Fakhru'd-Dawlih.  
Observing how humbly and deferentially &amp;Nabil 
was kneeling there, the &amp;Haji was astonished.  
     "Sir," he murmured, "what are you doing in this place?"  
     &amp;Nabil answered, "I came here for the same reason you 
did."  
     The two visitors could not recover from their surprise, 
for it was widely known that this personage was unique 
among mujtahids and was the most favored disciple of the 
renowned &amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtada.  
     Later, &amp;Nabil-i-Akbar left for Persia and went on to &amp;Khurasan.  
The &amp;Amir of &amp;Qa'in--&amp;Mir &amp;Alam &amp;Khan--showed him 
every courtesy at first, and greatly valued his company.  So 
marked was this that people felt the &amp;Amir was captivated 
by him, and indeed he was spellbound at the scholar's eloquence, 
knowledge, and accomplishments.  One can judge, 
from this, what honors were accorded to &amp;Nabil by the rest, 
for "men follow the faith of their kings."  
     &amp;Nabil spent some time thus esteemed and in high favor, 
but the love he had for God was past all concealing.  It 
burst from his heart, flamed out and consumed its coverings.  
 
          A thousand ways I tried 
          My love to hide-- 
          But how could I, upon that blazing pyre 
          Not catch fire!  
 
     He brought light to the &amp;Qa'in area and converted a 
great number of people.  And when he had become known 
far and wide by this new name, the clergy, envious and 
 
+P3 
malevolent, arose, and informed against him, sending their 
calumnies on to &amp;Tihran, so that &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah rose 
up in wrath.  Terrified of the &amp;Shah, the &amp;Amir attacked 
&amp;Nabil with all his might.  Soon the whole city was in an uproar, 
and the populace, lashed to fury, turned upon him.  
     That enraptured lover of God never gave way, but withstood 
them all.  At last, however, they drove him out-- 
drove out that man who saw what they did not--and he 
went up to &amp;Tihran, where he was a fugitive, and homeless.  
     Here, his enemies struck at him again.  He was pursued 
by the watchmen; guards looked everywhere for him, 
asking after him in every street and alley, hunting him 
down to catch and torture him.  Hiding, he would pass by 
them like the sigh of the oppressed, and rise to the hills; 
or again, like the tears of the wronged, he would slip down 
into the valleys.  He could no longer wear the turban denoting 
his rank; he disguised himself, putting on a layman's 
hat, so that they would fail to recognize him and 
would let him be.  
     In secret, with all his powers he kept on spreading the 
Faith and setting forth its proofs, and was a guiding lamp 
to many souls.  He was exposed to danger at all times, always 
vigilant and on his guard.  The Government never 
gave up its search for him, nor did the people cease from 
discussing his case.  
     He left, then, for &amp;Bukhara and &amp;Ishqabad, continuously 
teaching the Faith in those regions.  Like a candle, he was 
using up his life; but in spite of his sufferings he was never 
dispirited, rather his joy and ardor increased with every 
passing day.  He was eloquent of speech; he was a skilled 
physician, a remedy for every ill, a balm to every sore.  
He would guide the Illuminati by their own philosophical 
principles, and with the mystics he would prove the Divine 
Advent in terms of "inspiration" and the "celestial 
 
+P4 
vision."  He would convince the &amp;Shaykhi leaders by quoting 
the very words of their late Founders, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad 
and Siyyid &amp;Kazim, and would convert Islamic theologians 
with texts from the &amp;Qur'an and traditions from the &amp;Imams, 
who guide mankind aright.  Thus he was an instant medicine 
to the ailing, and a rich bestowal to the poor.  
     He became penniless in &amp;Bukhara and a prey to many 
troubles, until at the last, far from his homeland, he died, 
hastening away to the Kingdom where no poverty exists.  
     &amp;Nabil-i-Akbar was the author of a masterly essay demonstrating 
the truth of the Cause, but the friends do not 
have it in hand at the present time.  I hope that it will come 
to light, and will serve as an admonition to the learned.  It 
is true that in this swiftly passing world he was the target 
of countless woes; and yet, all those generations of powerful 
clerics, those &amp;shaykhs like &amp;Murtada and &amp;Mirza &amp;Habibu'llah 
and &amp;Ayatu'llah-i-Khurasani and &amp;Mulla &amp;Asadu'llah-i-Mazandarani-- 
all of them will disappear without a trace.  
They will leave no name behind them, no sign, no fruit.  
No word will be passed down from any of them; no man 
will tell of them again.  But because he stood steadfast in 
this holy Faith, because he guided souls and served this 
Cause and spread its fame, that star, &amp;Nabil, will shine forever 
from the horizon of abiding light.  
     It is clear that whatever glory is gained outside the Cause 
of God turns to abasement at the end; and ease and comfort 
not met with on the path of God are finally but care 
and sorrow; and all such wealth is penury, and nothing 
more.  
     A sign of guidance, he was, an emblem of the fear of 
God.  For this Faith, he laid down his life, and in dying, 
triumphed.  He passed by the world and its rewards; he 
closed his eyes to rank and wealth; he loosed himself from 
all such chains and fetters, and put every worldly thought 
aside.  Of wide learning, at once a mujtahid, a philosopher, 
 
+P5 
a mystic, and gifted with intuitive sight, he was also an accomplished 
man of letters and an orator without a peer.  He 
had a great and universal mind.  
     Praise be to God, at the end he was made the recipient 
of heavenly grace.  Upon him be the glory of God, the All-Glorious.  
May God shed the brightness of the &amp;Abha Kingdom 
upon his resting-place.  May God welcome him into 
the Paradise of reunion, and shelter him forever in the 
realm of the righteous, submerged in an ocean of lights.  
 

&amp;Ismu'llahu'l-Asdaq 
 
     Among the Hands of the 
Cause of God who have 
departed this life and ascended to the Supreme Horizon 
was &amp;Jinab-i-Ismu'llahu'l-Asdaq.  Another was &amp;Jinab-i-Nabil-i-Akbar.  
Still others were &amp;Jinab-i-Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar and 
&amp;Jinab-i-Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-Riday-i-Yazdi.  Again, among 
others, was the revered martyr, &amp;Aqa &amp;Mirza &amp;Varqa.  
     &amp;Ismu'llahu'l-Asdaq was truly a servant of the Lord from 
the beginning of life till his last breath.  When young, he 
joined the circle of the late Siyyid &amp;Kazim and became one 
of his disciples.  He was known in Persia for his purity of 
life, winning fame as &amp;Mulla &amp;Sadiq the saintly.  He was a 
blessed individual, a man accomplished, learned, and much 
honored.  The people of &amp;Khurasan were strongly attached 
to him, for he was a great scholar and among the most renowned 
 
+P6 
of matchless and unique divines.  As a teacher of 
the Faith, he spoke with such eloquence, such extraordinary 
power, that his hearers were won over with great ease.  
     After he had come to &amp;Baghdad and attained the presence 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he was seated one day in the courtyard of 
the men's apartments, by the little garden.  I was in one of 
the rooms just above, that gave onto the courtyard.  At that 
moment a Persian prince, a grandson of &amp;Fath-'Ali &amp;Shah, arrived 
at the house.  The prince said to him, "Who are you?" 
&amp;Ismu'llah answered, "I am a servant of this Threshhold.  I 
am one of the keepers of this door."  And as I listened from 
above, he began to teach the Faith.  The prince at first objected 
violently; and yet, in a quarter of an hour, gently 
and benignly, &amp;Jinab-i-Ismu'llah had quieted him down.  
After the prince had so sharply denied what was said, and 
his face had so clearly reflected his fury, now his wrath 
was changed to smiles and he expressed the greatest satisfaction 
at having encountered &amp;Ismu'llah and heard what 
he had to say.  
     He always taught cheerfully and with gaiety, and would 
respond gently and with good humor, no matter how much 
passionate anger might be turned against him by the one 
with whom he spoke.  His way of teaching was excellent.  
He was truly &amp;Ismu'llah, the Name of God, not for his 
fame but because he was a chosen soul.  
     &amp;Ismu'llah had memorized a great number of &amp;Islamic traditions 
and had mastered the teachings of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad 
and Siyyid &amp;Kazim.  He became a believer in &amp;Shiraz, in the 
early days of the Faith, and was soon widely known as 
such.  And because he began to teach openly and boldly, 
they hung a halter on him and led him about the streets 
and &amp;bazars of the city.  Even in that condition, composed 
and smiling, he kept on speaking to the people.  He did 
not yield; he was not silenced.  When they freed him he 
left &amp;Shiraz and went to &amp;Khurasan, and there, too, began 
 
+P7 
to spread the Faith, following which he traveled on, in 
the company of &amp;Babu'l-Bab, to Fort &amp;Tabarsi.  Here he endured 
intense sufferings as a member of that band of sacrificial 
victims.  They took him prisoner at the Fort and delivered 
him over to the chiefs of &amp;Mazindaran, to lead him 
about and finally kill him in a certain district of that province.  
When, bound with chains, &amp;Ismu'llah was brought to 
the appointed place, God put it into one man's heart to 
free him from prison in the middle of the night and guide 
him to a place where he was safe.  Throughout all these 
agonizing trials he remained staunch in his faith.  
     Think, for example, how the enemy had completely 
hemmed in the Fort, and were endlessly pouring in cannon 
balls from their siege guns.  The believers, among them 
&amp;Ismu'llah, went eighteen days without food.  They lived on 
the leather of their shoes.  This too was soon consumed, 
and they had nothing left but water.  They drank a mouthful 
every morning, and lay famished and exhausted in 
their Fort.  When attacked, however, they would instantly 
spring to their feet, and manifest in the face of the enemy 
a magnificent courage and astonishing resistance, and drive 
the army back from their walls.  The hunger lasted eighteen 
days.  It was a terrible ordeal.  To begin with, they 
were far from home, surrounded and cut off by the foe; 
again, they were starving; and then there were the army's 
sudden onslaughts and the bombshells raining down and 
bursting in the heart of the Fort.  Under such circumstances 
to maintain an unwavering faith and patience is 
extremely difficult, and to endure such dire afflictions a rare 
phenomenon.+F1  
     &amp;Ismu'llah did not slacken under fire.  Once freed, he 
taught more widely than ever.  He spent every waking 
breath in calling the people to the Kingdom of God.  In 
 
+F1 Cf. &amp;Nabil, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 395, note 1.  
 
+P8 
&amp;Iraq, he attained the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and again in 
the Most Great Prison, receiving from Him grace and 
favor.  
     He was like a surging sea, a falcon that soared high.  His 
visage shone, his tongue was eloquent, his strength and 
steadfastness astounding.  When he opened his lips to 
teach, the proofs would stream out; when he chanted or 
prayed, his eyes shed tears like a spring cloud.  His face 
was luminous, his life spiritual, his knowledge both acquired 
and innate; and celestial was his ardor, his detachment 
from the world, his righteousness, his piety and fear 
of God.  
     &amp;Ismu'llah's tomb is in &amp;Hamadan.  Many a Tablet was 
revealed for him by the Supreme Pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah, including 
a special Visitation Tablet after his passing.  He 
was a great personage, perfect in all things.  
     Such blessed beings have now left this world.  Thank 
God, they did not linger on, to witness the agonies that 
followed the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah--the intense afflictions; 
for firmly rooted mountains will shake and tremble 
at these, and the high-towering hills bow down.  
     He was truly &amp;Ismu'llah, the Name of God.  Fortunate is 
the one who circumambulates that tomb, who blesses himself 
with the dust of that grave.  Upon him be salutations 
and praise in the &amp;Abha Realm.  
 
+P9 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar 
 
     Yet another Hand of the 
Cause was the revered 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the All-Glorious.  
Early in life, this illustrious man attended institutions 
of higher learning and labored diligently, by day 
and night, until he became thoroughly conversant with the 
learning of the day, with secular studies, philosophy, and 
religious jurisprudence.  He frequented the gatherings of 
philosophers, mystics, and &amp;Shaykhis, thoughtfully traversing 
those areas of knowledge, intuitive wisdom, and illumination; 
but he thirsted after the wellspring of truth, and 
hungered for the bread that comes down from Heaven.  No 
matter how he strove to perfect himself in those regions of 
the mind, he was never satisfied; he never reached the 
goal of his desires; his lips stayed parched; he was confused, 
perplexed, and felt that he had wandered from his 
path.  The reason was that in all those circles he had found 
no passion; no joy, no ecstasy; no faintest scent of love.  
And as he went deeper into the core of those manifold beliefs, 
he discovered that from the day of the Prophet &amp;Muhammad's 
advent until our own times, innumerable sects 
have arisen:  creeds differing among themselves; disparate 
opinions, divergent goals, uncounted roads and ways.  And 
he found each one, under some plea or other, claiming to 
 
+P10 
reveal spiritual truth; each one believing that it alone followed 
the true path--this although the &amp;Muhammedic sea 
could rise in one great tide, and carry all those sects away 
to the ocean floor.  "No cry shalt thou hear from them, nor 
a whisper even."+F1  
     Whoso ponders the lessons of history will learn that 
this sea has lifted up innumerable waves, yet in the end 
each has dissolved and vanished, like a shadow drifting by.  
The waves have perished, but the sea lives on.  This is why 
&amp;Ali Qabl-i-Akbar could never quench his thirst, till the day 
when he stood on the shore of Truth and cried:  
 
          Here is a sea with treasure to the brim; 
          Its waves toss pearls under the great wind's thong.  
          Throw off your robe and plunge, nor try to swim, 
          Pride not yourself on swimming--dive headlong.  
 
     Like a fountain, his heart welled and jetted forth; meaning 
and truth, like soft-flowing crystal waters, began to 
stream from his lips.  At first, with humility, with spiritual 
poverty, he garnered the new light, and only then he proceeded 
to shed it abroad.  For how well has it been said, 
 
          Shall he the gift of life to others bear 
          Who of life's gift has never had a share?  
 
A teacher must proceed in this way:  he must first teach 
himself, and then others.  If he himself still walks the path 
of carnal appetites and lusts, how can he guide another to 
the "evident signs"+F2 of God?  
     This honored man was successful in converting a multitude.  
For the sake of God he cast all caution aside, as he 
hastened along the ways of love.  He became as one frenzied, 
 
+F1 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 19:98 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 3:91 
 
+P11 
as a vagrant and one known to be mad.  Because of 
his new Faith, he was mocked at in &amp;Tihran by high and 
low.  When he walked through the streets and &amp;bazars, the 
people pointed their fingers at him, calling him a &amp;Baha'i.  
Whenever trouble broke out, he was the one to be arrested 
first.  He was always ready and waiting for this, since 
it never failed.  
     Again and again he was bound with chains, jailed, and 
threatened with the sword.  The photograph of this blessed 
individual, together with that of the great &amp;Amin, taken of 
them in their chains, will serve as an example to whoever 
has eyes to see.  There they sit, those two distinguished 
men, hung with chains, shackled, yet composed, acquiescent, 
undisturbed.  
     Things came to such a pass that in the end whenever 
there was an uproar &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali would put on his turban, 
wrap himself in his &amp;aba and sit waiting, for his enemies to 
rouse and the &amp;farrashes to break in and the guards to carry 
him off to prison.  But observe the power of God!  In spite 
of all this, he was kept safe.  "The sign of a knower and 
lover is this, that you will find him dry in the sea."  That 
is how he was.  His life hung by a thread from one moment 
to the next; the malevolent lay in wait for him; he 
was known everywhere as a &amp;Baha'i--and still he was protected 
from all harm.  He stayed dry in the depths of the 
sea, cool and safe in the heart of the fire, until the day he 
died.  
     After the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali continued 
on, loyal to the Testament of the Light of the World, 
staunch in the Covenant which he served and heralded.  
During the lifetime of the Manifestation, his yearning 
made him hasten to &amp;Baha'u'llah, Who received him with 
grace and favor, and showered blessings upon him.  He returned, 
then, to &amp;Iran, where he devoted all his time to 
serving the Cause.  Openly at odds with his tyrannical oppressors, 
 
+P12 
no matter how often they threatened him, he defied 
them.  He was never vanquished.  Whatever he had to 
say, he said.  He was one of the Hands of the Cause of 
God, steadfast, unshakable, not to be moved.  
     I loved him very much, for he was delightful to converse 
with, and as a companion second to none.  One night, 
not long ago, I saw him in the world of dreams.  Although 
his frame had always been massive, in the dream world he 
appeared larger and more corpulent than ever.  It seemed 
as if he had returned from a journey.  I said to him, "&amp;Jinab, 
you have grown good and stout."  "Yes," he answered, 
"praise be to God!  I have been in places where the air was 
fresh and sweet, and the water crystal pure; the landscapes 
were beautiful to look upon, the foods delectable.  It all 
agreed with me, of course, so I am stronger than ever now, 
and I have recovered the zest of my early youth.  The 
breaths of the All-Merciful blew over me and all my time 
was spent in telling of God.  I have been setting forth His 
proofs, and teaching His Faith."  (The meaning of teaching 
the Faith in the next world is spreading the sweet 
savors of holiness; that action is the same as teaching.)  We 
spoke together a little more, and then some people arrived 
and he disappeared.  
     His last resting-place is in &amp;Tihran.  Although his body 
lies under the earth, his pure spirit lives on, "in the seat of 
truth, in the presence of the potent King."+F3  I long to visit 
the graves of the friends of God, could this be possible.  
These are the servants of the Blessed Beauty; in His path 
they were afflicted; they met with toil and sorrow; they 
sustained injuries and suffered harm.  Upon them be the 
glory of God, the All-Glorious.  Unto them be salutation 
and praise.  Upon them be God's tender mercy, and forgiveness.  
 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 54:55 
 
+P13 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Salman 
 
     In 1266 A.H.+F1 the trusted 
messenger, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Salman, 
first heard the summons of God, and his heart leapt for 
joy.  He was then in &amp;Hindiyan.  Irresistibly attracted, he 
walked all the way to &amp;Tihran, where with ardent love he 
secretly joined the believers.  On a certain day he was passing 
through the &amp;bazar with &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad &amp;Taqiy-i-Kashani, 
and the &amp;farrashes followed him and discovered 
where he lived.  The next day, police and &amp;farrashes came 
looking for him and took him to the chief of police.  
     "Who are you?" the chief asked.  
     "I am from &amp;Hindiyan," replied &amp;Salman.  "I have come to 
&amp;Tihran and am on my way to &amp;Khurasan, for a pilgrimage 
to the Shrine of &amp;Imam &amp;Rida."  
     "What were you doing yesterday," the chief asked, 
"with that man in the white robe?"  
     &amp;Salman answered, "I had sold him an &amp;aba the day before, 
and yesterday he was to pay me."  
     "You are a stranger here," the chief said.  "How could 
you trust him?"  
     "A money-changer guaranteed the payment," &amp;Salman 
replied.  He had in mind the respected believer, &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-i-Sarraf 
(money-changer).  
 
+F1 1849-1850.  
 
+P14 
     The chief turned to one of his &amp;farrashes and said, "Take 
him to the money-changer's and look into it."  
     When they reached there the &amp;farrash went on ahead.  
"What was all this," he said, "about the sale of an &amp;aba 
and your vouching for the payment?  Explain yourself."  
     "I know nothing about it," the money-changer replied.  
     "Come along," said the &amp;farrash to &amp;Salman.  "All is clear 
at last.  You are a &amp;Babi."  
     It happened that the turban which &amp;Salman had on his 
head was similar to those worn in &amp;Shushtar.  As they were 
passing a crossroads, a man from &amp;Shushtar came out of his 
shop.  He embraced &amp;Salman and cried:  "Where have you 
been, &amp;Khajih &amp;Muhammad-'Ali?  When did you arrive?  
Welcome!"  
     &amp;Salman replied, "I came here a few days ago and now 
the police have arrested me."  
     "What do you want with him?" the merchant asked the 
&amp;farrash.  "What are you after?"  
     "He is a &amp;Babi," was the answer.  
     "God forbid!" cried the man from &amp;Shushtar.  "I know 
him well.  &amp;Khajih &amp;Muhammad-'Ali is a God-fearing Muslim, 
a &amp;Shi'ih, a devout follower of the &amp;Imam &amp;Ali."  With 
this he gave the &amp;farrash a sum of money and &amp;Salman was 
freed.  
     They went into the shop and the merchant began to 
ask &amp;Salman how he was faring.  &amp;Salman told him:  "I am 
not &amp;Khajih &amp;Muhammad-'Ali."  
     The man from &amp;Shushtar was dumbfounded.  "You look 
exactly like him!" he exclaimed.  "You two are identical.  
However, since you are not he, give me back the money I 
paid the &amp;farrash."  
     &amp;Salman immediately handed him the money, left, went 
out through the city gate and made for &amp;Hindiyan.  
     When &amp;Baha'u'llah arrived in &amp;Iraq, the first messenger 
to reach His holy presence was &amp;Salman, who then returned 
 
+P15 
with Tablets addressed to the friends in &amp;Hindiyan.  Once 
each year, this blessed individual would set out on foot to 
see his Well-Beloved, after which he would retrace his 
steps, carrying Tablets to many cities, &amp;Isfahan, &amp;Shiraz, &amp;Kashan, 
&amp;Tihran, and the rest.  
     From the year 69 until the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
1309 A.H.,+F2 &amp;Salman would arrive once a year, bringing 
letters, leaving with the Tablets, faithfully delivering each 
one to him for whom it was intended.  Every single year 
throughout that long period, he came on foot from Persia 
to &amp;Iraq, or to Adrianople, or to the Most Great Prison at 
&amp;Akka; came with the greatest eagerness and love, and then 
went back again.  
     He had remarkable powers of endurance.  He traveled 
on foot, as a rule eating nothing but onions and bread; and 
in all that time, he moved about in such a way that he was 
never once held up and never once lost a letter or a Tablet.  
Every letter was safely delivered; every Tablet reached its 
intended recipient.  Over and over again, in &amp;Isfahan, he 
was subjected to severe trials, but he remained patient and 
thankful under all conditions, and earned from &amp;non-Baha'is 
the title of "the &amp;Babis' Angel Gabriel."  
     Throughout his entire life, &amp;Salman rendered this momentous 
service to the Cause of God, becoming the means 
of its spread and contributing to the happiness of the believers, 
annually bringing Divine glad tidings to the cities 
and villages of Persia.  He was close to the heart of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
Who looked upon him with especial favor and grace.  
Among the Holy Scriptures, there are Tablets revealed in 
his name.  
     After the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Salman remained 
faithful to the Covenant, serving the Cause with all his 
powers.  Then, as before, he would come to the Most Great 
 
+F2 1853; 1892.  
 
+P16 
Prison every year, delivering mail from the believers, and 
returning with the answers to Persia.  At last, in &amp;Shiraz, he 
winged his way to the Kingdom of glory.  
     From the dawn of history until the present day, there 
has never been a messenger so worthy of trust; there has 
never been a courier to compare with &amp;Salman.  He has left 
respected survivors in &amp;Isfahan who, because of the troubles 
in Persia, are presently in distress.  It is certain that the 
friends will see to their needs.  Upon him be the glory of 
God, the All-Glorious; unto him be salutations and praise.  
 

&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, the &amp;Afnan 
 
     In the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
during the worst times in 
the Most Great Prison, they would not permit any of the 
friends either to leave the Fortress or to come in from the 
outside.  "Skew-Cap"+F1 and the Siyyid+F2 lived by the second 
gate of the city, and watched there at all times, day and 
night.  Whenever they spied a &amp;Baha'i traveler they would 
hurry away to the Governor and tell him that the traveler 
was bringing in letters and would carry the answers back.  
The Governor would then arrest the traveler, seize his papers, 
jail him, and drive him out.  This became an established 
 
+F1 &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan.  Cf. Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 189.

+P17 
custom with the authorities and went on for a long 
time--indeed, for nine years until, little by little, the practice 
was abandoned.  
     It was at such a period that the &amp;Afnan, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali-- 
that great bough of the Holy Tree+F3--journeyed 
to &amp;Akka, coming from India to Egypt, and from 
Egypt to Marseilles.  One day I was up on the roof of the 
caravanserai.  Some of the friends were with me and I was 
walking up and down.  It was sunset.  At that moment, 
glancing at the distant seashore, I observed that a carriage 
was approaching.  "Gentlemen," I said, "I feel that a holy 
being is in that carriage."  It was still far away, hardly 
within sight.  
     "Let us go to the gate," I told them.  "Although they 
will not allow us to pass through, we can stand there till 
he comes."  I took one or two people with me and we left.  
     At the city gate I called to the guard, privately gave him 
something and said:  "A carriage is coming in and I think 
it is bringing one of our friends.  When it reaches here, do 
not hold it up, and do not refer the matter to the Governor."  
He put out a chair for me and I sat down.  
     By this time the sun had set.  They had shut the main 
gate, too, but the little door was open.  The gatekeeper 
stayed outside, the carriage drew up, the gentleman had 
arrived.  What a radiant face he had!  He was nothing but 
light from head to foot.  Just to look at that face made one 
happy; he was so confident, so assured, so rooted in his 
faith, and his expression so joyous.  He was truly a blessed 
being.  He was a man who made progress day by day, who 
added, every day, to his certitude and faith, his luminous 
quality, his ardent love.  He made extraordinary progress 
during the few days that he spent in the Most Great 
Prison.  The point is that when his carriage had come only 
 
+F3 The &amp;Afnan are the kindred of the &amp;Bab.  Ibid., pp. 239; 328.  
 
+P18 
part of the way from Haifa to &amp;Akka, one could already 
perceive his spirit, his light.  
     After he had received the endless bounties showered on 
him by &amp;Baha'u'llah, he was given leave to go, and he 
traveled to China.  There, over a considerable period, he 
spent his days mindful of God and in a manner conformable 
to Divine good pleasure.  Later he went on to India, 
where he died.  
     The other revered &amp;Afnan and the friends in India felt 
it advisable to send his blessed remains to &amp;Iraq, ostensibly 
to Najaf, to be buried near the Holy City; for the Muslims 
had refused to let him lie in their graveyard, and his 
body had been lodged in a temporary repository for safekeeping.  
&amp;Aqa Siyyid &amp;Asadu'llah, who was in Bombay at 
the time, was deputized to transport the remains with all 
due reverence to &amp;Iraq.  There were hostile Persians on the 
steamship and these people, once they reached &amp;Bushihr, 
reported that the coffin of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali the 
&amp;Babi was being carried to Najaf for burial in the Vale of 
Peace, near the sacred precincts of the Shrine, and that 
such a thing was intolerable.  They tried to take his blessed 
remains off the ship, but they failed; see what the hidden 
Divine decrees can bring about.  
     His body came as far as &amp;Basra.  And since that was a 
period when the friends had to remain in concealment, 
Siyyid &amp;Asadu'llah was obliged to proceed as if he were going 
on with the burial in Najaf, meanwhile hoping in one 
way or another to effect the interment near &amp;Baghdad.  Because, 
although Najaf is a holy city and always shall be, 
still the friends had chosen another place.  God, therefore, 
stirred up our enemies to prevent the Najaf burial.  They 
swarmed in, attacking the quarantine station to lay hold of 
the body and either bury it in &amp;Basra or throw it into the 
sea or out on the desert sands.  
     The case took on such importance that in the end it 
 
+P19 
proved impossible to bring the remains to Najaf, and Siyyid 
&amp;Asadu'llah had to carry them on to &amp;Baghdad.  Here, 
too, there was no burial place where the &amp;Afnan's body 
would be safe from molestation at enemy hands.  Finally 
the Siyyid decided to carry it to the shrine of Persia's &amp;Salman 
the Pure,+F4 about five &amp;farsakhs out of &amp;Baghdad, and 
bury it in Ctesiphon, close to the grave of &amp;Salman, beside 
the palace of the &amp;Sasaniyan kings.  The body was taken 
there and that trust of God was, with all reverence, laid 
down in a safe resting-place by the palace of &amp;Nawshiravan.  
     And this was destiny, that after a lapse of thirteen hundred 
years, from the time when the throne city of Persia's 
ancient kings was trampled down, and no trace of it was 
left, except for rubble and hills of sand, and the very palace 
roof itself had cracked and split so that half of it toppled to 
the ground--this edifice should win back the kingly pomp 
and splendor of its former days.  It is indeed a mighty arch.  
The width of its entry-way is fifty-two paces and it towers 
very high.  
     Thus did God's grace and favor encompass the Persians 
of an age long gone, in order that their ruined capital 
should be rebuilt and flourish once again.  To this end, 
with the help of God, events were brought about which 
led to the &amp;Afnan's being buried here; and there is no doubt 
that a proud city will rise up on this site.  I wrote many letters 
about it, until at last the holy dust could be laid to rest 
in this place.  Siyyid &amp;Asadu'llah would write me from 
&amp;Basra and I would answer him.  One of the public functionaries 
there was completely devoted to us, and I directed 
him to do all he could.  Siyyid &amp;Asadu'llah informed me 
from &amp;Baghdad that he was at his wits' end, and had no 
idea where he could consign this body to the grave.  "Wherever 
 
+F4 Herald of the Prophet &amp;Muhammad.  
 
+P20 
I might bury it," he wrote, "they will dig it up again."  
     At last, praised be God, it was laid down in the very 
spot to which time and again the Blessed Beauty had repaired; 
in that place honored by His footsteps, where He 
had revealed Tablets, where the believers of &amp;Baghdad had 
been in His company; that very place where the Most 
Great Name was wont to stroll.  How did this come about?  
It was due to the &amp;Afnan's purity of heart.  Lacking this, all 
those ways and means could never have been brought to 
bear.  Verily, God is the Mover of heaven and earth.  
     I loved the &amp;Afnan very much.  Because of him, I rejoiced.  
I wrote a long Visitation Tablet for him and sent 
it with other papers to Persia.  His burial site is one of the 
holy places where a magnificent &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar must 
be raised up.  If possible, the actual arch of the royal 
palace should be restored and become the House of Worship.  
The auxiliary buildings of the House of Worship 
should likewise be erected there:  the hospital, the schools 
and university, the elementary school, the refuge for the 
poor and indigent; also the haven for orphans and the 
helpless, and the travelers' hospice.  
     Gracious God!  That royal edifice was once splendidly 
decked forth and fair.  But there are spiders' webs today, 
where hung the curtains of gold brocade, and where the 
king's drums beat and his musicians played, the only 
sound is the harsh cries of kites and crows.  "This is verily 
the capital of the owl's realm, where thou wilt hear no 
sound, save only the echo of his repeated calls."  That is 
how the barracks were, when we came to &amp;Akka.  There 
were a few trees inside the walls, and on their branches, 
as well as up on the battlements, the owls cried all night 
long.  How disquieting is the hoot of an owl; how it saddens 
the heart.  
     From earliest youth until he grew helpless and old, that 
sacred bough of the Holy Tree, with his smiling face, 
 
+P21 
shone out like a lamp in the midst of all.  Then he leapt 
and soared to undying glory, and plunged into the ocean 
of light.  Upon him be the breathings of his Lord, the All-Merciful.  
Upon him, lapped in the waters of grace and 
forgiveness, be the mercy and favor of God.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan, the &amp;Afnan 
 
     Among the most eminent of 
those who left their homeland 
to join &amp;Baha'u'llah was &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan, the great 
&amp;Afnan, who during the latter days won the honor of emigrating 
and of receiving the favor and companionship of 
his Lord.  The &amp;Afnan, related to the &amp;Bab, was specifically 
named by the Supreme Pen as an offshoot of the Holy 
Tree.  When still a small child, he received his portion of 
bounty from the &amp;Bab, and showed forth an extraordinary 
attachment to that dazzling Beauty.  Not yet adolescent, he 
frequented the society of the learned, and began to study 
sciences and arts.  He reflected day and night on the most 
abstruse of spiritual questions, and gazed in wonderment 
at the mighty signs of God as written in the Book of Life.  
He became thoroughly versed even in such material sciences 
as mathematics, geometry, and geography; in brief, 
he was well grounded in many fields, thoroughly conversant 
with the thought of ancient and modern times.  
     A merchant by profession, he spent only a short period 
 
+P22 
of the day and evening at his business, devoting most of 
his time to discussion and research.  He was truly erudite, 
a great credit to the Cause of God amongst leading men of 
learning.  With a few concise phrases, he could solve perplexing 
questions.  His speech was laconic, but in itself a 
kind of miracle.  
     Although he first became a believer in the days of the 
&amp;Bab, it was during the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah that he caught 
fire.  Then his love of God burned away every obstructing 
veil and idle thought.  He did all he could to spread the 
Faith of God, becoming known far and wide for his ardent 
love of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
          I am lost, O Love, possessed and dazed, 
          Love's fool am I, in all the earth.  
          They call me first among the crazed, 
          Though I once came first for wit and worth...  
 
     After the ascension of the &amp;Bab, he had the high honor of 
serving and watching over the revered and saintly consort 
of the blessed Lord.  He was in Persia, mourning his separation 
from &amp;Baha'u'llah, when his distinguished son became, 
by marriage, a member of the Holy Household.  At this, 
the &amp;Afnan rejoiced.  He left Persia and hastened to the 
sheltering favor of his Well-Beloved.  He was a man amazing 
to behold, his face so luminous that even those who 
were not believers used to say that a heavenly light shone 
from his forehead.  
     He went away for a time and sojourned in Beirut, where 
he met the noted scholar, &amp;Khajih &amp;Findik.  This personage 
warmly praised the erudition of the great &amp;Afnan in various 
circles, affirming that an individual of such wide and diverse 
learning was rare throughout the East.  Later on, the 
&amp;Afnan returned to the Holy Land, settling near the Mansion 
of &amp;Bahji and directing all his thoughts toward aspects 
 
+P23 
of human culture.  Much of the time he would occupy 
himself with uncovering the secrets of the heavens, contemplating 
in their detail the movements of the stars.  He 
had a telescope with which he would make his observations 
every night.  He lived a happy life, carefree and light 
of heart.  In the neighborhood of &amp;Baha'u'llah his days were 
blissful, his nights bright as the first morning in spring.  
     But then came the Beloved's departure from this world.  
The &amp;Afnan's peace was shattered, his joy was changed to 
grief.  The Supreme Affliction was upon us, separation consumed 
us, the once bright days turned black as night, and 
all those roses of other hours were dust and rubble now.  
He lived on for a little while, his heart smoldering, his eyes 
shedding their tears.  But he could not bear the longing for 
his Well-Beloved, and in a little while his soul gave up this 
life and fled to the eternal one; passed into the Heaven of 
abiding reunion and was immersed beneath an ocean of 
light.  Upon him be most great mercy, plenteous bounty, 
and every blessing, as the ages and cycles roll on.  His 
honored tomb is in &amp;Akka at the &amp;Manshiyyih.  
 

&amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Isfahani 
 
     &amp;Muhammad-'Ali of &amp;Isfahan 
was among the 
earliest of believers, guided to the Faith from its very beginning.  
He was one of the mystics; his house was a gathering 
 
+P24 
place for them, and the philosophers.  Noble, high-minded, 
he was one of &amp;Isfahan's most respected citizens, and served 
as a host and sanctuary for every stranger, rich or poor.  He 
had verve, an excellent disposition, was forbearing, affable, 
generous, a boon companion; and it was known throughout 
the city that he enjoyed a good time.  
     Then he was led to embrace the Faith and caught fire 
from the Sinaitic Tree.  His house became a teaching center, 
dedicated to the glory of God.  Day and night the believers 
flocked there, as to a lamp lit by heavenly love.  
Over a long period, the sacred verses were chanted in that 
house and the clear proofs set forth.  Although this was 
widely known, &amp;Muhammad-'Ali was not molested, because 
he was a kinsman of the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih of &amp;Isfahan.  
Finally, however, things came to such a pass that the 
&amp;Imam-Jum'ih himself sent him away, telling him:  "I can 
protect you no longer.  You are in grave danger.  The best 
thing for you is to leave here, and go on a journey."  
     He left his home then, went to &amp;Iraq, and entered the 
presence of the world's Desired One.  He spent some time 
there, progressing every day; he had little to live on, but 
was happy and content.  A man of excellent disposition, he 
was congenial to believers and others alike.  
     When &amp;Baha'u'llah and His retinue left &amp;Baghdad for 
Constantinople, &amp;Muhammad-'Ali was in His company, and 
continued on with Him to the Land of Mystery, Adrianople.  
Not one to be inconstant, he maintained his characteristic 
immutability of heart.  Whatever happened, he 
remained the same.  In Adrianople as well, his days passed 
happily, under the protection of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He would 
carry on some business which, however trifling, would 
bring in surprisingly abundant returns.  
     From Adrianople, &amp;Muhammad-'Ali accompanied &amp;Baha'u'llah 
to the fortress of &amp;Akka, was put in jail there, and 
was numbered among &amp;Baha'u'llah's fellow captives for the 
 
+P25 
rest of his life, achieving that greatest of all distinctions, to 
be in prison with the Blessed Beauty.  
     He spent his days in utter bliss.  Here, too, he carried on 
a small business, which occupied him from morning till 
noon.  In the afternoons he would take his samovar, wrap 
it in a dark-colored pouch made from a saddlebag, and go 
off somewhere to a garden or meadow, or out in a field, and 
have his tea.  Sometimes he would be found at the farm of 
&amp;Mazra'ih, or again in the &amp;Ridvan Garden; or, at the Mansion, 
he would have the honor of attending upon &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     &amp;Muhammad-'Ali would carefully consider every blessing 
that came his way.  "How delicious my tea is today," he 
would comment.  "What perfume, what color!  How lovely 
this meadow is, and the flowers so bright!"  He used to say 
that everything, even air and water, had its own special 
fragrance.  For him the days passed in indescribable delight.  
Even kings were not so happy as this old man, the people 
said.  "He is completely free of the world," they would declare.  
"He lives in joy."  It also happened that his food was 
of the very best, and that his home was situated in the very 
best part of &amp;Akka.  Gracious God!  Here he was, a prisoner, 
and yet experiencing comfort, peace and joy.  
     &amp;Muhammad-'Ali was past eighty when he finally departed 
to eternal light.  He had been the recipient of many 
Tablets from &amp;Baha'u'llah, and of endless bounty, under 
all conditions.  Upon him be the glory of God the Most 
Glorious.  Upon him be myriads of heavenly blessings; may 
God favor him with gladness forever and ever.  His luminous 
grave is in &amp;Akka.  
 
+P26 
&amp;Abdu's-Salih, the Gardener 
 
     Among those who emigrated 
and were companions 
in the Most Great Prison was &amp;Aqa &amp;Abdu's-Salih.  This 
excellent soul, a child of early believers, came from &amp;Isfahan.  
His noble-hearted father died, and this child grew up an 
orphan.  There was none to rear or care for him and he was 
the prey of anyone who chose to do him harm.  At last he 
became adolescent, and older now, sought out his Well-Beloved.  
He emigrated to the Most Great Prison and here, 
at the &amp;Ridvan, achieved the honor of being appointed gardener.  
At this task he was second to none.  In his faith, too, 
he was staunch, loyal, worthy of trust; as to his character, he 
was an embodiment of the sacred verse, "Of a noble nature 
art thou."+F1  That is how he won the distinction of being 
gardener at the &amp;Ridvan, and of thus receiving the greatest 
bounty of all:  almost daily, he entered the presence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     For the Most Great Name was held prisoner and confined 
nine years in the fortress-town of &amp;Akka; and at all 
times, both in the barracks and afterward, from without 
the house, the police and &amp;farrashes had Him under constant 
guard.  The Blessed Beauty lived in a very small house, 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 68:4.  
 
+P27 
and He never set foot outside that narrow lodging, because 
His oppressors kept continual watch at the door.  When, 
however, nine years had elapsed, the fixed and predetermined 
length of days was over; and at that time, against 
the rancorous will of the tyrant, &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, and all 
his minions, &amp;Baha'u'llah proceeded out of the fortress with 
authority and might, and in a kingly mansion beyond the 
city, made His home.  
     Although the policy of &amp;Sultan &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid was 
harsher than ever; although he constantly insisted on his 
Captive's strict confinement--still, the Blessed Beauty now 
lived, as everyone knows, with all power and glory.  Some 
of the time &amp;Baha'u'llah would spend at the Mansion, and 
again, at the farm village of &amp;Mazra'ih; for a while He 
would sojourn in Haifa, and occasionally His tent would 
be pitched on the heights of Mount Carmel.  Friends from 
everywhere presented themselves and gained an audience.  
The people and the government authorities witnessed it 
all, yet no one so much as breathed a word.  And this is one 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's greatest miracles:  that He, a captive, surrounded 
Himself with panoply and He wielded power.  
The prison changed into a palace, the jail itself became a 
Garden of Eden.  Such a thing has not occurred in history 
before; no former age has seen its like:  that a man confined 
to a prison should move about with authority and might; 
that one in chains should carry the fame of the Cause of 
God to the high heavens, should win splendid victories in 
both East and West, and should, by His almighty pen, 
subdue the world.  Such is the distinguishing feature of 
this supreme Theophany.  
     One day the government leaders, pillars of the country, 
the city's &amp;ulamas, leading mystics and intellectuals came 
out to the Mansion.  The Blessed Beauty paid them no attention 
whatever.  They were not admitted to His presence, 
nor did He inquire after any of them.  I sat down with them 
 
+P28 
and kept them company for some hours, after which they 
returned whence they had come.  Although the royal &amp;farman 
specifically decreed that &amp;Baha'u'llah was to be held in 
solitary confinement within the &amp;Akka fortress, in a cell, 
under perpetual guard; that He was never to set foot outside; 
that He was never even to see any of the believers-- 
notwithstanding such a &amp;farman, such a drastic order, His 
tent was raised in majesty on the heights of Mount Carmel.  
What greater display of power could there be than 
this, that from the very prison, the banner of the Lord was 
raised aloft, and rippled out for all the world to see!  
Praised be the Possessor of such majesty and might; praised 
be He, weaponed with the power and the glory; praised be 
He, Who defeated His foes when He lay captive in the 
&amp;Akka prison!  
     To resume:  &amp;Abdu's-Salih lived under a fortunate star, 
for he regularly came into the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He 
enjoyed the distinction of serving as gardener for many 
years, and he was at all times loyal, true, and strong in 
faith.  He was humble in the presence of every one of the 
believers; in all that time he never hurt nor offended any 
one.  And at the last he left his garden and hastened to the 
encompassing mercy of God.  
     The Ancient Beauty was well pleased with &amp;Abdu's-Salih, 
and after his ascension revealed a Visitation Tablet in 
his honor, also delivering an address concerning him, 
which was taken down and published together with other 
Scriptures.  
     Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious!  Upon him 
be God's gentleness and favor in the Exalted Realm.  
 
+P29 
&amp;Ustad &amp;Isma'il 
 
     Yet another from amongst 
that blessed company was 
&amp;Ustad &amp;Isma'il, the builder.  He was the construction overseer 
of &amp;Farrukh &amp;Khan (&amp;Aminu'd-Dawlih) in &amp;Tihran, living 
happily and prosperously, a man of high standing, well 
regarded by all.  But he lost his heart to the Faith, and 
was enraptured by it, till his holy passion consumed every 
intervening veil.  Then he cast caution aside, and became 
known throughout &amp;Tihran as a pillar of the &amp;Baha'is.  
     &amp;Farrukh &amp;Khan ably defended him at first.  But as time 
went on, he summoned him and said, "&amp;Ustad, you are very 
dear to me and I have given you my protection and have 
stood by you as best I could.  But the &amp;Shah has found out 
about you and you know what a bloodthirsty tyrant he is.  
I am afraid that he will seize you without warning, and he 
will hang you.  The best thing for you is to go on a journey.  
Leave this country, go somewhere else, and escape from 
this peril."  
     Composed, happy, &amp;Ustad gave up his work, closed his 
eyes to his possessions, and left for &amp;Iraq, where he lived in 
poverty.  He had recently taken a bride, and loved her beyond 
measure.  Her mother arrived, and by subterfuge, obtained 
his permission to conduct the daughter back to 
&amp;Tihran, supposedly for a visit.  As soon as she reached 
 
+P30 
&amp;Kirmanshah, she went to the mujtahid, and told him that 
because her son-in-law had abandoned his religion, her 
daughter could not remain his lawful wife.  The mujtahid 
arranged a divorce, and wedded the girl to another man.  
When word of this reached &amp;Baghdad, &amp;Isma'il, steadfast as 
ever, only laughed.  "God be praised!" he said.  "Nothing is 
left me on this pathway.  I have lost everything, including 
my bride.  I have been able to give Him all I possessed."  
     When &amp;Baha'u'llah departed from &amp;Baghdad, and traveled 
to Rumelia, the friends remained behind.  The inhabitants 
of &amp;Baghdad then rose up against those helpless believers, 
sending them away as captives to Mosul.  &amp;Ustad was old 
and feeble, but he left on foot, with no provisions for his 
journey, crossed over mountains and deserts, valleys and 
hills, and in the end arrived at the Most Great Prison.  At 
one time, &amp;Baha'u'llah had written down an ode of &amp;Rumi's 
for him, and had told him to turn his face toward the &amp;Bab 
and sing the words, set to a melody.  And so as he wandered 
through the long dark nights, &amp;Ustad would sing these 
lines:  
 
          I am lost, O Love, possessed and dazed, 
          Love's fool am I, in all the earth.  
          They call me first among the crazed, 
          Though I once came first for wit and worth.  
 
          O Love, who sellest me this wine,+F1 
          O Love, for whom I burn and bleed, 
          Love, for whom I cry and pine-- 
          Thou the Piper, I the reed.  
 
+F1 This wine, &amp;Rumi says elsewhere, comes from the jar of "Yea verily."  
+F1 That is, it symbolizes the Primal Covenant established between 
+F1 God and man on the day of "Am I not your Lord?"  On that day, the 
+F1 Creator summoned posterity out of the loins of Adam and said to the 
+F1 generations unborn, "Am I not your Lord?"  Whereupon they answered, 
+F1 "Yea, verily, Thou art."  Cf. &amp;Qur'an 7:171.  
 
+P31 
          If Thou wishest me to live, 
          Through me blow Thy holy breath.  
          The touch of Jesus Thou wilt give 
          To me, who've lain an age in death.  
 
          Thou, both End and Origin, 
          Thou without and Thou within-- 
          From every eye Thou hidest well, 
          And yet in every eye dost dwell.  
 
     He was like a bird with broken wings but he had the 
song and it kept him going onward to his one true Love.  
By stealth, he approached the Fortress and went in, but 
he was exhausted, spent.  He remained for some days, and 
came into the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, after which he was 
directed to look for a lodging in Haifa.  He got himself to 
Haifa, but he found no haven there, no nest or hole, no 
water, no grain of corn.  Finally he made his home in a cave 
outside the town.  He acquired a little tray and on this he 
set out rings of earthenware, and some thimbles, pins and 
other trinkets.  Every day, from morning till noon, he peddled 
these, wandering about.  Some days his earnings 
would amount to twenty paras,+F2 some days thirty; and forty 
on his best days.  Then he would go home to the cave and 
content himself with a piece of bread.  He was always voicing 
his thanks, always saying, "Praise be to God that I have 
attained such favor and grace; that I have been separated 
from friend and stranger alike, and have taken refuge in 
this cave.  Now I am of those who gave their all, to buy the 
Divine Joseph in the market place.  What bounty could be 
any greater than this!"  
     Such was his condition, when he died.  Many and many 
a time, &amp;Baha'u'llah was heard to express His satisfaction 
 
+F2 The Turkish para was one-ninth of a cent.  Cf. Webster, New International 
+F2 Dictionary.  
 
+P32 
with &amp;Ustad &amp;Isma'il.  Blessings hemmed him round, and the 
eye of God was on him.  Salutations be unto him, and 
praise.  Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious.  
 

&amp;Nabil-i-Zarandi 
 
     Still another of those who 
emigrated from their native 
land to be near &amp;Baha'u'llah was the great &amp;Nabil.+F1  In the 
flower of youth he bade farewell to his family in Zarand 
and with Divine aid began to teach the Faith.  He became 
a chief of the army of lovers, and on his quest he left Persian 
&amp;Iraq for Mesopotamia, but could not find the One he 
sought.  For the Well-Beloved was then in &amp;Kurdistan, living 
in a cave at &amp;Sar-Galu; and there, entirely alone in that wasteland, 
with no companion, no friend, no listening soul, He 
was communing with the beauty that dwelt in His own 
heart.  All news of Him was completely cut off; &amp;Iraq was 
eclipsed, and in mourning.  
     When &amp;Nabil discovered that the flame which had once 
been kindled and tended there was almost out, that the 
believers were few, that &amp;Yahya+F2 had crawled into a secret 
 
+F1 &amp;Nabil, author of The Dawn-Breakers, is &amp;Baha'u'llah's "Poet-Laureate, 
+F1 His chronicler and His indefatigable disciple."  Cf. God Passes 
+F1 By, p. 130.  
+F2 &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, the community's "nominal head," was the "center

+F2 One."  Ibid., p. 127-28.  
 
+P33 
hole where he lay torpid and inert, and that a wintry cold 
had taken over--he found himself obliged to leave, bitterly 
grieving, for &amp;Karbila.  There he stayed until the Blessed 
Beauty returned from &amp;Kurdistan, making His way to 
&amp;Baghdad.  At that time there was boundless joy; every believer 
in the country sprang to life; among them was &amp;Nabil, 
who hastened to the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and became 
the recipient of great bestowals.  He spent his days in gladness 
now, writing odes to celebrate the praises of his Lord.  
He was a gifted poet, and his tongue most eloquent; a man 
of mettle, and on fire with passionate love.  
     After a time he returned to &amp;Karbila, then came back to 
&amp;Baghdad and from there went on to Persia.  Because he 
associated with Siyyid &amp;Muhammad he was led into error 
and sorely afflicted and tried; but like the shooting stars, 
he became as a missile to drive off satanic imaginings,+F3 and 
he repulsed the evil whisperers and went back to &amp;Baghdad, 
where he found rest in the shade of the Holy Tree.  He was 
later directed to visit &amp;Kirmanshah.  He returned again, and 
on every journey was enabled to render a service.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah and His retinue then left &amp;Baghdad, the 
"Abode of Peace," for Constantinople, the "City of &amp;Islam."  
After His departure, &amp;Nabil put on the dress of a dervish, 
and set out on foot, catching up with the convoy along the 
way.  In Constantinople he was directed to return to Persia 
and there teach the Cause of God; also to travel throughout 
the country, and acquaint the believers in its cities and 
villages with all that had taken place.  When this mission 
was accomplished, and the drums of "Am I not your 
Lord?" were rolling out--for it was the "year eighty"+F4-- 
 
+F3 A reference to &amp;Islamic symbolism, according to which good is protected 
+F3 from evil:  the angels repel such evil spirits as attempt to spy on 
+F3 Paradise, by hurling shooting stars at them.  Cf. &amp;Qur'an 15:18, 37:10 
+F3 and 67:5.  
+F4 A reference to the declaration of &amp;Baha'u'llah's advent in 1863, as 
+F4 the Promised One of the &amp;Bab.  The &amp;Bab's own advent had taken place 
+F4 in the "year sixty"--1844.  
 
+P34 
&amp;Nabil hurried to Adrianople, crying as he went, "Yea 
verily Thou art!  Yea verily!" and "Lord, Lord, here am I!"  
     He entered &amp;Baha'u'llah's presence and drank of the red 
wine of allegiance and homage.  He was then given specific 
orders to travel everywhere, and in every region to 
raise the call that God was now made manifest:  to spread 
the blissful tidings that the Sun of Truth had risen.  He 
was truly on fire, driven by restive love.  With great fervor 
he would pass through a country, bringing this best of all 
messages and reviving the hearts.  He flamed like a torch in 
every company, he was the star of every assemblage, to all 
who came he held out the intoxicating cup.  He journeyed 
as to the beat of drums and at last he reached the &amp;Akka 
fortress.  
     In those days the restrictions were exceptionally severe.  
The gates were shut, the roads closed off.  Wearing a disguise, 
&amp;Nabil arrived at the &amp;Akka gate.  Siyyid &amp;Muhammad 
and his wretched accomplice immediately hurried to the 
Governorate and informed against the traveler.  "He is a 
Persian," they reported.  "He is not, as he seems, a man of 
&amp;Bukhara.  He has come here to seek for news of &amp;Baha'u'llah."  
The authorities expelled him at once.  
     &amp;Nabil, despairing, withdrew to the town of &amp;Safad.  Later 
he came on to Haifa, where he made his home in a cave 
on Mount Carmel.  He lived apart from friend and stranger 
alike, lamenting night and day, moaning and chanting 
prayers.  There he remained as a recluse, and waited for 
the doors to open.  When the predestined time of captivity 
was over, and the gates were flung wide, and the Wronged 
One issued forth in beauty, in majesty and glory, &amp;Nabil 
hastened to Him with a joyful heart.  Then he used himself 
up like a candle, burning away with the love of God.  
Day and night he sang the praises of the one Beloved of 
both worlds and of those about His threshold, writing 
verses in the pentameter and hexameter forms, composing 
 
+P35 
lyrics and long odes.  Almost daily, he was admitted to the 
presence of the Manifestation.+F5  
     This went on until the day &amp;Baha'u'llah ascended.  At that 
supreme affliction, that shattering calamity, &amp;Nabil sobbed 
and trembled and cried out to Heaven.  He found that the 
numerical value of the word "&amp;shidad"--year of stress--was 
309, and it thus became evident that &amp;Baha'u'llah foretold 
what had now come to pass.+F6  
     Utterly cast down, hopeless at being separated from 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, fevered, shedding tears, &amp;Nabil was in such 
anguish that anyone seeing him was bewildered.  He struggled 
on, but the only desire he had was to lay down his 
life.  He could suffer no longer; his longing was aflame in 
him; he could stand the fiery pain no more.  And so he became 
king of the cohorts of love, and he rushed into the 
sea.  
     Before that day when he offered himself up, he wrote 
out the year of his death in the one word:  "Drowned."+F7  
Then he threw down his life for the Well-Beloved, and 
was released from his despair, and no longer shut away.  
     This distinguished man was erudite, wise, and eloquent 
of speech.  His native genius was pure inspiration, his 
poetic gift like a crystal stream.  In particular his ode "&amp;Baha, 
&amp;Baha!" was written in sheer ecstasy.  Throughout all his 
life, from earliest youth till he was feeble and old, he spent 
 
+F5 &amp;Baha'i writings emphasize that the "divinity attributed to so great 
+F5 a Being and the complete incarnation of the names and attributes of 
+F5 God in so exalted a Person should, under no circumstances, be misconceived 
+F5 or misinterpreted ... that invisible yet rational God ... 
+F5 however much we extol the divinity of His Manifestations on earth, 
+F5 can in no wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His incorruptible 
+F5 and all-embracing Reality in ... a mortal being."  Cf. Shoghi 
+F5 Effendi, The Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
+F6 According to the abjad reckoning, the letters of "&amp;shidad" total 
+F6 309.  1892, the date of &amp;Baha'u'llah's ascension, was 1309 A.H. 
+F7 &amp;Ghariq.  The letters composing this word total 1310, which Hijra 
+F7 year began July 26, 1892.  
 
+P36 
his time serving and worshiping the Lord.  He bore hardships, 
he lived through misfortunes, he suffered afflictions.  
From the lips of the Manifestation he heard marvelous 
things.  He was shown the lights of Paradise; he won his 
dearest wish.  And at the end, when the Daystar of the 
world had set, he could endure no more, and flung himself 
into the sea.  The waters of sacrifice closed over him; 
he was drowned, and he came, at last, to the Most High.  
     Upon him be abundant blessings; upon him be tender 
mercies.  May he win a great victory, and a manifest grace 
in the Kingdom of God.  
 

&amp;Darvish &amp;Sidq-'Ali 
 
     &amp;Aqa &amp;Sidq-'Ali was yet one 
more of those who left 
their native land, journeyed to &amp;Baha'u'llah and were put 
in the Prison.  He was a dervish; a man who lived free and 
detached from friend and stranger alike.  He belonged to 
the mystic element and was a man of letters.  He spent 
some time wearing the dress of poverty, drinking the wine 
of the Rule and traveling the Path,+F1 but unlike the other 
&amp;Sufis he did not devote his life to dusty &amp;hashish; on the 
contrary, he cleansed himself of their vain imaginings and 
only searched for God, spoke of God, and followed the 
path of God.  
 
+F1 Terms used by the &amp;Sufis.  
 
+P37 
     He had a fine poetic gift and wrote odes to sing the 
praises of Him Whom the world has wronged and rejected.  
Among them is a poem written while he was a 
prisoner in the barracks at &amp;Akka, the chief couplet of 
which reads:  
 
          A hundred hearts Thy curling locks ensnare, 
          And it rains hearts when Thou dost toss Thy hair.  
 
     That free and independent soul discovered, in &amp;Baghdad, 
a trace of the untraceable Beloved.  He witnessed the dawning 
of the Daystar above the horizon of &amp;Iraq, and received 
the bounty of that sunrise.  He came under the spell of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, and was enraptured by that tender Companion.  
Although he was a quiet man, one who held his peace, 
his very limbs were like so many tongues crying out their 
message.  When the retinue of &amp;Baha'u'llah was about to 
leave &amp;Baghdad he implored permission to go along as a 
groom.  All day, he walked beside the convoy, and when 
night came he would attend to the horses.  He worked with 
all his heart.  Only after midnight would he seek his bed 
and lie down to rest; the bed, however, was his mantle, 
and the pillow a sun-dried brick.  
     As he journeyed, filled with yearning love, he would 
sing poems.  He greatly pleased the friends.  In him the 
name+F2 bespoke the man:  he was pure candor and truth; 
he was love itself; he was chaste of heart, and enamored 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In his high station, that of groom, he 
reigned like a king; indeed he gloried over the sovereigns 
of the earth.  He was assiduous in attendance upon &amp;Baha'u'llah; 
in all things, upright and true.  
     The convoy of the lovers went on; it reached Constantinople; 
it passed to Adrianople, and finally to the &amp;Akka 
 
+F2 &amp;Sidq, truth.  
 
+P38 
prison.  &amp;Sidq-'Ali was present throughout, faithfully serving 
its Commander.  
     While in the barracks, &amp;Baha'u'llah set apart a special 
night and He dedicated it to &amp;Darvish &amp;Sidq-'Ali.  He wrote 
that every year on that night the dervishes should bedeck 
a meeting place, which should be in a flower garden, and 
gather there to make mention of God.  He went on to say 
that "dervish" does not denote those persons who wander 
about, spending their nights and days in fighting and folly; 
rather, He said, the term designates those who are completely 
severed from all but God, who cleave to His laws, 
are firm in His Faith, loyal to His Covenant, and constant 
in worship.  It is not a name for those who, as the Persians 
say, tramp about like vagrants, are confused, unsettled in 
mind, a burden to others, and of all mankind the most 
coarse and rude.  
     This eminent dervish spent his whole life-span under 
the sheltering favor of God.  He was completely detached 
from worldly things.  He was attentive in service, and 
waited upon the believers with all his heart.  He was a 
servant to all of them, and faithful at the Holy Threshold.  
     Then came that hour when, not far from his Lord, he 
stripped off the cloak of life, and to physical eyes passed 
into the shadows, but to the mind's eye betook himself to 
what is plain as day; and he was seated there on a throne 
of lasting glory.  He escaped from the prison of this world, 
and pitched his tent in a wide and spacious land.  May 
God ever keep him close and bless him in that mystic 
realm with perpetual reunion and the beatific vision; may 
he be wrapped in tiers of light.  Upon him be the glory of 
God, the All-Glorious.  His grave is in &amp;Akka.  
 
+P39 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Mirza &amp;Mahmud and &amp;Aqa &amp;Rida 
 
     These two blessed souls, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Mahmud of &amp;Kashan 
and &amp;Aqa &amp;Rida of &amp;Shiraz, were like two lamps lit with God's 
love from the oil of His knowledge.  Encompassed by Divine 
bestowals from childhood on, they succeeded in rendering 
every kind of service for fifty-five years.  Their services 
were countless, beyond recording.  
     When the retinue of &amp;Baha'u'llah left &amp;Baghdad for Constantinople, 
He was accompanied by a great crowd of people.  
Along the way, they met with famine conditions.  
These two souls strode along on foot, ahead of the howdah 
in which &amp;Baha'u'llah was riding, and covered a distance 
of seven or eight &amp;farsakhs every day.  Wayworn and faint, 
they would reach the halting-place; and yet, weary as they 
were, they would immediately set about preparing and 
cooking the food, and seeing to the comfort of the believers.  
The efforts they made were truly more than flesh can 
bear.  There were times when they had not more than two 
or three hours sleep out of the twenty-four; because, once 
the friends had eaten their meal, these two would be busy 
collecting and washing up the dishes and cooking utensils; 
this would take them till midnight, and only then 
would they rest.  At daybreak they would rise, pack everything, 
and set out again, in front of the howdah of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P40 
See what a vital service they were able to render, and 
for what bounty they were singled out:  from the start of 
the journey, at &amp;Baghdad, to the arrival in Constantinople, 
they walked close beside &amp;Baha'u'llah; they made every one 
of the friends happy; they brought rest and comfort to all; 
they prepared whatever anyone asked.  
     &amp;Aqa &amp;Rida and &amp;Mirza &amp;Mahmud were the very essence of 
God's love, utterly detached from all but God.  In all that 
time no one ever heard either of them raise his voice.  They 
never hurt nor offended anyone.  They were trustworthy, 
loyal, true.  &amp;Baha'u'llah showered blessings upon them.  
They were continually entering His presence and He 
would be expressing His satisfaction with them.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Mahmud was a youth when he arrived in &amp;Baghdad 
from &amp;Kashan.  &amp;Aqa &amp;Rida became a believer in &amp;Baghdad.  
The spiritual condition of the two was indescribable.  
There was in &amp;Baghdad a company of seven leading believers 
who lived in a single, small room, because they were 
destitute.  They could hardly keep body and soul together, 
but they were so spiritual, so blissful, that they thought 
themselves in Heaven.  Sometimes they would chant prayers 
all night long, until the day broke.  Days, they would 
go out to work, and by nightfall one would have earned 
ten paras, another perhaps twenty paras, others forty or 
fifty.  These sums would be spent for the evening meal.  On 
a certain day one of them made twenty paras, while the 
rest had nothing at all.  The one with the money bought 
some dates, and shared them with the others; that was 
dinner, for seven people.  They were perfectly content 
with their frugal life, supremely happy.  
     These two honored men devoted their days to all that 
is best in human life:  they had seeing eyes; they were 
mindful and aware; they had hearing ears, and were fair 
of speech.  Their sole desire was to please &amp;Baha'u'llah.  To 
them, nothing was a bounty at all, except service at His 
 
+P41 
Holy Threshold.  After the time of the Supreme Affliction, 
they were consumed with sorrow, like candles flickering 
away; they longed for death, and stayed firm in the 
Covenant and labored hard and well to spread that Daystar's 
Faith.  They were close and trusted companions of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and could be relied on in all things.  They 
were always lowly, humble, unassuming, evanescent.  In all 
that long period, they never uttered a word which had to 
do with self.  
     And at the last, during the absence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, they 
took their flight to the Kingdom of unfading glory.  I sorrowed 
much because I was not with them when they 
died.  Although absent in body, I was there in my heart, 
and mourning over them; but to outward seeming I did not 
bid them good-by; this is why I grieve.  
     Unto them both be salutations and praise; upon them 
be compassion and glory.  May God give them a home in 
Paradise, under the Lote-Tree's shade.  May they be immersed 
in tiers of light, close beside their Lord, the 
Mighty, the All-Powerful.  
 

&amp;Pidar-Jan of &amp;Qazvin 
 
     The late &amp;Pidar-Jan was 
among those believers who 
emigrated to &amp;Baghdad.  He was a godly old man, enamored 
of the Well-Beloved; in the garden of Divine love, he was 
 
+P42 
like a rose full-blown.  He arrived there, in &amp;Baghdad, and 
spent his days and nights communing with God and chanting 
prayers; and although he walked the earth, he traveled 
the heights of Heaven.  
     To obey the law of God, he took up a trade, for he had 
nothing.  He would bundle a few pairs of socks under his 
arm and peddle them as he wandered through the streets 
and &amp;bazars, and thieves would rob him of his merchandise.  
Finally he was obliged to lay the socks across his outstretched 
palms as he went along.  But he would get to 
chanting a prayer, and one day he was surprised to find 
that they had stolen the socks, laid out on his two hands, 
from before his eyes.  His awareness of this world was 
clouded, for he journeyed through another.  He dwelt in 
ecstasy; he was a man drunken, bedazzled.  
     For some time, that is how he lived in &amp;Iraq.  Almost daily 
he was admitted to the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  His name 
was &amp;Abdu'llah but the friends bestowed on him the title of 
&amp;Pidar-Jan--Father Dear--for he was a loving father to 
them all.  At last, under the sheltering care of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
he took flight to the "seat of truth, in the presence of the 
potent king."+F1  
     May God make fragrant his sepulcher with the outpouring 
rains of His mercy and cast upon him the eye of 
Divine compassion.  Salutations be unto him, and praise.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 54:55 
 
+P43 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Sadiq-i-Yazdi 
 
     Another of those who emigrated 
to &amp;Baghdad was 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Sadiq of Yazd, a man esteemed, and righteous as 
his name, &amp;Sadiq.+F1  He was a towering palm in the groves of 
Heaven, a star flaming in the skies of the love of God.  
     It was during the &amp;Iraq period that he hastened to the 
presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  His detachment from the things 
of this world and his attachment to the life of the spirit 
are indescribable.  He was love embodied, tenderness personified.  
Day and night, he commemorated God.  Utterly 
unconscious of this world and all that is therein, he dwelt 
continually on God, remaining submerged in supplications 
and prayers.  Most of the time, tears poured from his 
eyes.  The Blessed Beauty singled him out for special favor, 
and whenever He turned His attention toward &amp;Sadiq, 
His loving-kindness was clear to see.  
     On a certain day they brought word that &amp;Sadiq was at 
the point of death.  I went to his bedside and found him 
breathing his last.  He was suffering from ileus, an abdominal 
pain and swelling.  I hurried to &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
described his condition.  
 
+F1 This word has a number of meanings, including truthful, loyal 
+F1 and just.  
 
+P44 
"Go," He said.  "Place your hand on the distended area 
and speak the words:  `O Thou the Healer!'"+F2  
     I went back.  I saw that the affected part had swollen up 
to the size of an apple; it was hard as stone, in constant 
motion, twisting, and coiling about itself like a snake.  I 
placed my hand upon it; I turned toward God and, humbly 
beseeching Him, I repeated the words, "O Thou the 
Healer!"  Instantly the sick man rose up.  The ileus vanished; 
the swelling was carried off.  
     This personified spirit lived contentedly in &amp;Iraq until 
the day when &amp;Baha'u'llah's convoy wended its way out of 
&amp;Baghdad.  As bidden, &amp;Sadiq remained behind in that city.  
But his longing beat so passionately within him that after 
the arrival of &amp;Baha'u'llah at Mosul, he could endure the 
separation no more.  Shoeless, hatless, he ran out alongside 
the courier going to Mosul; ran and ran until, on that 
barren plain, with mercy all about him, he fell to his rest.  
     May God give him to drink from "a wine cup tempered 
at the camphor fountain,"+F3 and send down crystal waters 
on his grave; may God perfume his dust in that desert 
place with musk, and cause to descend there range on 
range of light.  
 
+F2 &amp;Ya &amp;Shafi.

+P45 
&amp;Shah-Muhammad-Amin 
 
     &amp;Shah-Muhammad, who had 
the title of &amp;Amin, the 
Trusted One, was among the earliest of believers, and most 
deeply enamored.  He had listened to the Divine summons 
in the flower of his youth, and set his face toward the 
Kingdom.  He had ripped from his gaze the veils of idle 
suppositions and had won his heart's desire; neither the 
fancies current among the people nor the reproaches of 
which he was the target turned him back.  Unshaken, he 
stood and faced a sea of troubles; staunch with the 
strength of the Advent day, he confronted those who tried 
to thwart him and block his path.  The more they sought 
to instill doubts in his mind, the stronger he became; the 
more they tormented him, the more progress he made.  He 
was a captive of the face of God, enslaved by the beauty 
of the All-Glorious; a flame of God's love, a jetting fountain 
of the knowledge of Him.  
     Love smoldered in his heart, so that he had no peace; 
and when he could bear the absence of the Beloved One 
no more, he left his native home, the province of Yazd.  
He found the desert sands like silk under his feet; light 
as the wind's breath, he passed over the mountains and 
across the endless plains, until he stood at the door of his 
 
+P46 
Love.  He had freed himself from the snare of separation, 
and in &amp;Iraq, he entered the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Once he made his way into the home of the Darling of 
mankind, he was emptied of every thought, released from 
every concern, and became the recipient of boundless 
favor and grace.  He passed some days in &amp;Iraq and was directed 
to return to Persia.  There he remained for a time, 
frequenting the believers; and his pure breathings stirred 
each one of them anew, so that each one yearned over the 
Faith, and became more restless, more impatient than before.  
     Later he arrived at the Most Great Prison with &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Abu'l-Hasan, the second &amp;Amin.  On this journey he met 
with severe hardships, for it was extremely difficult to find 
a way into the prison.  Finally he was received by &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in the public baths.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Abu'l-Hasan was so overwhelmed 
at the majestic presence of his Lord that he 
shook, stumbled, and fell to the floor; his head was injured 
and the blood flowed out.  
     &amp;Amin, that is &amp;Shah-Muhammad, was honored with the 
title of the Trusted One, and bounties were showered upon 
him.  Full of eagerness and love, taking with him Tablets 
from &amp;Baha'u'llah, he hastened back to Persia, where, at all 
times worthy of trust, he labored for the Cause.  His services 
were outstanding, and he was a consolation to the believers' 
hearts.  There was none to compare with him for 
energy, enthusiasm and zeal, and no man's services could 
equal his.  He was a haven amidst the people, known everywhere 
for devotion to the Holy Threshold, widely acclaimed 
by the friends.  
     He never rested for a moment.  Not one night did he 
spend on a bed of ease, never did he lay down his head on 
comfort's pillow.  He was continuously in flight, soaring as 
the birds do, running like a deer, guesting in the desert of 
oneness, alone and swift.  He brought joy to all the believers; 
 
+P47 
to all, his coming was good news; to every seeker, he 
was a sign and token.  He was enamored of God, a vagrant 
in the desert of God's love.  Like the wind, he traveled over 
the face of the plains, and he was restive on the heights 
of the hills.  He was in a different country every day, and 
in yet another land by nightfall.  Never did he rest, never 
was he still.  He was forever rising up to serve.  
     But then they took him prisoner in &amp;Adhirbayjan, in the 
town of &amp;Miyandu'ab.  He fell a prey to some ruthless 
Kurds, a hostile band who asked no questions of the innocent, 
defenseless man.  Believing that this stranger, like 
other foreigners, wished ill to the Kurdish people, and 
taking him for worthless, they killed him.  
     When news of his martyrdom reached the Prison, all 
the captives grieved, and they shed tears for him, resigned 
to God and undefended as he was in his last hour.  Even 
on the countenance of &amp;Baha'u'llah, there were visible tokens 
of grief.  A Tablet, infinitely tender, was revealed by 
the Supreme Pen, commemorating the man who died on 
that calamitous plain, and many other Tablets were sent 
down concerning him.  
     Today, under the shadowing mercy of God, he dwells 
in the bright Heavens.  He communes with the birds of 
holiness, and in the assemblage of splendors he is immersed 
in light.  The memory and praise of him shall remain, till 
the end of time, in the pages of books and on the tongues 
and lips of men.  
     Unto him be salutations and praise; upon him be the 
glory of the All-Glorious; upon him be the most great 
mercy of God.  
 
+P48 
&amp;Mashhadi &amp;Fattah 
 
     &amp;Mashhadi &amp;Fattah was 
personified spirit.  He 
was devotion itself.  Brother to &amp;Haji &amp;Ali-'Askar--of the same 
pure lineage--through the latter he came into the Faith.  
Like the twins, Castor and Pollux, the two kept together in 
one spot, and both were illumined with the light of belief.  
     In all things, the two were united as a pair; they shared 
the same certitude and faith, the same conscience, and 
made their way out of &amp;Adhirbayjan to Adrianople, emigrating 
at the same time.  In every circumstance of their 
life, they lived as one individual; their disposition, their 
aims, their religion, character, behavior, faith, certitude, 
knowledge--all were one.  Even in the Most Great Prison, 
they were constantly together.  
     &amp;Mashhadi &amp;Fattah possessed some merchandise; this was 
all he owned in the world.  He had entrusted it to persons 
in Adrianople, and later on those unrighteous people did 
away with the goods.  Thus, in the pathway of God, he 
lost whatever he possessed.  He passed his days, perfectly 
content, in the Most Great Prison.  He was utter selflessness; 
from him, no one ever heard a syllable to indicate 
that he existed.  He was always in a certain corner of the 
prison, silently meditating, occupied with the remembrance 
 
+P49 
of God; at all times spiritually alert and mindful, 
in a state of supplication.  
     Then came the Supreme Affliction.  He could not tolerate 
the anguish of parting with &amp;Baha'u'llah, and after 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's passing, he died of grief.  Blessed is he; again, 
blessed is he.  Glad tidings to him; again, glad tidings to 
him.  Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious.  
 

&amp;Nabil of &amp;Qa'in 
 
     This distinguished man, 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Ali,+F1 
was one of those whose hearts were drawn to &amp;Baha'u'llah 
before the Declaration of the &amp;Bab; it was then that he 
drank the red wine of knowledge from the hands of the 
Cupbearer of grace.  It happened that a prince, who was 
the son of &amp;Mir &amp;Asadu'llah &amp;Khan, prince of &amp;Qa'in, was commanded 
to remain as a political hostage in &amp;Tihran.  He was 
young, far away from his loving father, and &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
was his tutor and guardian.  Since the youth 
was a stranger in &amp;Tihran, the Blessed Beauty showed him 
special kindness.  Many a night the young prince was 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's guest at the mansion, and &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
would accompany him.  This was prior to the Declaration 
of the &amp;Bab.  
 
+F1 &amp;Nabil of &amp;Qa'in was his title.  
 
+P50 
     It was then that this chief of all trusted friends was 
captivated by &amp;Baha'u'llah, and wherever he went, spread 
loving praise of Him.  After the way of &amp;Islam, he also related 
the great miracles which he had, with his own eyes, 
seen &amp;Baha'u'llah perform, and the marvels he had heard.  
He was in ecstasy, burning up with love.  In that condition, 
he returned to &amp;Qa'in with the prince.  
     Later on that eminent scholar, &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad of 
&amp;Qa'in (whose title was &amp;Nabil-i-Akbar) was made a mujtahid, 
a doctor of religious law, by the late &amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtada; 
he left, then, for &amp;Baghdad, became an ardent follower of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, and hastened back to Persia.  The leading divines 
and mujtahids were well aware of and acknowledged 
his vast scholarly accomplishments, the breadth of 
his learning, and his high rank.  When he reached &amp;Qa'in, 
he began openly to spread the new Faith.  The moment 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Ali heard the name of the Blessed 
Beauty, he immediately accepted the &amp;Bab.  "I had the 
honor," he said, "of meeting the Blessed Beauty in &amp;Tihran.  
The instant I saw Him, I became His slave."  
     In his village of &amp;Sar-Chah, this gifted, high-minded man 
began to teach the Faith.  He guided in his own family and 
saw to the others as well, bringing a great multitude under 
the law of the love of God, leading each one to the path 
of salvation.  
     Up to that time he had always been a close companion 
of &amp;Mir &amp;Alam &amp;Khan, the Governor of &amp;Qa'in, had rendered 
him important services, and had enjoyed the Governor's 
respect and trust.  Now that shameless prince turned 
against him in a rage on account of his religion, seized his 
property and plundered it; for the &amp;Amir was terrified of 
&amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah.  He banished &amp;Nabil-i-Akbar and ruined 
&amp;Nabil of &amp;Qa'in.  After throwing him in prison and torturing 
him, he drove him out as a homeless vagrant.  
     To &amp;Nabil, the sudden calamity was a blessing, the sacking 
 
+P51 
of his earthly goods, the expulsion into the desert, was 
a kingly crown and the greatest favor God could grant 
him.  For some time he remained in &amp;Tihran, to outward 
seeming a pauper of no fixed abode, but inwardly rejoicing; 
for this is the characteristic of every soul who is firm 
in the Covenant.  
     He had access to the society of the great and knew the 
condition of the various princes.  He would, therefore, 
frequent some of them and give them the message.  He was 
a consolation to the hearts of the believers and as a drawn 
sword to the enemies of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He was one of those 
of whom we read in the &amp;Qur'an:  "For the Cause of God 
shall they strive hard; the blame of the blamer shall they 
not fear."+F2  Day and night he toiled to promote the Faith, 
and with all his might to spread abroad the clear signs of 
God.  He would drink and drink again of the wine of God's 
love, was clamorous as the storm clouds, restless as the 
waves of the sea.  
     Permission came, then, for him to visit the Most Great 
Prison; for in &amp;Tihran, as a believer, he had become a 
marked man.  They all knew of his conversion; he had no 
caution, no patience, no reserve; he cared nothing for 
reticence, nothing for dissimulation.  He was utterly fearless 
and in terrible danger.  
     When he arrived at the Most Great Prison, the hostile 
watchers drove him off, and try as he might he found no 
way to enter.  He was obliged to leave for Nazareth, where 
he lived for some time as a stranger, alone with his two 
sons, &amp;Aqa &amp;Qulam-Husayn and &amp;Aqa &amp;Ali-Akbar, grieving and 
praying.  At last a plan was devised to introduce him into 
the fortress and he was summoned to the prison where they 
had immured the innocent.  He came in such ecstasy as 
cannot be described, and was admitted to the presence of 
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 5:59.  
 
+P52 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  When he entered there and lifted his eyes to 
the Blessed Beauty he shook and trembled and fell unconscious 
to the floor.  &amp;Baha'u'llah spoke words of loving-kindness 
to him and he rose again.  He spent some days 
hidden in the barracks, after which he returned to Nazareth.  
     The inhabitants of Nazareth wondered much about 
him.  They told one another that he was obviously a great 
and distinguished man in his own country, a notable and 
of high rank; and they asked themselves why he should 
have chosen such an out-of-the-way corner of the world 
as Nazareth and how he could be contented with such 
poverty and hardship.  
     When, in fulfillment of the promise of the Most Great 
Name, the gates of the Prison were flung wide, and all the 
friends and travelers could enter and leave the fortress-town 
in peace and with respect, &amp;Nabil of &amp;Qa'in would 
journey to see &amp;Baha'u'llah once in every month.  However, 
as commanded by Him, he continued to live in Nazareth, 
where he converted a number of Christians to the Faith; 
and there he would weep, by day and night, over the 
wrongs that were done to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     His means of livelihood was his business partnership 
with me.  That is, I provided him with a capital of three 
krans;+F3 with it he bought needles, and this was his stock-in-trade.  
The women of Nazareth gave him eggs in exchange 
for his needles and in this way he would obtain 
thirty or forty eggs a day:  three needles per egg.  Then he 
would sell the eggs and live on the proceeds.  Since there 
was a daily caravan between &amp;Akka and Nazareth, he 
would refer to &amp;Aqa &amp;Rida each day, for more needles.  Glory 
be to God!  He survived two years on that initial outlay of 
capital; and he returned thanks at all times.  You can tell 
 
+F3 The kran was 20 &amp;shahis, or almost 8 cents.  Cf. Webster, op. cit.  
 
+P53 
how detached he was from worldly things by this one fact:  
the Nazarenes used to say it was plain to see from the old 
man's manner and behavior that he was very rich, and 
that if he lived so modestly it was only because he was a 
stranger in a strange place--hiding his wealth by setting up 
as a peddler of needles.  
     Whenever he came into the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah he 
received still more evidences of favor and love.  For all seasons, 
he was a close friend and companion to me.  When 
sorrows attacked me I would send for him, and then I 
would rejoice just to see him again.  How wonderful his 
talk was, how attractive his society.  Bright of face he was; 
free of heart; loosed from every earthly tie, always on the 
wing.  Toward the end he made his home in the Most 
Great Prison, and every day he entered the presence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     On a certain day, walking through the &amp;bazar with his 
friends, he met a gravedigger named &amp;Haji &amp;Ahmad.  Although 
in the best of health, he addressed the gravedigger 
and laughingly told him:  "Come along with me."  Accompanied 
by the believers and the gravedigger he made for 
&amp;Nabiyu'llah &amp;Salih.  Here he said:  "O &amp;Haji &amp;Ahmad, I have 
a request to make of you:  when I move on, out of this 
world and into the next, dig my grave here, beside the 
Purest Branch.+F4  This is the favor I ask."  So saying, he gave 
the man a gift of money.  
     That very evening, not long after sunset, word came that 
&amp;Nabil of &amp;Qa'in had been taken ill.  I went to his home at 
once.  He was sitting up, and conversing.  He was radiant, 
laughing, joking, but for no apparent reason the sweat was 
pouring off his face--it was rushing down.  Except for this 
 
+F4 &amp;Mirza &amp;Mihdi, the son of &amp;Baha'u'llah who, praying one evening on 
+F4 the barracks roof, fell to his death.  Cf. God Passes By, p. 188.  
 
+P54 
he had nothing the matter with him.  The perspiring went 
on and on; he weakened, lay in his bed, and toward morning, 
died.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah would refer to him with infinite grace and 
loving-kindness, and revealed a number of Tablets in his 
name.  The Blessed Beauty was wont, after &amp;Nabil's passing, 
to recall that ardor, the power of that faith, and to comment 
that here was a man who had recognized Him, prior 
to the advent of the &amp;Bab.  
     All hail to him for this wondrous bestowal.  "Blessedness 
awaiteth him and a goodly home...  And God will single 
out for His mercy whomsoever He willeth."+F5  
 

Siyyid &amp;Muhammad-Taqi &amp;Manshadi 
 
     &amp;Muhammad-Taqi came 
from the village of 
&amp;Manshad.  When still young, he learned of the Faith of 
God.  In holy ecstasy, his mind turned Heavenward, and his 
heart was flooded with light.  Divine grace descended upon 
him; the summons of God so enraptured him that he 
threw the peace of &amp;Manshad to the winds.  Leaving his 
kinsfolk and children, he set out over mountains and desert 
plains, passed from one halting-place to the next, came to 
the seashore, crossed over the sea and at last reached the 
 
+F5 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 13:28; 2:99; 3:67.  
 
+P55 
city of Haifa.  From there he hastened on to &amp;Akka and entered 
the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     In the early days he opened a small shop in Haifa and 
carried on some trifling business.  God's blessing descended 
upon it, and it prospered.  That little corner became the 
haven of the pilgrims.  When they arrived, and again at 
their departure, they were guests of the high-minded and 
generous &amp;Muhammad-Taqi.  He also helped to manage the 
affairs of the believers, and would get together their means 
of travel.  He proved unfailingly reliable, loyal, worthy of 
trust.  Ultimately he became the intermediary through 
whom Tablets could be sent away and mail from the believers 
could come in.  He performed this service with perfect 
dependability, accomplishing it in a most pleasing way, 
scrupulously despatching and receiving the correspondence 
at all times.  Trusted by everyone, he became known in 
many parts of the world, and received unnumbered bounties 
from &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He was a treasury of justice and 
righteousness, entirely free from any attachment to worldly 
things.  He had accustomed himself to a very spare way of 
life, caring nothing for food or sleep, comfort or peace.  He 
lived all alone in a single room, passed the nights on a 
couch of palm branches, and slept in a corner.  But to the 
travelers, he was a spring in the desert; for them, he provided 
the softest of pillows, and the best table he could afford.  
He had a smiling face and by nature was spiritual 
and serene.  
     After the Daystar of the Supreme Concourse had set, 
Siyyid &amp;Manshadi remained loyal to the Covenant, a sharp 
sword confronting the violators.  They tried every ruse, 
every deceit, all their subtlest expedients; it is beyond imagining 
how they showered favors on him and what honors 
they paid him, what feasts they prepared, what pleasures 
they offered, all this to make a breach in his faith.  
Yet every day he grew stronger than before, continued to 
 
+P56 
be staunch and true, kept free from every unseemly 
thought, and shunned whatever went contrary to the Covenant 
of God.  When they finally despaired of shaking his 
resolve, they harassed him in every possible way, and 
plotted his financial ruin.  He remained, however, the 
quintessence of constancy and trust.  
     When, at the instigation of the violators, &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid 
began his opposition to me, I was obliged to send &amp;Manshadi 
away to Port &amp;Said, because he was widely known 
among the people as the distributor of our mail.  I then 
had to relay the correspondence to him through intermediaries 
who were unknown, and he would send the 
letters on as before.  In this way the treacherous and the 
hostile were unable to take over the mail.  During the latter 
days of &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, when a commission of investigation 
appeared and--urged on by those familiars-turned-strangers-- 
made plans to tear out the Holy Tree by the 
roots; when they determined to cast me into the depths of 
the sea or banish me to the Fezzan, and this was their settled 
purpose; and when the commission accordingly tried 
their utmost to get hold of some document or other, they 
failed.  In the thick of all that turmoil, with all the pressures 
and restraints, and the foul attacks of those persons 
who were pitiless as &amp;Yazid,+F1 still the mail went through.  
     For many long years, Siyyid &amp;Manshadi befittingly performed 
this service in Port &amp;Said.  The friends were uniformly 
pleased with him.  In that city he earned the gratitude 
of travelers, placed those who had emigrated in his 
debt, brought joy to the local believers.  Then the heavy 
heat of Egypt proved too much for him; he took to his bed, 
 
+F1 &amp;Yazid (son of &amp;Mu'aviyyih), &amp;Ummayad Caliph by whose order the 
+F1 &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn was martyred.  Proverbial for cruelty.  Cf. S. &amp;Haim, 
+F1 New Persian-English Dictionary, s.v.  
 
+P57 
and in a raging fever, cast off the robe of life.  He abandoned 
Port &amp;Said for the Kingdom of Heaven, and rose up 
to the mansions of the Lord.  
     Siyyid &amp;Manshadi was the essence of virtue and intellect.  
His qualities and attainments were such as to amaze the 
most accomplished minds.  He had no thought except of 
God, no hope but to win the good pleasure of God.  He was 
the embodiment of "Keep all my words of prayer and praise 
confined to one refrain; make all my life but servitude 
to Thee."  
     May God cool his feverish pain with the grace of reunion 
in the Kingdom, and heal his sickness with the balm 
of nearness to Him in the Realm of the All-Beauteous.  
Upon him be the glory of God the Most Glorious.  
 

&amp;Muhammad-'Ali &amp;Sabbaq of Yazd 
 
     Early in youth, &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
&amp;Sabbaq became a 
believer while in &amp;Iraq.  He tore away hindering veils and 
doubts, escaped from his delusions and hastened to the 
welcoming shelter of the Lord of Lords.  A man to outward 
seeming without education, for he could neither read nor 
write, he was of sharp intelligence and a trustworthy 
friend.  Through one of the believers, he was brought into 
the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and was soon widely known 
to the public as a disciple.  He found himself a corner to 
 
+P58 
live in, close beside the house of the Blessed Beauty, and 
mornings and evenings would enter the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
For a time he was supremely happy.  
     When &amp;Baha'u'llah and His retinue left &amp;Baghdad for 
Constantinople, &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-'Ali was of that company, 
and fevered with the love of God.  We reached Constantinople; 
and since the Government obliged us to settle 
in Adrianople we left &amp;Muhammad-'Ali in the Turkish capital 
to assist the believers as they came and went through 
that city.  We then went on to Adrianople.  This man remained 
alone and he suffered intense distress for he had 
no friend nor companion nor anyone to care for him.  
     After two years of this he came on to Adrianople, seeking 
a haven in the loving-kindness of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He went 
to work as a peddler, and when the great rebellion+F1 began 
and the oppressors drove the friends to the extreme of adversity, 
he too was among the prisoners and was exiled 
with us to the fortress at &amp;Akka.  
     He spent a considerable time in the Most Great Prison, 
after which &amp;Baha'u'llah desired him to leave for Sidon, 
where he engaged in trade.  Sometimes he would return 
and be received by &amp;Baha'u'llah, but otherwise he stayed in 
Sidon.  He lived respected and trusted, a credit to all.  When 
 
+F1 The rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, who had been named provisional 
+F1 chief of the &amp;Babi community.  The &amp;Bab had never appointed a successor 
+F1 or viceregent, instead referring His disciples to the imminent advent 
+F1 of His Promised One.  In the interim a virtual unknown was, for 
+F1 security reasons, made the ostensible leader.  Following His declaration 
+F1 in 1863 as the Promised One of the &amp;Bab, &amp;Baha'u'llah withdrew for a 
+F1 time, in Adrianople, to allow the exiles a free choice as between Him 
+F1 and this unworthy half brother, whose crimes and follies had threatened 
+F1 to destroy the infant Faith.  Terrified at being challenged to face 
+F1 &amp;Baha'u'llah in a public debate, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya refused, and was completely 
+F1 discredited.  As &amp;Baha'i history has repeatedly demonstrated, this 
+F1 crisis too, however grievous, resulted in still greater victories for the 
+F1 Faith--including the rallying of prominent disciples to &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
+F1 and the global proclamation of &amp;Baha'u'llah's mission, in His Tablets to 
+F1 the Pope and Kings.  Cf. God Passes By, p. 28, Chapter X and passim.  
 
+P59 
the Supreme Affliction came upon us, he returned to &amp;Akka 
and passed the remainder of his days near the Holy Tomb.  
     The friends, one and all, were pleased with him, and he 
was cherished at the Holy Threshold; in this state he 
soared to abiding glory, leaving his kin to mourn.  He was 
a kind man, an excellent one:  content with God's will for 
him, thankful, a man of dignity, long-suffering.  Upon him 
be the glory of the All-Glorious.  May God send down, 
upon his scented tomb in &amp;Akka, tiers of celestial light.  
 

&amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar of &amp;Isfahan 
 
     Another of those who left 
their homeland to become 
our neighbors and fellow prisoners was &amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar of 
&amp;Isfahan.  He was a highly perceptive individual who, on 
commercial business, had traveled about Asia Minor for 
many years.  He made a journey to &amp;Iraq, where &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
of &amp;Sad (&amp;Isfahan) brought him into the shelter 
of the Faith.  He soon ripped off the bandage of illusions 
that had blinded his eyes before, and he rose up, 
winging to salvation in the Heaven of Divine love.  With 
him, the veil had been thin, almost transparent, and that 
is why, as the first word was imparted, he was immediately 
released from the world of idle imaginings and attached 
himself to the One Who is clear to see.  
     On the journey from &amp;Iraq to the Great City, Constantinople, 
 
+P60 
&amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar was a close and agreeable companion.  
He served as interpreter for the entire company, 
for he spoke excellent Turkish, a language in which none 
of the friends was proficient.  The journey came peacefully 
to an end and then, in the Great City, he continued on, as 
a companion and friend.  The same was true in Adrianople 
and also when, as one of the prisoners, he accompanied us 
to the city of Haifa.  
     Here, the oppressors determined to send him to Cyprus.  
He was terrified and shouted for help, for he longed to be 
with us in the Most Great Prison.+F1  When they held him 
back by force, from high up on the ship he threw himself 
into the sea.  This had no effect whatever on the brutal officers.  
After dragging him from the water they held him 
prisoner on the ship, cruelly restraining him, and carrying 
him away by force to Cyprus.  He was jailed in Famagusta, 
but one way or another managed to escape and hastened to 
&amp;Akka.  Here, protecting himself from the malevolence of 
our oppressors, he changed his name to &amp;Abdu'llah.  Sheltered 
within the loving-kindness of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he passed 
his days at ease, and happy.  
     But when the world's great Light had set, to shine on 
forever from the All-Luminous Horizon, &amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar 
was beside himself and a prey to anguish.  He no longer 
had a home.  He left for Damascus and spent some time 
there, pent up in his sorrow, mourning by day and night.  
He grew weaker and weaker.  We despatched &amp;Haji &amp;Abbas 
there, to nurse him and give him treatment and care, and 
send back word of him every day.  But &amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar 
would do nothing but talk, unceasingly, at every hour, 
 
+F1 &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya had not been banished from Persia.  Now, however, 
+F1 he was being exiled from Adrianople to Cyprus, and &amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar 
+F1 was one of the four companions condemned to go with him.  Cf. &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
+F1 Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 166, and God Passes By, 
+F1 p. 182.  
 
+P61 
with his nurse, and tell how he longed to go his way, into 
the mysterious country beyond.  And at the end, far from 
home, exiled from his Love, he set out for the Holy 
Threshold of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     He was truly a man long-suffering, and mild; a man of 
good character, good acts, and goodly words.  Greetings and 
praise be unto him, and the glory of the All-Glorious.  His 
sweet-scented tomb is in Damascus.  
 

&amp;Ali &amp;Najaf-Abadi 
 
     Also among the emigrants 
and near neighbors was 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Ali &amp;Najaf-Abadi.  When this spiritual young man first 
listened to the call of God he set his lips to the holy cup 
and beheld the glory of the Speaker on the Mount.  And 
when, by grace of the light, he had attained positive knowledge, 
he journeyed to the Most Great Prison, where he 
witnessed the substance of knowledge itself, and arrived at 
the high station of indubitable truth.  
     For a long time he remained in and about the sacred 
city; he became the proverbial &amp;Habibu'llah the Merchant, 
and spent his days relying upon God, in supplication and 
prayer.  He was a man meek, quiet, uncomplaining, steadfast; 
in all things pleasing, worthy of praise.  He won the 
approval of all the friends and was accepted and welcome 
at the Holy Threshold.  During his latter days, when he 
 
+P62 
felt that a happy end was in store for him, he again presented 
himself at the holy city of the Most Great Prison.  
Upon arrival he fell ill, weakened, passed his hours in supplicating 
God.  The breath of life ceased within him, the 
gates of flight to the supreme Kingdom were flung wide, 
he turned his eyes away from this world of dust and went 
onward to the Holy Place.  
     &amp;Ali &amp;Najaf-Abadi was tender and sensitive of heart, at 
all times mindful of God and remembering Him, and toward 
the close of his life detached, without stain, free 
from the contagion of this world.  Sweetly, he gave up his 
corner of the earth, and pitched his tent in the land beyond.  
May God send upon him the pure savors of forgiveness, 
brighten his eyes with beholding the Divine Beauty 
in the Kingdom of Splendors, and refresh his spirit with 
the musk-scented winds that blow from the &amp;Abha Realm.  
Unto him be salutation and praise.  His sweet and holy 
dust lies in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Mashhadi &amp;Husayn and &amp;Mashhadi 
&amp;Muhammad-i-Adhirbayjani 
 
     &amp;Mashhadi &amp;Husayn and 
&amp;Mashhadi &amp;Muhammad 
were both from the province of &amp;Adhirbayjan.  They were 
pure souls who took the great step in their own country:  
 
+P63 
they freed themselves from friend and stranger alike, escaped 
from the superstitions that had blinded them before, 
strengthened their resolve, and bowed themselves down 
before the grace of God, the Lord of Life.  They were 
blessed souls, loyal, unsullied in faith; evanescent, submissive, 
poor, content with the will of God, in love with His 
guiding Light, rejoicing over the great message.  They left 
their province and traveled to Adrianople.  Here beside the 
holy city they lived for quite a time in the village of &amp;Qumruq-Kilisa.  
By day, they supplicated God and communed 
with Him; by night, they wept, bemoaning the plight of 
Him Whom the world hath wronged.  
     When the exile to &amp;Akka was under way, they were not 
present in the city and thus were not arrested.  Heavy of 
heart, they continued on in that area, shedding their tears.  
Once they had obtained a definite report from &amp;Akka, they 
left Rumelia and came here:  two excellent souls, loyal 
bondsmen of the Blessed Beauty.  It is impossible to tell 
how translucent they were of heart, how firm in faith.  
     They lived outside &amp;Akka in &amp;Bagh-i-Firdaws, worked as 
farmers, and spent their days returning thanks to God because 
once again they had won their way to the neighborhood 
of grace and love.  But they were natives of &amp;Adhirbayjan, 
accustomed to the cold, and they could not endure 
the local heat.  Furthermore, this was during our early days 
in &amp;Akka, when the air was noxious, and the water unwholesome 
in the extreme.  They both fell ill of a chronic, 
high fever.  They bore it cheerfully, with amazing patience.  
During their days of illness, despite the assault of the fever, 
the violence of their ailment, the raging thirst, the restlessness, 
they remained inwardly at peace, rejoicing at the Divine 
glad tidings.  And at a time when they were offering 
thanks with all their heart, they hurried away from this 
world and entered the other; they escaped from this cage 
and were released into the garden of immortality.  Upon 
 
+P64 
them be the mercy of God, and may He be well pleased 
with them.  Unto them be salutations and praise.  May God 
bring them into the Realm that abides forever, to delight 
in reunion with Him, to bask in the Kingdom of Splendors.  
Their two luminous tombs are in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'r-Rahim-i-Yazdi 
 
     &amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'r-Rahim of 
Yazd was a precious soul, 
from his earliest years virtuous and God-fearing, and 
known among the people as a holy man, peerless in observing 
his religious duties, mindful as to his acts.  His 
strong religious faith was an indisputable fact.  He served 
and worshiped God by day and night, was sound, mild, 
compassionate, a loyal friend.  
     Because he was fully prepared, at the very moment 
when he heard the summons from the Supreme Horizon
--heard the drumbeats of "Am I not your Lord?"--he instantly 
cried out, "Yea, verily!"  With his whole being, he 
became enamored of the splendors shed by the Light of the 
World.  Openly and boldly he began to confirm his family 
and friends.  This was soon known throughout the city; to 
the eyes of the evil &amp;ulamas, he was now an object of hate 
and contempt.  Incurring their wrath, he was despised by 
those creatures of their own low passions.  He was molested 
and harassed; the inhabitants rioted, and the evil &amp;ulamas 
 
+P65 
plotted his death.  The government authorities turned on 
him as well, hounded him, even subjected him to torture.  
They beat him with clubs, and whipped him.  All this went 
on, by day and night.  
     He was forced, then, to abandon his home and go out of 
the city, a vagrant, climbing the mountains, crossing over 
the plains, until he came to the Holy Land.  But so weak he 
was, and wasted away, that whoever saw him thought he 
was breathing his last; when he reached Haifa, &amp;Nabil of 
&amp;Qa'in hurried to &amp;Akka, and desired me to summon the 
&amp;Haji at once, because he was in his death agony and failing 
fast.  
     "Let me go to the Mansion," I said, "and ask leave."  
     "It would take too long," he said.  "And then &amp;Abdu'r-Rahim 
will never see &amp;Akka.  I long for him to have this 
bounty; for him at least to see &amp;Akka, and die.  I beg of You, 
send for him at once!"  
     Complying with his wish, I summoned &amp;Abdu'r-Rahim.  
When he came, I could hardly detect in him a whisper of 
life.  At times he would open his eyes, but he spoke no 
word.  Still, the sweet savors of the Most Great Prison restored 
the vital spark, and his yearning to meet &amp;Baha'u'llah 
breathed life into him again.  I looked in on him the next 
morning and found him cheerful and refreshed.  He asked 
permission to attend upon &amp;Baha'u'llah.  "It all depends," I 
answered, "on whether He grants you leave.  God willing, 
you shall be singled out for this cherished gift."  
     A few days later, permission came, and he hastened to 
the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  When &amp;Abdu'r-Rahim entered 
there, the spirit of life was wafted over him.  On his return, 
it was clear that this &amp;Haji had become a different &amp;Haji entirely:  
he was in the bloom of health.  &amp;Nabil was dumbfounded, 
and said:  "How life-giving, to a true believer, is 
this prison air!"  
     For some time, &amp;Abdu'r-Rahim lived in the neighborhood.  
 
+P66 
He spent his hours remembering and praising God; 
he chanted prayers, and carefully attended to his religious 
duties.  Thus he saw few people.  This servant paid special 
attention to his needs, and ordered a light diet for him.  
But it all came to an end with the Supreme Affliction, the 
ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  There was anguish then, and the 
noise of loud weeping.  With his heart on fire, his eyes raining 
tears, he struggled weakly to move about; so his days 
went by, and always, he longed to make his exit from this 
rubbish heap, the world.  At last he broke away from the 
torment of his loss, and hurried on to the Realm of God, 
and came to the assemblage of Divine splendor in the 
Kingdom of Lights.  
     Unto him be salutations and praise, and mercy ineffable.  
May God scatter on his resting-place rays from the mysterious 
Realm.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'llah &amp;Najaf-Abadi 
 
     Once he had become a believer, 
&amp;Haji &amp;Abdu'llah 
left his native Persia, hastened to the Holy Land, and under 
the sheltering grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah found peace of 
heart.  He was a man confident, steadfast and firm; certain 
of the manifold bounties of God; of an excellent disposition 
and character.  
     He spent his days in friendly association with the other 
 
+P67 
believers.  Then for a while he went to &amp;Ghawr, near Tiberias, 
where he farmed, both tilling the soil and devoting 
much of his time to supplicating and communing with 
God.  He was an excellent man, high-minded and unsullied.  
     Later he returned from &amp;Ghawr, settled near &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in Junayna, and came often into His presence.  His eyes 
were fixed on the &amp;Abha Kingdom; sometimes he would 
shed tears and moan, again he would rejoice, glad because 
he had achieved his supreme desire.  He was completely 
detached from all but God, happy in God's grace.  He 
would keep a vigil most of the night, remaining in a state 
of prayer.  Then death came at the appointed hour, and in 
the shadowing care of &amp;Baha'u'llah he ascended, hurried 
away from this world of dust to the high Firmament, 
soared upward to the secret land.  Unto him be salutations, 
mercy and praise, in the neighborhood of his exalted Lord.  
 

&amp;Muhammad-Hadiy-i-Sahhaf 
 
     Yet one more among those 
who emigrated and came 
to settle near &amp;Baha'u'llah was the bookbinder, &amp;Muhammad-Hadi.  
This noted man was from &amp;Isfahan, and as a 
binder and illuminator of books he had no peer.  When he 
gave himself up to the love of God he was alert on the path 
and fearless.  He abandoned his home and began a dreadful 
 
+P68 
journey, passing with extreme hardship from one country 
to another until he reached the Holy Land and became 
a prisoner.  He stationed himself by the Holy Threshold, 
carefully sweeping it and keeping watch.  Through his 
constant efforts, the square in front of &amp;Baha'u'llah's house 
was at all times swept, sprinkled and immaculate.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah would often glance at that plot of ground, 
and then He would smile and say:  "&amp;Muhammad-Hadi has 
turned the square in front of this prison into the bridalbower 
of a palace.  He has brought pleasure to all the neighbors 
and earned their thanks."  
     When his sweeping, sprinkling and tidying was done, 
he would set to work illuminating and binding the various 
books and Tablets.  So his days went by, his heart happy in 
the presence of the Beloved of mankind.  He was an excellent 
soul, righteous, true, worthy of the bounty of being 
united with his Lord, and free of the world's contagion.  
     One day he came to me and complained of a chronic 
ailment.  "I have suffered from chills and fever for two 
years," he said, "The doctors have prescribed a purgative, 
and quinine.  The fever stops a few days; then it returns.  
They give me more quinine, but still the fever returns.  I 
am weary of this life, and can no longer do my work.  Save 
me!"  
     "What food would you most enjoy?"  I asked him.  
"What would you eat with great appetite?"  
     "I don't know," he said.  
     Jokingly, I named off the different dishes.  When I came 
to barley soup with whey (&amp;ash-i-kashk), he said, "Very 
good!  But on condition there is braised garlic in it."  
     I directed them to prepare this for him, and I left.  The 
next day he presented himself and told me:  "I ate a whole 
bowlful of the soup.  Then I laid my head on my pillow 
and slept peacefully till morning."  
 
+P69 
     In short, from then on he was perfectly well for about 
two years.  
     One day a believer came to me and said:  "&amp;Muhammad-Hadi 
is burning up with fever."  I hurried to his bedside 
and found him with a fever of 42 Centigrade.  He was 
barely conscious.  "What has he done?"  I asked.  "When he 
became feverish," was the reply, "he said that he knew 
from experience what he should do.  Then he ate his fill of 
barley soup with whey and braised garlic; and this was the 
result."  
     I was astounded at the workings of fate.  I told them:  
"Because, two years ago, he had been thoroughly purged 
and his system was clear; because he had a hearty appetite 
for it, and his ailment was fever and chills, I prescribed 
the barley soup.  But this time, with the different foods he 
has had, with no appetite, and especially with a high fever, 
there was no reason to diagnose the previous chronic condition.  
How could he have eaten the soup!"  They answered, 
"It was fate."  Things had gone too far; &amp;Muhammad-Hadi 
was past saving.  
     He was a man short of stature, lofty of station and mind.  
His heart was pure, his soul luminous.  During all those 
days when he served the Holy Threshold, he was loved by 
the friends and favored by God.  From time to time, a smile 
on His lips, the Blessed Beauty would speak to him, expressing 
kindness and grace.  
     &amp;Muhammad-Hadi was loyal always, and he accounted 
all things other than God's good pleasure as fiction and 
fable, nothing more.  Blessed is he for this gift bestowed 
upon him, glad tidings to him for the place to which he 
shall be led; may it do him good, this wine-cup tempered 
at the camphor fountain, and may all his strivings meet 
with thanks and be acceptable to God.+F1  
 
+F1 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 11:101; 11:100; 76:5; 76:22; 17:20.  
 
+P70 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli 
 
     &amp;Jinab-i-Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli+F1 
was a loyal brother 
of the Blessed Beauty.  This 
great man was known even from his childhood for nobility 
of soul.  He was newly born when his distinguished father 
passed away, and thus it came about that from the beginning 
to the end of his days, he spent his life in the sheltering 
arms of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He was detached from every selfish 
thought, averse to every mention except to whatever 
concerned the Holy Cause.  He was reared in Persia under 
the care of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and in &amp;Iraq as well, especially favored 
by Him.  In the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, it was he 
who would pass around the tea; and he waited upon his 
Brother at all times, by day and night.  He was always silent.  
He always held fast to the Covenant of "Am I not 
your Lord?"  He was encompassed by loving-kindness and 
bounty; day and night he had access to the presence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah; he was invariably patient and forbearing, until 
in the end he reached the very heights of Divine favor 
and acceptance.  
     He kept always to his own way of being.  He traveled in 
the company of &amp;Baha'u'llah; from &amp;Iraq to Constantinople 
 
+F1 Cf. God Passes By, p. 108.  
 
+P71 
he was with the convoy and at the halting-places it was his 
task to pitch the tents.  He served with the greatest diligence, 
and did not know the meaning of lethargy or fatigue.  
In Constantinople as well, and later in the Land of 
Mystery, Adrianople, he continued on, in one and the 
same invariable condition.  
     With his peerless Lord, he then was exiled to the &amp;Akka 
fortress, condemned by order of the &amp;Sultan to be imprisoned 
forever.+F2  But he accepted in the same spirit all that 
came his way--comfort and torment, hardship and respite, 
sickness and health; eloquently, he would return thanks to 
the Blessed Beauty for His bounties, uttering praise with a 
free heart and a face that shone like the sun.  Each morning 
and evening he waited upon &amp;Baha'u'llah, delighting in 
and sustained by His presence; and mostly, he kept silent.  
     When the Beloved of all mankind ascended to the Kingdom 
of Splendors, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli remained firm 
in the Covenant, shunning the craft, the malice and hypocrisy 
which then appeared, devoting himself entirely to 
God, supplicating and praying.  To those who would listen 
he gave wise advice; and he called to mind the days of the 
Blessed Beauty and grieved over the fact that he himself 
lived on.  After the departure of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he did not 
draw an easeful breath; he kept company with no one, but 
stayed by himself most of the time, alone in his small refuge, 
burning with the fires of separation.  Day by day he 
grew feebler, more helpless, until at the last he soared away 
to the world of God.  Upon him be peace; upon him be 
praise and mercy, in the gardens of Heaven.  His luminous 
grave is in &amp;Naqib, by Tiberias.  
 
+F2 Cf. God Passes By, pp. 186; 193; 196.  
 
+P72 
&amp;Ustad &amp;Baqir and &amp;Ustad &amp;Ahmad 
 
     And again among those who 
left their homeland were 
two carpenters, &amp;Ustad &amp;Baqir and &amp;Ustad &amp;Ahmad.  These 
two were brothers, of pure lineage, and natives of &amp;Kashan.  
From the time when both became believers each held the 
other in his embrace.  They harkened to the voice of God, 
and to His cry of "Am I not your Lord?"  they replied, 
"Yea, verily!"  
     For a time they stayed on in their own country, occupied 
with the remembrance of God, characterized by faith and 
knowledge, respected by friend and stranger alike, known 
to all for righteousness and trustworthiness, for austerity of 
life and the fear of God.  When the oppressor stretched 
forth his hands against them, and tormented them beyond 
endurance, they emigrated to &amp;Iraq, to the sheltering care 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  They were two most blessed souls.  For 
some time they remained in &amp;Iraq, praying in all lowliness, 
and supplicating God.  
     Then &amp;Ustad &amp;Ahmad departed for Adrianople, while 
&amp;Ustad &amp;Baqir remained in &amp;Iraq and was taken as a prisoner 
to Mosul.  &amp;Ustad &amp;Ahmad went on with the party of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
to the Most Great Prison, and &amp;Ustad &amp;Baqir emigrated 
from Mosul to &amp;Akka.  Both of the brothers were 
under the protection of God and free from every earthly 
bond.  In the prison, they worked at their craft, keeping to 
 
+P73 
themselves, away from friend and stranger alike.  Tranquil, 
dignified, confident, strong in faith, sheltered by the 
All-Merciful, they happily spent their days.  &amp;Ustad &amp;Baqir 
was the first to die, and some time afterward his brother 
followed him.  
     These two were firm believers, loyal, patient, at all 
times thankful, at all times supplicating God in lowliness, 
with their faces turned in His direction.  During that long 
stay in the prison they were never neglectful of duty, never 
at fault.  They were constantly joyful, for they had drunk 
deep of the holy cup; and when they soared upward, out of 
the world, the friends mourned over them and asked that 
by the grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah, they should be favored and 
forgiven.  These two were embosomed in bounty, and Divinely 
sustained, and the Blessed Beauty was well pleased 
with them both; with this provision for their journey, they 
set out for the world to come.  Upon them both be the glory 
of God the All-Glorious; to each be a seat of truth+F1 in the 
Kingdom of Splendors.  
 

&amp;Muhammad &amp;Hana-Sab 
 
     This man of dignity and 
rank, &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad, 
was yet another among those who abandoned their homes, 
and was one of the earliest believers.  From the dawn tide, 
he was widely known as a lover of the Most Great Light.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 54:55.  
 
+P74 
He was then in &amp;Isfahan, and he shut his eyes to this world 
and the next as well,+F1 and opened them to the beauty of 
Him Who is the embodiment of all that is lovable.+F2  
     &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad could no longer find rest, for he had 
come alive through the musk-laden breathings of God; his 
heart was alight, he could inhale the holy fragrance, he 
had an eye to see, an ear to hear.  He guided a number of 
souls, remaining true and loyal to the great Cause.  He endured 
terrible persecution and torment, but did not falter.  
Then he found favor in the eyes of the King of Martyrs 
and became a trusted attendant of the Beloved of Martyrs,+F3 
serving them for some years.  He was confirmed in 
his work, so that on many occasions the King of Martyrs 
expressed satisfaction with him, saying, "This man is one 
of those souls who are at rest; he is indeed well-pleased 
with his Lord, and well-pleasing unto Him.+F4  His faith is 
unalloyed, he loves God, he has a good character, and 
leads a good life.  He is also an agreeable companion, and 
an eloquent one."  
     After the King of Martyrs was put to death, &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad 
stayed on for a time in &amp;Isfahan, consumed with 
mourning for him.  Finally he emigrated to the Most Great 
Prison, where he was received by &amp;Baha'u'llah, and won 
the high honor of sweeping the ground about the Threshold.  
He was patient, forbearing, a true friend and companion.  
Then the Supreme Affliction came upon us, and 
 
+F1 This reference to two worlds, du &amp;jihan, may indicate the saying:  
+F1 &amp;Isfahan is half the world--&amp;Isfahan &amp;nisf-i-jihan.  
+F2 For this definition of the Manifestation of God, see God Passes By, 
+F2 p. 119.  
+F3 These "twin shining lights" were two brothers, famous merchants 
+F3 of &amp;Isfahan.  Because he owed them a large sum of money, the leading 
+F3 priest--&amp;Imam &amp;Jum'ih--of the city brought about their martyrdom.  See 
+F3 &amp;Baha'u'llah's Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, and God Passes By, pp. 
+F3 200-201 and 219.  
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 89:27-30.  
 
+P75 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad was in such anguish that he was unable 
to rest for a moment.  At every dawn he would rise and 
would sweep the ground about the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
his tears pouring down like rain, chanting prayers as he 
worked.  
     What a holy being he was, how great a man!  He could 
not bear the separation very long, but died, and hastened 
onward to the world of lights, to the assemblage where the 
beauty of God is unveiled.  May God shed upon his grave 
rays from the realm of forgiveness, and lull his spirit in the 
heart of Paradise.  May God exalt his station in the gardens 
above.  His bright tomb is in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Faraju'llah &amp;Tafrishi 
 
     Yet another of those who 
came out of their homeland 
to live in the neighborhood of &amp;Baha'u'llah was &amp;Faraju'llah 
of &amp;Tafrish.  This blessed individual was from earliest 
youth the servant of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and with his esteemed 
father, &amp;Aqa &amp;Lutfu'llah, he emigrated from Persia 
to Adrianople.  &amp;Aqa &amp;Lutfu'llah was a staunch believer, lovingly 
devoted to the Blessed Beauty.  Patient, long-suffering, 
completely indifferent to this world and its vanities, 
he lived content in the neighborhood of &amp;Baha'u'llah; and 
then humbly at the Threshold, with a contrite heart, he 
abandoned this fleeting life and soared away to the boundless 
 
+P76 
realms beyond.  His sweet-scented dust is in Adrianople.  
     As for &amp;Haji &amp;Faraju'llah, he lived on in that city, until 
the day when merciless oppressors banished &amp;Baha'u'llah to 
&amp;Akka, and in His company the &amp;Haji came here to the 
Most Great Prison.  Later on, when hardship was changed 
into ease, he engaged in trade, becoming a partner to &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
of &amp;Isfahan.  For some time he prospered and 
was happy.  Then he was given leave to go, and journeyed 
to India, where he spent a long period before he winged 
his way into the gardens of forgiveness, and entered the 
precincts of ineffable mercy.  
     This servant of the Blessed Beauty was one with the believers 
in their afflictions and calamities; he had his share 
of the anguish.  The favors of &amp;Baha'u'llah compassed him 
about, and he rejoiced in that boundless grace.  He was 
among the companions, a close associate of the friends, and 
he had a docile heart.  Although his body was thin and 
sickly, he was thankful, accepted it, was patient, and endured 
the trials of God's path.  Unto him be greetings and 
praise; may he receive Heavenly gifts and blessings; upon 
him be the glory of God the All-Glorious.  His pure sepulcher 
is in Bombay, India.  
 
+P77 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Ibrahim-i-Isfahani and His Brothers 
 
     And among those who emigrated 
and came to settle 
in the Holy Land was &amp;Aqa &amp;Ibrahim, one of four honored 
brothers:  &amp;Muhammad-Sadiq; &amp;Muhammad-Ibrahim; &amp;Aqa 
&amp;Habibu'llah; and &amp;Muhammad-'Ali.  These four lived in 
&amp;Baghdad with their paternal uncle, &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Rida, 
known as &amp;Arid.  They all lived in the same house, 
and remained together day and night.  Bird-like, they 
shared the one nest; and they were always fresh and full of 
grace, like flowers in a bed.  
     When the Ancient Beauty arrived in &amp;Iraq their house 
was in the neighborhood of His, and thus they had the joy 
of watching Him as He came and went.  Little by little the 
manner of that Lord of hearts, what He did and what He 
did not do, and the sight of His lovesome face, had its effect; 
they began to thirst after the Faith and to seek His 
grace and favor.  They presented themselves at the door 
of His house, as if they were flowers blooming there; and 
they were soon enamored of the light that shone out from 
His brow, captives of the beauty of that dear Companion.  
They needed no teacher, then; by themselves, they saw 
through the veils that had blinded them before, and won 
the supreme desire of their hearts.  
     As commanded by the Blessed Beauty, &amp;Mirza &amp;Javad of 
 
+P78 
&amp;Turshiz went to their house one night.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Javad had 
hardly opened his mouth when they accepted the Faith.  
They did not hesitate for an instant, for they had amazing 
receptivity.  This is what is meant by the &amp;Qur'anic verse:  
"...whose oil would well nigh shine out, even though 
fire touched it not!  It is light upon light."+F1  That is, this oil 
is so fully prepared, so ready to be lit, that it almost 
catches fire of itself, though no flame be at hand; which 
means that the capacity for faith, and the deserving it, can 
be so great, that without the communication of a single 
word the light shines forth.  This is how it was with those 
pure-hearted men; truly they were loyal, staunch, and devoted 
to God.  
     The eldest brother, &amp;Muhammad-Sadiq, accompanied 
&amp;Baha'u'llah from &amp;Iraq to Constantinople, and from there 
to Adrianople, where he lived happily for some time, close 
to his Lord.  He was humble, long-suffering, thankful; 
there was always a smile on his lips; he was light of heart, 
and his soul was in love with &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Later he was 
given leave to return to &amp;Iraq, for his family was there, and 
he remained in that city for a while, dreaming and remembering.  
     Then a great calamity occurred in &amp;Iraq, and all four 
brothers with their noble uncle were taken prisoner.  Victimized, 
captive, they were brought to Mosul.  The uncle, 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Rida, was an old man, illumined of 
mind, spiritual of heart, a man detached from all worldly 
things.  He had been extremely rich in &amp;Iraq, enjoying comforts 
and pleasures, but now in &amp;Hadba--Mosul--he became 
the chief victim among the prisoners, and suffered 
dire need.  He was destitute, but remained dignified, patient, 
content, and thankful.  Keeping to himself in an out-of-the-way 
place, he praised God day and night until he 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 24:35.  
 
+P79 
died.  He gave up his heart to his heart's Love, burst from 
the shackles of this inconstant world and ascended to the 
Kingdom that endures forever.  May God immerse him in 
the waters of forgiveness, make him to enter the garden of 
His compassion and good pleasure, and keep him in Paradise 
till the end of time.  
     As for &amp;Muhammad-Sadiq, he too, in Mosul, was subjected 
to hardships on God's path.  He too was a soul at 
rest, well-pleased with his Lord and well-pleasing unto 
Him.  In the end he too replied to the voice of the King of 
Glory:  "Lord, here am I!" and came to fulfill the verses:  
"O thou soul who art well-assured, return unto thy Lord, well-pleased, 
and well-pleasing unto Him.  Enter thou among 
My servants; enter Thou My Paradise."+F2  
     And &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, once he was freed from captivity, 
hastened from Mosul to the Holy Land, to the precincts of 
inexhaustible grace.  Here he still lives.  Although he suffers 
hardship, his heart is at peace.  As for his brother &amp;Ibrahim, 
referred to above, he also came on from Mosul to &amp;Akka, 
but to a region close by.  There with patience, calm, contentment, 
but difficulty, he engaged in trade, meanwhile 
mourning the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah by day and night.  
Lowly and contrite, with his face turned toward the mysterious 
realms of God, he wore his life away.  At the end, 
consumed by the years, hardly able to move about, he came 
to Haifa, where he found a corner of the travelers' hospice 
to live in, and spent his time humbly calling upon God, entreating 
Him, offering praise.  Little by little, eaten away 
with age, his person began its dissolution, and at the end he 
stripped off the garment of flesh and with his unclothed 
spirit took flight to the realm of the All-Merciful.  He was 
transported out of this dark life into the shining air, and 
was plunged in a sea of lights.  May God brighten his grave 
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 89:27-30.  
 
+P80 
with spreading rays, and lull his spirit with the fannings of 
Divine compassion.  Upon him be the mercy of God, and 
His good pleasure.  
     As for &amp;Aqa &amp;Habibu'llah, he too was made a captive in 
&amp;Iraq and was banished away to Mosul.  For a long time, he 
lived in that city, subjected to hardships, but remaining 
content, and his faith increasing day by day.  When famine 
came to Mosul life was harder than ever on the outsiders, 
but in the remembrance of God their hearts were at rest,+F3 
and their souls ate of food from Heaven.  Thus they endured 
it all with astonishing patience, and the people 
wondered at those strangers in their midst who were 
neither distressed nor terrified as the others were, and who 
continued to offer praise day and night.  "What amazing 
trust," the people said, "they have in God!"  
     &amp;Habib was a man with a great store of patience and a 
joyous heart.  He accustomed himself to exile and he lived 
in a state of yearning love.  After the departure from &amp;Baghdad, 
the prisoners of Mosul were constantly made mention 
of by &amp;Baha'u'llah; with regard to them, He expressed His 
infinite favor.  A few years afterward, &amp;Habib hastened away 
to the encompassing mercy of God, and found a nest and 
refuge on the boughs of the celestial Tree.  There, in the 
Paradise of all delights, with wondrous songs he poured 
out his praise of the bountiful Lord.  
 
+F3 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 13:28:  "Truly in the remembrance of God are the 
+F3 hearts set at rest."  
 
+P81 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Ibrahim 
 
     &amp;Muhammad-Ibrahim, 
who bore the title of 
&amp;Mansur--Victorious--was a coppersmith.  This man of 
God, yet another among the emigrants and settlers, was a 
native of &amp;Kashan.  In the early flowering of his youth he 
recognized the newborn Light and drank deep of the holy 
cup that is "tempered at the camphor fountain."+F1  He was a 
man of pleasing disposition, full of zest and the joy of life.  
As soon as the light of faith was lit in his heart, he left 
&amp;Kashan, journeyed to &amp;Baghdad, and was honored with 
coming into the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad had a fine poetic gift, and he would 
create verses like stringed pearls.  In &amp;Zawra--that is, &amp;Baghdad, 
the Abode of Peace--he was on amicable terms with 
friend and stranger alike, ever striving to show forth loving-kindness 
to all.  He brought his brothers from Persia to 
&amp;Baghdad, and opened a shop for arts and crafts, applying 
himself to the welfare of others.  He, too, was taken prisoner 
and exiled from &amp;Baghdad to Mosul, after which he 
journeyed to Haifa, where day and night, lowly and humble, 
he chanted prayers and supplications and centered his 
thoughts on God.  
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 76:5.  
 
+P82 
     He remained a long time in Haifa, successfully serving 
the believers there, and most humbly and unobtrusively 
seeing to the travelers' needs.  He married in that city, and 
fathered fine children.  To him every day was a new life 
and a new joy, and whatever money he made he spent on 
strangers and friends.  After the slaying of the King of 
Martyrs, he wrote an elegy to memorialize that believer who 
had fallen on the field of anguish, and recited his ode in 
the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah; the lines were touching in the 
extreme, so that all who were there shed tears, and voices 
were raised in grief.  
     &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad continued to live out his life, high of 
aim, unvarying as to his inner condition, with fervor and 
love.  Then he welcomed death, laughing like a rose suddenly 
full-blown, and crying, "Here am I!"  Thus he quitted 
Haifa, exchanging it for the world above.  From this narrow 
slip of land he hastened upward to the Well-Beloved, 
soared out of this dust heap to pitch his tent in a fair and 
shining place.  Blessings be unto him, and a goodly home.+F2  
May God sheathe him in mercies; may he rest under the 
tabernacles of forgiveness and be brought into the gardens 
of Heaven.  
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 13:28.  
 
+P83 
&amp;Zaynu'l-'Abidin &amp;Yazdi 
 
     One of the emigrants who 
died along the way to the 
Holy Land was &amp;Zaynu'l-'Abidin of Yazd.  When, in &amp;Manshad, 
this devoted man first heard the cry of God, he was 
awakened to restless life.  A holy passion stirred him, his 
soul was made new.  The light of guidance flamed from 
the lamp of his heart; the love of God sparked a revolution 
in the country of his inner self.  Carried away by love for the 
Loved One's beauty, he left the home that was dear to him 
and set out for the Desired Land.  
     As he traveled along with his two sons, gladdened by 
hopes of the meeting that would be his, he paused on every 
hilltop, in every plain, village and hamlet to visit with the 
friends.  But the great distance stretching out before him 
changed to a sea of troubles, and although his spirit 
yearned, his body weakened, and at the end he sickened 
and turned helpless; all this when he was without a home.  
     Sick as he was, he did not renounce the journey, nor fail 
in his resolve; he had amazing strength of will, and was 
determined to keep on; but the illness worsened with every 
passing day, until at last he winged his way to the mercy 
of God, and yielded up his soul in a longing unfulfilled.  
     Although to outward eyes he never drained the cup of 
meeting, never gazed upon the beauty of &amp;Baha'u'llah, still 
 
+P84 
he achieved the very spirit of spiritual communion; he is 
accounted as one of those who attained the Presence, and 
for him the reward of those who reached that Presence is 
fixed and ordained.  He was a stainless soul, faithful, devoted 
and true.  He never drew a breath except in righteousness, 
and his single desire was to worship his Lord.  He 
walked the ways of love; he was known to all for steadfast 
loyalty and pure intent.  May God fill up reunion's cup for 
him in a fair country, make him to enter the everlasting 
Kingdom, and console his eyes with beholding the lights 
of that mysterious Realm.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Mulla &amp;Mihdiy-i-Yazdi 
 
     Yet another who left his 
homeland was &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Mihdi of Yazd.  Although to all appearances this excellent 
man was not of the learned class, he was an expert in the 
field of Muslim sacred traditions and an eloquent interpreter 
of orally transmitted texts.  Persevering in his devotions, 
known for holy practices and nightly communings 
and vigils, his heart was illumined, and he was spiritual of 
mind and soul.  He spent most of his time repeating communes, 
performing the obligatory prayers, confessing his 
failings and supplicating the Lord.  He was one of those 
who penetrate mysteries, and was a confidant of the righteous.  
As a teacher of the Faith he was never at a loss for 
 
+P85 
words, forgetting, as he taught, all restraint, pouring forth 
one upon another sacred traditions and texts.  
     When news of him spread around the town and he was 
everywhere charged, by prince and pauper alike, with 
bearing this new name, he freely declared his adherence 
and on this account was publicly disgraced.  Then the evil 
&amp;ulamas of Yazd rose up, issuing a decree that he must die.  
Since the mujtahid, &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir of &amp;Ardikan, refused to 
confirm the sentence of those dark divines, &amp;Mulla &amp;Mihdi 
lived on, but was forced to leave his native home.  With his 
two sons, one the great martyr-to-be, &amp;Jinab-i-Varqa, and the 
other &amp;Jinab-i-Husayn, he set out for the country of his Well-Beloved.  
In every town and village along the way, he ably 
spread the Faith, adducing clear arguments and proofs, 
quoting from and interpreting the sacred traditions and evident 
signs.+F1  He did not rest for a moment; everywhere he 
shed abroad the attar of the love of God, and diffused the 
sweet breathings of holiness.  And he inspired the friends, 
making them eager to teach others in their turn, and to 
excel in knowledge.  
     He was an eminent soul, with his heart fixed on the 
beauty of God.  From the day he was first created and came 
into this world, he single-mindedly devoted all his efforts 
to acquiring grace for the day he should be born into the 
next.+F2  His heart was illumined, his mind spiritual, his soul 
aspiring, his destination Heaven.  He was imprisoned along 
his way; and as he crossed the deserts and climbed and descended 
the mountain slopes he endured terrible, uncounted 
hardships.  But the light of faith shone from his brow and 
in his breast the longing was aflame, and thus he joyously, 
gladly passed over the frontiers until at last he came to 
Beirut.  In that city, ill, restive, his patience gone, he spent 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 3:91.  
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 29:19; 53:48; 56:62.  
 
+P86 
some days.  His yearning grew, and his agitation was such 
that weak and sick as he was, he could wait no more.  
     He set out on foot for the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Because 
he lacked proper shoes for the journey, his feet were 
bruised and torn; his sickness worsened; he could hardly 
move, but still he went on; somehow he reached the village 
of &amp;Mazra'ih and here, close by the Mansion, he died.  His 
heart found his Well-Beloved One, when he could bear 
the separation no more.  Let lovers be warned by his story; 
let them know how he gambled away his life in his yearning 
after the Light of the World.  May God give him to 
drink of a brimming cup in the everlasting gardens; in the 
Supreme Assemblage, may God shed upon his face rays 
of light.  Upon him be the glory of the Lord.  His sanctified 
tomb is in &amp;Mazra'ih, beside &amp;Akka.  
 

His Eminence &amp;Kalim (&amp;Mirza &amp;Musa) 
 
     &amp;Jinab-i-Mirza &amp;Musa was the 
true brother of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and from earliest childhood 
he was reared in the sheltering embrace of the Most Great 
Name.  He drank in the love of God with his mother's 
milk; when yet a suckling, he showed an extraordinary attachment 
to the Blessed Beauty.  At all times he was the 
object of Divine grace, favor and loving-kindness.  After 
their distinguished father died, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa was brought 
 
+P87 
up by &amp;Baha'u'llah, growing to maturity in the haven of 
His care.  Day by day, the youth's servitude and devotion 
increased.  In all things, he lived according to the commandments, 
and he was entirely severed from any thoughts of 
this world.  
     Like a bright lamp, he shone out in that Household.  He 
wished neither rank nor office, and had no worldly aims 
at all.  His one supreme desire was to serve &amp;Baha'u'llah, and 
for this reason he was never separated from his Brother's 
presence.  No matter what torments the others inflicted, his 
loyalty equaled the cruelty of the rest, for he had drunk 
the wine of unadulterated love.  
     Then the voice was heard, crying out of &amp;Shiraz, and from 
a single utterance of &amp;Baha'u'llah's his heart was filled with 
light, and from a single gust that blew over the gardens of 
faith, he caught the fragrance.  At once, he began to serve 
the friends.  He had an extraordinary attachment to me, 
and was at all times concerned for my well-being.  In &amp;Tihran 
he occupied himself day and night with propagating the 
Faith and gradually became well known to everyone; habitually 
he spent his time in the company of blessed souls.  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah then left &amp;Tihran, journeying to &amp;Iraq, and 
of His brothers the two who were in His company were 
&amp;Aqay-i-Kalim+F1 and &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli.  They turned 
their faces away from Persia and the Persians, and closed 
their eyes to comfort and peace; in the Beloved's path they 
chose with all their hearts to bear whatever calamity 
should be their lot.  
     Thus they arrived in &amp;Iraq.  During the days when &amp;Baha'u'llah 
had vanished from sight, that is, when He was on the 
journey to &amp;Kurdistan, &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim lived on the edge of an 
abyss; his life was constantly in danger, and each day that 
passed was worse than the one before; still, he bore it all, 
 
+F1 &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa.  
 
+P88 
and knew no fear.  When at last the Blessed Beauty returned 
out of &amp;Kurdistan, &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim resumed his post by 
the Holy Threshold, rendering every service within his 
power.  For this he became known far and wide.  At the 
time when &amp;Baha'u'llah left &amp;Baghdad for Constantinople, 
&amp;Aqay-i-Kalim was with Him and continued to serve along 
the way, as he did on the further journey from Constantinople 
to Adrianople.  
     It was during the sojourn in this latter city that he detected 
from &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya the odor of rebellion.  Day and 
night he tried to make him mend his ways, but all to 
no avail.  On the contrary, it was astonishing how, like a 
deadly poison, the temptings and satanic suggestions of 
Siyyid &amp;Muhammad worked on &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, so that &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim 
finally abandoned hope.  Even then he never ceased 
trying, thinking that somehow, perhaps, he could still the 
tempest and rescue &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya from the gulf.  His heart 
was worn away with despair and grief.  He tried everything 
he knew.  At last he had to admit the truth of these words of 
&amp;Sana'i:  
 
          If to the fool my lore you'd bring, 
          Or think my secrets can be told 
          To him who is not wise-- 
          Then to the deaf go harp and sing, 
          Or stand before the blind and hold 
          A mirror to his eyes.  
 
     When all hope was gone, he ended the relationship, 
saying:  "O my brother, if others are in doubt as to this 
affair, you and I both know the truth.  Have you forgotten 
the loving-kindness of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and how He trained us 
both?  What care He took with your lessons and your penmanship; 
how constantly He saw to your spelling and your 
composition, and encouraged you to practice the different 
calligraphic styles; He even guided your copy with His own 
 
+P89 
blessed fingers.  Who does not know how He showered 
favors on you, how He brought you up in the haven of 
His embrace.  Is this your thanks for all His tenderness-- 
that you plot with Siyyid &amp;Muhammad and desert the shelter 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah?  Is this your loyalty?  Is this the right return 
for all His love?"  The words had no effect whatever; on the 
contrary, with each passing day, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya disclosed a 
greater measure of his concealed intent.  Then at the end, 
the final rupture took place.  
     From Adrianople, &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim went on with the convoy 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, to the fortress of &amp;Akka.  His name was 
specifically listed in the &amp;Sultan's decree, and he was condemned 
to perpetual banishment.+F2  He devoted all his time 
in the Most Great Prison to serving &amp;Baha'u'llah, and had 
the honor of being continually in his Brother's presence, 
also keeping company with the believers; until at last he 
left this world of dust and hastened to the holy world 
above, dying with lowliness and contrition, as he supplicated 
his Lord.  
     It happened that during the &amp;Baghdad period, the well-known 
&amp;Ilkhani, son of &amp;Musa &amp;Khan-i-Qazvini, received 
through Siyyid &amp;Javad-i-Tabataba'i an audience with &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Siyyid &amp;Javad on that occasion made a plea in the 
&amp;Ilkhani's behalf, saying:  "This &amp;Ilkhani, &amp;Ali-Quli &amp;Khan, 
although a sinner and a lifelong creature of his passions, 
has now repented.  He stands before You with regret as to 
his former ways, and from this day forward he will not so 
much as draw a breath that might be contrary to Your good 
pleasure.  I beg of You, accept his repentance; make him the 
object of Your grace and favor."  
     &amp;Baha'u'llah replied:  "Because he has chosen you as intercessor, 
I will hide away his sins, and I will take steps to 
bring him comfort and peace of mind."  
 
+F2 Cf. God Passes By, p. 186.  
 
+P90 
     The &amp;Ilkhani had been a man of unlimited wealth, but he 
had wasted it all on the desires of the flesh.  He was now 
destitute, to such a point that he did not even dare to step 
outside his house, because of the creditors waiting there to 
fall upon him.  &amp;Baha'u'llah directed him to go to &amp;Umar 
&amp;Pasha, the Governor of Damascus, and obtain from him a 
letter of recommendation to Constantinople.  The &amp;Ilkhani 
complied, and he received every assistance from the Governor 
of &amp;Baghdad.  After utter despair, he began to hope 
again, and left for Constantinople.  When he arrived at 
&amp;Diyarbakr+F3 he penned a letter on behalf of two Armenian 
merchants.  "These two are about to leave for &amp;Baghdad," 
his letter said.  "They have shown me every courtesy, and 
have also asked me for an introduction.  I had no refuge 
or shelter except Your bounty; thus I beg of You to show 
them favor."  The superscription, that is, the address he 
had written on the envelope was:  "To His Eminence 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, Leader of the &amp;Babis."  The merchants presented 
this letter to &amp;Baha'u'llah at the head of the bridge, 
and when He inquired about it their reply was:  "In &amp;Diyarbakr, 
the &amp;Ilkhani gave us particulars as to this Cause."  
Then they accompanied Him to His house.  
     When the Blessed Beauty entered the family apartments, 
&amp;Aqay-i-Kalim was there to meet Him.  &amp;Baha'u'llah 
cried out, "&amp;Kalim, &amp;Kalim!  The fame of the Cause of God 
has reached as far as &amp;Diyarbakr!"  And He was smiling, 
jubilant.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa was indeed a true brother to the Blessed 
Beauty; this is why he remained steadfast, under all conditions, 
to the very end.  Unto him be praise and salutations, 
and the breath of life, and glory; upon him be mercy and 
grace.  
 
+F3 Some four hundred miles northwest of &amp;Baghdad.  
 
+P91 
&amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad &amp;Khan 
 
     Another of those who left 
their homes and came to 
settle in the neighborhood of &amp;Baha'u'llah was &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Khan.  This distinguished man, a native of &amp;Sistan, 
was a &amp;Baluch.  When he was very young, he caught fire and 
became a mystic--an &amp;arif, or adept.  As a wandering dervish, 
completely selfless, he went out from his home and, 
following the dervish rule, traveled about in search of his 
&amp;murshid, his perfect leader.  For he yearned, as the Qalandar 
dervishes would say, to discover that "priest of the 
Magi," or spiritual guide.  
     Far and wide, he carried on his search.  He would speak 
to everyone he met.  But what he longed for was the sweet 
scent of the love of God, and this he was unable to detect 
in anyone, whether Gnostic or philosopher, or member of 
the &amp;Shaykhi sect.  All he could see in the dervishes was 
their tufted beards, and their palms-up religion of beggary.  
They were "dervish"--poor in all save God--in name only; 
all they cared about, it seemed to him, was whatever came 
to hand.  Nor did he find illumination among the Illuminati; 
he heard nothing from them but idle argument.  He 
observed that their grandiloquence was not eloquence and 
that their subtleties were but windy figures of speech.  
Truth was not there; the core of inner meaning was absent.  
 
+P92 
For true philosophy is that which produces rewards 
of excellence, and among these learned men there was no 
such fruit to be found; at the peak of their accomplishment, 
they became the slaves of vice, led an unconcerned 
life and were given over to personal characteristics that 
were deserving of blame.  To him, of all that constitutes 
the high, distinguishing quality of humankind, they were 
devoid.  
     As for the &amp;Shaykhi group, their essence was gone, only 
the dregs remained; the kernel of them had vanished, 
leaving the shell behind; most of their dialectics was lumber 
and superfluities by now.  
     Thus at the very moment when he heard the call from 
the Kingdom of God, he shouted, "Yea, verily!" and he 
was off like the desert wind.  He traveled over vast distances, 
arrived at the Most Great Prison and attained the 
presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  When his eyes fell upon that 
bright Countenance he was instantly enslaved.  He returned 
to Persia so that he could meet with those people 
who professed to be following the Path, those friends of 
other days who were seeking out the Truth, and deal with 
them as his loyalty and duty required.  
     Both going and returning, the &amp;Haji betook himself to 
each one of his friends, foregathered with them, and let 
each one hear the new song from Heaven.  He reached 
his homeland and set his family's affairs in order, providing 
for all, seeing to the security, happiness and comfort 
of each one.  After that he bade them all goodby.  To his 
relatives, his wife, children, kin, he said:  "Do not look for 
me again; do not wait for my return."  
     He took up a staff and wandered away; over the mountains 
he went, across the plains, seeking and finding the 
mystics, his friends.  On his first journey, he went to the 
late &amp;Mirza &amp;Yusuf &amp;Khan (&amp;Mustawfiyu'l-Mamalik), in &amp;Tihran.  
When he had said his say, &amp;Yusuf &amp;Khan expressed a 
 
+P93 
wish, and declared that should it be fulfilled, he would believe; 
the wish was to be given a son.  Should such a bounty 
become his, &amp;Yusuf &amp;Khan would be won over.  The &amp;Haji 
reported this to &amp;Baha'u'llah, and received a firm promise 
in reply.  Accordingly, when the &amp;Haji met with &amp;Yusuf 
&amp;Khan on his second journey, he found him with a child 
in his arms.  "&amp;Mirza," the &amp;Haji cried, "praise be to God!  
Your test has demonstrated the Truth.  You snared your 
bird of joy."  "Yes," answered &amp;Yusuf &amp;Khan, "the proof is 
clear.  I am convinced.  This year, when you go to &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
say that I implore His grace and favor for this child, 
so that it may be kept safe in the sheltering care of God."  
     &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad then went to the blissful future martyr, 
the King of Martyrs, and asked him to intercede, so 
that he, the &amp;Haji, might be allowed to keep watch at the 
doorway of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The King of Martyrs sent in this 
request by letter, after which &amp;Haji &amp;Khan duly arrived at 
the Most Great Prison and made his home in the neighborhood 
of his loving Friend.  He enjoyed this honor for 
a long time, and later, in the &amp;Mazra'ih garden as well, he 
was very frequently in &amp;Baha'u'llah's presence.  After the 
Beloved had ascended, &amp;Haji &amp;Khan remained faithful to 
the Covenant and Testament, shunning the hypocrites.  At 
last, when this servant was absent on the journeys to Europe 
and America, the &amp;Haji made his way to the travelers' 
hospice at the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds; and here, beside the Shrine 
of the &amp;Bab, he took his flight to the world above.  
     May God refresh his spirit with the musk-scented air 
of the &amp;Abha Paradise, and the sweet savors of holiness 
that blow from the highest Heaven.  Unto him be greetings 
and praise.  His bright tomb is in Haifa.  
 
+P94 
&amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Ibrahim &amp;Amir 
 
     &amp;Muhammad-Ibrahim 
&amp;Amir came from &amp;Nayriz.  
He was a blessed person; he was like a cup filled with 
the red wine of faith.  At the time when he was first made 
captive by the tender Loved One, he was in the flower of his 
youth.  Then he fell a prey to the oppressors, and following 
the upheaval in &amp;Nayriz and all the suffering, his persecutors 
laid hold of him.  Three &amp;farrashes pinned his arms and 
tied his hands behind him; but the &amp;Amir by main strength 
burst his bonds, snatched a dagger from a &amp;farrash's belt, 
saved himself and ran away to &amp;Iraq.  There he engaged in 
writing down the sacred verses and later won the honor of 
serving at the Holy Threshold.  Constant and steadfast, he 
remained on duty day and night.  During the journey from 
&amp;Baghdad to Constantinople, from there to Adrianople, and 
from there to the Most Great Prison, he was always at 
hand to serve.  He married the handmaid of God, &amp;Habibih, 
who also served at the Threshold, and his daughter &amp;Badi'ih 
became the helpmeet of the late &amp;Husayn-Aqa &amp;Qahvih-chi.  
     Thus the &amp;Amir was steadfast in service throughout his 
life; but after the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah his health 
steadily declined, and at last he left this world of dust behind 
him and hastened away to the unsullied world above.  
May God illumine the place where he rests with rays from 
the all-highest Realm.  Unto him be salutations and praise.  
His bright shrine is in &amp;Akka.  
 
+P95 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Mihdiy-i-Kashani 
 
     This honored man, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Mihdi, was from &amp;Kashan.  
In early youth, under his father's tutelage, he had studied 
sciences and arts, and had become skilled in composing 
both prose and verse, as well as in producing calligraphy 
in the style known as &amp;shikastih.+F1  He was singled out from 
his fellows, head and shoulders above the rest.  When still 
a child, he learned of the Lord's Advent, caught fire with 
love, and became one of those who "gave their all to purchase 
Joseph."  He was chief of the yearning seekers, lord 
of lovers; eloquently, he began to teach the Faith, and to 
prove the validity of the Manifestation.  
     He made converts; and because he yearned after God, 
he became a laughingstock in &amp;Kashan, disparaged by 
friend and stranger alike, exposed to the taunts of his faithless 
companions.  One of them said:  "He has lost his mind."  
And another:  "He is a public disgrace.  Fortune has turned 
against him.  He is done for."  The bullies mocked him, and 
spared him nothing.  When life became untenable, and 
open war broke out, he left his homeland and journeyed 
to &amp;Iraq, the focal center of the new Light, where he 
gained the presence of all mankind's Beloved.  
     He spent some time here, in the friends' company, 
 
+F1 &amp;Shikastih--broken--a cursive or half-shorthand script, is thought 
+F1 to have been invented at the close of the seventeenth century, in 
+F1 &amp;Hirat.  
 
+P96 
composing verses that sang the praises of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Later 
he was given leave to return home, and went back to live 
for a while in &amp;Kashan.  But again, he was plagued by yearning 
love, and could bear the separation no more.  He returned, 
therefore, to &amp;Baghdad, bringing with him his respected 
sister, the third consort+F2.  
     Here he remained, under the bountiful protection of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, until the convoy left &amp;Iraq for Constantinople, 
at which time &amp;Mirza &amp;Mihdi was directed to remain behind 
and guard the Holy House.  Restless, consumed with longing, 
he stayed on.  When the friends were banished from 
&amp;Baghdad to Mosul, he was among the prisoners, a victim 
along with the others.  With the greatest hardship, he got 
to Mosul, and here fresh calamities awaited him; he was 
ill almost all the time, he was an outcast, and destitute.  
Still he endured it for a considerable period, was patient, 
retained his dignity, and continually offered thanks.  Finally 
he could bear the absence of &amp;Baha'u'llah no longer.  
He sought permission, was granted leave to come, and set 
out for the Most Great Prison.  
     Because the way was long and hard, and he suffered 
cruelly on the journey, when he finally reached the &amp;Akka 
prison he was almost helpless, and worn to the bone.  It 
was during the time when the Blessed Beauty was imprisoned 
within the citadel, at the center of the barracks.  
Despite the terrible hardships, &amp;Mirza &amp;Mihdi spent some 
days here, in great joy.  To him, the calamities were favors, 
the tribulations were Divine Providence, the chastisement 
 
+F2 Gawhar &amp;Khanum's marriage to &amp;Baha'u'llah took place in &amp;Baghdad.  
+F2 She remained with her brother in that city when &amp;Baha'u'llah left 
+F2 &amp;Iraq and later proceeded to &amp;Akka at His instruction.  While 
+F2 traveling from &amp;Baghdad to Mosul, she was made captive together 
+F2 with other believers, among them &amp;Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin.  &amp;Baha'u'llah 
+F2 makes reference to this captivity in His Tablet to the &amp;Shah.
+F2     Gawhar &amp;Khanum broke the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah following His 
+F2 passing.  She passed away during the ministry of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
 
+P97 
abounding grace; for he was enduring all this on the pathway 
of God, and seeking to win His good pleasure.  His 
illness worsened; from day to day he failed; then at the 
last, under sheltering grace, he took his flight to the inexhaustible 
mercy of the Lord.  
     This noble personage had been honored among men, 
but for God's love he lost both name and fame.  He bore 
manifold misfortunes with never a complaint.  He was content 
with God's decrees, and walked the ways of resignation.  
The glance of &amp;Baha'u'llah's favor was upon him; he 
was close to the Divine Threshold.  Thus, from the beginning 
of his life till the end, he remained in one and the 
same inner state:  immersed in an ocean of submission and 
consent.  "O my Lord, take me, take me!" he would cry, 
until at last he soared away to the world that no man sees.  
     May God cause him to inhale the sweet scent of holiness 
in the highest Paradise, and refresh him with the 
crystalline wine cup, tempered at the camphor fountain.+F3  
Unto him be salutations and praise.  His fragrant tomb is 
in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Mishkin-Qalam 
 
     Among the exiles, neighbors, 
and prisoners there 
was also a second &amp;Mir &amp;Imad,+F1 the eminent calligrapher, 
 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 76:9.  
+F1 A famed calligrapher who lived and wrote at the court of &amp;Shah-'Abbas, 
+F1 the &amp;Safavi (1557-1628).  
 
+P98 
&amp;Mishkin-Qalam.+F2  He wielded a musk-black pen, and his 
brows shone with faith.  He was among the most noted of 
mystics, and had a witty and subtle mind.  The fame of this 
spiritual wayfarer reached out to every land.  He was the 
leading calligrapher of Persia and well known to all the 
great; he enjoyed a special position among the court ministers 
of &amp;Tihran, and with them he was solidly established.+F3  
He was famed throughout Asia Minor; his pen was the 
wonder of all calligraphers, for he was adept at every calligraphic 
style.  He was besides, for human virtues, a bright star.  
     This highly accomplished man first heard of the Cause 
of God in &amp;Isfahan, and the result was that he set out to 
find &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He crossed the great distances, measured 
out the miles, climbing mountains, passing over deserts 
and over the sea, until at last he came to Adrianople.  Here 
he reached the heights of faith and assurance; here he 
drank the wine of certitude.  He responded to the summons 
of God, he attained the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he ascended 
to that apogee where he was received and accepted.  
By now he was reeling to and fro like a drunkard 
in his love for God, and because of his violent desire and 
yearning, his mind seemed to wander.  He would be 
raised up, and then cast down again; he was as one distracted.  
He spent some time under the sheltering grace 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and every day new blessings were showered 
upon him.  Meanwhile he produced his splendid calligraphs; 
he would write out the Most Great Name, &amp;Ya 
&amp;Baha'u'l-Abha, O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious, with 
marvelous skill, in many different forms, and would send 
them everywhere.+F4  
 
+F2 &amp;Mishk is musk.  &amp;Mishkin-Qalam means either musk-scented pen, or 
+F2 jet black pen.  
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 61:4.  
+F4 In some of this artist's productions, the writing was so arranged as 
+F4 to take the forms of birds.  When E. G. Browne was in Persia, he was 
 
+P99 
     He was then directed to go on a journey to Constantinople, 
and set out with &amp;Jinab-i-Sayyah.  When he 
reached that Great City, the leading Persians and Turks 
received him with every honor at first, and they were 
captivated by his jet black, calligraphic art.  He, however, 
began boldly and eloquently to teach the Faith.  The Persian 
ambassador lurked in ambush; betaking himself to 
the &amp;Sultan's &amp;vazirs he slandered &amp;Mishkin-Qalam.  "This 
man is an agitator," the ambassador told them, "sent here 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah to stir up trouble and make mischief in this 
Great City.  He has already won over a large company, and 
he intends to subdue still more.  These &amp;Baha'is turned 
Persia upside down; now they have started in on the capital 
of Turkey.  The Persian Government put 20,000 of 
them to the sword, hoping by this tactic to quench the fires 
of sedition.  You should awaken to the danger; soon this 
perverse thing will blaze up here as well.  It will consume 
the harvest of your life; it will burn up the whole world.  
Then you can do nothing, for it will be too late."  
     Actually that mild and submissive man, in that throne 
city of Asia Minor, was occupied solely with his calligraphy 
and his worship of God.  He was striving to bring about 
not sedition but fellowship and peace.  He was seeking to 
reconcile the followers of different faiths, not to drive them 
 
+F4 told that "these would be eagerly sought after by Persians of all classes, 
+F4 were it not that they all bore, as the signature of the penman, the 
+F4 following verse:

+F4          &amp;Bandiy-i-bab-i-Baha, &amp;Mishkin-Qalam."  
+F4 Cf. A Year Amongst the Persians, p. 227.  The verse might be translated:  
+F4          Lord of calligraphy, my banner goes before; 
+F4          But to &amp;Baha'u'llah, a bondsman at the door, 
+F4          Naught else I am, 
+F4          &amp;Mishkin-Qalam.  
+F4 Note the wordplay on door, which makes possible the inclusion of the 
+F4 &amp;Bab's name as well as &amp;Baha'u'llah's.  
 
+P100 
still further apart.  He was of service to strangers and was 
helping to educate the native people.  He was a refuge to 
the hapless and a horn of plenty to the poor.  He invited all 
comers to the oneness of humankind; he shunned hostility 
and malice.  
     The Persian ambassador, however, wielded enormous 
power, and he had maintained close ties with the ministers 
for a very long time.  He prevailed on a number of persons 
to insinuate themselves into various gatherings and there 
to make every kind of false charge against the believers.  
Urged on by the oppressors, spies began to surround &amp;Mishkin-Qalam.  
Then, as instructed by the ambassador, they 
carried reports to the Prime Minister, stating that the individual 
in question was stirring up mischief day and night, 
that he was a trouble maker, a rebel and a criminal.  The 
result was, they jailed him and they sent him away to 
Gallipoli, where he joined our own company of victims.  
They despatched him to Cyprus and ourselves to the &amp;Akka 
prison.  On the island of Cyprus, &amp;Jinab-i-Mishkin was held 
prisoner in the citadel at Famagusta, and in this city he 
remained, a captive, from the year 85 till 94.  
     When Cyprus passed out of Turkish hands, &amp;Mishkin-Qalam 
was freed and betook himself to his Well-Beloved 
in the city of &amp;Akka, and here he lived encompassed by the 
grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah, producing his marvelous calligraphs 
and sending them about.  He was at all times joyous of 
spirit, ashine with the love of God, like a candle burning 
its life away, and he was a consolation to all the believers.  
     After the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Mishkin-Qalam remained 
loyal, solidly established in the Covenant.  He 
stood before the violators like a brandished sword.  He 
would never go half way with them; he feared no one but 
God; not for a moment did he falter, nor ever fail in 
service.  
     Following the ascension he made a journey to India, 
 
+P101 
where he associated with the lovers of truth.  He spent some 
time there, making fresh efforts every day.  When I learned 
that he was getting helpless, I sent for him at once and he 
came back to this Most Great Prison, to the joy of the believers, 
who felt blessed to have him here again.  He was 
at all times my close companion.  He had amazing verve, 
intense love.  He was a compendium of perfections:  believing, 
confident, serene, detached from the world, a peerless 
companion, a wit--and his character like a garden in full 
bloom.  For the love of God, he left all good things behind; 
he closed his eyes to success, he wanted neither comfort 
nor rest, he sought no wealth, he wished only to be free 
from the defilement of the world.  He had no ties to this 
life, but spent his days and nights supplicating and communing 
with God.  He was always smiling, effervescing; 
he was spirit personified, love embodied.  For sincerity and 
loyalty he had no match, nor for patience and inner calm.  
He was selflessness itself, living on the breaths of the 
spirit.  
     If he had not been in love with the Blessed Beauty, if 
he had not set his heart on the Realm of Glory, every 
worldly pleasure could have been his.  Wherever he went, 
his many calligraphic styles were a substantial capital, and 
his great accomplishment brought him attention and respect 
from rich and poor alike.  But he was hopelessly 
enamored of man's one true Love, and thus he was free of 
all those other bonds, and could float and soar in the spirit's 
endless sky.  
     Finally, when I was absent, he left this darksome, narrow 
world and hastened away to the land of lights.  There, 
in the haven of God's boundless mercy, he found infinite 
rewards.  Unto him be praise and salutations, and the Supreme 
Companion's tender grace.  
 
+P102 
&amp;Ustad &amp;Ali-Akbar-i-Najjar 
 
     &amp;Ustad &amp;Ali-Akbar, the 
Cabinet-Maker,+F1 was 
numbered among the just, a prince of the righteous.  He 
was one of Persia's earliest believers and a leading member 
of that company.  From the beginning of the Cause a trusted 
confidant, he loosed his tongue to proclaim the Faith.  He 
informed himself as to its proofs, and went deep into its 
Scriptures.  He was also a gifted poet, writing odes in eulogy 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Exceptionally skilled in his craft, &amp;Ustad produced highly 
ingenious work, fashioning carpentry that, for intricacy 
and precision, resembled mosaic inlay.  He was expert in 
mathematics as well, solving and explaining difficult problems.  
     From Yazd, this revered man traveled to &amp;Iraq, where he 
achieved the honor of entering the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and received abundant grace.  The Blessed Beauty showered 
favors upon &amp;Ustad &amp;Ali, who entered His presence almost 
every day.  He was one of those who were exiled from 
&amp;Baghdad to Mosul, and he endured severe hardships there.  
He remained a long time in Mosul, in extremely straitened 
 
+F1 &amp;Ustad is a master, one who is skilled in an art or profession.  
 
+P103 
circumstances but resigned to the will of God, always in 
prayer and supplication, and with a thankful tongue.  
     Finally he came from Mosul to the Holy Shrine and 
here by the tomb of &amp;Baha'u'llah he would meditate and 
pray.  In the dark of the night, restless and uneasy, he 
would lament and cry out; when he was supplicating God 
his heart burned within him; his eyes would shed their 
tears, and he would lift up his voice and chant.  He was 
completely cut off from this dust heap, this mortal world.  
He shunned it, he asked but one thing--to soar away; and 
he hoped for the promised recompense to come.  He could 
not bear for the Light of the World to have disappeared, 
and what he sought was the paradise of reunion with Him, 
and what his eyes hungered to behold was the glory of the 
&amp;Abha Realm.  At last his prayer was answered and he rose 
upward into the world of God, to the gathering-place of 
the splendors of the Lord of Lords.  
     Upon him be God's benediction and praise, and may 
God bring him into the abode of peace, as He has written 
in His book:  "For them is an abode of peace with their 
Lord."+F2  "And to those who serve Him, is God full of kindness."+F3

&amp;Shaykh &amp;Ali-Akbar-i-Mazgani 
 
     This chief of free souls, of 
wanderers for the love of 
God, was only an infant when, in &amp;Mazgan, he was suckled 
at the breast of grace.  He was a child of the eminent 
scholar, &amp;Shaykh-i-Mazgani; his noble father was one of the 
leading citizens of &amp;Qamsar, near &amp;Kashan, and for piety, 
holiness, and the fear of God he had no peer.  This father 
embodied all the qualities that are worthy of praise; moreover 
his ways were pleasing, his disposition good, he was 
an excellent companion, and for all these things he was 
well known.  When he threw off restraint and openly declared 
himself a believer, the faithless, whether friend or 
stranger, turned their backs on him and began to plot his 
death.  But he continued to further the Cause, to alert the 
people's hearts, and to welcome the newcomers as generously 
as ever.  Thus in &amp;Kashan the fame of his strong faith 
reached as high as the Milky Way.  Then the pitiless aggressors 
rose up, plundered his possessions and killed him.  
     &amp;Ali-Akbar, the son of him who had laid down his life in 
the pathway of God, could live in that place no longer.  
Had he remained, he too, like his father, would have been 
put to the sword.  He passed some time in &amp;Iraq, and received 
the honor of being in the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Then he went back to Persia, but again he longed to look 
 
+P105 
upon &amp;Baha'u'llah, and with his wife he set out over the 
deserts and mountains, sometimes riding, sometimes on 
foot, measuring off the miles, passing from one shore to the 
other, reaching the Holy Place at last and in the shade 
of the Divine Lote-Tree finding safety and peace.  
     When the beauty of the Desired One had vanished 
from this world, &amp;Ali-Akbar remained loyal to the Covenant 
and prospered under the grace of God.  By disposition 
and because of the intense love in his heart, he 
yearned to write poetry, to fashion odes and &amp;ghazals, but 
he lacked both meter and rhyme:  
 
          I planned a poem, but my Beloved told me, 
          "Plan only this, that thine eyes should behold Me."  
 
With rapturous longing, his heart desired the realms of 
his compassionate Lord; consumed by burning love, he left 
this world at last, and pitched his tent in the world above.  
May God send down upon his grave, from the Kingdom 
of His forgiveness, a heavy rain+F1 of blessings, bestow a 
great victory upon him, and grant him mercies, pressed 
down and running over, in the retreats of Heaven.

&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad, the Servant at the 
Travelers' Hospice 
 
     This youth of God was 
from &amp;Isfahan, and from an 
early age was known to its leading divines for his excellent 
mind.  He was of gentle birth, his family was known and 
respected, and he was an accomplished scholar.  He had 
profited from philosophy and history alike, from sciences 
and arts, but he thirsted after the secret of reality, and 
longed for knowledge of God.  His feverish thirst was not 
allayed by the arts and sciences, however limpid those 
waters.  He kept on seeking, seeking, carrying on debates 
in gatherings of learned men until at last he discovered 
the meaning of his longing dream, and the enigma, the 
inviolable secret, lay open before him.  Suddenly he caught 
the scent of fresh flowers from the gardens of the splendor 
of God, and his heart was ashine with a ray from the Sun 
of Truth.  Whereas before, he was like a fish taken from 
the water, now he had come to the wellspring of eternal 
life; before, he was a questing moth; now he had found 
the candle flame.  A true seeker after truth, he was instantly 
revived by the supreme Glad Tidings; his heart's eye was 
brightened by the new dawn of guidance.  So blinding was 
the fire of Divine love that he turned his face away from 
his life, its peace, its blessings, and set out for the Most 
Great Prison.  
 
+P107 
     In &amp;Isfahan he had enjoyed every comfort, and the world 
was good to him.  Now his yearning for &amp;Baha'u'llah freed 
him from all other bonds.  He passed over the long miles, 
suffered intense hardships, exchanged a palace for a prison, 
and in the &amp;Akka fortress assisted the believers and attended 
upon and served &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He who had been 
waited upon, now waited on others; he who had been the 
master was now the servant, he who had once been a 
leader was now a captive.  He had no rest, no leisure, day 
or night.  To the travelers he was a trusted refuge; to the 
settlers, a companion without peer.  He served beyond his 
strength, for he was filled with love of the friends.  The 
travelers were devoted to him, and the settlers grateful.  
And because he was continuously busy, he kept silent at 
all times.  
     Then the Supreme Affliction came upon us and the absence 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah was not to be endured.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad 
could not stay quiet, day or night.  He wasted 
away, like a candle burning down; from the fiery anguish, 
his liver and heart were inflamed, and his body could bear 
no more.  He wept and supplicated day and night, yearning 
to soar away to that undiscovered country.  "Lord, free 
me, free me from this absence," he would cry, "let me 
drink of reunion's cup, find me a lodging in the shelter of 
Thy mercy, Lord of Lords!"  
     At last he quit this dust heap, the earth, and took his 
flight to the world that has no end.  May it do him good, 
that cup brimming with the grace of God, may he eat 
with healthy relish of that food which gives life to heart 
and soul.  May God lead him to that happy journey's end 
and grant him an abundant share in the gifts which shall

&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-i-Vakil 
 
     One of the captives who 
were sent on from &amp;Baghdad 
to Mosul was &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-i-Vakil.  This righteous 
soul was among those who became believers in &amp;Baghdad.  
It was there he drank from the cup of resignation to 
the will of God and sought his rest in the shade of the 
celestial Tree.  He was a man high-minded and worthy of 
trust.  He was also an extremely capable and energetic administrator 
of important affairs, famous in &amp;Iraq for his 
wise counsel.  After he became a believer, he was distinguished 
by the title of &amp;Vakil--deputy.  It happened in this 
way:  
     There was a notable in &amp;Baghdad by the name of &amp;Haji 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Hadi, the jeweler.  He had a distinguished son, &amp;Aqa 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, who had received from &amp;Baha'u'llah the title 
"Letter of Eternity."  This son had become a staunch believer.  
As for his father, the &amp;Haji, he was a princely individual 
known for his lavish open-handedness not only in 
Persia and &amp;Iraq but as far away as India.  To begin with 
he had been a Persian &amp;vazir; but when he saw how the 
late &amp;Fath-'Ali &amp;Shah eyed worldly riches, particularly the 
worldly riches of Persian &amp;vazirs, and how he snatched 
whatever they had accumulated, and how, not content 
 
+P109 
with confiscating their costly vanities and lumber, he punished 
and tortured them right and left, calling it a legal 
penalty--the &amp;Haji dreaded that he too might be catapulted 
into the abyss.  He abandoned his position as &amp;vazir, and his 
mansion, and fled to &amp;Baghdad.  &amp;Fath-'Ali &amp;Shah demanded 
that the Governor of &amp;Baghdad, &amp;Davud &amp;Pasha, send him 
back, but the &amp;Pasha was a man of courage and the &amp;Haji 
was widely known for his able mind.  Accordingly, the 
&amp;Pasha respected and helped him and the &amp;Haji set up in 
business as a jeweler.  He lived with pomp and splendor, 
like a great prince.  He was one of the most remarkable 
men of his time, for within his palace he carried on a life 
of gratification and opulence, but he left his pomp, style 
and retinue behind, occupied himself with his business 
affairs and realized great profits.  
     The door of his house was always open.  Turks and Persians, 
neighbors, strangers from far places, all were his 
honored guests.  Most of Persia's great, when they came 
on pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines, would stop at his 
house, where they would find a banquet laid out, and 
every luxury ready to hand.  The &amp;Haji was, indeed, more 
distinguished than Persia's Grand &amp;Vazir; he outshone all 
the &amp;vazirs for magnificence, and as the days passed by he 
dispensed ever more largesse to all who came and went.  
He was the pride of the Persians throughout &amp;Iraq, the 
glory of his fellow nationals.  Even on the Turkish &amp;vazirs 
and ministers and the grandees of &amp;Baghdad he bestowed 
gifts and favors; and for intelligence and perceptivity he 
had no equal.  
     Because of the &amp;Haji's advancing years, toward the end 
of his days his business affairs declined.  Still, he made no 
change in his way of life.  Exactly as before, he continued 
to live with elegance.  The prominent would borrow heavily 
from him, and never pay him back.  One of them, the 
mother of &amp;Aqa &amp;Khan &amp;Mahallati, borrowed 100,000 &amp;tumans+F1 
 
+F1 The &amp;Baghdad period in &amp;Baha'i history was from April 8, 1853 to 
+F1 May 3, 1863.  According to various estimates the &amp;tuman of the day 
+F1 ranged from $1.08 to $1.60.  
 
+P110 
from him and did not repay one penny, for she 
died soon after.  The &amp;Il-Khan, &amp;Ali-Quli &amp;Khan, was another 
debtor; another was Sayfu'd-Dawlih, a son of &amp;Fath-'Ali 
&amp;Shah; another, &amp;Valiyyih, a daughter of &amp;Fath-'Ali &amp;Shah; 
these are only a few examples out of many, from among 
the Turkish &amp;amirs and the great of Persia and &amp;Iraq.  All 
these debts remained unpaid and irrecoverable.  Nevertheless, 
that eminent and princely man continued to live 
exactly as before.  
     Toward the close of his life he conceived a remarkable 
love for &amp;Baha'u'llah, and most humbly, would enter His 
presence.  I remember him saying one day, to the Blessed 
Beauty, that in the year 1250 and something over, &amp;Mirza 
Mawkab the famed astrologer visited the Shrines.  "One 
day he said to me," the &amp;Haji continued, "`&amp;Mirza, I see a 
strange, a unique conjunction in the stars.  It has never 
occurred before.  It proves that a momentous event is about 
to take place, and I am certain that this event can be nothing 
less than the Advent of the promised &amp;Qa'im.'"  
     Such was the situation of that illustrious prince when 
he passed away, leaving as heirs a son and two daughters.  
Thinking him to be as wealthy as ever, the people believed 
that his heirs would inherit millions, for everyone knew 
his way of life.  The Persian diplomatic representative, the 
latter-day mujtahids, and the faithless judge all sharpened 
their teeth.  They started a quarrel among the heirs, so that 
in the resulting turmoil they themselves would make substantial 
gains.  With this in view they did whatever they 
could to ruin the heirs, the idea being to strip the inheritors 
bare, while the Persian diplomat, the mujtahids, 
and the judge would accumulate the spoils.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa was a staunch believer; his sisters, however, 
 
+P111 
were from a different mother, and they knew nothing 
of the Cause.  One day the two sisters, accompanied 
by the son-in-law of the late &amp;Mirza Siyyid &amp;Rida, came to 
the house of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The two sisters entered the family 
apartments while the son-in-law settled down in the 
public reception rooms.  The two girls then said to &amp;Baha'u'llah:  
"The Persian envoy, the judge, and the faithless 
mujtahids have destroyed us.  Toward the close of his life, 
the late &amp;Haji trusted no one but Yourself.  We ourselves 
have been remiss and we should have sought Your protection 
before; in any case we come now to implore Your 
pardon and help.  Our hope is that You will not send us 
away despairing, and that through Your favor and support 
we shall be saved.  Deign, then, to look into this affair, 
and to overlook our past mistakes."  
     Replying, the Blessed Beauty declared with finality that 
intervention in affairs of this kind was abhorrent to Him.  
They kept on pleading with Him, however.  They remained 
a whole week in the family apartments, clamoring 
every morning and evening for favor and grace.  "We will 
not lift our heads from off this Threshold," they said.  "We 
will seek sanctuary here in this house; we will remain 
here, by the door of Him Who guards the angels, until 
He shall deign to look into our concerns and to save us 
from our oppressors."  
     Each day, &amp;Baha'u'llah would counsel them, saying, 
"Matters of this kind are in the hands of the mujtahids 
and the government authorities.  We do not interfere in 
such affairs."  But they kept on with their importunities, 
insisting, imploring, begging for help.  It happened that the 
house of &amp;Baha'u'llah was bare of worldly goods, and these 
ladies, accustomed to the best of everything, could hardly 
be satisfied with bread and water.  Food had to be procured 
for them on credit.  Briefly, from every direction, 
there were problems.  
 
+P112 
     Finally one day &amp;Baha'u'llah summoned me to His presence.  
"These esteemed ladies," He said, "with all their exactions, 
have put Us to considerable inconvenience.  There 
is no help for it--you will have to see to this case.  But you 
must solve this entire, complicated matter in a single day."  
     The next morning, accompanied by &amp;Aqay-i-Kalim, I 
went to the house of the late &amp;Haji.  We called in appraisers 
and they collected all the jewels in an upper apartment; 
the ledgers and account books having to do with the properties 
were placed in a second room; the costly furnishings 
and art objects of the house in a third.  A number of jewelers 
then went to work and set a value on the gems.  Other 
experts appraised the house, the shops, the gardens, the 
baths.  As soon as they began their work I came out and 
posted someone in each room so that the appraisers could 
duly complete their tasks.  By this time it was nearly noon.  
We then had luncheon, after which the appraisers were 
directed to divide everything into two equal parts, so that 
lots could be cast; one part would be that of the daughters, 
and one that of the son, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa.+F2  I then went to bed, 
for I was ill.  In the afternoon I rose, had tea, and repaired 
to the family apartments of the mansion.  Here I observed 
that the goods had been divided into three parts.  I said to 
them:  "My instructions were that everything should be 
divided into two parts.  How is it that there are three?"  The 
heirs and other relatives answered as one:  "A third must 
certainly be set aside.  That is why we have divided everything 
into three.  One share is for &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, one for the 
two daughters, and the third we place at Your disposal; 
this third is the portion of the deceased and You are to 
expend it in any way You see fit."  
     Greatly disturbed, we told them, "Such a thing is out 
of the question.  This you must not require, for it cannot 
 
+F2 This was in accord with the law of &amp;Islam.  Cf. &amp;Qur'an 4:12.  
 
+P113 
be complied with.  We gave our word to &amp;Baha'u'llah that 
not so much as a copper coin would be accepted."  But 
they, too, swore upon oath that it must be as they wished, 
that they would agree to nothing else.  This servant answered:  
"Let us leave this matter for the present.  Is there 
any further disagreement among you?"  "Yes," said &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Musa, "what has become of the money that was left?"  
Asked the amount, he answered:  "Three hundred thousand 
&amp;tumans."  The daughters said:  "There are two possibilities:  
either this money is here in the house, in some 
coffer, or buried hereabouts--or else it is in other hands.  
We will give over the house and all its contents to &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Musa.  We two will leave the house, with nothing but our 
veils.  If anything turns up we, as of now, freely accord it 
to him.  If the money is elsewhere, it has no doubt been 
deposited in someone's care; and that person, well aware 
of the breach of trust, will hardly come forward, deal 
honorably by us, and return it--rather, he will make off 
with it all.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa must establish a satisfactory proof 
of what he says; his claim alone is not evidence."  &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Musa replied:  "All the property was in their hands; I 
knew nothing of what was going on--I had no hint of it.  
They did whatever they pleased."  
     In short, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa had no clear proof of his claim.  
He could only ask, "Is such a thing possible, that the late 
&amp;Haji had no ready funds?"  Since the claim was unsupported, 
I felt that pursuing it further would lead to a scandal 
and produce nothing of value.  Accordingly I bade 
them:  "Cast the lots."  As for the third share, I had them 
put it in a separate apartment, close it off, and affix a seal 
to the door.  The key I brought to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  "The task 
is done," I said.  "It was accomplished only through Your 
confirmations.  Otherwise it could not have been completed 
in a year.  However, a difficulty has arisen."  I described in 
detail the claim of &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa and the absence of any 
 
+P114 
proof.  Then I said, "&amp;Mirza &amp;Musa is heavily in debt.  Even 
should he expend all he has, still he could not pay off his 
creditors.  It is best, therefore, if You Yourself will accept 
the heirs' request, since they persist in their offer, and bestow 
that share on &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa.  Then he could at least 
free himself from his debts and still have something left 
over."  
     On the following day the heirs appeared and implored 
the Blessed Beauty to have me accept the third share.  
"This is out of the question," He told them.  Then they 
begged and entreated Him to accept that share Himself 
and expend it for charitable purposes of His own choice.  
He answered:  "There is only one purpose for which I 
might expend that sum."  They said, "That is no concern 
of ours, even if You have it thrown into the sea.  We will 
not loose our hold from the hem of Your garment and we 
will not cease our importunities until You accede to our 
request."  Then He told them, "I have now accepted this 
third share; and I have given it to &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, your 
brother, but on the condition that, from this day forward, 
he will speak no more of any claim against yourselves."  
The heirs were profuse in their thanks.  And so this 
weighty and difficult case was settled in a single day.  It 
left no residue of complaints, no uproar, no further quarrels.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa did his best to urge some of the jewels on 
me, but I refused.  Finally he requested that I accept a 
single ring.  It was a precious ring, set with a costly pomegranate 
ruby, a flawless sphere, and unique.  All around 
the central stone, it was gemmed with diamonds.  This too 
I refused, although I had no &amp;aba to my back and nothing 
to wear but a cotton tunic that bespoke the antiquity of 
the world, nor did I own a copper coin.  As &amp;Hafiz would 
say:  "An empty purse, but in our sleeve a hoard."  
     Grateful for the bounty he had received, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa 
 
+P115 
offered &amp;Baha'u'llah everything he possessed:  orchards, 
lands, estates--but it was refused.  Then he appointed the 
&amp;ulamas of &amp;Iraq to intercede for him.  They hastened to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in a body and begged Him to accept the proffered 
gifts.  He categorically refused.  They respectfully told 
Him:  "Unless You accept, in a very short time &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Musa will scatter it all to the winds.  For his own good, he 
should not have access to this wealth."  
     Then in his own hand, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa penned deeds of 
gift, made out according to each of the five creeds, in Arabic 
and Persian; two copies he made, and chose the &amp;ulamas 
as his witnesses.  Through certain &amp;ulamas of &amp;Baghdad, 
among them the famed scholar &amp;Abdu's-Salam Effendi, and 
the erudite and widely known Siyyid &amp;Davud Effendi, he 
presented the deed of gift to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The Blessed 
Beauty told them:  "We are appointing &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa himself 
as Our deputy."  
     After &amp;Baha'u'llah's departure for Rumelia, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa, 
with a promissory note, purchased from the Government 
the tithes of &amp;Hindiyyih, a district near &amp;Karbila, and suffered 
a terrible loss, close to 100,000 &amp;tumans.  The Government 
confiscated his properties and sold them for next to 
nothing.  When told of the matter, &amp;Baha'u'llah said, "Do 
not speak of this, ever again.  Do not so much as utter a 
word about those estates."  Meanwhile the exile from Adrianople 
to &amp;Akka took place.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad went to 
the Government authorities and said to them:  "I am the 
deputy (&amp;vakil) of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  These properties do not belong 
to &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa.  How is it that you have taken them 
over?"  But he had no documents to support him, for the 
title deeds were in &amp;Akka, and on this account the Government 
rejected his claim.  However, in the process, he became 
known to all as &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad the Deputy.  
This is how he received the title.  
     When we were in Adrianople, &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa sent on the 
 
+P116 
ruby ring, through Siyyid &amp;Ali-Akbar, and the Blessed 
Beauty directed us to accept it.  After we reached &amp;Akka 
the believers fell ill, and lay suffering in their beds.  I sent 
the ring to India, to one of the friends, asking him to sell 
it with all possible speed and forward the proceeds to us 
in &amp;Akka to be expended on the sick.  That blessed individual 
never sent us a penny.  Two years later he wrote to 
say that he had sold the ring for twenty-five pounds and 
had spent that sum on the pilgrims.  This, when the ring 
was of such great value.  I made no complaint.  Rather, I 
praised God, thanking Him that out of all that wealth not 
a fleck of dust had settled on my robe.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad was taken prisoner and sent away 
from &amp;Baghdad to Mosul, where he fell a prey to fearful 
ills.  He had been rich; in God's path he was now poor.  He 
had enjoyed his ease and comfort; now, for the love of 
God, he suffered pain and toil.  He lived on for a time in 
Mosul, suppliant, resigned, and lowly.  And then, severed 
from all save God, irresistibly drawn by the gentle gales 
of the Lord, he rose out of this dark world to the land of 
light.  Unto him be salutations and praise.  May God shed 
down upon him the waters of forgiveness, and open before 
his grave the gates of Heaven.  
 
+P117 
&amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Riday-i-Shirazi 
 
     &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Rida 
came from &amp;Shiraz.  He 
was a man spiritually minded, lowly, contrite, the embodiment 
of serenity and faith.  When the call of God was 
lifted up, that needy soul hurried into the shelter of heavenly 
grace.  As soon as he heard the summons, "Am I not 
your Lord?" he cried out:  "Yea, verily!"+F1 and became as a 
lamp to the people's feet.  
     For a long time he served the &amp;Afnan, &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, 
and was his loyal and close companion, 
trusted in all things.  Later, following a journey to distant 
countries, he went to the Holy Land, and there in utter 
submission and lowliness bowed his head before the Sacred 
Threshold and was honored with entering the presence 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, where he drank in endless bounties 
from cupped hands.  For quite a time he remained there, 
attending upon &amp;Baha'u'llah almost every day, encompassed 
by holy favor and grace.  He was outstanding as to 
character, and lived after the commandments of God:  
tranquil and long-suffering, in his surrender to God's will 
he was selflessness itself.  He had no personal aims whatever, 
no feeling of attachment to this fleeting world.  His 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 7:171.  
 
+P118 
one desire was to please his Lord, his one hope, to walk 
the holy path.  
     He went on, then, to Beirut, serving the honored &amp;Afnan 
in that city.  He spent a long time in this wise, returning 
again and again to enter the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah and 
gaze upon that Most Great Beauty.  Later, in Sidon, he 
fell ill.  Unable to make the journey to &amp;Akka, in perfect 
acquiescence and contentment he ascended to the &amp;Abha 
Kingdom, and was plunged in the ocean of lights.  By the 
Supreme Pen, endless bounty was bestowed upon his 
memory.  He was indeed one of the loyal, the steadfast, a 
solid pillar of servitude to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Many and many a 
time, from the lips of the Blessed Beauty, we heard his 
praise.  
     Unto him be greetings and praise, and the glory of the 
All-Glorious.  Upon him be compassion and most great 
mercy from the Lord of the High Heavens.  His shining 
grave is in Sidon, near the place called the Station of 
John the Holy.  
 

&amp;Husayn Effendi &amp;Tabrizi 
 
     This youth was from &amp;Tabriz, 
and he was filled with 
the love of God like a cup flowing and brimming over 
with red wine.  In the flower of his youth he left Persia 
and traveled to Greece, making his living as a merchant 
there; till a day came when, guided by Divine bounty, he 
 
+P119 
went from Greece to Smyrna, and there he was given the 
glad tidings of a new Manifestation on earth.  He shouted 
aloud, was frenzied, was drunk with the music of the new 
message.  He escaped from his debits and credits, set out to 
meet the Lord of his heart, and entered the presence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  For some time, a trusted attendant and companion, 
he served the Blessed Beauty.  He was then directed 
to seek a lodging in the city of Haifa.  
     Here he faithfully waited upon the believers, and his 
home was a way station for &amp;Baha'i travelers.  He had an 
excellent disposition, a wonderful character, and high, 
spiritual aims.  He was friendly with friend and stranger 
alike; he was kind to people of every nation and wished 
them well.  
     When the Most Great Light ascended to the Concourse 
above, &amp;Husayn Effendi remained faithful to Him, steadfast 
and firm; and as before, he continued to be a close 
friend to the friends.  Thus he lived for a considerable period, 
and felt himself better off than the kings of the earth.  
He became the son-in-law of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Quli, 
brother of the Blessed Beauty, and remained for a time 
peaceful and serene.  He carefully avoided any occasion of 
being seduced into error, for he dreaded that the tempest 
of afflictions might mount in fury, surge ever higher, and 
sweep many a soul into the fathomless gulf.+F1  He would 
sigh and mourn, for this fear was with him at all times.  At 
last he could bear the world no longer, and with his own 
hands stripped off the garment of life.  
     Praise be unto him, and salutations, and the mercy of 
God, and Divine acceptance.  May God pardon him and 
make him to enter the highest Heaven, the Paradise that 
towers above all the rest.  His sweet-scented grave is in 
Haifa.

+P120 
&amp;Jamshid-i-Gurji 
 
     Yet another of the emigrants 
and settlers was the 
valiant &amp;Jamshid-i-Gurji, who came from Georgia, but grew 
up in the city of &amp;Kashan.  He was a fine youth, faithful, 
trustworthy, with a high sense of honor.  When he heard 
of a new Faith dawning, and awoke to the tidings that on 
Persia's horizons the Sun of Truth had risen, he was filled 
with holy ecstasy, and he longed and loved.  The new fire 
burned away those veils of uncertainty and doubt that had 
closed him round; the light of Truth shed down its rays, 
the lamp of guidance burned before him.  
     He remained in Persia for a time, then left for Rumelia, 
which was Ottoman territory, and in the Land of Mystery, 
Adrianople, won the honor of entering the presence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah; it was there that his meeting took place.  His 
joy and fervor were boundless.  Later, at &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
command he made a journey to Constantinople, with &amp;Aqa 
&amp;Muhammad-Baqir and &amp;Aqa &amp;Abdu'l-Ghaffar.  In that city, 
the tyrannous imprisoned him and put him in chains.  
     The Persian ambassador informed against &amp;Jamshid and 
&amp;Ustad &amp;Muhammad-'Ali-i-Dallak as enemy leaders and 
fighters.  &amp;Jamshid he described as a latter-day Rustam+F1 
 
+F1 Persia's Hercules.  
 
+P121 
while &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, according to the envoy, was a 
ravening lion.  These two respected men were first imprisoned 
and caged; then they were sent out of Turkish 
territory, under guard to the Persian frontier.  They were 
to be delivered over to the Persian Government and crucified, 
and the guards were threatened with terrible punishments 
should they once relax their vigilance and let the 
prisoners escape.  For this reason, at every stopping place 
the victims were kept in some almost inaccessible spot.  
Once they were thrown into a pit, a kind of well, and 
suffered agonies all through the night.  The next morning 
&amp;Jamshid cried out:  "O you who oppress us!  Are we Joseph 
the Prophet that you have thrown us in this well?  Remember 
how He rose out of the well as high as the full moon?  
We too walk the pathway of God, we too are down here 
for His sake, and we know that these depths are the 
heights of the Lord."  
     Once arrived at the Persian frontier, &amp;Jamshid and &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
were handed over to Kurdish chiefs to be 
sent on to &amp;Tihran.  The Kurdish chiefs could see that the 
prisoners were innocent men, kindly and well-disposed, 
who had fallen a prey to their enemies.  Instead of dispatching 
them to the capital, they set them free.  Joyfully, 
the two hastened away on foot, went back to &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and found a home close by Him in the Most Great Prison.  
     &amp;Jamshid spent some time in utter bliss, receiving the 
grace and favor of &amp;Baha'u'llah and ever and again being 
admitted to His presence.  He was tranquil and at peace.  
The believers were well-pleased with him, and he was 
well-pleased with God.  It was in this condition that he 
hearkened to the celestial bidding:  "O thou soul who art 
well-assured, return unto thy Lord, well-pleased with Him, and 
well-pleasing unto Him."+F2  And to God's cry:  "Return!" 
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 89:27.  
 
+P122 
he replied, "Yea, verily!"  He rose out of the Most Great 
Prison to the highest Heaven; he soared away to a pure 
and gleaming Kingdom, out of this world of dust.  May 
God succor him in the celestial company,+F3 bring him into 
the Paradise of Splendors, and safe in the Divine gardens, 
make him to live forevermore.  
     Salutations be unto him, and praise.  His grave, sweet 
as musk, is in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far-i-Tabrizi and His Brothers 
 
     There were three brothers, 
all from &amp;Tabriz:  &amp;Haji 
&amp;Hasan, &amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far, and &amp;Haji &amp;Taqi.  These three were like 
eagles soaring; they were three stars of the Faith, pulsing 
with the light of the love of God.  
     &amp;Haji &amp;Hasan was of the earlier day; he had believed 
from the new Luminary's first dawning.  He was full of 
ardor, keen of mind.  After his conversion he traveled 
everywhere, through the cities and villages of Persia, and 
his breath moved the hearts of longing souls.  Then he left 
for &amp;Iraq, and on the Beloved's first journey, attained His 
presence there.  Once he beheld that beauteous Light he 
was carried away to the Kingdom of Splendors; he was 
incandescent, he became a thrall of yearning love.  At this 
 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 4:71.  
 
+P123 
time he was directed to go back to Persia.  He was a peddler, 
a vendor of small wares, and would travel from city 
to city.  
     On &amp;Baha'u'llah's second journey to &amp;Iraq, &amp;Haji &amp;Hasan 
longed to behold Him again, and there in &amp;Baghdad was 
once more bedazzled by His presence.  Every so often he 
would journey to Persia and then return, his thoughts 
centered on teaching and furthering the Cause.  His business 
fell apart.  His merchandise was carried away by 
thieves, and thus, as he put it, his load was lifted from 
him--he was disencumbered.  He shunned every worldly 
tie.  He was held fast as by a magnet; he fell hopelessly, 
madly in love with the tender Companion, with Him 
Who is the Well-Beloved of both worlds.  He was known 
everywhere for the ecstasy he was in, and experienced 
strange states of being; sometimes, with utmost eloquence, 
he would teach the Faith, adducing as proofs many a 
sacred verse and holy tradition, and bringing sound and 
reasonable arguments to bear.  Then his hearers would 
comment on the power of his mind, on his wisdom and 
his self-possession.  But there were other times when love 
suddenly flamed within him, and then he could not remain 
still for an instant.  At those times he would skip, and 
dance, or again in a loud voice he would cry out a verse 
from the poets, or a song.  Toward the end of his days he 
became a close friend of &amp;Jinab-i-Munib; the two exchanged 
many a recondite confidence, and each carried many a 
melody in his breast.  
     On the friends' final journey he went to &amp;Adhirbayjan, 
and there, throwing caution to the winds, he roared out 
the Greatest Name:  "&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!"  The unbelievers 
there joined forces with his relatives, and they lured that 
innocent, that man in his ecstasy, away to a garden.  Here, 
they first put questions to him and listened to his answers.  
He spoke out; he expounded the secret verities of the 
 
+P124 
Faith, and set forth conclusive proofs that the Advent had 
indeed come to pass.  He recited verses from the &amp;Qur'an, 
and traditions handed down from the Prophet &amp;Muhammad 
and the Holy &amp;Imams.  Following that, in a frenzy of 
love and longing rapture, he began to sing.  It was a 
&amp;shahnaz melody he sang; the words were from the poets, 
to say that the Lord had come.  And they killed him; they 
shed his blood.  They wrenched and hacked his limbs apart 
and hid his body underneath the dust.  
     As for &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Ja'far, the gently born, he too, 
like his brother, was bewitched by the Blessed Beauty.  It 
was in &amp;Iraq that he entered the presence of the Light of 
the World, and he too caught fire with Divine love and 
was carried away by the gentle gales of God.  Like his 
brother, he was a vendor of small wares, always on a journey 
from one place to the next.  When &amp;Baha'u'llah left 
&amp;Baghdad for the capital of &amp;Islam, &amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far was in Persia, 
and when the Blessed Beauty and His retinue came to a 
halt in Adrianople, &amp;Ja'far and &amp;Haji &amp;Taqi, his brother, arrived 
there from &amp;Adhirbayjan.  They found a corner somewhere 
and settled down.  Our oppressors then stretched 
out arrogant hands to send &amp;Baha'u'llah forth to the Most 
Great Prison, and they forbade the believers to accompany 
the true Beloved, for it was their purpose to bring the 
Blessed Beauty to this prison with but a few of His people.  
When &amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far saw that they had excluded him from 
the band of exiles, he seized a razor and slashed his throat.+F1  
The crowds expressed their grief and horror and the authorities 
then permitted all the believers to leave in company 
with &amp;Baha'u'llah--this because of the blessing that 
came from &amp;Ja'far's act of love.  
     They stitched up his wound but no one thought he 
would recover.  They told him, "For the time being, you 
 
+F1 Cf. God Passes By, p. 180.  
 
+P125 
will have to stay where you are.  If your throat heals, you 
will be sent on, along with your brother.  Be sure of this."  
&amp;Baha'u'llah also directed that this be done.  Accordingly, 
we left &amp;Ja'far in the hospital and went on to the &amp;Akka 
prison.  Two months later, he and his brother &amp;Haji &amp;Taqi 
arrived at the fortress, and joined the other prisoners.  The 
safely delivered &amp;Haji grew more loving, more ardent with 
every passing day.  From dusk till dawn he would stay 
awake, chanting prayers, shedding his tears.  Then one 
night he fell from the roof of the caravanserai and ascended 
to the Kingdom of miracles and signs.  
     &amp;Haji &amp;Taqi, born under a fortunate star, was in every 
sense a true brother to &amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far.  He lived in the same 
spiritual condition, but he was calmer.  After &amp;Haji &amp;Ja'far's 
death, he would stay in one room, all alone.  He was silence 
itself.  He would sit there, all alone, properly and courteously, 
even during the night.  One midnight he climbed 
up to the roof to chant prayers.  The next morning they 
found him where he had fallen, on the ground by the 
wall.  He was unconscious, and they could not tell whether 
this was an accident or whether he had thrown himself 
down.  When he came to himself he said:  "I was weary of 
this life, and I tried to die.  Not for a moment do I wish to 
linger in this world.  Pray that I may go on."  
     This, then, is the life story of those three brothers.  All 
three were souls well-assured; all three were pleased, 
and pleasing unto God.+F2  They were 
flames; they were captives of the Faith; they were pure 
and holy.  And therefore, cut off from the world, turning 
their faces toward the Most High Kingdom, they ascended.  
May God wrap them in the garment of His grace 
in the realm of forgiveness, and immerse them in the waters 
of His mercy forever and ever.  Greetings be unto 
them, and praise.  
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 89:27-30.  
 
+P126 
&amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-Taqi, the &amp;Afnan 
 
     Among those souls that are 
righteous, that are luminous 
entities and Divine reflections, was &amp;Jinab-i-Muhammad-Taqi, 
the &amp;Afnan.+F1  His title was &amp;Vakilu'd-Dawlih.  
This eminent Bough was an offshoot of the Holy Tree; in 
him an excellent character was allied to a noble lineage.  
His kinship was a true kinship.  He was among those souls 
who, after one reading of the Book of &amp;Iqan, became believers, 
bewitched by the sweet savors of God, rejoicing 
at the recital of His verses.  His agitation was such that he 
cried out, "Lord, Lord, here am I!"  Joyously, he left Persia 
and hurried away to &amp;Iraq.  Because he was filled with longing 
love, he sped over the mountains and across the desert 
wastes, not pausing to rest until he came to &amp;Baghdad.  
     He entered the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and achieved 
acceptance in His sight.  What holy ecstasy he had, what 
fervor, what detachment from the world!  It was beyond 
description.  His blessed face was so comely, so luminous 
that the friends in &amp;Iraq gave him a name:  they called him 
"the &amp;Afnan of all delights."  He was truly a blessed soul, a 
man worthy to be revered.  He never failed in his duty, 
from the beginning of life till his last breath.  As his days 
 
+F1 The &amp;Afnan are the &amp;Bab's kindred.  
 
+P127 
began, he became enamored of the sweet savors of God, 
and as they closed, he rendered a supreme service to the 
Cause of God.  His life was righteous, his speech agreeable, 
his deeds worthy.  Never did he fail in servitude, in devotion, 
and he would set about a major undertaking with 
alacrity and joy.  His life, his behavior, what he did, what 
he left undone, his dealings with others--were all a way 
of teaching the Faith, and served as an example, an admonishment 
to the rest.  
     After he had achieved the honor, in &amp;Baghdad, of meeting 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, he returned to Persia, where he proceeded 
to teach the Faith with an eloquent tongue.  And this is 
how to teach:  with an eloquent tongue, a ready pen, a 
goodly character, pleasing words, and righteous ways and 
deeds.  Even enemies bore witness to his high-mindedness 
and his spiritual qualities, and they would way:  "There is 
none to compare with this man for his words and acts, his 
righteousness, trustworthiness, and strong faith; in all 
things he is unique; what a pity that he is a &amp;Baha'i!"  That 
is:  "What a pity that he is not as we are, perverse, uncaring, 
committing sins, engrossed in sensuality, the creatures 
of our passions!"  Gracious God!  They saw with their own 
eyes that the moment he learned of the Faith he was transformed, 
he was severed from the world, he began to emit 
rays from the Sun of Truth; and still, they failed to profit 
by the example he set.  
     During his days in Yazd he was, outwardly, engaged in 
commercial pursuits, but actually teaching the Faith.  His 
only aim was to exalt the Word of God, his only wish, to 
spread the Divine sweet savors, his only thought, to come 
nearer and ever nearer to the mansions of the Lord.  There 
was no remembrance on his lips but the verses of God.  He 
was an embodiment of the good pleasure of &amp;Baha'u'llah; a 
dawning-point of the grace of the Greatest Name.  Many 
and many a time, &amp;Baha'u'llah expressed to those about 
 
+P128 
Him, His extreme satisfaction with the &amp;Afnan; and consequently, 
everyone was certain that he would in future 
initiate some highly important task.  
     After the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the &amp;Afnan, loyal and 
staunch in the Covenant, rendered even more services 
than he had before; this in spite of many obstacles, and an 
overwhelming load of work, and an infinite variety of matters 
all claiming his attention.  He gave up his comfort, his 
business, his properties, estates, lands, hastened away to 
&amp;Ishqabad and set about building the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar; 
this was a service of very great magnitude, for he thus became 
the first individual to erect a &amp;Baha'i House of Worship, 
the first builder of a House to unify man.  With the 
believers in &amp;Ishqabad assisting him, he succeeded in carrying 
off the palm.  For a long period in &amp;Ishqabad, he had no 
rest.  Day and night, he urged the believers on.  Then they 
too exerted their efforts, and made sacrifices above and beyond 
their power; and God's edifice arose, and word of it 
spread throughout East and West.  The &amp;Afnan expended 
everything he possessed to rear this building, except for a 
trifling sum.  This is the way to make a sacrifice.  This is 
what it means to be faithful.  
     Afterward he journeyed to the Holy Land, and there 
beside that place where the chosen angels circle, in the 
shelter of the Shrine of the &amp;Bab, he passed his days, holy 
and pure, supplicating and entreating the Lord.  God's 
praise was always on his lips, and he chanted prayers with 
both his tongue and heart.  He was wonderfully spiritual, 
strangely ashine.  He is one of those souls who, before ever 
the drumbeat of "Am I not your Lord?" was sounded, 
drummed back:  "Yea, verily Thou art!"+F2  It was in the 
&amp;Iraq period, during the years between the seventies and 
the eighties of the Hijra, that he first caught fire and loved 
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 7:171.  
 
+P129 
the Light of the World, beheld the glory dawning in &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and witnessed the fulfillment of the words, "I am He 
that liveth in the &amp;Abha Realm of Glory!"  
     The &amp;Afnan was an uncommonly happy man.  Whenever 
I was saddened, I would meet with him, and on the 
instant, joy would return again.  Praise be to God, at the 
last, close by the Shrine of the &amp;Bab, he hastened away in 
light to the &amp;Abha Realm; but the loss of him deeply 
grieved &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     His bright grave is in Haifa, beside the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, 
near Elijah's Cave.  A tomb must be erected there, and 
built solidly and well.  May God shed upon his resting-place 
rays from the Paradise of Splendors, and lave that 
holy dust with the rains that beat down from the retreats 
of the Exalted Companion.  Upon him be the glory of the 
All-Glorious.  
 

&amp;Abdu'llah &amp;Baghdadi 
 
     When he was very young, 
people thought of &amp;Abdu'llah 
&amp;Baghdadi as a libertine, solely devoted to pleasure.  
He was regarded by all as the sport of inordinate desires, 
mired down in his physical passions.  But the moment he 
became a believer, he was carried away by the sweet savors 
of God, and was changed into a new creation.  He 
found himself in a strange rapture, completely transformed.  
 
+P130 
He had been of the world, now he was of 
Heaven; he had lived by the flesh, now he lived by the 
spirit; he had walked in darkness; now he walked in 
light.  He had been a slave to his senses, now he was a 
thrall of God.  He had been clay and earthenware before, 
now he was a dear-bought pearl; a dull and lusterless stone 
before, now a ruby glowing.  
     Even among the non-believers, people were astonished 
at the change.  What could have come over this youth, 
they wanted to know; how did it happen that he was suddenly 
detached from the world, eager and devoted?  "He 
was tainted, corrupted," they said; "today he is abstemious 
and chaste.  He was sunk in his appetites, but is now the 
soul of purity, living a righteous life.  He has left the 
world behind him.  He has broken up the feast, dismissed 
the revelers, and folded the banquet cloth away.  His mind 
is distracted by love."  
     Briefly, he let go his pleasures and possessions, and 
journeyed to &amp;Akka on foot.  His face had turned so bright, 
his nature so luminous, that it was a joy to look at him.  I 
used to say:  "&amp;Aqa &amp;Abdu'llah, what condition are you in?"  
And he would answer to this effect:  "I was in darkness; 
now, by the favor of the Blessed Beauty, I am in light.  I 
was a heap of dust; He changed me to a fertile field.  I 
was in constant torment; I am now at peace.  I was in love 
with my chains; He has broken them.  I was avid for this 
one and that; now I cling to the Lord.  I was a bird in a 
cage; He let me out.  Today, though I live in the desert, 
and I have the bare ground for my bed and pillow, it feels 
like silk.  In the old time, my coverlet was satin, and my 
soul was on the rack.  Now I am homeless, and happy."  
     But his burning heart broke when he saw how victimized 
was &amp;Baha'u'llah, how patiently He suffered.  &amp;Abdu'llah 
yearned to die for Him.  And thus it came about 
that he offered up his life for his tender Companion, and 
 
+P131 
hastened away, out of this dark world to the country of 
light.  His luminous grave is in &amp;Akka.  Upon him be the 
glory of the All-Glorious; upon him be mercy, out of the 
grace of the Lord.  
 

&amp;Muhammad-Mustafa &amp;Baghdadi 
 
     &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa 
was a blazing light.  He 
was the son of the famous scholar &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-i-Shibl; 
he lived in &amp;Iraq, and from his earliest youth was 
clearly unique and beyond compare; wise, brave, deserving 
in every way, he was known far and wide.  From 
childhood, guided by his father, he had lit the light of 
faith in the chapel of his heart.  He had rid himself of the 
hindering veils of illusion, gazed about with perceptive 
eyes, witnessed great new signs of God and, regardless of 
the consequences, had cried aloud:  "The earth hath shone 
out with the light of her Lord!"+F1  
     Gracious God!  The opposition was powerful, the penalty 
obvious, the friends, every one of them, terrified, and 
off in some corner hiding their belief; at such a time this 
intrepid personality boldly went about his business, and 
like a man, faced up to every tyrant.  The one individual 
who, in the year seventy, was famed in &amp;Iraq for his love 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 39:69.  
 
+P132 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, was this honored person.  A few other souls, 
then in &amp;Baghdad and its environs, had crept away into 
nooks and crannies and, imprisoned in their own lethargy, 
there they remained.  But this admirable &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa 
would boldly, proudly come and go like a man, 
and the hostile, because of his physical strength and his 
courage, were afraid to attack him.  
     After &amp;Baha'u'llah's return from His journey to &amp;Kurdistan, 
the virile strength and bearing of that gallant individual 
was still further enhanced.  Whenever leave was 
granted, he would attend upon &amp;Baha'u'llah, and would 
hear from His lips expressions of favor and grace.  He was 
the leader, among all the friends in &amp;Iraq, and after the 
great separation, when the convoy of the Beloved left for 
Constantinople, he remained loyal and staunch, and withstood 
the foe.  He girded himself for service and openly, 
publicly, observed by all, taught the Faith.  
     As soon as &amp;Baha'u'llah's declaration that He was "He 
Whom God Shall Manifest"+F2 had become known far and 
wide, &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa--being among those souls 
who had become believers prior to this Declaration, and 
before the call was raised--cried out:  "Verily, we believe!"  
Because, even before this Declaration, the very 
light itself pierced through the veils that had closed off 
the peoples of the world, so that every seeing eye beheld 
the splendor, and every longing soul could look upon its 
Well-Beloved.  
     With all his strength, then, &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa arose 
to serve the Cause.  He rested neither day nor night.  After 
the Ancient Beauty had departed to the Most Great 
Prison; after the friends had been taken prisoner in &amp;Baghdad 
and sent away to Mosul; after the hostility of outstanding 
enemies and the opposition of the populace of 
 
+F2 The Promised One of the &amp;Bab.  
 
+P133 
&amp;Baghdad, he did not falter, but continued to stand his 
ground.  A long time passed in this way.  But with his 
yearning for &amp;Baha'u'llah, the tumult in his heart was such 
that he set out alone for the Most Great Prison.  He 
reached there during the period of extreme restrictions, 
and had the honor of entering the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     He asked then for leave to find a lodging somewhere in 
the neighborhood of &amp;Akka, and was permitted to reside in 
Beirut.  There he went and faithfully served the Cause, assisting 
all the pilgrims as they arrived and departed.  He 
was an excellent servitor, a generous and kindly host, and 
he sacrificed himself to see to their affairs as they passed 
through.  For all this he became known everywhere.  
     When the Sun of Truth had set and the Light of the 
Concourse on high had ascended, &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa 
remained loyal to the Covenant.  He stood so firm against 
the waverers that they dared not draw a breath.  He was 
like a shooting star, a missile hurled against the demons;+F3 
against the violators, an avenging sword.  Not one of the 
violators so much as dared pass through the street where 
he lived and if they chanced to meet him they were like 
those described in the &amp;Qur'an:  "deaf, dumb, blind:  therefore 
they shall not retrace their steps from error!"+F4  He 
was the very embodiment of:  "The blame of the blamer 
shall not deflect him from the path of God, and the terrible 
might of the reviler shall not shake him."  
     Living in the same manner as before, he served the believers 
with a free mind and pure intent.  With all his 
heart, he assisted the travelers to the Holy Land, those 
who had come to circumambulate that place which is 
ringed around by the Company on high.  Later he moved 
 
+F3 &amp;Islamic symbolism:  Satan is the "stoned one"; with shooting stars 
+F3 for stones, the angels repel demons from Paradise.  &amp;Qur'an 3:31, 15:17, 
+F3 34; 37:7; 67:5.  
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 2:17.  
 
+P134 
from Beirut to &amp;Iskandarun, and there he spent some time, 
until, drawn as if by a magnet to the Lord, detached from 
all save Him, rejoicing in His glad tidings, holding fast to 
the cord that none can sever--he ascended on the wings 
of the spirit to his Exalted Companion.  
     May God lift him up to the highest Heaven, to the 
fellowship of glory.+F5  May God bring him into the land of 
lights, the mysterious Kingdom, the assemblage of the 
splendors of the mighty, all powerful Lord.  Upon him be 
the glory of the All-Glorious.  
 

&amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan-i-Tunukabani 
 
     &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan was the 
emigrant and settler who 
was given the title of &amp;Jamali'd-Din.  He was born in &amp;Tunukaban, 
into an old family of that region.  He was cradled 
in wealth, bred to ease, reared in the comfortable ways of 
luxury.  From his early childhood he had high ambitions 
and noble aims, and he was honor and aspiration personified.  
At first he planned to outdistance all his fellows and 
achieve some lofty rank.  For this reason he left his birthplace 
and went to the capital, &amp;Tihran, where he hoped to 
become a leader, surpassing the rest of his generation.  
 
+F5 &amp;Qur'an 4:71.  
 
+P135 
     In &amp;Tihran, however, the fragrance of God was borne 
his way, and he listened to the summons of the Well-Beloved.  
He was saved from the perturbations of high 
rank; from all the din and clatter, the glory, the pomps 
and palaces, of this heap of dust, the world.  He threw off 
his chains, and by God's grace, discovered peace.  To him, 
the seat of honor was now no different from the place 
where people removed their slippers at the door, and high 
office was a thing soon gone and forgotten.  He was 
cleansed from the stain of living, his heart was eased, for 
he had burst the shackles that held him to this present 
life.  
     Putting on the garments of a pilgrim, he set out to find 
his loving Friend, and came to the Most Great Prison.  
Here for a time he rested, under the protection of the 
Ancient Beauty; here he gained the honor of entering the 
presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and listened to momentous teachings 
from His holy lips.  When he had breathed the 
scented air, when his eyes were illumined and his ears attuned 
to the words of the Lord, he was permitted to make 
a journey to India, and bidden to teach the true seekers 
after truth.  
     Resting his heart on God, in love with the sweet savors 
of God, on fire with the love of God, he left for India.  
There he wandered, and whenever he came to a city he 
raised the call of the Great Kingdom and delivered the 
good news that the Speaker of the Mount had come.  He 
became one of God's farmers, scattering the holy seed of 
the Teachings.  This sowing was fruitful.  Through him a 
considerable number found their way into the Ark of Salvation.  
The light of Divine guidance was shed upon those 
souls, and their eyes were brightened with beholding the 
mighty signs of God.  He became the focal point of every 
gathering, the honored guest.  To this day, in India, the 
 
+P136 
results of his auspicious presence are clear to see, and 
those whom he taught are now, in their turn, guiding others 
to the Faith.  
     Following his Indian journey, &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan came 
back to &amp;Baha'u'llah, but when he arrived, the ascension 
had taken place.  Continuously, he shed his tears, and his 
heart was a thurible for sorrow.  But he remained loyal to 
the Covenant, well rooted in Heaven.  
     Not long before His passing, &amp;Baha'u'llah had said:  
"Should someone go to Persia, and manage to convey it, 
this message must be delivered to &amp;Aminu's-Sultan:+F1  `You 
took steps to help the prisoners; you freely rendered them 
a befitting service; this service will not be forgotten.  Rest 
assured that it will bring you honor and call down a blessing 
upon all your affairs.  O &amp;Aminu's-Sultan!  Every house 
that is raised up will one day fall to ruin, except the house 
of God; that will grow more massive and be better guarded 
day by day.  Then serve the Court of God with all your 
might, that you may discover the way to a home in 
Heaven, and found an edifice that will endure forever.'"  
After the departure of &amp;Baha'u'llah, this message was conveyed 
to &amp;Aminu's-Sultan.  
     In &amp;Adhirbayjan the Turkish clerics had brought down 
&amp;Aqa Siyyid &amp;Asadu'llah, hunted him down in &amp;Ardabil and 
plotted to shed his blood; but the Governor, by a ruse, 
managed to save him from being physically beaten and 
then murdered:  he sent the victim to &amp;Tabriz in chains, 
and from there had him conducted to &amp;Tihran.  &amp;Aminu's-Sultan 
came to the prisoner's assistance and, in his own 
office, provided &amp;Asadu'llah with a sanctuary.  One day 
when the Prime Minister was ill, &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah arrived 
to visit him.  The Minister then explained the situation, 
and lavished praise upon his captive; so much so that 
 
+F1 The Prime Minister.  
 
+P137 
the &amp;Shah, as he left, showed great kindness to &amp;Asadu'llah, 
and spoke words of consolation.  This, when at an earlier 
time, the captive would have been strung up at once to 
adorn some gallows-tree, and shot down with a gun.  
     After a time &amp;Aminu's-Sultan lost the Sovereign's favor.  
Hated, in disgrace, he was banished to the city of Qum.  
Thereupon this servant dispatched &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan to 
Persia, carrying a prayer and a missive written by me.  The 
prayer besought God's aid and bounty and succor for the 
fallen Minister, so that he might, from that corner of oblivion, 
be recalled to favor.  In the letter we clearly stated:  
"Prepare to return to &amp;Tihran.  Soon will God's help arrive; 
the light of grace will shine on you again; with full authority 
again, you will find yourself free, and Prime Minister.  
This is your reward for the efforts you exerted on behalf 
of a man who was oppressed."  That letter and that 
prayer are today in the possession of the family of &amp;Aminu's-Sultan.  
     From &amp;Tihran, &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan journeyed to Qum, and 
according to his instructions went to live in a cell in the 
shrine of the Immaculate.+F2  The relatives of &amp;Aminu's-Sultan 
came to visit there; &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan inquired after the 
fallen Minister and expressed the wish to meet him.  When 
the Minister learned of this, he sent for &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan.  
Placing all his trust in God, &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan hastened to 
the Minister's house and, meeting him in private, presented 
the letter from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The Minister rose, 
and received the letter with extreme respect.  Then addressing 
the &amp;Khan he said:  "I had given up hope.  If this 
longing is fulfilled, I will arise to serve; I will preserve and 
uphold the friends of God."  Then he expressed his gratitude, 
indebtedness and joy, and added, "Praise be to God, 
 
+F2 Qum is the shrine city of &amp;Fatimih, "the Immaculate."  Sister of the 
+F2 eighth &amp;Imam, &amp;Imam &amp;Rida, she was buried here in 816 A.D.  
 
+P138 
I hope again; I feel that by His aid, my dream will come 
true."  
     In brief, the Minister pledged himself to serve the 
friends, and &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan took his leave.  The Minister 
then desired to give him a sum of money to defray the expenses 
of his journey, but &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan refused, and 
despite the Minister's insistence, would accept nothing.  
The &amp;Khan had not yet reached the Holy Land on his return 
journey when &amp;Aminu's-Sultan was recalled from exile 
and immediately summoned to the Premiership again.  
He assumed the position and functioned with full authority; 
and at first he did indeed support the believers, but 
toward the end, in the case of the Yazd martyrdoms, he 
was neglectful.  He neither helped nor protected the sufferers 
in any way, nor would he listen to their repeated 
pleas, until all of them were put to death.  Accordingly he 
too was dismissed, a ruined man; that flag which had 
flown so proudly was reversed, and that hoping heart despaired.  
     &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan lived on in the Holy Land, near the 
Shrine which the Exalted Assembly circle about.  He kept 
company with the believers until the day of inescapable 
death, when he set out for the mansions of Him Who 
liveth, and dieth not.  He turned his back on this heap of 
dust, the world, and hurried away to the country of light.  
He broke out of this cage of contingent being and soared 
into the endless, placeless Realm.  May God enfold him in 
the waters of His mercy, cause His forgiveness to rain 
down upon him, and bestow on him the wonders of 
abounding grace.  Salutations be unto him, and praise.  
 
+P139 
&amp;Abdu'r-Rahman, the Coppersmith 
 
     This was a patient and long-enduring 
man, a native of 
&amp;Kashan.  He was one of the very earliest believers.  The 
down was not yet upon his cheek when he drank of the 
love of God, saw with his own eyes the heavenly table 
spread out before him, and received his faith and his portion 
of abounding grace.  
     In a little while he left his home and set out for the 
rose garden that was &amp;Baghdad, where he achieved the 
honor of entering the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He spent 
some time in &amp;Iraq, and won a crown of endless favor:  he 
would enter the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah and many a time 
would accompany Him on foot to the Shrine of the Two 
&amp;Kazims; this was his great delight.  
     &amp;Abdu'r-Rahman was among the prisoners exiled to 
Mosul, and later he fairly dragged himself to the fortress 
at &amp;Akka.  Here he lived, blessed by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He carried 
on a small business, trifling, but he was content with it, 
happy and at peace.  Thus, walking the path of righteousness, 
he lived to be eighty years old, at which time, serenely 
patient, he soared away to the Threshold of God.  
May the Lord enfold him there with His bounty and 
compassion, and clothe him in the garment of forgiveness.  
His luminous grave is in &amp;Akka.  
 
+P140 
&amp;Muhammad-Ibrahim-i-Tabrizi 
 
     This man, noble and high-minded, 
was the son of the 
respected &amp;Abdu'l-Fattah who was in the &amp;Akka prison.  
Learning that his father was a captive there, he came with 
all speed to the fortress so that he too might have a share 
of those dire afflictions.  He was a man wise, understanding, 
in a tumult from drinking the wine of the love of 
God, but with a wonderful, basic serenity and calm.  
     He had inherited the nature of his father, and he exemplified 
the saying that the child is the secret essence of 
its sire.  For this reason, over a long period, he found delight 
in the neighborhood of the Divine Presence, enjoying 
utter peace.  Daytimes, he would carry on his trade, 
and at night he would come in all haste to the door of the 
house, to be with the friends.  He was close to all those 
who were staunch and true; he was full of courage; he 
was grateful to God, abstemious and chaste, expectant of 
and relying on the bounty and grace of the Lord.  He 
made his father's lamp to shine, brightened the household 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Fattah, and left descendants to remain behind 
him in this swiftly passing world.  
     He always did what he could to provide for the happiness 
of the believers; he always saw to their well-being.  
He was sagacious, grave, and steadfast.  By God's grace, he 
 
+P141 
stayed loyal to the end, and sound in faith.  May God give 
him to drink from the cup of forgiveness; may he sip from 
the spring of God's bounty and good pleasure; may God 
raise him up to the heights of Divine bestowal.  His sweet-scented 
tomb is in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Ardikani 
 
     In the flower of tender youth, 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali, the illumined, 
heard the cry of God, and lost his heart to heavenly 
grace.  He entered the service of the &amp;Afnan, offshoot 
of the Holy Tree, and lived happy and content.  This was 
how he came to the city of &amp;Akka, and was for quite a time 
present at the Sacred Threshold, winning a crown of lasting 
glory.  The eye of &amp;Baha'u'llah's grace and favor was 
upon him.  He served with a loyal heart.  He had a happy 
nature, a comely face; he was a man believing, seeking, 
tested and tried.  
     During the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Muhammad-'Ali remained 
steadfast, and after the Supreme Affliction his heart 
did not fail him, for he had drunk the wine of the Covenant 
and his thoughts were fixed on the bounties of God.  He 
moved to Haifa and lived, a firm believer, near the &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds 
by the Holy Shrine on Mount Carmel till his 
final breath, when death came and the carpet of his earthly 
life was rolled up and put away.  
 
+P142 
     This man was a true servant of the Threshold, a good 
friend to the believers.  All were pleased with him, finding 
him an excellent companion, gentle and mild.  May God 
succor him in His exalted Kingdom, and give him a home 
in the &amp;Abha Realm, and send upon him abounding grace 
from the gardens of Heaven--the place of meeting, the 
place of the mystical contemplation of God.  His amber-scented 
dust is in Haifa.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Aqay-i-Tabrizi 
 
     Early in his youth this spiritual 
man, who came from 
&amp;Tabriz, had sensed the mystic knowledge and drunk the 
heady wine of God, and he remained staunch as ever in 
the Faith during his years of helpless age.  
     He lived for a time in &amp;Adhirbayjan, enamored of the 
Lord.  When he became widely known thereabouts as one 
bearing the name of God, the people ruined his life.  His 
relatives and friends turned against him, finding a new 
excuse to hound him with every passing day.  Finally he 
broke up his home, took his family and fled to Adrianople.  
He reached there during the close of the Adrianople period 
and was taken prisoner by the oppressors.  
     Along with us homeless wanderers, and under the protection 
of the Ancient Beauty, he came to the Most Great 
Prison and was a confidant and companion, sharing with 
 
+P143 
us the calamities and tribulations, humble and long-enduring.  
Afterward, when the restrictions were somewhat relaxed, 
he engaged in trade, and through the bounty of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah was comfortable and at peace.  But his body had 
become enfeebled from the earlier hardships, and all the 
suffering, and his faculties had deteriorated; so that ultimately 
he fell ill, beyond hope of a remedy; and not far 
from &amp;Baha'u'llah, and shadowed by His protection, he 
hastened away from this least of worlds to the high Heavens, 
from this dark place to the land of lights.  May God 
immerse him in the waters of forgiveness; may He bring 
him into the gardens of Paradise, and there keep him safe 
forevermore.  His pure dust rests in &amp;Akka.  
 

&amp;Qulam-'Aliy-i-Najjar 
 
     This man, a carpenter and a 
master craftsman, came 
from &amp;Kashan.  For faith and certitude, he was like a sword 
drawn from the scabbard.  He was well known in his own 
city as a man righteous, true and worthy of trust.  He was 
high-minded, abstemious and chaste.  When he became a 
believer, his urgent longing to meet &amp;Baha'u'llah could not 
be stilled; full of joyous love, he went out of the Land of 
&amp;Kaf (&amp;Kashan) and traveled to &amp;Iraq, where he beheld the 
splendor of the rising Sun.  
     He was a mild man, patient, quiet, mostly keeping to 
 
+P144 
himself.  In &amp;Baghdad, he worked at his craft, was in touch 
with the friends, and sustained by the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
For some time he lived in utter happiness and peace.  
Then those who had been taken prisoner were sent away 
to Mosul, and he was among the victims and like them exposed 
to the wrath of the oppressors.  He remained in captivity 
for quite a while and when freed came to &amp;Akka.  
Here too he was a friend to the prisoners and in the Fortress 
he continued to practice his skill.  As usual he was inclined 
to solitude, apt to stay apart from friend and stranger alike, 
and much of the time lived by himself.  
     Then the supreme ordeal, the great desolation, came 
upon us.  &amp;Qulam-'Ali took on the carpentry work of the 
Holy Tomb, exerting all his sure powers.  To this day, the 
glass roof which is over the inner courtyard of the Shrine 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah remains as the product of his skill.  He was 
a man crystal clear of heart.  His face shone; his inner condition 
was constant; at no time was he changeable or unstable.  
He was staunch, loving, and true till his last breath.  
     After some years in this neighborhood, he rose upward 
to the neighborhood of the all-embracing mercy of God, 
and became a friend to those who dwell in the high Heavens.  
He had the honor of meeting &amp;Baha'u'llah in both 
worlds.  This is the most precious bestowal, the costliest of 
all gifts.  To him be salutations and praise.  His bright 
grave is in &amp;Akka.  
 
+P145 
&amp;Jinab-i-Munib, upon him be the Glory of the 
All-Glorious 
 
     His name was &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa 
and he was spirit itself.  
He came from &amp;Kashan.  In the days of the &amp;Bab, he was 
drawn to the sweet savors of God; it was then he caught 
fire.  He was a fine youth, handsome, full of charm and 
grace.  He was a calligrapher second to none, a poet, and he 
had as well a remarkable singing voice.  He was wise and 
perceptive; staunch in the Faith of God; a flame of God's 
love, severed from all but God.  
     During the years when &amp;Baha'u'llah resided in &amp;Iraq, 
&amp;Jinab-i-Munib left &amp;Kashan and hastened to His presence.  
He went to live in a small and humble house, barely 
managed to subsist, and set about committing to writing 
the words of God.  On his brow, the bestowals of the Manifestation 
were clear to see.  In all this mortal world he had 
only one possession, his daughter; and even his daughter 
he had left behind in Persia, as he hurried away to &amp;Iraq.  
     At the time when, with all pomp and ceremony, &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and His retinue departed from &amp;Baghdad, &amp;Jinab-i-Munib 
accompanied the party on foot.  The young man 
had been known in Persia for his easy and agreeable life 
and his love of pleasure; also for being somewhat soft and 
delicate, and used to having his own way.  It is obvious what 
 
+P146 
a person of this type endured, going on foot from &amp;Baghdad 
to Constantinople.  Still, he gladly measured out the desert 
miles, and he spent his days and nights chanting prayers, 
communing with God and calling upon Him.  
     He was a close companion of mine on that journey.  
There were nights when we would walk, one to either 
side of the howdah of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and the joy we had 
defies description.  Some of those nights he would sing 
poems; among them he would chant the odes of &amp;Hafiz, 
like the one that begins, "Come, let us scatter these roses, 
let us pour out this wine,"+F1 and that other:  
 
          To our King though we bow the knee, 
          We are kings of the morning star.  
          No changeable colors have we-- 
          Red lions, black dragons we are!  
 
     The Blessed Beauty, at the time of His departure from 
Constantinople, directed &amp;Jinab-i-Munib to return to Persia 
and promulgate the Faith.  Accordingly he went back, and 
over a considerable period he rendered outstanding services, 
especially in &amp;Tihran.  Then he came again, from Persia to 
Adrianople, and entered the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, enjoying 
the privilege of attending upon Him.  At the time 
of the greatest catastrophe, that is, the exile to &amp;Akka, he 
was made a prisoner on this Pathway and traveled, by now 
feeble and ill, with the party of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     He had been stricken by a severe ailment and was pitifully 
weak.  Still, he would not agree to remaining behind 
in Adrianople where he could receive treatment, because 
he wanted to sacrifice his life and fall at the feet of his 
Lord.  We journeyed along till we reached the sea.  He was 
now so feeble that it took three men to lift him and carry 
 
+F1 The remainder of the verse is:  "Let us split the roof of Heaven and 
+F1 draw a new design."  
 
+P147 
him onto the ship.  Once he was on board, his condition 
grew so much worse that the captain insisted we put him 
off the ship, but because of our repeated pleas he waited 
till we reached Smyrna.  In Smyrna, the captain addressed 
Colonel &amp;Umar Bayk, the government agent who accompanied 
us, and told him:  "If you don't put him ashore, I 
will do it by force, because the ship will not accept passengers 
in this condition."  
     We were compelled, then, to take &amp;Jinab-i-Munib to the 
hospital at Smyrna.  Weak as he was, unable to utter a 
word, he dragged himself to &amp;Baha'u'llah, lay down at His 
feet, and wept.  On the countenance of &amp;Baha'u'llah as well, 
there was intense pain.  
     We carried &amp;Jinab-i-Munib to the hospital, but the functionaries 
allowed us not more than one hour's time.  We 
laid him down on the bed; we laid his fair head on the 
pillow; we held him and kissed him many times.  Then 
they forced us away.  It is clear how we felt.  Whenever I 
think of that moment, the tears come; my heart is heavy 
and I summon up the remembrance of what he was.  A 
great man; infinitely wise, he was, steadfast, modest and 
grave; and there was no one like him for faith and certitude.  
In him the inner and outer perfections, the spiritual 
and physical, were joined together.  That is why he could 
receive endless bounty and grace.  
     His grave is in Smyrna, but it is off by itself, and deserted.  
Whenever this can be done, the friends must search 
for it, and that neglected dust must be changed into a 
much-frequented shrine,+F2 so that pilgrims who visit there 
may breathe in the sweet scent of his last resting-place.  
 
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 52:4.  
 
+P148 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Mustafa &amp;Naraqi 
 
     Among that company of 
pure and goodly souls was 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Mustafa, a leading citizen of &amp;Naraq and one of the 
earliest believers.  His face shone with the love of God.  His 
mind was concerned with the anemones of mystic meanings, 
fair as meadows and beds of flowers.  
     It was in the days of the &amp;Bab that he first set his lips to 
the intoxicating cup of spiritual truth, and he had a strange 
tumult in his brain, a fierce yearning in his heart.  In the 
path of God he threw down whatever he possessed; he 
gambled everything away, gave up his home, his kin, his 
physical well-being, his peace of mind.  Like a fish on the 
sand, he struggled to reach the water of life.  He came to 
&amp;Iraq, joined the friends of his soul, and entered the presence 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  For some time he lived there, joyful 
and content, receiving endless bounty.  Then he was sent 
back to Persia, where, to the utmost of his capacity, he 
served the Faith.  He was a whole and accomplished man, 
staunch, firmly rooted as the hills; sound, and worthy of 
trust.  To him, in all that turmoil and panic, the wild dogs 
howling were only buzzing flies; tests and trials rested his 
mind; when cast into the fire of afflictions that broke out, 
he proved to be shining gold.  
     On the day when the convoy of &amp;Baha'u'llah was leaving 
 
+P149 
Constantinople for Adrianople, &amp;Mirza &amp;Mustafa arrived from 
Persia.  There was no opportunity for him to reach &amp;Baha'u'llah 
except once; and he was thereupon directed to return 
to Persia.  At such a moment he had the honor of being 
received.  
     When &amp;Mirza &amp;Mustafa reached &amp;Adhirbayjan, he began 
to spread the Faith.  Day and night he remained in a state 
of prayer, and there in &amp;Tabriz he drank of a brimming cup.  
His fervor increased, his teaching raised a tumult.  Then 
the eminent scholar, the renowned &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad-i-Khurasani, 
came to &amp;Adhirbayjan and the two of them 
joined forces.  The result was such overwhelming spiritual 
fire that they taught the Faith openly and publicly and the 
people of &amp;Tabriz rose up in wrath.  
     The &amp;farrashes hunted them down, and caught &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Mustafa.  But then the oppressors said, "&amp;Mirza &amp;Mustafa 
had two long locks of hair.  This cannot be the right man."  
At once, &amp;Mirza &amp;Mustafa took off his hat and down fell the 
locks of hair.  "Behold!" he told them.  "I am the one."  They 
arrested him then.  They tortured him and &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad 
until finally, in &amp;Tabriz, those two great men drained the 
cup of death and, martyred, hastened away to the Supreme 
Horizon.  
     At the place where they were to be killed, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Mustafa cried out:  "Kill me first, kill me before &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Ahmad, that I may not see them shed his blood!"  
     Their greatness has been recorded for all time in the 
Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  They received many a Tablet from 
Him, and after their death He set down, with His exalted 
pen, the anguish they endured.  
     From youth till old age, this illustrious man, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Mustafa, devoted his entire life to service on the pathway 
of God.  Today he dwells in the all-glorious Realm, in the 
neighborhood of the ineffable mercy of God, and he rejoices 
with exceeding gladness, and he celebrates the praise 
 
+P150 
of his Lord.  Blessedness be his, and a goodly home.+F1  To 
him be tidings of great joy, from the Lord of Lords.  May 
God grant him an exalted station, in that high Company.  
 

&amp;Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin 
 
     This distinguished man was 
one of the greatest of all the 
&amp;Bab's companions and all the loved ones of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
When he lived under &amp;Islam, he was already famed for his 
purity and holiness of life.  He was talented and highly accomplished 
in many directions.  He was the leader and 
spiritual exemplar of the entire population of &amp;Najaf-Abad, 
and the eminent of that area showed him unbounded respect.  
When he spoke out, his was the deciding opinion; 
when he passed judgment, it took effect; for he was known 
to all as the standard, and the authority of last resort.  
     He had no sooner learned of the &amp;Bab's Declaration than 
he cried out from the depths of his heart, "O our Lord! we 
have indeed heard the voice of one that called.  He called 
us to the Faith--`Believe ye on your Lord'--and we have 
believed."+F1  He rid himself of all impeding veils; his doubts 
dispelled, he began to extol and glorify the Beauty promised 
from of old.  In his own home, and at &amp;Isfahan, he became 
 
+F1 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 13:28.  
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 3:190.  
 
+P151 
notorious for declaring far and wide that the advent 
of the long-desired One had come to pass.  By the hypocrites, 
he was mocked, cursed and tormented.  As for the 
people, "the mass, as a snake in the grass," who had worshiped 
him before, now rose up to do him harm.  Every 
day brought on a fresh cruelty, a new torment from his 
oppressors.  He endured it all, and went on teaching with 
great eloquence.  He remained staunch, unmoved, as their 
wrath increased.  In his hands he held out a full cup of 
Divine glad tidings, offering to all who came that heady 
draught of the knowledge of God.  He was utterly without 
fear, knew nothing of danger, and swiftly followed the 
holy path of the Lord.  
     After the attempt on the &amp;Shah, however, there was no 
shelter anywhere; no evening, no morning, without intense 
affliction.  And since his staying on in &amp;Najaf-Abad at 
such a time was a great danger to the believers, he left 
there and traveled to &amp;Iraq.  It was during the period when 
the Blessed Beauty was in &amp;Kurdistan, when He had gone 
into seclusion and was living in the cave on &amp;Sar-Galu, 
that &amp;Jinab-i-Zayn arrived in &amp;Baghdad.  But his hopes were 
dashed, his heart grieved, for all was silence:  there was no 
word of the Cause of God, no name nor fame of it; there 
were no gatherings, no call was being raised.  &amp;Yahya, terror 
stricken, had vanished into some dark hiding place.  Torpid, 
flaccid, he had made himself invisible.  Try as he might, 
&amp;Jinab-i-Zayn could find not one soul.  He met on a single 
occasion with His Eminence &amp;Kalim.  But it was a period 
when great caution was being exercised by the believers, 
and he went on to &amp;Karbila.  He spent some time there, and 
occupied himself with copying out the Writings, after 
which he returned home to &amp;Najaf-Abad.  Here the foul 
persecutions and attacks of his relentless enemies could 
hardly be endured.  
 
+P152 
     But when the Trump had been sounded a second time,+F2 
he was restored to life.  To the tidings of &amp;Baha'u'llah's advent 
his soul replied; to the drum beat, "Am I not your 
Lord?" his heart drummed back:  "Yea, verily!"+F3  Eloquently, 
he taught again, using both rational and historical 
proofs to establish that He Whom God Shall Manifest-- 
the Promised One of the &amp;Bab--had indeed appeared.  He 
was like refreshing waters to those who thirsted, and to 
seekers, a clear answer from the Concourse on high.  In 
his writing and speaking, he was first among the righteous, 
in his elucidations and commentaries a mighty sign of God.  
     In Persia his life was in imminent peril; and since remaining 
at &amp;Najaf-Abad would have stirred up the agitators 
and brought on riots, he hastened away to Adrianople, seeking 
sanctuary with God, and crying out as he went, "Lord, 
Lord, here am I!"  Wearing the lover's pilgrim dress, he 
reached the Mecca of his longing.  For some time he tarried 
there, in the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, after which he was 
commanded to leave, with &amp;Jinab-i-Mirza &amp;Ja'far-i-Yazdi, and 
promulgate the Faith.  He returned to Persia and began to 
teach most eloquently, so that the glad tidings of the Lord's 
advent resounded to the high heavens.  In the company of 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Ja'far he traveled everywhere, through cities flourishing 
and ruined, spreading the good news that the 
Blessed Beauty was now manifest.  
     Once again, he returned to &amp;Iraq, where he was the 
center of every gathering, and rejoiced his hearers.  At all 
times, he gave wise counsel; at all times he was consumed 
with the love of God.  
     When the believers were taken prisoner in &amp;Iraq and 
banished to Mosul, &amp;Jinab-i-Zayn became their chief.  He 
remained for some time in Mosul, a consolation to the 
 
+F2 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 39:68.  
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 7:171.  
 
+P153 
rest, working to solve their many problems.  He would 
kindle love in people's hearts, and make them kind to one 
another.  Later he asked for permission to attend upon 
&amp;Baha'u'llah; when this was granted he arrived at the Prison 
and had the honor of entering the presence of his Well-Beloved.  
He then busied himself with writing down the 
sacred verses, and encouraging the friends.  He was love 
itself to the emigrants, and warmed the travelers' hearts.  
He never rested for a moment, and received new grace and 
bounty every day, meanwhile taking down the &amp;Baha'i 
Scriptures with faultless care.  
     From his early years till his last breath, this eminent man 
never failed in service to the Manifestation.  After the ascension 
he was consumed with such grieving, such constant 
tears and anguish, that as the days passed by, he 
wasted away.  He remained faithful to the Covenant, and 
was a close companion to this servant of the Light of the 
World, but he longed to rise out of this life, and awaited 
his departure from day to day.  At last, serene and happy, 
rejoicing in the tidings of the Kingdom, he soared away 
to that mysterious land.  There he was loosed from every 
sorrow, and in the gathering-place of splendors he was immersed 
in light.  
     Unto him be salutations and praise from the luminous 
Realm, and the glory of the All-Glorious from the Concourse 
on high, and great joy in that Kingdom which endures 
forever.  May God provide him with an exalted station 
in the &amp;Abha Paradise.  
 
+P154 
&amp;Azim-i-Tafrishi 
 
     This man of God came from 
the district of &amp;Tafrish.  He 
was detached from the world, fearless, independent of 
kindred and stranger alike.  He was one of the earliest believers, 
and belonged to the company of the faithful.  It was 
in Persia that he won the honor of belief, and began to 
assist the friends; he was a servant to every believer, a 
trusted helper to every traveler.  With &amp;Musay-i-Qumi, upon 
whom be the glory of God, he came to &amp;Iraq, received his 
portion of bounty from the Light of the World, and was 
honored with entering the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah, attending 
upon Him and becoming the object of bestowals 
and grace.  
     After a time, &amp;Azim and &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Musa went back to 
Persia, where he continued to render service to the friends, 
purely for God's sake.  Without wage or stipend he served 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Nasru'llah of &amp;Tafrish for a number of years, his faith 
and certitude growing stronger with every passing day.  
&amp;Mirza &amp;Nasru'llah then left Persia for Adrianople, and in 
his company came &amp;Jinab-i-'Azim, and entered the presence 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He kept on serving with love and loyalty, 
purely for the sake of God; and when the convoy departed 
for &amp;Akka, &amp;Azim received the distinction of accompanying 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, and he entered the Most Great Prison.  
 
+P155 
     In the prison he was chosen to serve the Household; he 
became the water carrier both within doors and on the outside.  
He undertook many hard tasks in the barracks.  He 
had no rest at all, day or night.  &amp;Azim--"the great, the 
magnificent"--was magnificent as to character.  He was 
patient, long-suffering, forbearing, shunning the stain of 
this earth.  And since he was the family water carrier, he 
had the honor of coming into &amp;Baha'u'llah's presence every 
day.  
     He was a good companion to all the friends, a consolation 
to their hearts; he brought happiness to all of them, 
the present and the absent as well.  Many and many a 
time, &amp;Baha'u'llah was heard to express His approval of this 
man.  He always maintained the same inner condition; he 
was constant, never subject to change.  He was always 
happy-looking.  He did not know the meaning of fatigue.  
He was never despondent.  When anyone asked a service 
of him, he performed it at once.  He was staunch and firm 
in his faith, a tree that grew in the scented garden of God's 
tenderness.  
     After he had served at the Holy Threshold for many 
long years, he hastened away, tranquil, serene, rejoicing 
in the tidings of the Kingdom, out of this swiftly fading 
life to the world that does not die.  The friends, all of them, 
mourned his passing, but the Blessed Beauty eased their 
hearts, for He lavished grace and praise on him who was 
gone.  
     Mercies be upon &amp;Azim from the Kingdom of Divine 
compassion; God's glory be upon him, at nightfall and the 
rising of the sun.  
 
+P156 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Ja'far-i-Yazdi 
 
     This knight of the battlefield 
was one of the most 
learned of seekers after truth, well versed in many branches 
of knowledge.  For a long time he was in the schools, 
specializing in the fundamentals of religion and religious 
jurisprudence, and making researches into philosophy and 
metaphysics, logic and history, the contemplative and the 
narrated sciences.+F1  He began, however, to note that his 
fellows were arrogant and self-satisfied, and this repelled 
him.  It was then that he heard the cry out of the Supreme 
Concourse, and without a moment's hesitation he raised 
up his voice and shouted, "Yea, verily!"; and he repeated 
the words, "O our Lord!  We have heard the voice of one 
that called.  He called us to the Faith--`Believe ye on your 
Lord'--and we have believed."+F2  
     When he saw the great tumult and the riots in Yazd, he 
left his homeland and went to Najaf, the noble city; here 
for safety's sake he mingled with the scholars of religion, 
becoming renowned among them for his own wide knowledge.  
Then, listening to the voice from &amp;Baghdad, he hastened 
there, and changed his mode of dress.  That is, he put 
a layman's hat on his head, and went to work as a carpenter 
 
+F1 &amp;Manqul va &amp;ma'qul:  "desumed" versus "excogitated" knowledge.  
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 3:190.  
 
+P157 
to earn his living.  He traveled once to &amp;Tihran, returned, 
and sheltered by the grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah was patient and 
content, rejoicing in his garb of poverty.  In spite of his 
great learning he was humble, self-effacing, lowly.  He kept 
silent at all times, and was a good companion to every sort 
of man.  
     On the journey from &amp;Iraq to Constantinople, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Ja'far was one of &amp;Baha'u'llah's retinue, and in seeing to the 
needs of the friends, he was a partner to this servant.  When 
we would come to a stopping-place the believers, exhausted 
by the long hours of travel, would rest or sleep.  &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Ja'far and I would go here and there to the surrounding 
villages to find oats, straw and other provisions for the 
caravan.+F3  Since there was a famine in that area, it sometimes 
happened that we would be roaming from village to 
village from after the noon hour until half the night was 
gone.  As best we could, we could procure whatever was 
available, then return to the convoy.  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Ja'far was patient and long-suffering, a faithful 
attendant at the Holy Threshold.  He was a servant to all 
the friends, working day and night.  A quiet man, sparing 
of speech, in all things relying entirely upon God.  He 
continued to serve in Adrianople until the banishment to 
&amp;Akka was brought about and he too was made a prisoner.  
He was grateful for this, continually offering thanks, and 
saying, "Praise be to God!  I am in the fully-laden Ark!"+F4  
     The Prison was a garden of roses to him, and his narrow 
cell a wide and fragrant place.  At the time when we were 
in the barracks he fell dangerously ill and was confined to 
 
+F3 &amp;Baha'u'llah was accompanied by members of His family and twenty-six 
+F3 disciples.  The convoy included a mounted guard of ten soldiers 
+F3 with their officer, a train of fifty mules, and seven pairs of howdahs, 
+F3 each pair surmounted by four parasols.  The journey to Constantinople 
+F3 lasted from May 3, 1863 to August 16.  Cf. God Passes By, p. 156.  
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 26:119; 36:41.  
 
+P158 
his bed.  He suffered many complications, until finally the 
doctor gave him up and would visit him no more.  Then the 
sick man breathed his last.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan ran to &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
with word of the death.  Not only had the patient 
ceased to breathe, but his body was already going limp.  
His family were gathered about him, mourning him, shedding 
bitter tears.  The Blessed Beauty said, "Go; chant the 
prayer of &amp;Ya &amp;Shafi--O Thou, the Healer--and &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Ja'far will come alive.  Very rapidly, he will be as well as 
ever."  I reached his bedside.  His body was cold and all the 
signs of death were present.  Slowly, he began to stir; soon 
he could move his limbs, and before an hour had passed he 
lifted his head, sat up, and proceeded to laugh and tell 
jokes.  
     He lived for a long time after that, occupied as ever 
with serving the friends.  This giving service was a point of 
pride with him:  to all, he was a servant.  He was always 
modest and humble, calling God to mind, and to the highest 
degree full of hope and faith.  Finally, while in the 
Most Great Prison, he abandoned this earthly life and 
winged his way to the life beyond.  
     Greetings and praise be unto him; upon him be the 
glory of the All-Glorious, and the favoring glances of the 
Lord.  His luminous grave is in &amp;Akka.  
 
+P159 
&amp;Husayn-Aqay-i-Tabrizi 
 
     This man who was close to 
the Divine Threshold was 
the respected son of &amp;Ali-'Askar-i-Tabrizi.  Full of yearning 
love, he came with his father from &amp;Tabriz to Adrianople, 
and by his own wish, went on with joy and hope to the 
Most Great Prison.  From the day of his arrival at the 
fortress of &amp;Akka he took over the coffee service, and waited 
upon the friends.  This accomplished man was so patient, 
so docile, that over a forty-year period, despite extreme 
difficulties (for day and night, friend and stranger alike 
thronged the doors), he attended upon each and every one 
who came, faithfully helping them all.  During all that 
time &amp;Husayn-Aqa never offended a soul, nor did anyone, 
where he was concerned, utter a single complaint.  This 
was truly a miracle, and no one else could have established 
such a record of service.  He was always smiling, attentive 
as to the tasks committed to his care, known as a man to 
trust.  In the Cause of God he was staunch, proud and 
true; in times of calamity he was patient and long-suffering.  
     After the ascension of &amp;Baha'u'llah the fires of tests leaped 
up and a whirlwind of violation battered the edifice down.  
This believer, in spite of a close tie of kinship, remained 
loyal, showing such strength and firmness that he manifested 
 
+P160 
the words:  "In the Cause of God, the blame of 
the blamer shall he not fear."+F1  Not for a moment did he 
hesitate, nor waver in his faith, but he stood firm as a 
mountain, proud as an impregnable citadel, and rooted 
deep.  
     The Covenant-breakers took his mother away to their 
own place, where her daughter lived.  They did everything 
they could think of to unsettle her faith.  To an extent beyond 
belief, they lavished favors upon her, and plied her 
with kindnesses, hiding the fact that they had broken the 
Covenant.  Finally, however, that respected handmaid of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah detected the odor of violation, whereupon she 
instantly quit the Mansion of &amp;Bahji and hurried back to 
&amp;Akka.  "I am the handmaid of the Blessed Beauty," she 
said, "and loyal to His Covenant and Testament.  Though 
my son-in-law were a prince of the realm, what would that 
profit me?  I am not to be won over by kinship and displays 
of affection.  I am not concerned with external tokens of 
friendliness from those who are the very embodiment of 
selfish desire.  I stand by the Covenant, and I hold to the 
Testament."  She would not consent to meet with the 
Covenant-breakers again; she freed herself completely from 
them, and turned her face to God.  
     As for &amp;Husayn-Aqa, never did he separate himself 
from &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  He had the utmost consideration for 
me and was my constant companion, and it followed that 
his passing was a formidable blow.  Even now, whenever he 
comes to mind I grieve, and mourn his loss.  But God be 
praised that this man of God, in the days of the Blessed 
Beauty, remained at all times in close proximity to His 
House, and was the object of His good pleasure.  Time and 
again, &amp;Baha'u'llah was heard to comment that &amp;Husayn-Aqa 
had been created to perform this service.  
 
+F1 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 5:59.  
 
+P161 
     After forty years of serving, he forsook this swiftly passing 
world and soared away to the realms of God.  Greetings 
and praise be unto him, and mercy from his bountiful 
Lord.  May his grave be encircled with lights that stream 
from the exalted Companion.  His resting-place is in Haifa.  
 

&amp;Haji &amp;Ali-'Askar-i-Tabrizi 
 
     The distinguished &amp;Ali-'Askar 
was a merchant from 
&amp;Tabriz.  He was much respected in &amp;Adhirbayjan by all who 
knew him, and recognized for godliness and trustworthiness, 
for piety and strong faith.  The people of &amp;Tabriz, one 
and all, acknowledged his excellence and praised his character 
and way of life, his qualities and talents.  He was one 
of the earliest believers, and one of the most notable.  
     When the Trumpet first sounded, he fainted away, and 
at the second blast, he was awakened to new life.+F1  He became 
a candle burning with the love of God, a goodly tree 
in the &amp;Abha gardens.  He led all his household, his other 
kindred and his friends to the Faith, and successfully 
rendered many services; but the tyranny of the wicked 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 39:68-69:  "And there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and 
+F1 all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth shall swoon 
+F1 away, save those whom God shall vouchsafe to live.  Then shall there 
+F1 be another blast on it, and lo! arising they shall gaze around them:  and 
+F1 the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord..."  
 
+P162 
brought him to an agonizing pass, and he was beset by new 
afflictions every day.  Still, he did not slacken and was not 
dispirited; on the contrary, his faith, his certitude and self-sacrifice 
increased.  Finally he could endure his homeland no 
more.  Accompanied by his family, he arrived in Adrianople, 
and here, in financial straits, but content, he spent his 
days, with dignity, patience, acquiescence, and offering 
thanks.  
     Then he took a little merchandise with him from 
Adrianople, and left for the city of &amp;Jum'ih-Bazar, to earn 
his livelihood.  What he had with him was trifling, but still, 
it was carried off by thieves.  When the Persian Consul 
learned of this he presented a document to the Government, 
naming an enormous sum as the value of the stolen 
goods.  By chance the thieves were caught and proved to 
be in possession of considerable funds.  It was decided to 
investigate the case.  The Consul called in &amp;Haji &amp;Ali-'Askar 
and told him:  "These thieves are very rich.  In my report 
to the Government, I wrote that the amount of the theft 
was great.  Therefore you must attend the trial and testify 
conformably to what I wrote."  
     The &amp;Haji replied:  "Your Honor, &amp;Khan, the stolen 
goods amounted to very little.  How can I report something 
that is not true?  When they question me, I will give the 
facts exactly as they are.  I consider this my duty, and only 
this."  
     "&amp;Haji," said the Consul, "We have a golden opportunity 
here; you and I can both profit by it.  Don't let such a once-in-a-lifetime 
chance slip through your hands."  
     The &amp;Haji answered:  "&amp;Khan, how would I square it with 
God?  Let me be.  I shall tell the truth and nothing but the 
truth."  
     The Consul was beside himself.  He began to threaten 
and belabor &amp;Ali-'Askar.  "Do you want to make me out a 
liar?" he cried.  "Do you want to make me a laughingstock?  
 
+P163 
I will jail you; I will have you banished; there is no 
torment I will spare you.  This very instant I will hand 
you over to the police, and I will tell them that you are an 
enemy of the state, and that you are to be manacled and 
taken to the Persian frontier."  
     The &amp;Haji only smiled.  "&amp;Jinab-i-Khan," he said.  "I have 
given up my life for the truth.  I have nothing else.  You 
are telling me to lie and bear false witness.  Do with me 
as you please; I will not turn my back on what is right."  
     When the Consul saw that there was no way to make 
&amp;Ali-'Askar testify to a falsehood, he said:  "It is better, then, 
for you to leave this place, so that I can inform the Government 
that the owner of the merchandise is no longer 
available and has gone away.  Otherwise I shall be disgraced."  
     The &amp;Haji returned to Adrianople, and spoke not a word 
as to his stolen goods, but the matter became public knowledge 
and caused considerable surprise.  
     That fine and rare old man was taken captive in Adrianople 
along with the rest, and he accompanied the Blessed 
Beauty to the &amp;Akka fortress, this prison-house of sorrows.  
With all his family, he was jailed in the path of God for a 
period of years; and he was always offering thanks, because 
the prison was a palace to him, and captivity a reason 
to rejoice.  In all those years he was never known to express 
himself except in thankfulness and praise.  The greater the 
tyranny of the oppressors, the happier he was.  Time and 
again &amp;Baha'u'llah was heard to speak of him with loving 
kindness, and He would say:  "I am pleased with him."  
This man, who was spirit personified, remained constant, 
true, and joyful to the end.  When some years had passed, 
he exchanged this world of dust for the Kingdom that is 
undefiled, and he left powerful influences behind.  
     As a rule, he was the close companion of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
One day, at the beginning of our time in the Prison, I 
 
+P164 
hurried to the corner of the barracks where he lived--the 
cell that was his shabby nest.  He was lying there, running 
a high fever, out of his head.  On his right side lay his wife, 
shaking and trembling with chills.  To his left was his 
daughter, &amp;Fatimih, burning up with typhus.  Beyond them 
his son, &amp;Husayn-Aqa, was down with scarlet fever; he had 
forgotten how to speak Persian, and he kept crying out in 
Turkish, "My insides are on fire!"  At the father's feet lay 
the other daughter, deep in her sickness, and along the 
side of the wall was his brother, &amp;Mashhadi &amp;Fattah, raving 
and delirious.  In this condition, &amp;Ali-'Askar's lips were moving:  
he was returning thanks to God, and expressing joy.  
     Praise be to God!  He died in the Most Great Prison, still 
patient and thankful, still with dignity and firm in his 
faith.  He rose up to the retreats of the compassionate Lord.  
Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious; to him be 
salutations and praise:  upon him be mercy and forgiveness 
forever and ever.  
 

&amp;Aqa &amp;Aliy-i-Qazvini 
 
     This eminent man had high 
ambitions and aims.  He was 
to a supreme degree constant, loyal and firmly rooted in 
his faith, and he was among the earliest and greatest of the 
believers.  At the very dawn of the new Day of Guidance 
he became enamored of the &amp;Bab and began to teach.  From 
 
+P165 
morning till dark he worked at his craft, and almost every 
night he entertained the friends at supper.  Being host in 
this way to friends in the spirit, he guided many seekers to 
the Faith, attracting them with the melody of the love of 
God.  He was amazingly constant, energetic, and persevering.  
     Then the perfume-laden air began to stir from over the 
gardens of the All-Glorious, and he caught fire from the 
newly kindled flame.  His illusions and fancies were burned 
away and he arose to proclaim the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Every night there was a meeting, a gathering that rivaled 
the flowers in their beds.  The verses were read, the prayers 
chanted, the good news of the greatest of Advents was 
shared.  He spent most of his time in showing kindness to 
friend and stranger alike; he was a magnanimous being, 
with open hand and heart.  
     The day came when he set out for the Most Great 
Prison, and arrived with his family at the &amp;Akka fortress.  
He had been afflicted with many a hardship on his journey, 
but his longing to see &amp;Baha'u'llah was such that he 
found the calamities easy to endure; and so he measured 
off the miles, looking for a home in God's sheltering grace.  
     At first he had means; life was comfortable and pleasant.  
Later on, however, he was destitute and subjected to terrible 
ordeals.  Most of the time his food was bread, nothing 
else; instead of tea, he drank from a running brook.  Still, 
he remained happy and content.  His great joy was to enter 
the presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah; reunion with his Beloved was 
bounty enough; his food was to look upon the beauty of 
the Manifestation; his wine, to be with &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He was 
always smiling, always silent; but at the same time, his 
heart shouted, leapt and danced.  
     Often, he was in the company of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  He was 
an excellent friend and comrade, happy, delightful; favored 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah, respected by the friends, shunning 
 
+P166 
the world, trusting in God.  There was no fickleness in 
him, his inner condition was always the same:  stable, constant, 
firmly rooted as the hills.  
     Whenever I call him to mind, and remember that 
patience and serenity, that loyalty, that contentment, involuntarily 
I find myself asking God to shed His bounties 
upon &amp;Aqa &amp;Ali.  Misfortunes and calamities were forever 
descending on that estimable man.  He was always ill, 
continually subjected to unnumbered physical afflictions.  
The reason was that when at home and serving the Faith 
in &amp;Qazvin, he was caught by the malevolent and they 
beat him so brutally over the head that the effects stayed 
with him till his dying hour.  They abused and tormented 
him in many ways and thought it permissible to inflict 
every kind of cruelty upon him; yet his only crime was to 
have become a believer, and his only sin, to have loved 
God.  As the poet has written, in lines that illustrate the 
plight of &amp;Aqa &amp;Ali:  
 
          By owls the royal falcon is beset.  
          They rend his wings, though he is free of sin.  
          "Why"--so they mock--"do you remember yet 
          That royal wrist, that palace you were in?"  
          He is a kingly bird:  this crime he did commit.  
          Except for beauty, what was Joseph's sin?  
 
     Briefly, that great man spent his time in the &amp;Akka 
prison, praying, supplicating, turning his face toward 
God.  Infinite bounty enfolded him; he was favored by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, much of the time admitted to His presence 
and showered with endless grace.  This was his joy and 
his delight, his great good fortune, his dearest wish.  
     Then the fixed hour was upon him, the daybreak of his 
hopes, and it came his turn to soar away, into the invisible 
realm.  Sheltered under the protection of &amp;Baha'u'llah, he 
 
+P167 
went swiftly forth to that mysterious land.  To him be 
salutations and praise and mercy from the Lord of this 
world and the world to come.  May God light up his resting-place 
with rays from the Companion on high.  
 

&amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Baqir and &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Isma'il, 
the Tailor 
 
     These were two brothers 
who, in the path of God, 
captives along with the rest, were shut in the &amp;Akka fortress.  
They were brothers of the late &amp;Pahlavan &amp;Rida.  They 
left Persia and emigrated to Adrianople, hastening to the 
loving-kindness of &amp;Baha'u'llah; and under His protection, 
they came to &amp;Akka.  
     &amp;Pahlavan &amp;Rida--God's mercy and blessings and splendors 
be upon him; praise and salutations be unto him-- 
was a man to outward seeming untutored, devoid of learning.  
He was a tradesman, and like the others who came 
in at the start, he cast everything away out of love for God, 
attaining in one leap the highest reaches of knowledge.  
He is of those from the earlier time.  So eloquent did he 
suddenly become that the people of &amp;Kashan were astounded.  
For example this man, to all appearances unschooled, 
betook himself to &amp;Haji &amp;Muhammad-Karim &amp;Khan 
in &amp;Kashan and propounded this question:  
 
+P168 
     "Sir, are you the Fourth Pillar?  I am a man who thirsts 
after spiritual truth and I yearn to know of the Fourth 
Pillar."+F1  
     Since a number of political and military leaders were 
present, the &amp;Haji replied:  "Perish the thought!  I shun all 
those who consider me the Fourth Pillar.  Never have I 
made such a claim.  Whoever says I have, speaks falsehood; 
may God's curse be on him!"  
     A few days later &amp;Pahlavan &amp;Rida again sought out the 
&amp;Haji and told him:  "Sir, I have just finished your book, 
&amp;Irshadu'l-'Avam (Guidance unto the Ignorant); I have 
read it from cover to cover; in it you say that one is obligated 
to know the Fourth Pillar or Fourth Support; indeed, 
you account him a fellow knight of the Lord of the Age.+F2  
Therefore I long to recognize and know him.  I am certain 
that you are informed of him.  Show him to me, I beg of 
you."  
     The &amp;Haji was wrathful.  He said:  "The Fourth Pillar is 
no figment.  He is a being plainly visible to all.  Like me, 
he has a turban on his head, he wears an &amp;aba, and carries 
a cane in his hand."  &amp;Pahlavan &amp;Rida smiled at him.  "Meaning 
no discourtesy," he said, "there is, then, a contradiction 
in Your Honor's teaching.  First you say one thing, 
then you say another."  
     Furious, the &amp;Haji replied:  "I am busy now.  Let us discuss 
this matter some other time.  Today I must ask to be 
excused."  
     The point is that &amp;Rida, a man considered to be unlettered, 
was able, in an argument, to best such an erudite 
 
+F1 In &amp;Shaykhi terminology, the Fourth Support or Fourth Pillar was 
+F1 the perfect man or channel of grace, always to be sought.  &amp;Haji 
+F1 &amp;Muhammad-Karim &amp;Khan regarded himself as such.  Cf. &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
+F1 &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan (The Book of Certitude), p. 184, and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, A 
+F1 Traveller's Narrative, p. 4.  
+F2 The promised Twelfth &amp;Imam.  
 
+P169 
"Fourth Pillar."  In the phrase of &amp;Allamiy-i-Hilli, he 
downed him with the Fourth Support.+F3  
     Whenever that lionhearted champion of knowledge began 
to speak, his listeners marveled; and he remained, till 
his last breath, the protector and helper of all seekers after 
truth.  Ultimately he became known far and wide as a 
&amp;Baha'i, was turned into a vagrant, and ascended to the 
&amp;Abha Kingdom.  
     As for his two brothers:  through the grace of the Blessed 
Beauty, after they were taken captive by the tyrants, they 
were shut in the Most Great Prison, where they shared the 
lot of these homeless wanderers.  Here, during the early 
days at &amp;Akka, with complete detachment, with ardent 
love, they hastened away to the all-glorious Realm.  For our 
ruthless oppressors, as soon as we arrived, imprisoned all of 
us inside the fortress in the soldiers' barracks, and they 
closed up every issue, so that none could come and go.  At 
that time the air of &amp;Akka was poisonous, and every 
stranger, immediately following his arrival, would be taken 
ill.  &amp;Muhammad-Baqir and &amp;Muhammad-Isma'il came down 
with a violent ailment and there was neither doctor nor 
medicine to be had; and those two embodied lights died 
on the same night, wrapped in each other's arms.  They 
rose up to the undying Kingdom, leaving the friends to 
mourn them forever.  There was none there but wept that 
night.  
     When morning came we wished to carry their sanctified 
bodies away.  The oppressors told us:  "You are forbidden 
to go out of the fortress.  You must hand over these two 
corpses to us.  We will wash them, shroud them and bury 
them.  But first you must pay for it."  It happened that we 
had no money.  There was a prayer carpet which had been 
 
+F3 &amp;Allamiy-i-Hilli, "the Very Erudite Doctor," title of the famed 
+F3 &amp;Shi'ih theologian, &amp;Jamalu'd-Din &amp;Hasan &amp;ibn-i-Yusuf &amp;ibn-i-'Ali of Hilla 
+F3 (1250-1325 A.D.).  
 
+P170 
placed under the feet of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He took up this carpet 
and said, "Sell it.  Give the money to the guards."  The 
prayer carpet was sold for 170 piasters+F4 and that sum was 
handed over.  But the two were never washed for their 
burial nor wrapped in their winding sheets; the guards 
only dug a hole in the ground and thrust them in, as they 
were, in the clothes they had on; so that even now, their 
two graves are one, and just as their souls are joined in the 
&amp;Abha Realm, their bodies are together here, under the 
earth, each holding the other in his close embrace.  
     The Blessed Beauty showered His blessings on these 
two brothers.  In life, they were encompassed by His grace 
and favor; in death, they were memorialized in His Tablets.  
Their grave is in &amp;Akka.  Greetings be unto them, and 
praise.  The glory of the All-Glorious be upon them, and 
God's mercy, and His benediction.  
 

&amp;Abu'l-Qasim of &amp;Sultan-Abad 
 
     Another among the prisoners 
was &amp;Abu'l-Qasim of 
&amp;Sultan-Abad, the traveling companion of &amp;Aqa Faraj.  These 
two were unassuming, loyal and staunch.  Once their souls 
had come alive through the breathings of the Faithful 
Spirit they hastened out of Persia to Adrianople, for such 
 
+F4 The Turkish &amp;ghurush or piaster of the time was forty paras, the 
+F4 para one-ninth of a cent.  These figures are approximate only.  
 
+P171 
was the unabating cruelty of the malevolent that they 
could no longer remain in their own home.  On foot, free 
of every tie, they took to the plains and hills, seeking their 
way across trackless waters and desert sands.  How many 
a night they could not sleep, staying in the open with no 
place to lay their heads; with nothing to eat or drink, no 
bed but the bare earth, no food but the desert grasses.  
Somehow they dragged themselves along and managed to 
reach Adrianople.  It happened that they came during the 
last days in that city, and were taken prisoner with the 
rest, and in the company of &amp;Baha'u'llah they traveled to 
the Most Great Prison.  
     &amp;Abu'l-Qasim fell violently ill with typhus.  He died 
about the same time as those two brothers, &amp;Muhammad-Baqir 
and &amp;Muhammad-Isma'il, and his pure remains were 
buried outside &amp;Akka.  The Blessed Beauty expressed approval 
of him and the friends, all of them, wept over his 
afflictions and mourned him.  Upon him be the glory of the 
All-Glorious.  
 

&amp;Aqa Faraj 
 
     In all these straits, &amp;Aqa 
Faraj was the companion of 
&amp;Abu'l-Qasim.  When, in Persian &amp;Iraq, he first heard the 
uproar caused by the Advent of the Most Great Light, he 
shook and trembled, clapped his hands, cried out in exultation 
 
+P172 
and hastened off to &amp;Iraq.  Overcome with delight, he 
entered the presence of his holy Lord.  He was gathered 
into the loving fellowship, and blissfully received the honor 
of attending upon &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Then he returned, bearing 
glad tidings to &amp;Sultan-Abad.  
     Here the malevolent were lying in wait, and disturbances 
broke out, with the result that the sainted &amp;Mulla-Bashi 
and some other believers who had none to defend 
them were struck down and put to death.  &amp;Aqa Faraj and 
&amp;Abu'l-Qasim, who had gone into hiding, then hurried 
away to Adrianople, to fall, ultimately, with the others 
and with their Well-Beloved, into the &amp;Akka prison.  
     &amp;Aqa Faraj then won the honor of waiting upon the Ancient 
Beauty.  He served the Holy Threshold at all times 
and was a comfort to the friends.  During the days of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
he was His loyal servitor, and a close companion to 
the believers, and so it was after &amp;Baha'u'llah's departure:  
he remained true to the Covenant, and in the domain of 
servitude he stood like a towering palm; a noble, superior 
man, patient in dire adversity, content under all conditions.  
     Strong in faith, in devotion, he left this life and set his 
face toward the Kingdom of God, to become the object 
of endless grace.  Upon him be God's mercy and good 
pleasure, in His Paradise.  Greetings be unto him, and 
praise, in the meadows of Heaven.  
 
+P173 
The Consort of the King of Martyrs 
 
     Among the women who 
came out of their homeland 
was the sorrowing &amp;Fatimih+F1 Begum, widow of the 
King of Martyrs.  She was a holy leaf of the Tree of God.  
From her earliest youth she was beset with uncounted ordeals.  
First was the disaster which overtook her noble 
father in the environs of &amp;Badasht, when, after terrible suffering, 
he died in a desert caravanserai, died hard--helpless 
and far from home.  
     The child was left an orphan, and in distress, until, by 
God's grace, she became the wife of the King of Martyrs.  
But since he was known everywhere as a &amp;Baha'i, was an 
impassioned lover of &amp;Baha'u'llah, a man distracted, carried 
away, and since &amp;Nasiri'd-Din &amp;Shah thirsted for blood 
--the hostile lurked in their ambush, and every day they 
informed against him and slandered him afresh, started 
a new outcry and set new mischief afoot.  For this reason 
his family was never sure of his safety for a single day, but 
lived from moment to moment in anguish, foreseeing and 
dreading the hour of his martyrdom.  Here was the family, 
everywhere known as &amp;Baha'is; their enemies, stony-hearted 
tyrants; their government inflexibly, permanently against 
them; their reigning Sovereign rabid for blood.  
 
+F1 Accent the first syllable:  &amp;FA-teh-meh 
 
+P174 
     It is obvious how life would be for such a household.  
Every day there was a new incident, more turmoil, another 
uproar, and they could not draw a breath in peace.  Then, 
he was martyred.  The Government proved brutal and savage 
to such a degree that the human race cried out and 
trembled.  All his possessions were stripped away and plundered, 
and his family lacked even their daily bread.  
     &amp;Fatimih spent her nights in weeping; till dawn broke, 
her only companions were tears.  Whenever she gazed on 
her children, she would sigh, wearing away like a candle 
in devouring grief.  But then she would thank God, and 
she would say:  "Praised be the Lord, these agonies, these 
broken fortunes are on &amp;Baha'u'llah's account, for His dear 
sake."  She would call to mind the defenseless family of 
the martyred &amp;Husayn, and what calamities they were 
privileged to bear in the pathway of God.  And as she 
pondered those events, her heart would leap up, and she 
would cry, "Praise be to God!  We too have become companions 
of the Prophet's Household."+F2  
     Because the family was in such straits, &amp;Baha'u'llah directed 
them to come to the Most Great Prison so that, 
sheltered in these precincts of abounding grace, they might 
be compensated for all that had passed.  Here for a time 
she lived, joyful, thankful, and praising God.  And although 
the son of the King of Martyrs, &amp;Mirza &amp;Abdu'l-Husayn, 
died in the prison, still his mother, &amp;Fatimih, accepted 
this, resigned herself to the will of God, did not so 
much as sigh or cry out, and did not go into mourning.  
Not a word did she utter to bespeak her grief.  
     This handmaid of God was infinitely patient, dignified 
and reserved, and at all times thankful.  But then &amp;Baha'u'llah 
left the world, and this was the supreme affliction, the 
 
+F2 Gibbon writes of the &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn's martyrdom and the fate of 
+F2 his Household, that "in a distant age and climate the tragic scene ... 
+F2 will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader."  
 
+P175 
ultimate anguish, and she could endure no more.  The 
shock and alarm were such that like a fish taken from the 
water she writhed on the ground, trembled and shook as 
if her whole being quaked, until at last she took leave of 
her children and she died.  She rose up into the shadowing 
mercy of God and was plunged in an ocean of light.  Unto 
her be salutations and praise, compassion and glory.  May 
God make sweet her resting-place with the outpourings of 
His heavenly mercy; in the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree+F3 
may He honor her dwelling.  
 

                    He is God!+F4  
 
     Thou seest, O my Lord, the assemblage of Thy loved 
ones, the company of Thy friends, gathered by the precincts 
of Thine all-sufficing Shrine, and in the neighborhood 
of Thine exalted garden, on a day among the days of 
Thy &amp;Ridvan Feast--that blessed time when Thou didst 
dawn upon the world, shedding thereon the lights of Thy 
holiness, spreading abroad the bright rays of Thy oneness, 
and didst issue forth from &amp;Baghdad, with a majesty and 
might that encompassed all mankind; with a glory that 
made all to fall prostrate before Thee, all heads to bow, 
every neck to bend low, and the gaze of every man to be 
cast down.  They are calling Thee to mind and making 
mention of Thee, their breasts gladdened with the lights 
of Thy bestowals, their souls restored by the evidences of 
Thy gifts, speaking Thy praise, turning their faces toward 
 
+F3 The &amp;Sadratu'l-Muntaha, translated inter alia as the Sidrah Tree 
+F3 which marks the boundary, and the Lote-Tree of the extremity.  Cf. 
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 53:14.  It is said to stand at the loftiest point in Paradise, and 
+F3 to mark the place beyond which neither men nor angels can pass.  In 
+F3 &amp;Baha'i terminology it refers to the Manifestation of God.  
+F4 This prayer was revealed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha for the Consort of the King of 
+F4 Martyrs.  
 
+P176 
Thy Kingdom, humbly supplicating Thy lofty Realms.  
     They are gathered here to commemorate Thy bright 
and holy handmaid, a leaf of Thy green Tree of Heaven, 
a luminous reality, a spiritual essence, who ever implores 
Thy tender compassion.  She was born into the arms of 
Divine wisdom, and she suckled at the breast of certitude; 
she flourished in the cradle of faith and rejoiced in the 
bosom of Thy love, O merciful, O compassionate Lord!  
And she grew to womanhood in a house from which the 
sweet savors of oneness were spread abroad.  But while she 
was yet a girl, distress came upon her in Thy path, and 
misfortune assailed her, O Thou the Bestower, and in her 
defenseless youth she drank from the cups of sorrow and 
pain, out of love for Thy beauty, O Thou the Forgiver!  
     Thou knowest, O my God, the calamities she joyfully 
bore in Thy pathway, the trials she confronted in Thy 
love, with a face that radiated delight.  How many a night, 
as others lay on their beds in soft repose, was she wakeful, 
humbly entreating Thy heavenly Realm.  How many a day 
did Thy people spend, safe in the citadel of Thy sheltering 
care, while her heart was harried from what had come 
upon Thy holy ones.  
     O my Lord, her days and her years passed by, and whenever 
she saw the morning light she wept over the sorrows 
of Thy servants, and when the evening shadows fell she 
cried and called out and burned in a fiery anguish for 
what had befallen Thy bondsmen.  And she arose with all 
her strength to serve Thee, to beseech the Heaven of Thy 
mercy, and in lowliness to entreat Thee and to rest her 
heart upon Thee.  And she came forth veiled in holiness, 
her garments unspotted by the nature of Thy people, and 
she entered into wedlock with Thy servant on whom 
Thou didst confer Thy richest gifts, and in whom Thou 
didst reveal the ensigns of Thine endless mercy, and whose 
face, in Thine all-glorious Realm, Thou didst make to
 
+P177  
shine with everlasting light.  She married him whom Thou 
didst lodge in the assemblage of reunion, one with the 
Company on high; him whom Thou didst cause to eat of 
all heavenly foods, him on whom Thou didst shower Thy 
blessings, on whom Thou didst bestow the title:  Martyrs' 
King.  
     And she dwelt for some years under the protection of 
that manifest Light; and with all her soul she served at 
Thy Threshold, holy and luminous; preparing foods and 
a place of rest and couches for all Thy loved ones that 
came, and she had no other joy but this.  Lowly and humble 
she was before each of Thy handmaids, deferring to 
each, serving each one with her heart and soul and her 
whole being, out of love for Thy beauty, and seeking to 
win Thy good pleasure.  Until her house became known 
by Thy name, and the fame of her husband was noised 
abroad, as one belonging to Thee, and the Land of &amp;Sad 
(&amp;Isfahan) shook and exulted for joy, because of continual 
blessings from this mighty champion of Thine; and the 
scented herbage of Thy knowledge and the roses of Thy 
bounty began to burgeon out, and a great multitude was led 
to the waters of Thy mercy.  
     Then the ignoble and the ignorant amongst Thy 
creatures rose against him, and with tyranny and malice 
they pronounced his death; and void of justice, with harsh 
oppression, they shed his immaculate blood.  Under the 
glittering sword that noble personage cried out to Thee:  
"Praised be Thou, O my God, that on the Promised Day, 
Thou hast helped me to attain this manifest grace; that 
Thou hast reddened the dust with my blood, spilled out 
upon Thy path, so that it puts forth crimson flowers.  Favor 
and grace are Thine, to grant me this gift which in all 
the world I longed for most.  Thanks be unto Thee that 
Thou didst succor me and confirm me and didst give me 
to drink of this cup that was tempered at the camphor
 
+P178  
fountain+F5--on the Day of Manifestation, at the hands of 
the cupbearer of martyrdom, in the assemblage of delights.  
Thou art verily the One full of grace, the Generous, the 
Bestower."  
     And after they had killed him they invaded his princely 
house.  They attacked like preying wolves, like lions at the 
hunt, and they sacked and plundered and pillaged, seizing 
the rich furnishings, the ornaments and the jewels.  She 
was in dire peril then, left with the fragments of her 
broken heart.  This violent assault took place when the 
news of his martyrdom was spread abroad, and the children 
cried out as panic struck at their hearts; they wailed 
and shed tears, and sounds of mourning rose from out of 
that splendid home, but there was none to weep over 
them, there was none to pity them.  Rather was the night 
of tyranny made to deepen about them, and the fiery Hell 
of injustice blazed out hotter than before; nor was there 
any torment but the evil doers brought it to bear, nor any 
agony but they inflicted it.  And this holy leaf remained, 
she and her brood, in the grip of their oppressors, facing 
the malice of the unmindful, with none to be their shield.  
     And the days passed by when tears were her only companions, 
and her comrades were cries; when she was 
mated to anguish, and had nothing but grief for a friend.  
And yet in these sufferings, O my Lord, she did not cease 
to love Thee; she did not fail Thee, O my Beloved, in 
these fiery ordeals.  Though disasters followed one upon 
another, though tribulations compassed her about, she bore 
them all, she patiently endured them all, to her they were 
Thy gifts and favors, and in all her massive agony--O 
Thou, Lord of most beauteous names--Thy praise was on 
her lips.  
     Then she gave up her homeland, rest, refuge and shelter, 
 
+F5 &amp;Qur'an 76:5.  
 
+P179 
and taking her young, like the birds she winged her 
way to this bright and holy Land--that here she might 
nest and sing Thy praise as the birds do, and busy herself 
in Thy love with all her powers, and serve Thee with all 
her being, all her soul and heart.  She was lowly before every 
handmaid of Thine, humble before every leaf of the 
garden of Thy Cause, occupied with Thy remembrance, 
severed from all except Thyself.  
     And her cries were lifted up at dawntide, and the sweet 
accents of her chanting would be heard in the night season 
and at the bright noonday, until she returned unto 
Thee, and winged her way to Thy Kingdom; went seeking 
the shelter of Thy Threshold and soared upward to Thine 
everlasting sky.  O my Lord, reward her with the contemplation 
of Thy beauty, feed her at the table of Thine eternity, 
give her a home in Thy neighborhood, sustain her 
in the gardens of Thy holiness as Thou willest and pleasest; 
bless Thou her lodging, keep her safe in the shade of 
Thy heavenly Tree; lead her, O Lord, into the pavilions 
of Thy godhood, make her to be one of Thy signs, one 
of Thy lights.  
     Verily Thou art the Generous, the Bestower, the Forgiver, 
the All-Merciful.  
 
+P180 
&amp;Shamsu'd-Duha 
 
     &amp;Khurshid Begum, who was 
given the title of &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha,+F1 
the Morning Sun, was mother-in-law to the King 
of Martyrs.  This eloquent, ardent handmaid of God was 
the cousin on her father's side of the famous &amp;Muhammad-Baqir 
of &amp;Isfahan, widely celebrated as chief of the &amp;ulamas 
in that city.  When still a child she lost both her parents, 
and was reared by her grandmother in the home of that 
famed and learned mujtahid, and well trained in various 
branches of knowledge, in theology, sciences and the arts.  
     Once she was grown, she was married to &amp;Mirza &amp;Hadiy-i-Nahri; 
and since she and her husband were both strongly 
attracted to the mystical teachings of that great luminary, 
the excellent and distinguished Siyyid &amp;Kazim-i-Rashti,+F2 
they left for &amp;Karbila, accompanied by &amp;Mirza &amp;Hadi's 
brother, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Nahri.+F3  Here they used 
to attend the Siyyid's classes, imbibing his knowledge, so 
that this handmaid became thoroughly informed on subjects 
relating to Divinity, on the Scriptures and on their 
 
+F1 Pronounced &amp;Shams-oz-Zoha.  
+F2 A forerunner of the &amp;Bab, and co-founder of the &amp;Shaykhi School.  
+F2 See glossary.  
+F3 His daughter, at a later date, became the consort of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
+F3 Cf. God Passes By, p. 130, and The Dawn-Breakers, p. 461.  
 
+P181
inner meanings.  The couple had two children, a girl and 
a boy.  They called their son Siyyid &amp;Ali and their daughter 
&amp;Fatimih Begum, she being the one who, when she 
reached adolescence, was married to the King of Martyrs.  
     &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha was there in &amp;Karbila when the cry of the 
exalted Lord was raised in &amp;Shiraz, and she shouted back, 
"Yea, verily!"  As for her husband and his brother, they immediately 
set out for &amp;Shiraz; for both of them, when visiting 
the Shrine of &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, had looked upon the 
beauty of the Primal Point, the &amp;Bab; both had been astonished 
at what they saw in that transplendent face, in 
those heavenly attributes and ways, and had agreed that 
One such as this must indeed be some very great being.  
Accordingly, the moment they learned of His Divine summons, 
they answered:  "Yea, verily!" and they burst into 
flame with yearning love for God.  Besides, they had been 
present every day in that holy place where the late Siyyid 
taught, and had clearly heard him say:  "The Advent is 
nigh, the affair most subtle, most elusive.  It behoves each 
one to search, to inquire, for it may be that the Promised 
One is even now present among men, even now visible, 
while all about Him are heedless, unmindful, with bandaged 
eyes, even as the sacred traditions have foretold."  
     When the two brothers arrived in Persia they heard 
that the &amp;Bab had gone to Mecca on a pilgrimage.  Siyyid 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali therefore left for &amp;Isfahan and &amp;Mirza &amp;Hadi 
returned to &amp;Karbila.  Meanwhile &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha had become 
friends with the "Leaf of Paradise," sister to 
&amp;Mulla Husayn, the &amp;Babu'l-Bab.+F4  Through that lady she 
had met &amp;Tahirih, &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn,+F5 and had begun to spend
 
+F4 "Gate of the Gate", a title of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the first to believe in 
+F4 the &amp;Bab.  For an account of his sister, cf. The Dawn-Breakers, p. 383, 
+F4 note.  
+F5 "Solace of the Eyes."  
 
+P182  
most of her time in close companionship with them both, 
occupied in teaching the Faith.  Since this was in the early 
days of the Cause, the people were not yet afraid of it.  
From being with &amp;Tahirih, &amp;Shams profited immeasurably, 
and was more on fire with the Faith than ever.  She spent 
three years in close association with &amp;Tahirih in &amp;Karbila.  
Day and night, she was stirred like the sea by the gales of 
the All-Merciful, and she taught with an eloquent tongue.  
     As &amp;Tahirih became celebrated throughout &amp;Karbila, and 
the Cause of His Supreme Holiness, the &amp;Bab, spread all 
over Persia, the latter-day &amp;ulamas arose to deny, to heap 
scorn upon, and to destroy it.  They issued a &amp;fatva or judgment 
that called for a general massacre.  &amp;Tahirih was one 
of those designated by the evil &amp;ulamas of the city as an 
unbeliever, and they mistakenly thought her to be in the 
home of &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha.  They broke into &amp;Shams's house, 
hemmed her in, abused and vilified her, and inflicted 
grievous bodily harm.  They dragged her out of the house 
and through the streets to the &amp;bazar; they beat her with 
clubs; they stoned her, they denounced her in foul language, 
repeatedly assaulting her.  While this was going on, 
&amp;Haji Siyyid &amp;Mihdi, the father of her distinguished husband, 
reached the scene.  "This woman is not &amp;Tahirih!" he 
shouted at them.  But he had no witness to prove it,+F6 and 
the &amp;farrashes, the police and the mob would not let up.  
Then, through the uproar, a voice screamed out:  "They 
have arrested &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn!"  At this, the people abandoned 
&amp;Shamsu'd-Duha.  
     Guards were placed at the door of &amp;Tahirih's house and 
no one was allowed to enter or leave, while the authorities 
waited for instructions from &amp;Baghdad and Constantinople.  
As the interval of waiting lengthened out, &amp;Tahirih asked 
for permission to leave for &amp;Baghdad.  "Let us go there ourselves," 
 
+F6 Persian women of the day went heavily veiled in public.  
 
+P183 
she told them.  "We are resigned to everything.  
Whatever happens to us is the best that can happen, and 
the most pleasing."  With government permission, &amp;Tahirih, 
the Leaf of Paradise, her mother and &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha 
all left &amp;Karbila and traveled to &amp;Baghdad, but the 
snake-like mass of the populace followed them for some 
distance, stoning them from a little way off.  
     When they reached &amp;Baghdad they went to live at the 
house of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad-i-Shibl, the father of &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa; 
and since many crowded the doors there 
was an uproar throughout that quarter, so that &amp;Tahirih 
transferred her residence elsewhere, to a lodging of her 
own, where she continually taught the Faith, and proclaimed 
the Word of God.  Here the &amp;ulamas, &amp;shaykhs and 
others would come to listen to her, asking their questions 
and receiving her replies, and she was soon remarkably 
well known throughout &amp;Baghdad, expounding as she 
would the most recondite and subtle of theological themes.  
     When word of this reached the government authorities, 
they conveyed &amp;Tahirih, &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha and the Leaf 
to the house of the &amp;Mufti, and here they remained 
three months until word as to their case was received from 
Constantinople.  During &amp;Tahirih's stay at the &amp;Mufti's, 
much of the time was spent in conversations with him, in 
producing convincing proofs as to the Teachings, analyzing 
and expounding questions relative to the Lord God, 
discoursing on the Resurrection Day, on the Balance and 
the Reckoning,+F7 unraveling the complexities of inner 
truths.  
     One day the &amp;Mufti's father came in and belabored them 
violently and at length.  This somewhat discomfited the 
&amp;Mufti and he began to apologize for his father.  Then he 
said:  "Your answer has arrived from Constantinople.  The 
 
+F7 &amp;Qur'an 7:7; 14:42; 21:48; 57:25, etc.  
 
+P184  
Sovereign has set you free, but on condition that you quit 
his realms."  The next morning they left the &amp;Mufti's house 
and proceeded to the public baths.  Meanwhile &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Muhammad-i-Shibl and &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan-i-'Arab made the 
necessary preparations for their journey, and when three 
days had passed, they left &amp;Baghdad; that is, &amp;Tahirih, 
&amp;Shamsu'd-Duha, the Leaf of Paradise, the mother of 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Hadi, and a number of Siyyids from Yazd set out 
for Persia.  Their travel expenses were all provided by 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad.  
     They arrived at &amp;Kirmanshah, where the women took up 
residence in one house, the men in another.  The work of 
teaching went on at all times, and as soon as the &amp;ulamas 
became aware of it they ordered that the party be expelled.  
At this the district head, with a crowd of people, broke into 
the house and carried off their belongings; then they seated 
the travelers in open howdahs and drove them from the 
city.  When they came to a field, the muleteers set them 
down on the bare ground and left, taking animals and 
howdahs away, leaving them without food or luggage, and 
with no roof over their heads.  
     &amp;Tahirih thereupon wrote a letter to the Governor of 
&amp;Kirmanshah.  "We were travelers," she wrote, "guests in 
your city.  `Honor thy guest,' the Prophet says, `though he 
be an unbeliever.'  Is it right that a guest should be thus 
scorned and despoiled?"  The Governor ordered that the 
stolen goods be restored, and that all be returned to the 
owners.  Accordingly the muleteers came back as well, 
seated the travelers in the howdahs again, and they went 
on to &amp;Hamadan.  The ladies of &amp;Hamadan, even the princesses, 
came every day to meet with &amp;Tahirih, who remained 
in that city two months.+F8  There she dismissed some of her 
 
+F8 Cf. &amp;Nabil, The Dawn-Breakers, chapter XV.  
 
+P185 
traveling companions, so that they could return to &amp;Baghdad; 
others, however, accompanied her to &amp;Qazvin.  
     As they journeyed, some horsemen, kinsfolk of &amp;Tahirih's, 
that is, her brothers, approached.  "We have come," 
they said, "at our father's command, to lead her away, 
alone."  But &amp;Tahirih refused, and accordingly the whole 
party remained together until they arrived in &amp;Qazvin.  
Here, &amp;Tahirih went to her father's house and the friends, 
those who had ridden and those who had traveled on foot, 
put up at a caravanserai.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Hadi, the husband of 
&amp;Shamsu'd-Duha, had gone to &amp;Mah-Ku, seeking out the &amp;Bab.  
On his return, he awaited the arrival of &amp;Shams in &amp;Qazvin, 
after which the couple left for &amp;Isfahan, and when they 
reached there, &amp;Mirza &amp;Hadi journeyed on to &amp;Badasht.  In 
that hamlet and its vicinity he was attacked, tormented, 
even stoned, and was subjected to such ordeals that finally, 
in a ruined caravanserai, he died.  His brother, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, 
buried him there, along the roadside.  
     &amp;Shams-i-Duha remained in &amp;Isfahan.  She spent her days 
and nights in the remembrance of God and in teaching 
His Cause to the women of that city.  She was gifted with 
an eloquent tongue; her utterance was wonderful to hear.  
She was highly honored by the leading women of &amp;Isfahan, 
celebrated for piety, for godliness, and the purity of her 
life.  She was chastity embodied; all her hours were spent 
in reciting Holy Writ, or expounding the Texts, or unraveling 
the most complex of spiritual themes, or spreading 
abroad the sweet savors of God.  
     It was for these reasons that the King of Martyrs married 
her respected daughter and became her son-in-law.  
And when &amp;Shams went to live in his princely house, day 
and night the people thronged its doors, for the leading 
women of the city, whether friends or strangers, whether 
close to her or not, would come and go.  For she was a fire 
lit by the love of God, and she proclaimed the Word of 
 
+P186 
God with great ardor and verve, so that she became known 
among the non-believers as &amp;Fatimih, the &amp;Baha'is' Lady of 
Light.+F9  
     And so time passed, until the day when the "She-Serpent" 
and the "Wolf" conspired together and issued a 
decree, a &amp;fatva, that sentenced the King of Martyrs to 
death.  They plotted as well with the Governor of the city 
so that among them they could sack and plunder and carry 
off all that vast treasure he possessed.  Then the &amp;Shah 
joined forces with those two wild animals; and he commanded 
that the blood of both brothers, the King of Martyrs 
and the Beloved of Martyrs, be spilled out.  Without 
warning, those ruthless men:  the She-Serpent, the Wolf, 
and their brutal &amp;farrashes and constabulary--attacked; 
they chained the two brothers and led them off to prison, 
looted their richly furnished houses, wrested away all their 
possessions, and spared no one, not even infants at the 
breast.  They tortured, cursed, reviled, mocked, beat the 
kin and others of the victims' household, and would not 
stay their hands.  
     In Paris, &amp;Zillu's-Sultan+F10 related the following, swearing 
to the truth of it upon his oath:  "Many and many a time 
I warned those two great scions of the Prophet's House, 
but all to no avail.  At the last I summoned them one night, 
and with extreme urgency I told them in so many words:  
`Gentlemen, the &amp;Shah has three times condemned you to 
death.  His &amp;farmans keep on coming.  The decree is absolute 
and there is only one course open to you now:  you 
must, in the presence of the &amp;ulamas, clear yourselves and 
curse your Faith.'  Their answer was:  `&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!  
 
+F9 The reference is to &amp;Muhammad's daughter, &amp;Fatimih, "the bright 
+F9 and fair of face, the Lady of Light."  
+F10 Eldest son of the &amp;Shah and ruler over more than two-fifths of the 
+F10 kingdom.  He ratified the death sentence.  Soon after these events, he 
+F10 fell into disgrace.  Cf. God Passes By, p. 200; 232.  
 
+P187 
O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious!  May our lives be offered 
up!'  Finally I agreed to their not cursing their Faith.  
I told them all they had to say was, `We are not &amp;Baha'is.'  
`Just those few words,' I said, `will be enough; then I can 
write out my report for the &amp;Shah, and you will be saved.'  
`That is impossible,' they answered, `because we are 
&amp;Baha'is.  O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious, our hearts 
hunger for martyrdom!  &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!'  I was enraged, 
then, and I tried, by being harsh with them, to force them 
to renounce their Faith, but it was hopeless.  The decree 
of the rapacious She-Serpent and Wolf, and the &amp;Shah's 
commands, were carried out."  
     After those two were martyred, &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha was 
hunted down, and had to seek a refuge in her brother's 
house.  Although he was not a believer, he was known in 
&amp;Isfahan as an upright, pious and godly man, a man of 
learning, an ascetic who, hermit-like, kept to himself, and 
for these reasons he was highly regarded and trusted by 
all.  She stayed there with him, but the Government did 
not abandon its search, finally discovered her whereabouts 
and summoned her to appear; the evil &amp;ulamas had a hand 
in this, joining forces with the civil authorities.  Her 
brother was therefore obliged to accompany &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha 
to the Governor's house.  He remained without, while they 
sent his sister into the women's apartments; the Governor 
came there, to the door, and he kicked and trampled her so 
savagely that she fainted away.  Then the Governor shouted 
to his wife:  "Princess!  Princess!  Come here and take a look 
at the &amp;Baha'is' Lady of Light!"  
     The women lifted her up and put her in one of the 
rooms.  Meanwhile her brother, dumbfounded, was waiting 
outside the mansion.  Finally, trying to plead with him, 
he said to the Governor:  "This sister of mine has been 
beaten so severely that she is at the point of death.  What 
is the use of keeping her here?  There is no hope for her
 
+P188  
now.  With your permission I can get her back to my 
house.  It would be better to have her die there, rather than 
here, for after all, she is a descendant of the Prophet, she 
is of &amp;Muhammad's noble line, and she has done no wrong.  
There is nothing against her except her kinship to the son-in-law."  
The Governor answered:  "She is one of the great 
leaders and heroines of the &amp;Baha'is.  She will simply cause 
another uproar."  The brother said:  "I promise you that 
she will not utter a word.  It is certain that within a few 
days she will not even be alive.  Her body is frail, weak, 
almost lifeless, and she has suffered terrible harm."  
     Since the brother was greatly respected and trusted by 
high and low alike, the Governor released &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha 
in his custody, letting her go.  She lived for a while in his 
house, crying out, grieving, shedding her tears, mourning 
her dead.  Neither was the brother at peace, nor would the 
hostile leave them alone; there was some new turmoil 
every day, and public clamor.  The brother finally thought 
it best to take &amp;Shams away on a pilgrimage to &amp;Mashhad, 
hoping that the fire of civil disturbances would die down.  
     They went to &amp;Mashhad and settled in a vacant house 
near the Shrine of the &amp;Imam &amp;Rida.+F11  
     Because he was such a pious man the brother would 
leave every morning to visit the Shrine, and there he 
would stay, busy with his devotions until almost noon.  In 
the afternoon as well, he would hasten away to the Holy 
Place, and pray until evening.  The house being empty, 
&amp;Shamsu'd-Duha managed to get in touch with various 
women believers and began to associate with them; and 
because the love of God burned so brightly in her heart 
 
+F11 The eighth &amp;Imam, poisoned by order of the Caliph &amp;Ma'mum, A.H. 
+F11 203, after the &amp;Imam had been officially designated as the Caliph's heir 
+F11 apparent.  His shrine, with its golden dome, has been called the glory 
+F11 of the &amp;Shi'ih world.  "A part of My body is to be buried in &amp;Khurasan", 
+F11 the Prophet traditionally said.  
 
+P189 
she was unable to keep silent, so that during those hours 
when her brother was absent the place came alive.  The 
&amp;Baha'i women would flock there and absorb her lucid and 
eloquent speech.  
     In those days life in &amp;Mashhad was hard for the believers, 
with the malevolent always on the alert; if they so 
much as suspected an individual, they murdered him.  
There was no security of any kind, no peace.  But &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha 
could not help herself:  in spite of all the terrible 
ordeals she had endured, she ignored the danger, and was 
capable of flinging herself into flames, or into the sea.  
Since her brother frequented no one, he knew nothing of 
what was going on.  Day and night he would only leave 
the house for the Shrine, the Shrine for the house; he was 
a recluse, had no friends, and would not so much as speak 
to another person.  Nevertheless there came a day when 
he saw that trouble had broken out in the city, and he 
knew it would end in serious harm.  He was a man so calm 
and silent that he did not reproach his sister; he simply 
took her away from &amp;Mashhad without warning, and they 
returned to &amp;Isfahan.  Here, he sent her to her daughter, the 
widow of the King of Martyrs, for he would no longer 
shelter her under his roof.  
     &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha was thus back in &amp;Isfahan, boldly teaching 
the Faith and spreading abroad the sweet savors of God.  
So vehement was the fiery love in her heart that it compelled 
her to speak out, whenever she found a listening 
ear.  And when it was observed that once again the household 
of the King of Martyrs was about to be overtaken by 
calamities, and that they were enduring severe afflictions 
there in &amp;Isfahan, &amp;Baha'u'llah desired them to come to the 
Most Great Prison.  &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha, with the widow of the 
King of Martyrs and the children, arrived in the Holy 
Land.  Here they were joyously spending their days when 
the son of the King of Martyrs, &amp;Mirza &amp;Abdu'l-Husayn, 
 
+P190 
as a result of the awful suffering he had been subjected to 
in &amp;Isfahan, came down with tuberculosis and died in 
&amp;Akka.  
     &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha was heavy of heart.  She mourned his absence, 
she wasted away with longing for him, and it was 
all much harder because then the Supreme Affliction came 
upon us, the crowning anguish.  The basis of her life was 
undermined; candle-like, she was consumed with grieving.  
She grew so feeble that she took to her bed, unable to 
move.  Still, she did not rest, nor keep silent for a moment.  
She would tell of days long gone, of things that had come 
to pass in the Cause, or she would recite from Holy Writ, 
or she would supplicate, and chant her prayers--until, out 
of the Most Great Prison, she soared away to the world of 
God.  She hastened away from this dust gulf of perdition 
to an unsullied country; packed her gear and journeyed to 
the land of lights.  Unto her be salutations and praise, and 
most great mercy, sheltered in the compassion of her omnipotent 
Lord.  
 
+P191
&amp;Tahirih 
 
     A woman chaste and holy, 
a sign and token of surpassing 
beauty, a burning brand of the love of God, a lamp 
of His bestowal, was &amp;Jinab-i-Tahirih.+F1  She was called 
&amp;Umm-Salma; she was the daughter of &amp;Haji &amp;Mulla &amp;Salih, a 
mujtahid of &amp;Qazvin, and her paternal uncle was &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Taqi, the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih or leader of prayers in the cathedral 
mosque of that city.  They married her to &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad, 
the son of &amp;Mulla &amp;Taqi, and she gave birth to three 
children, two sons and a daughter; all three were bereft of 
the grace that encompassed their mother, and all failed to 
recognize the truth of the Cause.  
     When she was still a child her father selected a teacher 
for her and she studied various branches of knowledge 
and the arts, achieving remarkable ability in literary pursuits.  
Such was the degree of her scholarship and attainments 
that her father would often express his regret, saying, 
"Would that she had been a boy, for he would have 
shed illumination upon my household, and would have 
succeeded me!"+F2  
 
+F1 Pronounced &amp;TA-heh-reh.  
+F2 Cf. The Dawn-Breakers, p. 81, note 2, and p. 285, note 2.  Certain 
+F2 lines, there translated by Shoghi Effendi, are incorporated here.  
 
+P192 
     One day she was a guest in the home of &amp;Mulla &amp;Javad, 
a cousin on her mother's side, and there in her cousin's 
library she came upon some of the writings of &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i.+F3  Delighted with what he had to say, &amp;Tahirih 
asked to borrow the writings and take them home.  
&amp;Mulla &amp;Javad violently objected, telling her:  "Your father 
is an enemy of the Twin Luminous Lights, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad 
and Siyyid &amp;Kazim.  If he should even dream that any 
words of those two great beings, any fragrance from the 
garden of those realities, had come your way, he would 
make an attempt against my life, and you too would become 
the target of his wrath."  &amp;Tahirih answered:  "For a 
long time now, I have thirsted after this; I have yearned 
for these explanations, these inner truths.  Give me whatever 
you have of these books.  Never mind if it angers my 
father."  Accordingly, &amp;Mulla &amp;Javad sent over the writings 
of the &amp;Shaykh and the Siyyid.  
     One night, &amp;Tahirih sought out her father in his library, 
and began to speak of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad's teachings.  The 
very moment he learned that his daughter knew of the 
&amp;Shaykhi doctrines, &amp;Mulla &amp;Salih's denunciations rang out, 
and he cried: "&amp;Javad has made you a lost soul!"  &amp;Tahirih 
answered, "The late &amp;Shaykh was a true scholar of God, 
and I have learned an infinity of spiritual truths from 
reading his books.  Furthermore, he bases whatever he says 
on the traditions of the Holy &amp;Imams.  You call yourself a 
mystic knower and a man of God, you consider your respected 
uncle to be a scholar as well, and most pious-- 
yet in neither of you do I find a trace of those qualities!"  
     For some time, she carried on heated discussions with 
her father, debating such questions as the Resurrection 
and the Day of Judgment, the Night-Ascent of &amp;Muhammad 
to Heaven, the Promise and the Threat, and the Advent 
 
+F3 A forerunner of the &amp;Bab, and first of the two founders of the 
+F3 &amp;Shaykhi School.  See glossary.  
 
+P193 
of the Promised One.+F4  Lacking arguments, her father 
would resort to curses and abuse.  Then one night, in 
support of her contention, &amp;Tahirih quoted a holy tradition 
from the &amp;Imam &amp;Ja'far-i-Sadiq;+F5 and since it confirmed what 
she was saying, her father burst out laughing, mocking 
the tradition.  &amp;Tahirih said, "Oh my father, these are the 
words of the Holy &amp;Imam.  How can you mock and deny 
them?"  
     From that time on, she ceased to debate and contend 
with her father.  Meanwhile she entered into secret correspondence 
with Siyyid &amp;Kazim, regarding the solution of 
complex theological problems, and thus it came about 
that the Siyyid conferred on her the name "Solace of the 
Eyes" (&amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn); as for the title &amp;Tahirih ("The 
Pure One"), it was first associated with her in &amp;Badasht, 
and was subsequently approved by the &amp;Bab, and recorded 
in Tablets.  
     &amp;Tahirih had caught fire.  She set out for &amp;Karbila, hoping 
to meet Siyyid &amp;Kazim, but she arrived too late:  ten days 
before she reached that city, he passed away.  Not long 
before his death the Siyyid had shared with his disciples 
the good news that the promised Advent was at hand.  
"Go forth," he repeatedly told them, "and seek out your 
Lord."  Thus the most distinguished of his followers gathered 
for retirement and prayer, for fasts and vigils, in the 
&amp;Masjid-i-Kufih, while some awaited the Advent in &amp;Karbila.  
Among these was &amp;Tahirih, fasting by day, practicing religious 
disciplines, and spending the night in vigils, and 
chanting prayers.  One night when it was getting along 
toward dawn she laid her head on her pillow, lost all 
awareness of this earthly life, and dreamed a dream; in her 
vision a youth, a Siyyid, wearing a black cloak and a green 
 
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 17:1; 30:56; 50:19; etc.  
+F5 The sixth &amp;Imam.  
 
+P194 
turban, appeared to her in the heavens; he was standing in 
the air, reciting verses and praying with his hands upraised.  
At once, she memorized one of those verses, and 
wrote it down in her notebook when she awoke.  After the 
&amp;Bab had declared His mission, and His first book, "The 
Best of Stories,"+F6 was circulated, &amp;Tahirih was reading a 
section of the text one day, and she came upon that same 
verse, which she had noted down from the dream.  Instantly 
offering thanks, she fell to her knees and bowed 
her forehead to the ground, convinced that the &amp;Bab's message 
was truth.  
     This good news reached her in &amp;Karbila and she at once 
began to teach.  She translated and expounded "The Best 
of Stories," also writing in Persian and Arabic, composing 
odes and lyrics, and humbly practicing her devotions, performing 
even those that were optional and supernumerary.  
When the evil &amp;ulamas in &amp;Karbila got wind of all this, and 
learned that a woman was summoning the people to a 
new religion and had already influenced a considerable 
number, they went to the Governor and lodged a complaint.  
Their charges, to be brief, led to violent attacks on 
&amp;Tahirih, and sufferings, which she accepted and for which 
she offered praise and thanks.  When the authorities came 
hunting for her they first assaulted &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha, mistaking 
her for &amp;Tahirih.  As soon, however, as they heard 
that &amp;Tahirih had been arrested they let &amp;Shams go--for 
&amp;Tahirih had sent a message to the Governor saying, "I am 
at your disposal.  Do not harm any other."  
     The Governor set guards over her house and shut her 
away, writing &amp;Baghdad for instructions as to how he 
should proceed.  For three months, she lived in a state of 
siege, completely isolated, with the guards surrounding her

+F6 Joseph, was called the &amp;Qur'an of the &amp;Babis, and was translated from

+P195 
house.  Since the local authorities had still received no reply 
from &amp;Baghdad, &amp;Tahirih referred her case to the Governor, 
saying:  "No word has come from either &amp;Baghdad or 
Constantinople.  Accordingly, we will ourselves proceed to 
&amp;Baghdad and await the answer there."  The Governor gave 
her leave to go, and she set out, accompanied by &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha 
and the Leaf of Paradise (the sister of &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Husayn) and her mother.  In &amp;Baghdad she stayed first in 
the house of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad, the distinguished father 
of &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa.  But so great was the 
press of people around her that she transferred her residence 
to another quarter, engaged night and day in spreading 
the Faith, and freely associated with the inhabitants of 
&amp;Baghdad.  She thus became celebrated throughout the city 
and there was a great uproar.  
     &amp;Tahirih also maintained a correspondence with the &amp;ulamas 
of &amp;Kazimayn; she presented them with unanswerable 
proofs, and when one or another appeared before her she 
offered him convincing arguments.  Finally she sent a message 
to the &amp;Shi'ih divines, saying to them:  "If you are not 
satisfied with these conclusive proofs, I challenge you to 
a trial by ordeal."+F7  Then there was a great outcry from the 
divines, and the Governor was obliged to send &amp;Tahirih and 
her women companions to the house of &amp;Ibn-i-Alusi, who 
was &amp;mufti of &amp;Baghdad.  Here she remained about three 
months, waiting for word and directions from Constantinople.  
&amp;Ibn-i-Alusi would engage her in learned dialogues, 
questions would be asked and answers given, and he 
would not deny what she had to say.  
     On a certain day the &amp;mufti related one of his dreams, 
and asked her to tell him what it meant.  He said:  "In my 
dream I saw the &amp;Shi'ih &amp;ulamas arriving at the holy tomb 
of &amp;Imam &amp;Husayn, the Prince of Martyrs.  They took away 
 
+F7 &amp;Qur'an 3:54:  "Then will we invoke and lay the malison of God on

+P196
the barrier that encloses the tomb, and they broke open 
the resplendent grave, so that the immaculate body lay 
revealed to their gaze.  They sought to take up the holy 
form, but I cast myself down on the corpse and I warded 
them off."  &amp;Tahirih answered:  "This is the meaning of 
your dream:  you are about to deliver me from the hands 
of the &amp;Shi'ih divines."  "I too had interpreted it thus," said 
&amp;Ibn-i-Alusi.  
     Since he had discovered that she was well versed in 
learned questions and in sacred commentaries and Texts, 
the two often carried on debates; she would speak on such 
themes as the Day of Resurrection, the Balance, and the 
&amp;Sirat,+F8 and he would not turn away.  
     Then came a night when the father of &amp;Ibn-i-Alusi called 
at the house of his son.  He had a meeting with &amp;Tahirih 
and abruptly, without asking a single question, began to 
curse, mock and revile her.  Embarrassed at his father's behavior, 
&amp;Ibn-i-Alusi apologized.  Then he said:  "The answer 
has come from Constantinople.  The King has commanded 
that you be set free, but only on condition that you leave 
his realms.  Go then, tomorrow, make your preparations for 
the journey, and hasten away from this land."  
     Accordingly &amp;Tahirih, with her women companions, left 
the &amp;mufti's house, saw to arranging for their travel gear, 
and went out of &amp;Baghdad.  When they left the city, a number 
of Arab believers, carrying arms, walked along beside 
their convoy.  Among the escort were &amp;Shaykh &amp;Sultan, 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad and his distinguished son &amp;Muhammad-Mustafa, 
and &amp;Shaykh &amp;Salih, and these were 
mounted.  It was &amp;Shaykh &amp;Muhammad who defrayed the 
expenses of the journey.  
     When they reached &amp;Kirmanshah the women alighted 
at one house, the men at another, and the inhabitants arrived

+P197 
in a continuous stream to seek information as to the 
new Faith.  Here as elsewhere the &amp;ulamas were soon in a 
state of frenzy and they commanded that the newcomers 
be expelled.  As a result the &amp;kad-khuda or chief officer of 
that quarter, with a band of people, laid siege to the house 
where &amp;Tahirih was, and sacked it.  Then they placed 
&amp;Tahirih and her companions in an uncovered howdah and 
carried them from the town to an open field, where they 
put the captives out.  The drivers then took their animals 
and returned to the city.  The victims were left on the bare 
ground, with no food, no shelter, and no means of traveling 
on.  
     &amp;Tahirih at once wrote a letter to the prince of that territory, 
in which she told him:  "O thou just Governor!  We 
were guests in your city.  Is this the way you treat your 
guests?"  When her letter was brought to the Governor of 
&amp;Kirmanshah he said:  "I knew nothing of this injustice.  
This mischief was kindled by the divines."  He immediately 
commanded the &amp;kad-khuda to return all the travelers' 
belongings.  That official duly surrendered the stolen 
goods, the drivers with their animals came back out of the 
city, the travelers took their places and resumed the journey.  
     They arrived in &amp;Hamadan and here their stay was a 
happy one.  The most illustrious ladies of that city, even 
the princesses, would come to visit, seeking the benefits of 
&amp;Tahirih's teaching.  In &amp;Hamadan she dismissed a part of 
her escort and sent them back to &amp;Baghdad, while she 
brought some of them, including &amp;Shamsu'd-Duha and 
&amp;Shaykh-Salih, along with her to &amp;Qazvin.  
     As they traveled, some riders advanced to meet them, 
kinsmen of &amp;Tahirih's from &amp;Qazvin, and they wished to 
lead her away alone, unescorted by the others, to her 
father's house.  &amp;Tahirih refused, saying:  "These are in my 
company."  In this way they entered &amp;Qazvin.  &amp;Tahirih proceeded 
 
+P198 
to her father's house, while the Arabs who had 
formed her escort alighted at a caravanserai.  &amp;Tahirih soon 
left her father and went to live with her brother, and 
there the great ladies of the city would come to visit her; 
all this until the murder of &amp;Mulla &amp;Taqi,+F9 when every &amp;Babi 
in &amp;Qazvin was taken prisoner.  Some were sent to &amp;Tihran 
and then returned to &amp;Qazvin and martyred.  
     &amp;Mulla &amp;Taqi's murder came about in this way:  One day, 
when that besotted tyrant had mounted his pulpit, he began 
to mock and revile the great &amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i.  
Shamelessly, grossly, screaming obscenities, he cried out:  
"That &amp;Shaykh is the one who has kindled this fire of evil, 
and subjected the whole world to this ordeal!"  There was 
an inquirer in the audience, a native of &amp;Shiraz.  He found 
the taunts, jeers and indecencies to be more than he could 
bear.  Under cover of darkness he betook himself to the 
mosque, plunged a spearhead between the lips of &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Taqi and fled.  The next morning they arrested the defenseless 
believers and thereupon subjected them to agonizing 
torture, though all were innocent and knew nothing 
of what had come to pass.  There was never any question 
of investigating the case; the believers repeatedly declared 
their innocence but no one paid them any heed.  When a 
few days had passed the killer gave himself up; he confessed 
to the authorities, informing them that he had 
committed the murder because &amp;Mulla &amp;Taqi had vilified 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad.  "I deliver myself into your hands," he 
told them, "so that you will set these innocent people free."  
They arrested him as well, put him in the stocks, chained 
him, and sent him in chains, along with the others, to 
&amp;Tihran.  
     Once there he observed that despite his confession, the 
 
+F9 Cf. The Dawn-Breakers, p. 276.  The murderer was not a &amp;Babi, 
+F9 but a fervent admirer of the &amp;Shaykhi leaders, the Twin Luminous 
+F9 Lights.  
 
+P199 
others were not released.  By night, he made his escape 
from the prison and went to the house of &amp;Rida &amp;Khan-- 
that rare and precious man, that star-sacrifice among the 
lovers of God--the son of &amp;Muhammad &amp;Khan, Master of 
the Horse to &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah.  He stayed there for a 
time, after which he and &amp;Rida &amp;Khan secretly rode away to 
the Fort of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi in &amp;Mazindaran.+F10  &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Khan sent riders after them to track them down, but try as 
they might, no one could find them.  Those two horsemen 
got to the Fort of &amp;Tabarsi, where both of them won a 
martyr's death.  As for the other friends who were in the 
prison at &amp;Tihran, some of these were returned to &amp;Qazvin 
and they too suffered martyrdom.  
     One day the administrator of finance, &amp;Mirza &amp;Shafi', 
called in the murderer and addressed him, saying:  "&amp;Jinab, 
do you belong to a dervish order, or do you follow the 
Law?  If you are a follower of the Law, why did you deal 
that learned mujtahid a cruel, a fatal blow in the mouth?  
If you are a dervish and follow the Path, one of the rules 
of the Path is to harm no man.  How, then, could you 
slaughter that zealous divine?"  "Sir," he replied, "besides 
the Law, and besides the Path, we also have the Truth.  
It was in serving the Truth that I paid him for his deed."+F11  
     These things would take place before the reality of this 
Cause was revealed and all was made plain.  For in those 
days no one knew that the Manifestation of the &amp;Bab 
would culminate in the Manifestation of the Blessed 
Beauty and that the law of retaliation would be done away 
with, and the foundation-principle of the Law of God 
would be this, that "It is better for you to be killed than to 
 
+F10 Cf. The Dawn-Breakers, p. 278.  
+F11 This refers to the doctrine that there are three ways to God:  the 
+F11 Law (&amp;shari'at), the Path (&amp;tariqat), and the Truth (&amp;haqiqat).  That is, 
+F11 the law of the orthodox, the path of the dervish, and the truth.  Cf. 
+F11 R. A. Nicholson, Commentary on the &amp;Mathnavi of &amp;Rumi, s.v.  
 
+P200  
kill"; that discord and contention would cease, and the 
rule of war and butchery would fall away.  In those days, 
that sort of thing would happen.  But praised be God, with 
the advent of the Blessed Beauty such a splendor of harmony 
and peace shone forth, such a spirit of meekness and 
long-suffering, that when in Yazd men, women and children 
were made the targets of enemy fire or were put to 
the sword, when the leaders and the evil &amp;ulamas and their 
followers joined together and unitedly assaulted those defenseless 
victims and spilled out their blood--hacking at 
and rending apart the bodies of chaste women, with their 
daggers slashing the throats of children they had orphaned, 
then setting the torn and mangled limbs on fire--not one 
of the friends of God lifted a hand against them.  Indeed, 
among those martyrs, those real companions of the ones 
who died, long gone, at &amp;Karbila--was a man who, when 
he saw the drawn sword flashing over him, thrust sugar 
candy into his murderer's mouth and cried, "With a 
sweet taste on your lips, put me to death--for you bring 
me martyrdom, my dearest wish!"  
     Let us return to our theme.  After the murder of her 
impious uncle, &amp;Mulla &amp;Taqi, in &amp;Qazvin, &amp;Tahirih fell into 
dire straits.  She was a prisoner and heavy of heart, grieving 
over the painful events that had come to pass.  She 
was watched on every side, by attendants, guards, the 
&amp;farrashes, and her foes.  While she languished thus, &amp;Baha'u'llah 
dispatched &amp;Hadiy-i-Qazvini, husband of the 
celebrated &amp;Khatun-Jan, from the capital, and they managed, 
by a stratagem, to free her from that embroilment 
and got her to &amp;Tihran in the night.  She alighted at the 
mansion of &amp;Baha'u'llah and was lodged in an upper apartment.  
     When word of this spread throughout &amp;Tihran, the Government 
hunted for her high and low; nevertheless, the 
friends kept arriving to see her, in a steady stream, and 
 
+P201 
&amp;Tahirih, seated behind a curtain, would converse with 
them.  One day the great Siyyid &amp;Yahya, surnamed &amp;Vahid, 
was present there.  As he sat without, &amp;Tahirih listened to 
him from behind the veil.  I was then a child, and was sitting 
on her lap.  With eloquence and fervor, &amp;Vahid was 
discoursing on the signs and verses that bore witness to 
the advent of the new Manifestation.  She suddenly interrupted 
him and, raising her voice, vehemently declared:  
"O &amp;Yahya!  Let deeds, not words, testify to thy faith, if 
thou art a man of true learning.  Cease idly repeating the 
traditions of the past, for the day of service, of steadfast 
action, is come.  Now is the time to show forth the true 
signs of God, to rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, to 
promote the Word of God, and to sacrifice ourselves in 
His path.  Let deeds, not words, be our adorning!"  
     The Blessed Beauty made elaborate arrangements for 
&amp;Tahirih's journey to &amp;Badasht and sent her off with an 
equipage and retinue.  His own party left for that region 
some days afterward.  
     In &amp;Badasht, there was a great open field.  Through its 
center a stream flowed, and to its right, left, and rear there 
were three gardens, the envy of Paradise.  One of those 
gardens was assigned to &amp;Quddus,+F12 but this was kept a secret.  
Another was set apart for &amp;Tahirih, and in a third was 
raised the pavilion of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  On the field amidst the 
three gardens, the believers pitched their tents.  Evenings, 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, &amp;Quddus and &amp;Tahirih would come together.  
In those days the fact that the &amp;Bab was the &amp;Qa'im had not 
yet been proclaimed; it was the Blessed Beauty, with &amp;Quddus, 
Who arranged for the proclamation of a universal Advent 
 
+F12 The eighteenth Letter of the Living, martyred with unspeakable 
+F12 cruelty in the market place at &amp;Barfurush, when he was twenty-seven.  
+F12 &amp;Baha'u'llah conferred on him a station second only to that of the &amp;Bab 
+F12 Himself.  Cf. The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 408-415.  
 
+P202 
and the abrogation and repudiation of the ancient 
laws.  
     Then one day, and there was a wisdom in it, &amp;Baha'u'llah 
fell ill; that is, the indisposition was to serve a vital 
purpose.  On a sudden, in the sight of all, &amp;Quddus came 
out of his garden, and entered the pavilion of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
But &amp;Tahirih sent him a message, to say that their Host 
being ill, &amp;Quddus should visit her garden instead.  His 
answer was:  "This garden is preferable.  Come, then, to 
this one."  &amp;Tahirih, with her face unveiled, stepped from 
her garden, advancing to the pavilion of &amp;Baha'u'llah; and 
as she came, she shouted aloud these words:  "The Trumpet 
is sounding!  The great Trump is blown!  The universal 
Advent is now proclaimed!"+F13  The believers gathered in 
that tent were panic struck, and each one asked himself, 
"How can the Law be abrogated?  How is it that this 
woman stands here without her veil?"  
     "Read the &amp;Surih of the Inevitable,"+F14 said &amp;Baha'u'llah; 
and the reader began:  "When the Day that must come 
shall have come suddenly...  Day that shall abase!  Day 
that shall exalt!..." and thus was the new Dispensation 
announced and the great Resurrection made manifest.  At 
the start, those who were present fled away, and some forsook 
their Faith, while some fell a prey to suspicion and 
doubt, and a number, after wavering, returned to the 
presence of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The Conference of &amp;Badasht broke 
up, but the universal Advent had been proclaimed.  
     Afterward, &amp;Quddus hastened away to the Fort of &amp;Tabarsi+F15 
and the Blessed Beauty, with provisions and equipment, 
 
+F13 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 74:8 and 6:73.  Also Isaiah 27:13 and Zechariah 9:14.  
+F14 &amp;Qur'an, &amp;Surih 56.  
+F15 A systematic campaign against the new Faith had been launched 
+F15 in Persia by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities combined.  The 
+F15 believers, cut down wherever they were isolated, banded together when 
+F15 they could, for protection against the Government, the clergy, and the 
+F15 people.  Betrayed and surrounded as they passed through the forest of 
+F15 &amp;Mazindaran, some 300 believers, mostly students and recluses, built 
+F15 the Fort of &amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi and held out against the armies of Persia 
+F15 for eleven months.  Cf. The Dawn-Breakers, chapters XIX and XX; 
+F15 God Passes By, p. 37 et seq.  
 
+P203 
journeyed to &amp;Niyala, having the intention of going 
on from there by night, making His way through the 
enemy encampment and entering the Fort.  But &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Taqi, the Governor of &amp;Amul, got word of this, and with 
seven hundred riflemen arrived in &amp;Niyala.  Surrounding 
the village by night, he sent &amp;Baha'u'llah with eleven riders 
back to &amp;Amul, and those calamities and tribulations, told 
of before, came to pass.  
     As for &amp;Tahirih, after the breakup at &amp;Badasht she was 
captured, and the oppressors sent her back under guard to 
&amp;Tihran.  There she was imprisoned in the house of &amp;Mahmud 
&amp;Khan, the &amp;Kalantar.  But she was aflame, enamored, 
restless, and could not be still.  The ladies of &amp;Tihran, on 
one pretext or another, crowded to see and listen to her.  
It happened that there was a celebration at the Mayor's 
house for the marriage of his son; a nuptial banquet was 
prepared, and the house adorned.  The flower of Tihran's 
ladies were invited, the princesses, the wives of &amp;vazirs and 
other great.  A splendid wedding it was, with instrumental 
music and vocal melodies--by day and night the lute, the 
bells and songs.  Then &amp;Tahirih began to speak; and so bewitched 
were the great ladies that they forsook the cithern 
and the drum and all the pleasures of the wedding feast, 
to crowd about &amp;Tahirih and listen to the sweet words of 
her mouth.  
     Thus she remained, a helpless captive.  Then came the 
attempt on the life of the &amp;Shah;+F16 a &amp;farman was issued; she

+F16 with shot from a pistol.  The assailant was instantly killed, and the 
+F16 authorities carried out a wholesale massacre of the believers, its climax 
+F16 described by Renan as "a day perhaps unparalleled in the history of 
+F16 the world."  Cf. Lord Curzon, Persia and the Persian Question, pp. 
+F16 501-2, and God Passes By, p. 62 et seq.

was sentenced to death.  Saying she was summoned to the 
Prime Minister's, they arrived to lead her away from the 
&amp;Kalantar's house.  She bathed her face and hands, arrayed 
herself in a costly dress, and scented with attar of roses 
she came out of the house.  
     They brought her into a garden, where the headsmen 
waited; but these wavered and then refused to end her 
life.  A slave was found, far gone in drunkenness; besotted, 
vicious, black of heart.  And he strangled &amp;Tahirih.  He 
forced a scarf between her lips and rammed it down her 
throat.  Then they lifted up her unsullied body and flung 
it in a well, there in the garden, and over it threw down 
earth and stones.  But &amp;Tahirih rejoiced; she had heard with 
a light heart the tidings of her martyrdom; she set her eyes 
on the supernal Kingdom and offered up her life.  
     Salutations be unto her, and praise.  Holy be her dust, 
as the tiers of light come down on it from Heaven.
