          In the Name of God the Clement, the Merciful 
 
     Praise and thanksgiving be unto Providence that 
out of all the realities in existence He has 
chosen the reality of man and has honored it 
with intellect and wisdom, the two most luminous lights 
in either world.  Through the agency of this great endowment, 
He has in every epoch cast on the mirror 
of creation new and wonderful configurations.  If we 
look objectively upon the world of being, it will become 
apparent that from age to age, the temple of existence 
has continually been embellished with a fresh grace, 
and distinguished with an ever-varying splendor, deriving 
from wisdom and the power of thought.  
     This supreme emblem of God stands first in the 
order of creation and first in rank, taking precedence 
over all created things.  Witness to it is the Holy Tradition, 
"Before all else, God created the mind."  From 
the dawn of creation, it was made to be revealed in the 
temple of man.  
     Sanctified is the Lord, Who with the dazzling rays 
of this strange, heavenly power has made our world 
of darkness the envy of the worlds of light:  "And the 
 
+P2 
earth shall shine with the light of her Lord."+F1  Holy 
and exalted is He, Who has caused the nature of man 
to be the dayspring of this boundless grace:  "The God 
of mercy hath taught the &amp;Qur'an, hath created man, 
hath taught him articulate speech."+F2  
     O ye that have minds to know!  Raise up your suppliant 
hands to the heaven of the one God, and humble 
yourselves and be lowly before Him, and thank Him 
for this supreme endowment, and implore Him to succor 
us until, in this present age, godlike impulses may 
radiate from the conscience of mankind, and this 
divinely kindled fire which has been entrusted to the 
human heart may never die away.  
     Consider carefully:  all these highly varied phenomena, 
these concepts, this knowledge, these technical 
procedures and philosophical systems, these sciences, 
arts, industries and inventions--all are emanations of 
the human mind.  Whatever people has ventured 
deeper into this shoreless sea, has come to excel the 
rest.  The happiness and pride of a nation consist in 
this, that it should shine out like the sun in the high 
heaven of knowledge.  "Shall they who have knowledge 
and they who have it not, be treated alike?"+F3  And 
the honor and distinction of the individual consist in 
this, that he among all the world's multitudes should 
become a source of social good.  Is any larger bounty 
 
+F1 &amp;Qur'an 39:69.  
+F2 &amp;Qur'an 55:1-3.  
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 39:12.  
 
+P3 
conceivable than this, that an individual, looking 
within himself, should find that by the confirming 
grace of God he has become the cause of peace and 
well-being, of happiness and advantage to his fellow 
men?  No, by the one true God, there is no greater 
bliss, no more complete delight.  
 
     How long shall we drift on the wings of passion 
and vain desire; how long shall we spend 
our days like barbarians in the depths of ignorance 
and abomination?  God has given us eyes, that 
we may look about us at the world, and lay hold of 
whatsoever will further civilization and the arts of living.  
He has given us ears, that we may hear and profit 
by the wisdom of scholars and philosophers and arise 
to promote and practice it.  Senses and faculties have 
been bestowed upon us, to be devoted to the service of 
the general good; so that we, distinguished above all 
other forms of life for perceptiveness and reason, 
should labor at all times and along all lines, whether 
the occasion be great or small, ordinary or extraordinary, 
until all mankind are safely gathered into the impregnable 
stronghold of knowledge.  We should continually 
be establishing new bases for human happiness and 
creating and promoting new instrumentalities toward 
 
+P4 
this end.  How excellent, how honorable is man if he 
arises to fulfil his responsibilities; how wretched and 
contemptible, if he shuts his eyes to the welfare of society 
and wastes his precious life in pursuing his own 
selfish interests and personal advantages.  Supreme happiness 
is man's, and he beholds the signs of God in the 
world and in the human soul, if he urges on the steed 
of high endeavor in the arena of civilization and justice.  
"We will surely show them Our signs in the world 
and within themselves."+F4  
     And this is man's uttermost wretchedness:  that he 
should live inert, apathetic, dull, involved only with his 
own base appetites.  When he is thus, he has his being 
in the deepest ignorance and savagery, sinking lower 
than the brute beasts.  "They are like the brutes:  Yea, 
they go more astray...  For the vilest beasts in God's 
sight, are the deaf, the dumb, who understand not."+F5  
     We must now highly resolve to arise and lay hold of 
all those instrumentalities that promote the peace and 
well-being and happiness, the knowledge, culture and 
industry, the dignity, value and station, of the entire 
human race.  Thus, through the restoring waters of pure 
intention and unselfish effort, the earth of human potentialities 
will blossom with its own latent excellence 
and flower into praiseworthy qualities, and bear and 
flourish until it comes to rival that rosegarden of knowledge 
which belonged to our forefathers.  Then will this 
 
+F4 &amp;Qur'an 41:53.  
+F5 &amp;Qur'an 7:178; 8:22.  
 
+P5 
holy land of Persia become in every sense the focal 
center of human perfections, reflecting as if in a mirror 
the full panoply of world civilization.  
     All praise and honor be to the Dayspring of Divine 
wisdom, the Dawning Point of Revelation (&amp;Muhammad), 
and to the holy line of His descendants, since, 
by the widespread rays of His consummate wisdom, 
His universal knowledge, those savage denizens of 
&amp;Yathrib (Medina) and &amp;Batha (Mecca), miraculously, 
and in so brief a time, were drawn out of the depths of 
their ignorance, rose up to the pinnacles of learning, 
and became centers of arts and sciences and human perfections, 
and stars of felicity and true civilization, shining 
across the horizons of the world.  
 
     His Majesty the &amp;Shah has, at the present time, 
[1875] resolved to bring about the advancement 
of the Persian people, their welfare 
and security and the prosperity of their country.  He has 
spontaneously extended assistance to his subjects, displaying 
energy and fair-mindedness, hoping that by the 
light of justice he might make &amp;Iran the envy of East 
and West, and set that fine fervor which characterized 
the first great epochs of Persia to flowing again through 
the veins of her people.  As is clear to the discerning, 
 
+P6 
the writer has for this reason felt it necessary to put 
down, for the sake of God alone and as a tribute to this 
high endeavor, a brief statement on certain urgent 
questions.  To demonstrate that His one purpose is to 
promote the general welfare, He has withheld His 
name.+F5b  Since He believes that guidance toward 
righteousness is in itself a righteous act, He offers these 
few words of counsel to His country's sons, words 
spoken for God's sake alone and in the spirit of a faithful 
friend.  Our Lord, Who knows all things, bears 
witness that this Servant seeks nothing but what is 
right and good; for He, a wanderer in the desert of 
God's love, has come into a realm where the hand of 
denial or assent, of praise or blame, can touch Him 
not.  "We nourish your souls for the sake of God; We 
seek from you neither recompense nor thanks."+F6  
 
         "The hand is veiled, yet the pen writes as bidden; 
          The horse leaps forward, yet the rider's hidden."  
 
     O people of Persia!  Look into those blossoming pages 
that tell of another day, a time long past.  Read them 
and wonder; see the great sight.  &amp;Iran in that day was as 
the heart of the world; she was the bright torch flaming 
in the assemblage of mankind.  Her power and glory 
shone out like the morning above the world's horizons, 
 
+F5b The original Persian text written in 1875 carried no author's 
+F5b name, and the first English translation published in 1910
under 
+F5b the title The Mysterious Forces of Civilization states only
"Written 
+F5b in Persian by an Eminent Bahai Philosopher."  
+F6 &amp;Qur'an 76:9.  
 
+P7 
and the splendor of her learning cast its rays over East 
and West.  Word of the widespread empire of those 
who wore her crown reached even to the dwellers in 
the arctic circle, and the fame of the awesome presence 
of her King of Kings humbled the rulers of Greece and 
Rome.  The greatest of the world's philosophers marveled 
at the wisdom of her government, and her political 
system became the model for all the kings of the 
four continents then known.  She was distinguished 
among all peoples for the scope of her dominion, she 
was honored by all for her praiseworthy culture and 
civilization.  She was as the pivot of the world, she was 
the source and center of sciences and arts, the wellspring 
of great inventions and discoveries, the rich mine 
of human virtues and perfections.  The intellect, the 
wisdom of the individual members of this excellent nation 
dazzled the minds of other peoples, the brilliance 
and perceptive genius that characterized all this noble 
race aroused the envy of the whole world.  
     Aside from that which is a matter of record in Persian 
histories, it is stated in the Old Testament--established 
today, among all European peoples, as a sacred and 
canonical Text--that in the time of Cyrus, called in 
Iranian works Bahman son of &amp;Isfandiyar, the three 
hundred and sixty divisions of the Persian Empire extended 
from the inner confines of India and China to 
the farthermost reaches of Yemen and Ethiopia.+F7  The 
 
+F7 2 Chronicles 36:22-23; Ezra 1:2; Esther 1:1; 8:9; Isaiah 
+F7 45:1, 14; 49:12.  
 
+P8 
Greek accounts, as well, relate how this proud sovereign 
came against them with an innumerable host, and left 
their own till then victorious dominion level with the 
dust.  He made the pillars of all the governments to 
quake; according to that authoritative Arab work, the 
history of &amp;Abu'l-Fida, he took over the entire known 
world.  It is likewise recorded in this same text and elsewhere, 
that &amp;Firaydun, a king of the &amp;Pishdadiyan Dynasty-- 
who was indeed, for his inherent perfections, 
his powers of judgment, the scope of his knowledge, 
and his long series of continual victories, unique among 
all the rulers who preceded and followed him--divided 
the whole known world among his three sons.  
     As attested by the annals of the world's most illustrious 
peoples, the first government to be established on 
earth, the foremost empire to be organized among the 
nations, was Persia's throne and diadem.  
     O people of Persia!  Awake from your drunken sleep!  
Rise up from your lethargy!  Be fair in your judgment:  
will the dictates of honor permit this holy land, once 
the wellspring of world civilization, the source of glory 
and joy for all mankind, the envy of East and West, to 
remain an object of pity, deplored by all nations?  She 
was once the noblest of peoples:  will you let contemporary 
history register for the ages her now degenerate 
state?  Will you complacently accept her present 
wretchedness, when she was once the land of all mankind's 
desire?  Must she now, for this contemptible 
 
+P9 
sloth, this failure to struggle, this utter ignorance, be 
accounted the most backward of nations?  
     Were not the people of Persia, in days long gone, 
the head and front of intellect and wisdom?  Did they 
not, by God's grace, shine out like the daystar from the 
horizons of Divine knowledge?  How is it that we are 
satisfied today with this miserable condition, are engrossed 
in our licentious passions, have blinded ourselves 
to supreme happiness, to that which is pleasing 
in God's sight, and have all become absorbed in our 
selfish concerns and the search for ignoble, personal advantage?  
     This fairest of lands was once a lamp, streaming with 
the rays of Divine knowledge, of science and art, of 
nobility and high achievement, of wisdom and valor.  
Today, because of the idleness and lethargy of her 
people, their torpor, their undisciplined way of life, 
their lack of pride, lack of ambition--her bright fortune 
has been totally eclipsed, her light has turned to darkness.  
"The seven heavens and the seven earths weep 
over the mighty when he is brought low."  
     It should not be imagined that the people of Persia 
are inherently deficient in intelligence, or that for essential 
perceptiveness and understanding, inborn sagacity, 
intuition and wisdom, or innate capacity, they 
are inferior to others.  God forbid!  On the contrary, 
they have always excelled all other peoples in endowments 
conferred by birth.  Persia herself, moreover, 
from the standpoint of her temperate climate and natural 
 
+P10 
beauties, her geographical advantages and her rich 
soil, is blessed to a supreme degree.  What she urgently 
requires, however, is deep reflection, resolute action, 
training, inspiration and encouragement.  Her people 
must make a massive effort, and their pride must be 
aroused.  
     Today throughout the five continents of the globe it 
is Europe and most sections of America that are renowned 
for law and order, government and commerce, 
art and industry, science, philosophy and education.  Yet 
in ancient times these were the most savage of the 
world's peoples, the most ignorant and brutish.  They 
were even stigmatized as barbarians--that is, utterly 
rude and uncivilized.  Further, from the fifth century 
after Christ until the fifteenth, that period defined as 
the Middle Ages, such terrible struggles and fierce upheavals, 
such ruthless encounters and horrifying acts, 
were the rule among the peoples of Europe, that the 
Europeans rightly describe those ten centuries as the 
Dark Ages.  The basis of Europe's progress and civilization 
was actually laid in the fifteenth century of the 
Christian era, and from that time on, all her present 
evident culture has been, under the stimulus of great 
minds and as a result of the expansion of the frontiers 
of knowledge and the exertion of energetic and ambitious 
efforts, in the process of development.  
     Today by the grace of God and the spiritual influence 
of His universal Manifestation, the fair-minded 
ruler of &amp;Iran has gathered his people into the shelter 
 
+P11 
of justice, and the sincerity of the imperial purpose has 
shown itself in kingly acts.  Hoping that his reign will 
rival the glorious past, he has sought to establish equity 
and righteousness and to foster education and the 
processes of civilization throughout this noble land, 
and to translate from potentiality into actuality whatever 
will insure its progress.  Not until now had we seen 
a monarch, holding in his capable hands the reins of 
affairs, and on whose high resolve the welfare of all 
his subjects depends, exerting as it would befit him, 
like a benevolent father, his efforts toward the training 
and cultivation of his people, seeking to insure their 
well-being and peace of mind, and exhibiting due concern 
for their interests; this Servant and those like Him 
have therefore remained silent.  Now, however, it is 
clear to the discerning that the &amp;Shah has of his own accord 
determined to establish a just government and to 
secure the progress of all his subjects.  His honorable 
intention has consequently evoked this present statement.  
     It is indeed strange that instead of offering thanks 
for this bounty, which truly derives from the grace of 
Almighty God, by arising as one in gratitude and enthusiasm 
and praying that these noble purposes will 
daily multiply, some, on the contrary, whose reason has 
been corrupted by personal motives and the clarity of 
whose perception has been clouded by self-interest and 
conceit; whose energies are devoted to the service of 
their passions, whose sense of pride is perverted to the 
 
+P12 
love of leadership, have raised the standard of opposition 
and waxed loud in their complaints.  Up to now, 
they blamed the &amp;Shah for not, on his own initiative, 
working for his people's welfare and seeking to bring 
about their peace and well-being.  Now that he has inaugurated 
this great design they have changed their 
tune.  Some say that these are newfangled methods and 
foreign isms, quite unrelated to the present needs and 
the time-honored customs of Persia.  Others have rallied 
the helpless masses, who know nothing of religion or 
its laws and basic principles and therefore have no 
power of discrimination--and tell them that these 
modern methods are the practices of heathen peoples, 
and are contrary to the venerated canons of true faith, 
and they add the saying, "He who imitates a people 
is one of them."  One group insists that such reforms 
should go forward with great deliberation, step by step, 
haste being inadmissible.  Another maintains that only 
such measures should be adopted as the Persians themselves 
devise, that they themselves should reform their 
political administration and their educational system 
and the state of their culture and that there is no need 
to borrow improvements from other nations.  Every faction, 
in short, follows its own particular illusion.  
     O people of Persia!  How long will you wander?  
How long must your confusion last?  How long will it 
go on, this conflict of opinions, this useless antagonism, 
this ignorance, this refusal to think?  Others are alert, 
and we sleep our dreamless sleep.  Other nations are 
 
+P13 
making every effort to improve their condition; we are 
trapped in our desires and self-indulgences, and at 
every step we stumble into a new snare.  
     God is Our witness that We have no ulterior motive 
in developing this theme.  We seek neither to curry 
favor with any one nor to attract any one to Ourselves 
nor to derive any material benefit therefrom.  We 
speak only as one earnestly desiring the good pleasure 
of God, for We have turned Our gaze away from the 
world and its peoples and have sought refuge in the 
sheltering care of the Lord.  "No pay do I ask of you for 
this...  My reward is of God alone."+F8  
     Those who maintain that these modern concepts apply 
only to other countries and are irrelevant in &amp;Iran, 
that they do not satisfy her requirements or suit her 
way of life, disregard the fact that other nations were 
once as we are now.  Did not these new systems and 
procedures, these progressive enterprises, contribute to 
the advancement of those countries?  Were the people 
of Europe harmed by the adoption of such measures?  
Or did they rather by these means reach the highest 
degree of material development?  Is it not true that for 
centuries, the people of Persia have lived as we see 
them living today, carrying out the pattern of the past?  
Have any discernible benefits resulted, has any progress 
been made?  If these things had not been tested by 
experience, some in whose minds the light of native 
intelligence is clouded, might idly question them.  On 
 
+F8 &amp;Qur'an 6:90; 11:31.  
 
+P14 
the contrary, however, every aspect of these prerequisites 
to progress have in other countries been time and 
again put to the test, and their benefits demonstrated 
so plainly that even the dullest mind can grasp them.  
     Let us consider this justly and without bias:  let us 
ask ourselves which one of these basic principles and 
sound, well-established procedures would fail to satisfy 
our present needs, or would be incompatible with Persia's 
best political interests or injurious to the general 
welfare of her people.  Would the extension of education, 
the development of useful arts and sciences, the 
promotion of industry and technology, be harmful 
things?  For such endeavor lifts the individual within 
the mass and raises him out of the depths of ignorance 
to the highest reaches of knowledge and human excellence.  
Would the setting up of just legislation, in accord 
with the Divine laws which guarantee the happiness 
of society and protect the rights of all mankind 
and are an impregnable proof against assault--would 
such laws, insuring the integrity of the members of society 
and their equality before the law, inhibit their 
prosperity and success?  
     Or if by using one's perceptive faculties, one can 
draw analogies from present circumstances and the conclusions 
arrived at by collective experience, and can 
envisage as coming realities situations now only potential, 
would it be unreasonable to take such present 
measures as would guarantee our future security?  
Would it seem shortsighted, improvident and unsound, 
 
+P15 
would it constitute a deviation from what is right and 
proper, if we were to strengthen our relationships with 
neighboring countries, enter into binding treaties with 
the great powers, foster friendly connections with well-disposed 
governments, look to the expansion of trade 
with the nations of East and West, develop our natural 
resources and increase the wealth of our people?  
     Would it spell perdition for our subjects if the provincial 
and district governors were relieved of their 
present absolute authority, whereby they function exactly 
as they please, and were instead limited to equity 
and truth, and if their sentences involving capital punishment, 
imprisonment and the like were contingent 
on confirmation by the &amp;Shah and by higher courts in 
the capital, who would first duly investigate the case 
and determine the nature and seriousness of the crime, 
and then hand down a just decision subject to the issuance 
of a decree by the sovereign?  If bribery and 
corruption, known today by the pleasant names of gifts 
and favors, were forever excluded, would this threaten 
the foundations of justice?  Would it be an evidence of 
unsound thinking to deliver the soldiery, who are a 
living sacrifice to the state and the people and brave 
death at every turn, from their present extreme misery 
and indigence, and to make adequate arrangements for 
their sustenance, clothing and housing, and exert every 
effort to instruct their officers in military science, and 
supply them with the most advanced types of firearms 
and other weapons?  
 
+P16 
     Should anyone object that the above-mentioned reforms 
have never yet been fully effected, he should 
consider the matter impartially and know that these 
deficiencies have resulted from the total absence of a 
unified public opinion, and the lack of zeal and resolve 
and devotion in the country's leaders.  It is obvious that 
not until the people are educated, not until public opinion 
is rightly focused, not until government officials, 
even minor ones, are free from even the least remnant 
of corruption, can the country be properly administered.  
Not until discipline, order and good government reach 
the degree where an individual, even if he should put 
forth his utmost efforts to do so, would still find himself 
unable to deviate by so much as a hair's breadth 
from righteousness, can the desired reforms be regarded 
as fully established.  
     Furthermore, any agency whatever, though it be the 
instrument of mankind's greatest good, is capable of 
misuse.  Its proper use or abuse depends on the varying 
degrees of enlightenment, capacity, faith, honesty, devotion 
and highmindedness of the leaders of public 
opinion.  
     The &amp;Shah has certainly done his part, and the execution 
of the proposed beneficial measures is now in the 
hands of persons functioning in assemblies of consultation.  
If these individuals prove to be pure and high-minded, 
if they remain free from the taint of corruption, 
the confirmations of God will make them a never-failing 
source of bounty to mankind.  He will cause to 
 
+P17 
issue from their lips and their pens what will bless the 
people, so that every corner of this noble country of 
&amp;Iran will be illumined with their justice and integrity 
and the rays of that light will encompass the whole 
earth.  "Neither will this be difficult with God."+F9  
     Otherwise it is clear that the results will prove
unacceptable.  
For it has been directly witnessed in certain 
foreign countries that following on the establishment 
of parliaments those bodies actually distressed and 
confused the people and their well-meant reforms produced 
maleficent results.  While the setting up of parliaments, 
the organizing of assemblies of consultation, 
constitutes the very foundation and bedrock of government, 
there are several essential requirements which 
these institutions must fulfill.  First, the elected members 
must be righteous, God-fearing, high-minded, incorruptible.  
Second, they must be fully cognizant, in 
every particular, of the laws of God, informed as to the 
highest principles of law, versed in the rules which 
govern the management of internal affairs and the conduct 
of foreign relations, skilled in the useful arts of 
civilization, and content with their lawful emoluments.  
     Let it not be imagined that members of this type 
would be impossible to find.  Through the grace of God 
and His chosen ones, and the high endeavors of the 
devoted and the consecrated, every difficulty can be 
easily resolved, every problem however complex will 
prove simpler than blinking an eye.  
 
+F9 &amp;Qur'an 14:23; 35:18.  
 
+P18 
     If, however, the members of these consultative assemblies 
are inferior, ignorant, uninformed of the laws 
of government and administration, unwise, of low aim, 
indifferent, idle, self-seeking, no benefit will accrue 
from the organizing of such bodies.  Where, in the past, 
if a poor man wanted his rights he had only to offer a 
gift to one individual, now he would either have to 
renounce all hope of justice or else satisfy the entire 
membership.  
     Close investigation will show that the primary cause 
of oppression and injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity 
and disorder, is the people's lack of religious 
faith and the fact that they are uneducated.  When, for 
example, the people are genuinely religious and are 
literate and well-schooled, and a difficulty presents itself, 
they can apply to the local authorities; if they do 
not meet with justice and secure their rights and if 
they see that the conduct of the local government is 
incompatible with the Divine good pleasure and the 
king's justice, they can then take their case to higher 
courts and describe the deviation of the local administration 
from the spiritual law.  Those courts can then 
send for the local records of the case and in this way 
justice will be done.  At present, however, because of 
their inadequate schooling, most of the population lack 
even the vocabulary to explain what they want.  
     As to those persons who, here and there, are considered 
leaders of the people:  because this is only the 
beginning of the new administrative process, they are 
 
+P19 
not yet sufficiently advanced in their education to have 
experienced the delights of dispensing justice or to have 
tasted the exhilaration of promoting righteousness or to 
have drunk from the springs of a clear conscience and a 
sincere intent.  They have not properly understood that 
man's supreme honor and real happiness lie in self-respect, 
in high resolves and noble purposes, in integrity 
and moral quality, in immaculacy of mind.  They 
have, rather, imagined that their greatness consists in 
the accumulation, by whatever means may offer, of 
worldly goods.  
     A man should pause and reflect and be just:  his 
Lord, out of measureless grace, has made him a human 
being and honored him with the words:  "Verily, We 
created man in the goodliest of forms"+F10--and caused 
His mercy which rises out of the dawn of oneness to 
shine down upon him, until he became the wellspring 
of the words of God and the place where the mysteries 
of heaven alighted, and on the morning of creation he 
was covered with the rays of the qualities of perfection 
and the graces of holiness.  How can he stain this immaculate 
garment with the filth of selfish desires, or 
exchange this everlasting honor for infamy?  "Dost thou 
think thyself only a puny form, when the universe is 
folded up within thee?"+F11  
     Were it not our purpose to be brief and to develop 
our primary subject, we would here set down a summary 
 
+F10 &amp;Qur'an 95:4.  
+F11 The &amp;Imam &amp;Ali.  
 
+P20 
of themes from the Divine world, as to the reality 
of man and his high station and the surpassing value 
and worth of the human race.  Let this be, for another 
time.  
     The highest station, the supreme sphere, the noblest, 
most sublime position in creation, whether visible or 
invisible, whether alpha or omega, is that of the Prophets 
of God, notwithstanding the fact that for the most 
part they have to outward seeming been possessed of 
nothing but their own poverty.  In the same way, ineffable 
glory is set apart for the Holy Ones and those 
who are nearest to the Threshold of God, although 
such as these have never for a moment concerned themselves 
with material gain.  Then comes the station of 
those just kings whose fame as protectors of the people 
and dispensers of Divine justice has filled the world, 
whose name as powerful champions of the people's 
rights has echoed through creation.  These give no 
thought to amassing enormous fortunes for themselves; 
they believe, rather, that their own wealth lies in enriching 
their subjects.  To them, if every individual citizen 
has affluence and ease, the royal coffers are full.  
They take no pride in gold and silver, but rather in 
their enlightenment and their determination to achieve 
the universal good.  
     Next in rank are those eminent and honorable ministers 
of state and representatives, who place the will of 
God above their own, and whose administrative skill 
and wisdom in the conduct of their office raises the science 
 
+P21 
of government to new heights of perfection.  They 
shine in the learned world like lamps of knowledge; 
their thinking, their attitudes and their acts demonstrate 
their patriotism and their concern for the country's advancement. 

Content with a modest stipend, they consecrate 
their days and nights to the execution of important 
duties and the devising of methods to insure the 
progress of the people.  Through the effectiveness of 
their wise counsel, the soundness of their judgment, 
they have ever caused their government to become an 
example to be followed by all the governments of the 
world.  They have made their capital city a focal center 
of great world undertakings, they have won distinction, 
attaining a supreme degree of personal eminence, and 
reaching the loftiest heights of repute and character.  
     Again, there are those famed and accomplished men 
of learning, possessed of praiseworthy qualities and vast 
erudition, who lay hold on the strong handle of the 
fear of God and keep to the ways of salvation.  In the 
mirror of their minds the forms of transcendent realities 
are reflected, and the lamp of their inner vision 
derives its light from the sun of universal knowledge.  
They are busy by night and by day with meticulous 
research into such sciences as are profitable to mankind, 
and they devote themselves to the training of students 
of capacity.  It is certain that to their discerning taste, 
the proffered treasures of kings would not compare 
with a single drop of the waters of knowledge, and 
mountains of gold and silver could not outweigh the 
 
+P22 
successful solution of a difficult problem.  To them, the 
delights that lie outside their work are only toys for 
children, and the cumbersome load of unnecessary possessions 
is only good for the ignorant and base.  Content, 
like the birds, they give thanks for a handful of 
seeds, and the song of their wisdom dazzles the minds 
of the world's most wise.  
     Again, there are sagacious leaders among the people 
and influential personalities throughout the country, 
who constitute the pillars of state.  Their rank and station 
and success depend on their being the well-wishers 
of the people and in their seeking out such means as 
will improve the nation and will increase the wealth 
and comfort of the citizens.  
     Observe the case when an individual is an eminent 
person in his country, zealous, wise, pure-hearted, 
known for his innate capacity, intelligence, natural 
perspicacity--and is also an important member of the 
state:  what, for such an individual, can be regarded as 
honor, abiding happiness, rank and station, whether in 
the here or the hereafter?  Is it a diligent attention to 
truth and righteousness, is it dedication and resolve 
and devotion to the good pleasure of God, is it the desire 
to attract the favorable consideration of the ruler 
and to merit the approval of the people?  Or would it, 
rather, consist in this, that for the sake of indulging in 
feasts and dissipations by night he should undermine 
his country and break the hearts of his people by day, 
causing his God to reject him, and his sovereign to cast 
 
+P23 
him out and his people to defame him and hold him in 
deserved contempt?  By God, the mouldering bones in 
the graveyard are better than such as these!  Of what 
value are they, who have never tasted the heavenly 
food of truly human qualities, and never drunk of the 
crystalline waters of those bounties which belong to the 
realm of man?  
 
     It is unquestionable that the object in establishing 
parliaments is to bring about justice and righteousness, 
but everything hinges on the efforts of 
the elected representatives.  If their intention is sincere, 
desirable results and unforeseen improvements will be 
forthcoming; if not, it is certain that the whole thing 
will be meaningless, the country will come to a standstill 
and public affairs will continuously deteriorate.  "I 
see a thousand builders unequal to one subverter; what 
then of the one builder who is followed by a thousand 
subverters?"  
     The purpose of the foregoing statements is to demonstrate 
at least this, that the happiness and greatness, 
the rank and station, the pleasure and peace, of an individual 
have never consisted in his personal wealth, 
but rather in his excellent character, his high resolve, 
the breadth of his learning, and his ability to solve difficult 
 
+P24 
problems.  How well has it been said:  "On my 
back is a garment which, were it sold for a penny, that 
penny would be worth far more; yet within the garment 
is a soul which, if you weighed it against all the 
souls in the world, would prove greater and nobler."  
     In the present writer's view it would be preferable 
if the election of nonpermanent members of consultative 
assemblies in sovereign states should be dependent 
on the will and choice of the people.  For elected representatives 
will on this account be somewhat inclined to 
exercise justice, lest their reputation suffer and they 
fall into disfavor with the public.  
     It should not be imagined that the writer's earlier remarks 
constitute a denunciation of wealth or a commendation 
of poverty.  Wealth is praiseworthy in the 
highest degree, if it is acquired by an individual's own 
efforts and the grace of God, in commerce, agriculture, 
art and industry, and if it be expended for philanthropic 
purposes.  Above all, if a judicious and resourceful individual 
should initiate measures which would universally 
enrich the masses of the people, there could be no 
undertaking greater than this, and it would rank in the 
sight of God as the supreme achievement, for such a 
benefactor would supply the needs and insure the comfort 
and well-being of a great multitude.  Wealth is 
most commendable, provided the entire population is 
wealthy.  If, however, a few have inordinate riches 
while the rest are impoverished, and no fruit or benefit 
accrues from that wealth, then it is only a liability to its 
 
+P25 
possessor.  If, on the other hand, it is expended for the 
promotion of knowledge, the founding of elementary 
and other schools, the encouragement of art and industry, 
the training of orphans and the poor--in brief, if it 
is dedicated to the welfare of society--its possessor will 
stand out before God and man as the most excellent of 
all who live on earth and will be accounted as one of 
the people of paradise.  
 
     As to those who maintain that the inauguration 
of reforms and the setting up of powerful 
institutions would in reality be at variance 
with the good pleasure of God and would contravene 
the laws of the Divine Law-Giver and run counter to 
basic religious principles and to the ways of the Prophet-- 
let them consider how this could be the case.  Would 
such reforms contravene the religious law because they 
would be acquired from foreigners and would therefore 
cause us to be as they are, since "He who imitates a 
people is one of them"?  In the first place these matters 
relate to the temporal and material apparatus of civilization, 
the implements of science, the adjuncts of progress 
in the professions and the arts, and the orderly 
 
+P26 
conduct of government.  They have nothing whatever 
to do with the problems of the spirit and the complex 
realities of religious doctrine.  If it be objected that even 
where material affairs are concerned foreign importations 
are inadmissible, such an argument would only 
establish the ignorance and absurdity of its proponents.  
Have they forgotten the celebrated &amp;hadith (Holy Tradition):  
"Seek after knowledge, even unto China"?  It 
is certain that the people of China were, in the sight of 
God, among the most rejected of men, because they 
worshiped idols and were unmindful of the omniscient 
Lord.  The Europeans are at least "Peoples of the Book," 
and believers in God and specifically referred to in the 
sacred verse, "Thou shalt certainly find those to be 
nearest in affection to the believers, who say, `We are 
Christians.'"+F12  It is therefore quite permissible and 
indeed more appropriate to acquire knowledge from 
Christian countries.  How could seeking after knowledge 
among the heathen be acceptable to God, and 
seeking it among the People of the Book be repugnant 
to Him?  
     Furthermore, in the Battle of the Confederates, &amp;Abu 
&amp;Sufyan enlisted the aid of the &amp;Bani &amp;Kinanih, the &amp;Bani 
&amp;Qahtan and the Jewish &amp;Bani Qurayzih and rose up 
with all the tribes of the &amp;Quraysh to put out the Divine 
Light that flamed in the lamp of &amp;Yathrib (Medina).  In 
those days the great winds of trials and tribulations 
were blowing from every direction, as it is written:  "Do 
 
+F12 &amp;Qur'an 5:85.  
 
+P27 
men think when they say `We believe' they shall be 
let alone and not be put to proof?"+F13  The believers 
were few and the enemy attacking in force, seeking to 
blot out the new-risen Sun of Truth with the dust of 
oppression and tyranny.  Then &amp;Salman (the Persian) 
came into the presence of the Prophet--the Dawning-Point 
of revelation, the Focus of the endless splendors 
of grace--and he said that in Persia to protect themselves 
from an encroaching host they would dig a moat 
or trench about their lands, and that this had proved 
a highly efficient safeguard against surprise attacks.  
Did that Wellspring of universal wisdom, that Mine 
of divine knowledge say in reply that this was a custom 
current among idolatrous, fire-worshiping Magians 
and could therefore hardly be adopted by monotheists?  
Or did He rather immediately direct His followers to 
set about digging a trench?  He even, in His Own 
blessed person, took hold of the tools and went to work 
beside them.  
     It is moreover a matter of record in the books of the 
various Islamic schools and the writings of leading divines 
and historians, that after the Light of the World 
had risen over &amp;Hijaz, flooding all mankind with Its 
brilliance, and creating through the revelation of a new 
divine Law, new principles and institutions, a fundamental 
change throughout the world--holy laws were 
revealed which in some cases conformed to the practices 
 
+F13 &amp;Qur'an 29:2.  
 
+P28 
of the Days of Ignorance.+F14  Among these, &amp;Muhammad 
respected the months of religious truce,+F15 retained 
the prohibition of swine's flesh, continued the 
use of the lunar calendar and the names of the months 
and so on.  There is a considerable number of such laws 
specifically enumerated in the texts:  
     "The people of the Days of Ignorance engaged in 
many practices which the Law of &amp;Islam later confirmed.  
They would not take in marriage both a mother and 
her daughter, and the most shameful of acts in their 
view was to marry two sisters.  They would stigmatize 
a man marrying the wife of his father, derisively calling 
him his father's competitor.  It was their custom to 
go on pilgrimage to the House at Mecca, where they 
would perform the ceremonies of visitation, putting on 
the pilgrim's dress, practicing the circumambulation, 
running between the hills, pausing at all the stopping-places, 
and casting the stones.  It was, furthermore, their 
wont to intercalate one month in every three-year period, 
to perform ablutions after intercourse, to rinse 
out the mouth and snuff up water through the nostrils, 
to part the hair, use the tooth-stick, pare the nails and 
pluck the armpits.  They would, likewise, cut off the 
right hand of a thief."  
     Can one, God forbid, assume that because some of 
 
+F14 &amp;Jahiliyyih:  the period of paganism in Arabia, prior to the 
+F14 advent of &amp;Muhammad.  
+F15 The pagan Arabs observed one separate and three consecutive 
+F15 months of truce, during which period pilgrimages were made to 
+F15 Mecca, and fairs, poetry contests and similar events took
place.  
 
+P29 
the divine laws resemble the practices of the Days of 
Ignorance, the customs of a people abhorred by all nations, 
it follows that there is a defect in these laws?  
Or can one, God forbid, imagine that the Omnipotent 
Lord was moved to comply with the opinions of the 
heathen?  The divine wisdom takes many forms.  Would 
it have been impossible for &amp;Muhammad to reveal a Law 
which bore no resemblance whatever to any practice 
current in the Days of Ignorance?  Rather, the purpose 
of His consummate wisdom was to free the people 
from the chains of fanaticism which had bound them 
hand and foot, and to forestall those very objections 
which today confuse the mind and trouble the conscience 
of the simple and helpless.  
     Some, who are not sufficiently informed as to the 
meaning of the divine Texts and the contents of traditional 
and written history, will aver that these customs 
of the Days of Ignorance were laws which had come 
down from His Holiness Abraham and had been retained 
by the idolaters.  In this connection they will 
cite the &amp;Qur'anic verse:  "Follow the religion of Abraham, 
the sound in faith."+F16  Nevertheless it is a fact 
attested by the writings of all the Islamic schools that 
the months of truce, the lunar calendar, and the cutting 
off of the right hand as punishment for theft, 
formed no part of Abraham's Law.  In any case, the 
Pentateuch is extant and available today, and contains 
the laws of Abraham.  Let them refer to it.  They will 
 
+F16 &amp;Qur'an 16:124.  
 
+P30 
then, of course, insist that the Torah has been tampered 
with, and in proof will quote the &amp;Qur'anic verse:  "They 
pervert the text of the Word of God."+F17  It is, however, 
known where such distortion has occurred, and is a 
matter of record in critical texts and commentaries.+F18  
Were We to develop the subject beyond this brief reference, 
We would have to abandon Our present purpose.  
     According to some accounts, mankind has been directed 
to borrow various good qualities and ways from 
wild animals, and to learn a lesson from these.  Since 
it is permissible to imitate virtues of dumb animals, it 
is certainly far more so to borrow material sciences and 
techniques from foreign peoples, who at least belong 
to the human race and are distinguished by judgment 
and the power of speech.  And if it be contended that 
such praiseworthy qualities are inborn in animals, by 
what proof can they claim that these essential principles 
of civilization, this knowledge and these sciences current 
among other peoples, are not inborn?  Is there any 
Creator save God?  Say:  Praised be God!  
     The most learned and accomplished divines, the 
most distinguished scholars, have diligently studied 
those branches of knowledge the root and origin of 
which were the Greek philosophers such as Aristotle 
and the rest, and have regarded the acquisition from 
the Greek texts of sciences such as medicine, and 
 
+F17 &amp;Qur'an 4:45; 5:16.  
+F18 Cf. &amp;Baha'u'llah, The &amp;Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 86.  
 
+P31 
branches of mathematics including algebra+F19 and arithmetic, 
as a most valuable achievement.  Every one of 
the eminent divines both studies and teaches the science 
of logic, although they consider its founder to 
have been a Sabean.  Most of them have insisted that if 
a scholar has thoroughly mastered a variety of sciences 
but is not well grounded in logic, his opinions, deductions 
and conclusions cannot safely be relied upon.  
 
     It has now been clearly and irrefutably shown that 
the importation from foreign countries of the 
principles and procedures of civilization, and 
the acquisition from them of sciences and techniques-- 
 
+F19 "If by the word algebra we mean that branch of mathematics 
+F19 by which we learn how to solve the equation x2+5x=14, 
+F19 written in this way, the science begins in the 17th century. 
If we 
+F19 allow the equation to be written with other and less
convenient 
+F19 symbols, it may be considered as beginning at least as early
as the 
+F19 3rd century.  If we permit it to be stated in words and
solved, for 
+F19 simple cases of positive roots, by the aid of geometric
figures, the 
+F19 science was known to Euclid and others of the Alexandrian
school 
+F19 as early as 300 B.C.  If we permit of more or less scientific
guessing 
+F19 in achieving a solution, algebra may be said to have been
known 
+F19 nearly 2000 years B.C., and it had probably attracted the
attention 
+F19 of the intellectual class much earlier...  The name `algebra'
is 
+F19 quite fortuitous.  When Mohammed ibn &amp;Musa &amp;al-Khowarizmi ... 
+F19 wrote in Baghdad (c. 825) he gave to one of his works the name

+F19 Al-jebr &amp;w'al-muqabalah.  The title is sometimes translated as

+F19 `restoration and equation,' but the meaning was not clear even
to the 
+F19 later Arab writers."  Encyclopedia Britannica, 1952, s.v.
Algebra.  
 
+P32 
in brief, of whatsoever will contribute to the general 
good--is entirely permissible.  This has been done to 
focus public attention on a matter of such universal advantage, 
so that the people may arise with all their 
energies to further it, until, God helping them, this 
Sacred Land may within a brief period become the first 
of nations.  
     O you who are wise!  Consider this carefully:  can an 
ordinary gun compare with a Martini-Henry rifle or a 
Krupp gun?  If anyone should maintain that our old-time 
firearms are good enough for us and that it is 
useless to import weapons which have been invented 
abroad would even a child listen to him?  Or should 
anyone say:  "We have always transported merchandise 
from one country to another on the backs of animals.  
Why do we need steam engines?  Why should we try to 
ape other peoples?" could any intelligent person tolerate 
such a statement?  No, by the one God!  Unless he 
should, because of some hidden design or animosity, 
refuse to accept the obvious.  
     Foreign nations, in spite of their having achieved the 
greatest expertness in science, industry and the arts, do 
not hesitate to borrow ideas from one another.  How can 
Persia, a country in the direst need, be allowed to lag 
behind, neglected, abandoned?  
     Those eminent divines and men of learning who 
walk the straight pathway and are versed in the secrets 
of divine wisdom and informed of the inner realities of 
the sacred Books; who wear in their hearts the jewel of 
 
+P33 
the fear of God, and whose luminous faces shine with 
the lights of salvation--these are alert to the present 
need and they understand the requirements of modern 
times, and certainly devote all their energies toward 
encouraging the advancement of learning and civilization.  
"Are they equal, those who know, and those who 
do not know?...  Or is the darkness equal with the 
light?"+F20  
     The spiritually learned are lamps of guidance among 
the nations, and stars of good fortune shining from the 
horizons of humankind.  They are fountains of life for 
such as lie in the death of ignorance and unawareness, 
and clear springs of perfections for those who thirst 
and wander in the wasteland of their defects and errors.  
They are the dawning places of the emblems of Divine 
Unity and initiates in the mysteries of the glorious 
&amp;Qur'an.  They are skilled physicians for the ailing body 
of the world, they are the sure antidote to the poison 
that has corrupted human society.  It is they who are 
the strong citadel guarding humanity, and the impregnable 
sanctuary for the sorely distressed, the anxious 
and tormented, victims of ignorance.  "Knowledge is a 
light which God casteth into the heart of whomsoever 
He willeth."  
     For every thing, however, God has created a sign and 
symbol, and established standards and tests by which 
it may be known.  The spiritually learned must be characterized 
by both inward and outward perfections; they 
 
+F20 &amp;Qur'an 39:12; 13:17.  
 
+P34 
must possess a good character, an enlightened nature, 
a pure intent, as well as intellectual power, brilliance 
and discernment, intuition, discretion and foresight, 
temperance, reverence, and a heartfelt fear of God.  For 
an unlit candle, however great in diameter and tall, is 
no better than a barren palm tree or a pile of dead 
wood.  
 
         "The flower-faced may sulk or play the flirt, 
          The cruel fair may bridle and coquet; 
          But coyness in the ugly is ill-met, 
          And pain in a blind eye's a double hurt."+F20a  
 
     An authoritative Tradition states:  "As for him who 
is one of the learned:+F21  he must guard himself, defend 
his faith, oppose his passions and obey the commandments 
of his Lord.  It is then the duty of the people to 
pattern themselves after him."  Since these illustrious 
and holy words embody all the conditions of learning, 
a brief commentary on their meaning is appropriate.  
Whoever is lacking in these divine qualifications and 
does not demonstrate these inescapable requirements in 
his own life, should not be referred to as learned and 
is not worthy to serve as a model for the believers.  
     The first of these requirements is to guard one's own 
self.  It is obvious that this does not refer to protecting 
oneself from calamities and material tests, for the 
 
+F20a &amp;Rumi, The &amp;Mathnavi, I, 1906-1907.  
+F21 &amp;Ulama', from the Arabic &amp;alima, to know, may be translated 
+F21 learned men, scientists, religious authorities.  
 
+P35 
Prophets and saints were, each and every one, subjected 
to the bitterest afflictions that the world has to offer, 
and were targets for all the cruelties and aggressions of 
mankind.  They sacrificed their lives for the welfare of 
the people, and with all their hearts they hastened to 
the place of their martyrdom; and with their inward 
and outward perfections they arrayed humanity in new 
garments of excellent qualities, both acquired and inborn.  
The primary meaning of this guarding of oneself 
is to acquire the attributes of spiritual and material perfection. 

     The first attribute of perfection is learning and the 
cultural attainments of the mind, and this eminent station 
is achieved when the individual combines in himself 
a thorough knowledge of those complex and 
transcendental realities pertaining to God, of the fundamental 
truths of &amp;Qur'anic political and religious law, 
of the contents of the sacred Scriptures of other faiths, 
and of those regulations and procedures which would 
contribute to the progress and civilization of this distinguished 
country.  He should in addition be informed 
as to the laws and principles, the customs, conditions 
and manners, and the material and moral virtues characterizing 
the statecraft of other nations, and should 
be well versed in all the useful branches of learning of 
the day, and study the historical records of bygone 
governments and peoples.  For if a learned individual 
has no knowledge of the sacred Scriptures and the entire 
field of divine and natural science, of religious 
 
+P36 
jurisprudence and the arts of government and the 
varied learning of the time and the great events of history, 
he might prove unequal to an emergency, and 
this is inconsistent with the necessary qualification of 
comprehensive knowledge.  
     If for example a spiritually learned Muslim is conducting 
a debate with a Christian and he knows nothing 
of the glorious melodies of the Gospel, he will, no 
matter how much he imparts of the &amp;Qur'an and its 
truths, be unable to convince the Christian, and his 
words will fall on deaf ears.  Should, however, the 
Christian observe that the Muslim is better versed in 
the fundamentals of Christianity than the Christian 
priests themselves, and understands the purport of the 
Scriptures even better than they, he will gladly accept 
the Muslim's arguments, and he would indeed have no 
other recourse.  
     When the Chief of the Exile+F22 came into the presence 
of that Luminary of divine wisdom, of salvation 
and certitude, the &amp;Imam &amp;Rida--had the &amp;Imam, that 
mine of knowledge, failed in the course of their interview 
to base his arguments on authority appropriate 
and familiar to the Exilarch, the latter would never 
have acknowledged the greatness of His Holiness.  
 
+F22 The Resh Galuta, a prince or ruler of the exiles in Babylon, 
+F22 to whom Jews, wherever they were, paid tribute.  
 
+P37 
     The state is, moreover, based upon two potent 
forces, the legislative and the executive.  The 
focal center of the executive power is the 
government, while that of the legislative is the learned 
--and if this latter great support and pillar should prove 
defective, how is it conceivable that the state should 
stand?  
     In view of the fact that at the present time such 
fully developed and comprehensively learned individuals 
are hard to come by, and the government and people 
are in dire need of order and direction, it is essential 
to establish a body of scholars the various groups of 
whose membership would each be expert in one of the 
aforementioned branches of knowledge.  This body 
should with the greatest energy and vigor deliberate as 
to all present and future requirements, and bring about 
equilibrium and order.  
     Up to now the religious law has not been given a 
decisive role in our courts, because each of the &amp;ulama 
has been handing down decrees as he saw fit, based on 
his arbitrary interpretation and personal opinion.  For 
example, two men will go to law, and one of the &amp;ulama 
will find for the plaintiff and another for the defendant.  
It may even happen that in one and the same case two 
conflicting decisions will be handed down by the same 
mujtahid, on the grounds that he was inspired first in 
 
+P38 
one direction and then in the other.  There can be no 
doubt that this state of affairs has confused every important 
issue and must jeopardize the very foundations 
of society.  For neither the plaintiff nor the defendant 
ever loses hope of eventual success, and each in turn 
will waste his life in the attempt to secure a later verdict 
which would reverse the previous one.  Their entire 
time is thus given over to litigation, with the result that 
their life instead of being devoted to beneficial undertakings 
and necessary personal affairs, is completely involved 
with the dispute.  Indeed, these two litigants 
might just as well be dead, for they can serve their government 
and community not a particle.  If, however, a 
definite and final verdict were forthcoming, the duly 
convicted party would perforce give up all hope of reopening 
the case, and would then be relieved on that 
score and would go back to looking after his own concerns 
and those of others.  
     Since the primary means for securing the peace and 
tranquillity of the people, and the most effective agency 
for the advancement of high and low alike, is this all-important 
matter, it is incumbent on those learned 
members of the great consultative assembly who are 
thoroughly versed in the Divine law to evolve a single, 
direct and definite procedure for the settlement of litigations.  
This instrument should then be published 
throughout the country by order of the king, and its 
provisions should be strictly adhered to.  This all-important 
question requires the most urgent attention.  
 
+P39 
     The second attribute of perfection is justice and
impartiality.  
This means to have no regard for one's own 
personal benefits and selfish advantages, and to carry 
out the laws of God without the slightest concern for 
anything else.  It means to see one's self as only one of 
the servants of God, the All-Possessing, and except for 
aspiring to spiritual distinction, never attempting to be 
singled out from the others.  It means to consider the 
welfare of the community as one's own.  It means, in 
brief, to regard humanity as a single individual, and 
one's own self as a member of that corporeal form, and 
to know of a certainty that if pain or injury afflicts any 
member of that body, it must inevitably result in suffering 
for all the rest.  
     The third requirement of perfection is to arise with 
complete sincerity and purity of purpose to educate the 
masses:  to exert the utmost effort to instruct them in 
the various branches of learning and useful sciences, to 
encourage the development of modern progress, to 
widen the scope of commerce, industry and the arts, to 
further such measures as will increase the people's 
wealth.  For the mass of the population is uninformed as 
to these vital agencies which would constitute an immediate 
remedy for society's chronic ills.  
     It is essential that scholars and the spiritually learned 
should undertake in all sincerity and purity of intent 
and for the sake of God alone, to counsel and exhort 
the masses and clarify their vision with that collyrium 
which is knowledge.  For today the people out of the 
 
+P40 
depths of their superstition, imagine that any individual 
who believes in God and His signs, and in the Prophets 
and Divine Revelations and laws, and is a devout 
and God-fearing person, must of necessity remain idle 
and spend his days in sloth, so as to be considered in 
the sight of God as one who has forsaken the world 
and its vanities, set his heart on the life to come, and 
isolated himself from human beings in order to draw 
nearer to God.  Since this theme will be developed elsewhere 
in the present text, We shall leave it for the 
moment.  
     Other attributes of perfection are to fear God, to love 
God by loving His servants, to exercise mildness and 
forbearance and calm, to be sincere, amenable, clement 
and compassionate; to have resolution and courage, 
trustworthiness and energy, to strive and struggle, to be 
generous, loyal, without malice, to have zeal and a 
sense of honor, to be high-minded and magnanimous, 
and to have regard for the rights of others.  Whoever is 
lacking in these excellent human qualities is defective.  
If We were to explain the inner meanings of each one 
of these attributes, "the poem would take up seventy 
maunds+F22a of paper."  
 
+F22a A measure of weight, in &amp;Tihran equivalent to six and
two-thirds 
+F22a pounds.  
 
+P41 
     The second of these spiritual standards which 
apply to the possessor of knowledge is that 
he should be the defender of his faith.  It is 
obvious that these holy words do not refer exclusively 
to searching out the implications of the Law, observing 
the forms of worship, avoiding greater and lesser sins, 
practicing the religious ordinances, and by all these 
methods, protecting the Faith.  They mean rather that 
the whole population should be protected in every 
way; that every effort should be exerted to adopt a combination 
of all possible measures to raise up the Word 
of God, increase the number of believers, promote the 
Faith of God and exalt it and make it victorious over 
other religions.  
     If, indeed, the Muslim religious authorities had persevered 
along these lines as they ought to have done, by 
now every nation on earth would have been gathered 
into the shelter of the unity of God and the bright fire 
of "that He may make it victorious over every other 
religion"+F23 would have flamed out like the sun in the 
midmost heart of the world.  
     Fifteen centuries after Christ, Luther, who was 
originally one of the twelve members of a Catholic religious 
body at the center of the Papal government and 
later on initiated the Protestant religious belief, opposed 
 
+F23 &amp;Qur'an 9:33; 48:28; 61:9.  
 
+P42 
the Pope on certain points of doctrine such as the 
prohibition of monastic marriage, the revering and bowing 
down before images of the Apostles and Christian 
leaders of the past, and various other religious practices 
and ceremonies which were accretional to the ordinances 
of the Gospel.  Although at that period the 
power of the Pope was so great and he was regarded 
with such awe that the kings of Europe shook and 
trembled before him, and he held control of all 
Europe's major concerns in the grasp of his might-- 
nevertheless because Luther's position as regards the 
freedom of religious leaders to marry, the abstention 
from worshiping and making prostrations before 
images and representations hung in the churches, and 
the abrogation of ceremonials which had been added 
on to the Gospel, was demonstrably correct, and because 
the proper means were adopted for the promulgation 
of his views:  within these last four hundred and 
some years the majority of the population of America, 
four-fifths of Germany and England and a large percentage 
of Austrians, in sum about one hundred and 
twenty-five million people drawn from other Christian 
denominations, have entered the Protestant Church.  
The leaders of this religion are still making every effort 
to promote it, and today on the East Coast of Africa, 
ostensibly to emancipate the Sudanese and various 
Negro peoples, they have established schools and colleges 
and are training and civilizing completely savage 
African tribes, while their true and primary purpose 
 
+P43 
is to convert some of the Muslim Negro tribes to Protestantism.  
Every community is toiling for the advancement 
of its people, and we (i.e., Muslims) sleep on!  
     Although it was not clear what purpose impelled 
this man or where he was tending, see how the zealous 
efforts of Protestant leaders have spread his doctrines 
far and wide.  
     Now if the illustrious people of the one true God, 
the recipients of His confirmations, the objects of His 
Divine assistance, should put forth all their strength, 
and with complete dedication, relying upon God and 
turning aside from all else but Him, should adopt procedures 
for spreading the Faith and should bend all 
their efforts to this end, it is certain that His Divine 
light would envelop the whole earth.  
     A few, who are unaware of the reality below the 
surface of events, who cannot feel the pulse of the 
world under their fingers, who do not know what a 
massive dose of truth must be administered to heal this 
chronic old disease of falsehood, believe that the Faith 
can only be spread by the sword, and bolster their 
opinion with the Tradition, "I am a Prophet by the 
sword."  If, however, they would carefully examine this 
question, they would see that in this day and age the 
sword is not a suitable means for promulgating the 
Faith, for it would only fill peoples' hearts with revulsion 
and terror.  According to the Divine Law of &amp;Muhammad, 
it is not permissible to compel the People of 
the Book to acknowledge and accept the Faith.  While 
 
+P44 
it is a sacred obligation devolving on every conscientious 
believer in the unity of God to guide mankind to the 
truth, the Traditions "I am a Prophet by the sword" 
and "I am commanded to threaten the lives of the 
people until they say, `There is none other God but 
God'" referred to the idolaters of the Days of Ignorance, 
who in their blindness and bestiality had sunk 
below the level of human beings.  A faith born of sword 
thrusts could hardly be relied upon, and would for any 
trifling cause revert to error and unbelief.  After the 
ascension of &amp;Muhammad, and His passing to "the seat 
of truth, in the presence of the potent King,"+F24 the 
tribes around Medina apostatized from their Faith, 
turning back to the idolatry of pagan times.  
     Remember when the holy breaths of the Spirit of 
God (Jesus) were shedding their sweetness over Palestine 
and Galilee, over the shores of Jordan and the regions 
around Jerusalem, and the wondrous melodies of 
the Gospel were sounding in the ears of the spiritually 
illumined, all the peoples of Asia and Europe, of Africa 
and America, of Oceania, which comprises the islands 
and archipelagoes of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, 
were fire-worshipers and pagans, ignorant of the Divine 
Voice that spoke out on the Day of the Covenant.+F25  
Alone the Jews believed in the divinity and oneness 
of God.  Following the declaration of Jesus, the pure 
 
+F24 &amp;Qur'an 54:55.  
+F25 &amp;Qur'an 7:171:  Yawm-i-Alast, the Day when God, addressing 
+F25 Adam's posterity-to-be, said to them, "Am I not your Lord?"  
+F25 (a-lastu bi Rabbikum) and they replied:  "Yea, we bear
witness."  
 
+P45 
and reviving breath of His mouth conferred eternal 
life on the inhabitants of those regions for a period of 
three years, and through Divine Revelation the Law 
of Christ, at that time the vital remedy for the ailing 
body of the world, was established.  In the days of 
Jesus only a few individuals turned their faces toward 
God; in fact only the twelve disciples and a few women 
truly became believers, and one of the disciples, Judas 
Iscariot apostatized from his Faith, leaving eleven.  
After the ascension of Jesus to the Realm of Glory, 
these few souls stood up with their spiritual qualities 
and with deeds that were pure and holy, and they arose 
by the power of God and the life-giving breaths of the 
Messiah to save all the peoples of the earth.  Then all 
the idolatrous nations as well as the Jews rose up in 
their might to kill the Divine fire that had been lit in 
the lamp of Jerusalem.  "Fain would they put out God's 
light with their mouths:  but God hath willed to perfect 
His light, albeit the infidels abhor it."+F26  Under the 
fiercest tortures, they did every one of these holy souls 
to death; with butchers' cleavers, they chopped the pure 
and undefiled bodies of some of them to pieces and 
burned them in furnaces, and they stretched some of 
the followers on the rack and then buried them alive.  
In spite of this agonizing requital, the Christians continued 
to teach the Cause of God, and they never drew 
a sword from its scabbard or even so much as grazed a 
cheek.  Then in the end the Faith of Christ encompassed 
 
+F26 &amp;Qur'an 9:33.  
 
+P46 
the whole earth, so that in Europe and America 
no traces of other religions were left, and today in Asia 
and Africa and Oceania, large masses of people are 
living within the sanctuary of the Four Gospels.  
     It has now by the above irrefutable proofs been fully 
established that the Faith of God must be propagated 
through human perfections, through qualities that are 
excellent and pleasing, and spiritual behavior.  If a soul 
of his own accord advances toward God he will be accepted 
at the Threshold of Oneness, for such a one is 
free of personal considerations, of greed and selfish interests, 
and he has taken refuge within the sheltering 
protection of his Lord.  He will become known among 
men as trustworthy and truthful, temperate and scrupulous, 
high-minded and loyal, incorruptible and God-fearing.  
In this way the primary purpose in revealing 
the Divine Law--which is to bring about happiness in 
the after life and civilization and the refinement of 
character in this--will be realized.  As for the sword, 
it will only produce a man who is outwardly a believer, 
and inwardly a traitor and apostate.  
 
     We shall here relate a story that will serve as 
an example to all.  The Arabian chronicles 
tell how, at a time prior to the advent of 
&amp;Muhammad, &amp;Nu'man son of &amp;Mundhir the Lakhmite 
 
+P47 
--an Arab king in the Days of Ignorance, whose seat 
of government was the city of &amp;Hirih--had one day returned 
so often to his wine-cup that his mind clouded 
over and his reason deserted him.  In this drunken and 
insensible condition he gave orders that his two boon 
companions, his close and much-loved friends, &amp;Khalid 
son of Mudallil and &amp;Amr son of &amp;Mas'ud-Kaldih, should 
be put to death.  When he wakened after his carousal, 
he inquired for the two friends and was given the 
grievous news.  He was sick at heart, and because of his 
intense love and longing for them, he built two 
splendid monuments over their two graves and he 
named these the Smeared-With-Blood.  
     Then he set apart two days out of the year, in memory 
of the two companions, and he called one of them 
the Day of Evil and one the Day of Grace.  Every year 
on these two appointed days he would issue forth with 
pomp and circumstance and sit between the monuments.  
If, on the Day of Evil, his eye fell on any soul, 
that person would be put to death; but on the Day of 
Grace, whoever passed would be overwhelmed with 
gifts and benefits.  Such was his rule, sealed with a 
mighty oath and always rigidly observed.  
     One day the king mounted his horse, that was called 
&amp;Mahmud, and rode out into the plains to hunt.  Suddenly 
in the distance he caught sight of a wild donkey.  
&amp;Nu'man urged on his horse to overtake it, and galloped 
away at such speed that he was cut off from his retinue.  
As night approached, the king was hopelessly lost.  
 
+P48 
Then he made out a tent, far off in the desert, and he 
turned his horse and headed toward it.  When he 
reached the entrance of the tent he asked, "Will you 
receive a guest?"  The owner (who was &amp;Hanzala, son 
of &amp;Abi-Ghafray-i-Ta'i) replied, "Yea."  He came forward 
and helped &amp;Nu'man to dismount.  Then he went 
to his wife and told her, "There are clear signs of greatness 
in the bearing of this person.  Do your best to show 
him hospitality, and make ready a feast."  His wife said, 
"We have a ewe.  Sacrifice it.  And I have saved a little 
flour against such a day."  &amp;Hanzala first milked the ewe 
and carried a bowl of milk to &amp;Nu'man, and then he 
slaughtered her and prepared a meal; and what with 
his friendliness and loving-kindness, &amp;Nu'man spent 
that night in peace and comfort.  When dawn came, 
&amp;Nu'man made ready to leave, and he said to &amp;Hanzala:  
"You have shown me the utmost generosity, receiving 
and feasting me.  I am &amp;Nu'man, son of &amp;Mundhir, and I 
shall eagerly await your arrival at my court."  
     Time passed, and famine fell on the land of &amp;Tayy.  
&amp;Hanzala was in dire need and for this reason he sought 
out the king.  By a strange coincidence he arrived on the 
Day of Evil.  &amp;Nu'man was greatly troubled in spirit.  He 
began to reproach his friend, saying, "Why did you 
come to your friend on this day of all days?  For this is 
the Day of Evil, that is, the Day of Wrath and the Day 
of Distress.  This day, should my eyes alight on &amp;Qabus, 
my only son, he should not escape with his life.  Now 
ask me whatever favor you will."  
 
+P49 
     &amp;Hanzala said:  "I knew nothing of your Day of Evil.  
As for the gifts of this life, they are meant for the living, 
and since I at this hour must drink of death, what 
can all the world's storehouses avail me now?"  
     &amp;Nu'man said, "There is no help for this."  
     &amp;Hanzala told him:  "Respite me, then, that I may go 
back to my wife and make my testament.  Next year 
I shall return, on the Day of Evil."  
     &amp;Nu'man then asked for a guarantor, so that, if &amp;Hanzala 
should break his word, this guarantor would be put 
to death instead.  &amp;Hanzala, helpless and bewildered, 
looked about him.  Then his gaze fell on one of 
&amp;Nu'man's retinue, &amp;Sharik, son of &amp;Amr, son of Qays of 
&amp;Shayban, and to him he recited these lines:  "O my 
partner, O son of &amp;Amr!  Is there any escape from death?  
O brother of every afflicted one!  O brother of him who 
is brotherless!  O brother of &amp;Nu'man, in thee today is a 
surety for the &amp;Shaykh.  Where is &amp;Shayban the noble-- 
may the All-Merciful favor him!"  But &amp;Sharik only 
answered, "O my brother, a man cannot gamble with 
his life."  At this the victim could not tell where to turn.  
Then a man named &amp;Qarad, son of &amp;Adja' the Kalbite 
stood up and offered himself as a surety, agreeing that, 
should he fail on the next Day of Wrath to deliver up 
the victim, the king might do with him, &amp;Qarad, as he 
wished.  &amp;Nu'man then bestowed five hundred camels on 
&amp;Hanzala, and sent him home.  
     In the following year on the Day of Evil, as soon 
as the true dawn broke in the sky, &amp;Nu'man as was his 
 
+P50 
custom set out with pomp and pageantry and made for 
the two mausoleums called the Smeared-With-Blood.  
He brought &amp;Qarad along, to wreak his kingly wrath 
upon him.  The pillars of the state then loosed their 
tongues and begged for mercy, imploring the king to 
respite &amp;Qarad until sundown, for they hoped that 
&amp;Hanzala might yet return; but the king's purpose was 
to spare the life of &amp;Hanzala, and to requite his hospitality 
by putting &amp;Qarad to death in his place.  As the 
sun began to set, they stripped off the garments of 
&amp;Qarad, and made ready to sever his head.  At that 
moment a rider appeared in the distance, galloping at 
top speed.  &amp;Nu'man said to the swordsman, "Why delayest 
thou?"  The ministers said, "Perchance it is &amp;Hanzala 
who comes."  And when the rider drew near, they 
saw it was none other.  
     &amp;Nu'man was sorely displeased.  He said, "Thou fool!  
Thou didst slip away once from the clutching fingers 
of death; must thou provoke him now a second time?"  
     And &amp;Hanzala answered, "Sweet in my mouth and 
pleasant on my tongue is the poison of death, at the 
thought of redeeming my pledge."  
     &amp;Nu'man asked, "What could be the reason for this 
trustworthiness, this regard for thine obligation and this 
concern for thine oath?"  And &amp;Hanzala answered, "It 
is my faith in the one God and in the Books that have 
come down from heaven."  &amp;Nu'man asked, "What Faith 
dost thou profess?"  And &amp;Hanzala said, "It was the holy 
breaths of Jesus that brought me to life.  I follow the 
 
+P51 
straight pathway of Christ, the Spirit of God."  &amp;Nu'man 
said, "Let me inhale these sweet aromas of the Spirit."  
     So it was that &amp;Hanzala drew out the white hand of 
guidance from the bosom of the love of God,+F27 and illumined 
the sight and the insight of the beholders with 
the Gospel light.  After he had in bell-like accents recited 
some of the divine verses out of the Evangel, 
&amp;Nu'man and all his ministers sickened of their idols 
and their idol-worship and were confirmed in the Faith 
of God.  And they said, "Alas, a thousand times alas, 
that up to now we were careless of this infinite mercy 
and veiled away therefrom, and were bereft of this rain 
from the clouds of the grace of God."  Then straightway 
the king tore down the two monuments called 
the Smeared-With-Blood, and he repented of his 
tyranny and established justice in the land.  
 
+F27 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 27:12, referring to Moses:  "Put now thy hand 
+F27 into thy bosom:  it shall come forth white ... one of nine
signs 
+F27 to Pharaoh and his people...."  Also &amp;Qur'an 7:105; 20:23;
26:32; 
+F27 and 28:32.  Also Exodus 4:6.  See too Edward Fitzgerald's The 
+F27 Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam:  
+F27      Now the New Year reviving old Desires, 
+F27      The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires, 
+F27      Where the White Hand of Moses on the Bough 
+F27      Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.  
+F27 The metaphors here refer to white blossoms and the perfumes of

+F27 spring.  
 
+P52 
     Observe how one individual, and he a man of 
the desert, to outward seeming unknown and 
of no station--because he showed forth one 
of the qualities of the pure in heart, was able to deliver 
this proud sovereign and a great company of others 
from the dark night of unbelief and guide them into 
the morning of salvation; to save them from the perdition 
of idolatry and bring them to the shores of the 
oneness of God, and to put an end to practices of the 
sort which blight a whole society and reduce the peoples 
to barbarism.  One must think deeply over this, 
and grasp its meaning.  
 
     My heart aches, for I note with intense regret 
that the attention of the people is nowhere 
directed toward that which is worthy of 
this day and time.  The Sun of Truth has risen above 
the world but we are ensnared in the dark of our 
imaginings.  The waters of the Most Great Sea are 
surging all around us, while we are parched and weak 
with thirst.  The divine bread is coming down from 
 
+P53 
heaven, and yet we grope and stumble in a famine-stricken 
land.  "Between the weeping and the telling, 
I spin out my days."  
     One of the principal reasons why people of other 
religions have shunned and failed to become converted 
to the Faith of God is fanaticism and unreasoning religious 
zeal.  See for example the divine words that were 
addressed to &amp;Muhammad, the Ark of Salvation, the 
Luminous Countenance and Lord of Men, bidding 
Him to be gentle with the people and long-suffering:  
"Debate with them in the kindliest manner."+F28  That 
Blessed Tree Whose light was "neither of the East nor 
of the West"+F29 and Who cast over all the peoples of 
the earth the sheltering shade of a measureless grace, 
showed forth infinite kindness and forbearance in His 
dealings with every one.  In these words, likewise, were 
Moses and Aaron commanded to challenge Pharaoh, 
Lord of the Stakes:+F30  "Speak ye to him with gentle 
speech."+F31  
     Although the noble conduct of the Prophets and 
Holy Ones of God is widely known, and it is indeed, 
until the coming of the Hour,+F32 in every aspect of life 
 
+F28 &amp;Qur'an 16:126.  
+F29 &amp;Qur'an 24:35.  
+F30 &amp;Dhu'l-Awtad is variously rendered by translators of the 
+F30 &amp;Qur'an as The Impaler, The Contriver of the Stakes, The Lord 
+F30 of a Strong Dominion, The One Surrounded by Ministers, etc.  
+F30 &amp;Awtad means pegs or tent stakes.  See &amp;Qur'an 38:11 and 89:9. 

+F31 &amp;Qur'an 20:46.  
+F32 &amp;Qur'an 33:63:  "Men will ask Thee of `the Hour.'  Say:  The 
+F32 knowledge of it is with God alone."  Cf. also 22:1, "the
earthquake 
+F32 of the Hour," etc.  See also Matthew 24:36, 42, etc.  To 
+F32 &amp;Baha'is, this refers to the Advent of the &amp;Bab and
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P54 
an excellent pattern for all mankind to follow, nevertheless 
some have remained neglectful of and separated 
from these qualities of extraordinary sympathy and 
loving-kindness, and have been prevented from attaining 
to the inner significances of the Holy Books.  Not 
only do they scrupulously shun the adherents of religions 
other than their own, they do not even permit 
themselves to show them common courtesy.  If one is 
not allowed to associate with another, how can one 
guide him out of the dark and empty night of denial, 
of "there-is-no-God," into the bright morning of belief, 
and the affirmation, "but God."+F33  And how can one 
urge him on and encourage him to rise up out of the 
abyss of perdition and ignorance and climb the heights 
of salvation and knowledge?  Consider justly:  had not 
&amp;Hanzala treated &amp;Nu'man with true friendship, showing 
him kindness and hospitality, could he have brought the 
King and a great number of other idolaters to acknowledge 
the unity of God?  To keep aloof from people, to 
shun them, to be harsh with them, will make them 
shrink away, while affection and consideration, mildness 
and forbearance will attract their hearts toward 
God.  If a true believer when meeting an individual 
from a foreign country should express revulsion, and 
 
+F33 Cf. the Islamic confession of faith, sometimes called the two 
+F33 testimonies:  "I testify that there is no God but God and
&amp;Muhammad 
+F33 is the Prophet of God."  
 
+P55 
should speak the horrible words forbidding association 
with foreigners and referring to them as "unclean," the 
stranger would be grieved and offended to such a point 
that he would never accept the Faith, even if he should 
see, taking place before his very eyes, the miracle of 
the splitting of the moon.  The results of shunning him 
would be this, that if there had been in his heart some 
faint inclination toward God, he would repent of it, 
and would flee away from the sea of faith into the 
wastes of oblivion and unbelief.  And upon returning 
home to his own country he would publish in the press 
statements to the effect that such and such a nation 
was utterly lacking in the qualifications of a civilized 
people.  
     If we ponder a while over the &amp;Qur'anic verses and 
proofs, and the traditional accounts which have come 
down to us from those stars of the heaven of Divine 
Unity, the Holy &amp;Imams, we shall be convinced of the 
fact that if a soul is endowed with the attributes of true 
faith and characterized with spiritual qualities he will 
become to all mankind an emblem of the outstretched 
mercies of God.  For the attributes of the people of faith 
are justice and fair-mindedness; forbearance and compassion 
and generosity; consideration for others; candor, 
trustworthiness, and loyalty; love and loving-kindness; 
devotion and determination and humanity.  If therefore 
an individual is truly righteous, he will avail himself 
of all those means which will attract the hearts of 
men, and through the attributes of God he will draw 
 
+P56 
them to the straight path of faith and cause them to 
drink from the river of everlasting life.  
     Today we have closed our eyes to every righteous act 
and have sacrificed the abiding happiness of society to 
our own transitory profit.  We regard fanaticism and 
zealotry as redounding to our credit and honor, and not 
content with this, we denounce one another and plot 
each other's ruin, and whenever we wish to put on a 
show of wisdom and learning, of virtue and godliness, 
we set about mocking and reviling this one and that.  
"The ideas of such a one," we say, "are wide of the 
mark, and so-and-so's behavior leaves much to be desired.  
The religious observances of Zayd are few and 
far between, and &amp;Amr is not firm in his faith.  So-and-so's 
opinions smack of Europe.  Fundamentally, Blank 
thinks of nothing but his own name and fame.  Last 
night when the congregation stood up to pray, the row 
was out of line, and it is not permissible to follow a 
different leader.  No rich man has died this month, and 
nothing has been offered to charity in memory of the 
Prophet.  The edifice of religion has crumbled, the 
foundations of faiths have been blown to the winds.  
The carpet of belief has been rolled up, the tokens of 
certitude blotted out; the whole world has fallen into 
error; when it comes to repelling tyranny all are soft 
and remiss.  Days and months have passed away, and 
these villages and estates still belong to the same owners 
as they did last year.  In this town there used to be seventy 
different governments functioning in good order, 
 
+P57 
but the number has steadily decreased; there are only 
twenty-five left now, as a memento.  It used to be that 
two hundred contradictory judgments were handed 
down by the same &amp;mufti in any one day, now we hardly 
get fifty.  In those days there were crowds of people 
who were all brainsick with litigation, and now they 
rest in peace; today the plaintiff would be defeated and 
the defendant victorious, tomorrow the plaintiff won 
the case and the defendant lost it--but now this excellent 
practice has been abandoned too.  What is this 
heathenish religion, this idolatrous kind of error!  Alas 
for the Law, alas for the Faith, alas for all these calamities!  
O Brothers in the Faith!  This is surely the end 
of the world!  The Judgment is coming!"  
     With words such as these they assault the minds of 
the helpless masses and disturb the hearts of the already 
bewildered poor, who know nothing of the true 
state of affairs and the real basis for all such talk, and 
remain completely unaware of the fact that a thousand 
selfish purposes are concealed behind the supposedly 
religious eloquence of certain individuals.  They imagine 
that speakers of this type are motivated by virtuous 
zeal, when the truth is that such individuals keep up a 
great hue and cry because they see their own personal 
ruin in the welfare of the masses, and believe that if 
the people's eyes are opened, their own light will go 
out.  Only the keenest insight will detect the fact that 
if the hearts of these individuals were really impelled 
by righteousness and the fear of God, the fragrance of 
 
+P58 
it would, like musk, be spreading everywhere.  Nothing 
in the world can ever be supported by words alone.  
 
          But these ill-omened owls have done a wrong, 
          And learned to sing as the white falcon sings.  
          And what of Sheba's message that the lapwing brings 
          If the bittern learn to sing the lapwing's song?+F34  
 
     The spiritually learned, those who have derived infinite 
significance and wisdom from the Book of Divine 
Revelation, and whose illumined hearts draw inspiration 
from the unseen world of God, certainly exert their 
efforts to bring about the supremacy of the true followers 
of God, in all respects and above all peoples, 
and they toil and struggle to make use of every agency 
that will conduce to progress.  If any man neglects 
these high purposes he can never prove acceptable in 
the sight of God; he stands out with all his shortcomings 
and claims perfection, and destitute, pretends to 
wealth.  
 
          One sluggish, blind and surly's a poor thing, 
          "A lump of flesh, without a foot or wing."  
          How far is he who apes and makes a show 
          From the illumined, who doth truly know.  
          One but an echo, though it's clear and sharp, 
          And one, the Psalmist David with his harp.  
 
     Knowledge, purity, devotion, discipline, independence, 
have nothing to do with outer appearance and 
dress.  Once in the course of My travels I heard an 
 
+F34 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 27:20 ff.  
 
+P59 
eminent personage make the following excellent remark, 
the wit and charm of which remain in memory:  
"Not every cleric's turban is a proof of continence and 
knowledge; not every layman's hat a sign of ignorance 
and immorality.  How many a hat has proudly raised 
the banner of knowledge, how many a turban pulled 
down the Law of God!"  
 
     The third element of the utterance under discussion 
is, "opposes his passions."  How wonderful 
are the implications of this deceptively 
easy, all-inclusive phrase.  This is the very foundation 
of every laudable human quality; indeed, these few 
words embody the light of the world, the impregnable 
basis of all the spiritual attributes of human beings.  
This is the balance wheel of all behavior, the means of 
keeping all man's good qualities in equilibrium.  
     For desire is a flame that has reduced to ashes uncounted 
lifetime harvests of the learned, a devouring 
fire that even the vast sea of their accumulated knowledge 
could never quench.  How often has it happened 
that an individual who was graced with every attribute 
of humanity and wore the jewel of true understanding, 
nevertheless followed after his passions until his excellent 
qualities passed beyond moderation and he was 
forced into excess.  His pure intentions changed to evil 
 
+P60 
ones, his attributes were no longer put to uses worthy 
of them, and the power of his desires turned him aside 
from righteousness and its rewards into ways that were 
dangerous and dark.  A good character is in the sight of 
God and His chosen ones and the possessors of insight, 
the most excellent and praiseworthy of all things, but 
always on condition that its center of emanation should 
be reason and knowledge and its base should be true 
moderation.  Were the implications of this subject to be 
developed as they deserve the work would grow too 
long and our main theme would be lost to view.  
     All the peoples of Europe, notwithstanding their 
vaunted civilization, sink and drown in this terrifying 
sea of passion and desire, and this is why all the phenomena 
of their culture come to nothing.  Let no one 
wonder at this statement or deplore it.  The primary 
purpose, the basic objective, in laying down powerful 
laws and setting up great principles and institutions 
dealing with every aspect of civilization, is human happiness; 
and human happiness consists only in drawing 
closer to the Threshold of Almighty God, and in securing 
the peace and well-being of every individual member, 
high and low alike, of the human race; and the 
supreme agencies for accomplishing these two objectives 
are the excellent qualities with which humanity 
has been endowed.  
     A superficial culture, unsupported by a cultivated 
morality, is as "a confused medley of dreams,"+F35 and 
 
+F35 &amp;Qur'an 12:44; 21:5.  
 
+P61 
external lustre without inner perfection is "like a vapor 
in the desert which the thirsty dreameth to be water."+F36  
For results which would win the good pleasure of God 
and secure the peace and well-being of man, could 
never be fully achieved in a merely external civilization.  
     The peoples of Europe have not advanced to the 
higher planes of moral civilization, as their opinions 
and behavior clearly demonstrate.  Notice, for example, 
how the supreme desire of European governments and 
peoples today is to conquer and crush one another, and 
how, while harboring the greatest secret repulsion, they 
spend their time exchanging expressions of neighborly 
affection, friendship and harmony.  
     There is the well-known case of the ruler who is 
fostering peace and tranquillity and at the same time 
devoting more energy than the warmongers to the accumulation 
of weapons and the building up of a larger 
army, on the grounds that peace and harmony can only 
be brought about by force.  Peace is the pretext, and 
night and day they are all straining every nerve to pile 
up more weapons of war, and to pay for this their 
wretched people must sacrifice most of whatever they 
are able to earn by their sweat and toil.  How many 
thousands have given up their work in useful industries 
and are laboring day and night to produce new and 
deadlier weapons which would spill out the blood of 
the race more copiously than before.  
     Each day they invent a new bomb or explosive and 
 
+F36 &amp;Qur'an 24:39.  
 
+P62 
then the governments must abandon their obsolete arms 
and begin producing the new, since the old weapons 
cannot hold their own against the new.  For example 
at this writing, in the year 1292 A.H.+F37 they have invented 
a new rifle in Germany and a bronze cannon in 
Austria, which have greater firepower than the Martini-Henry 
rifle and the Krupp cannon, are more rapid in 
their effects and more efficient in annihilating humankind.  
The staggering cost of it all must be borne by the 
hapless masses.  
     Be just:  can this nominal civilization, unsupported 
by a genuine civilization of character, bring about the 
peace and well-being of the people or win the good 
pleasure of God?  Does it not, rather, connote the destruction 
of man's estate and pull down the pillars of 
happiness and peace?  
     At the time of the Franco-Prussian War, in the year 
1870 of the Christian era, it was reported that 600,000 
men died, broken and beaten, on the field of battle.  
How many a home was torn out by the roots; how many 
a city, flourishing the night before, was toppled down 
by sunrise.  How many a child was orphaned and 
abandoned, how many an old father and mother had to 
see their sons, the young fruit of their lives, twisting 
and dying in dust and blood.  How many women were 
widowed, left without a helper or protector.  
     And then there were the libraries and magnificent 
buildings of France that went up in flames, and the 
 
+F37 1875 A.D.  
 
+P63 
military hospital, packed with sick and wounded men, 
that was set on fire and burned to the ground.  And 
there followed the terrible events of the Commune, 
the savage acts, the ruin and horror when opposing 
factions fought and killed one another in the streets of 
Paris.  There were the hatreds and hostilities between 
Catholic religious leaders and the German government.  
There was the civil strife and uproar, the bloodshed 
and havoc brought on between the partisans of 
the Republic and the Carlists in Spain.  
     Only too many such instances are available to demonstrate 
the fact that Europe is morally uncivilized.  
Since the writer has no wish to cast aspersions on anyone 
He has confined Himself to these few examples.  
It is clear that no perceptive and well-informed mind 
can countenance such events.  Is it right and proper 
that peoples among whom, diametrically opposed to 
the most desirable human behavior, such horrors take 
place, should dare lay claim to a real and adequate 
civilization?  Especially when out of all this no results 
can be hoped for except the winning of a transient 
victory; and since this outcome never endures, it is, to 
the wise, not worth the effort.  
     Time and again down the centuries, the German 
state has subdued the French; over and over, the kingdom 
of France has governed German land.  Is it permissible 
that in our day 600,000 helpless creatures 
should be offered up as a sacrifice to such nominal and 
temporary uses and results?  No, by the Lord God!  Even 
 
+P64 
a child can see the evil of it.  Yet the pursuit of passion 
and desire will wrap the eyes in a thousand veils that 
rise out of the heart to blind the sight and the insight 
as well.  
 
           Desire and self come in the door 
           And blot out virtue, bright before, 
           And a hundred veils will rise 
           From the heart, to blind the eyes.  
 
     True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost 
heart of the world whenever a certain number of 
its distinguished and high-minded sovereigns--the shining 
exemplars of devotion and determination--shall, for 
the good and happiness of all mankind, arise, with firm 
resolve and clear vision, to establish the Cause of Universal 
Peace.  They must make the Cause of Peace the 
object of general consultation, and seek by every means 
in their power to establish a Union of the nations of the 
world.  They must conclude a binding treaty and establish 
a covenant, the provisions of which shall be sound, 
inviolable and definite.  They must proclaim it to all the 
world and obtain for it the sanction of all the human 
race.  This supreme and noble undertaking--the real 
source of the peace and well-being of all the world-- 
should be regarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth.  
All the forces of humanity must be mobilized to ensure 
the stability and permanence of this Most Great Covenant.  
In this all-embracing Pact the limits and frontiers 
of each and every nation should be clearly fixed, the 
 
+P65 
principles underlying the relations of governments towards 
one another definitely laid down, and all international 
agreements and obligations ascertained.  In like 
manner, the size of the armaments of every government 
should be strictly limited, for if the preparations for war 
and the military forces of any nation should be allowed 
to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of others.  
The fundamental principle underlying this solemn 
Pact should be so fixed that if any government later 
violate any one of its provisions, all the governments 
on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submission, 
nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with 
every power at its disposal, to destroy that government.  
Should this greatest of all remedies be applied to the 
sick body of the world, it will assuredly recover from 
its ills and will remain eternally safe and secure.+F38  
     Observe that if such a happy situation be forthcoming, 
no government would need continually to pile up 
the weapons of war, nor feel itself obliged to produce 
ever new military weapons with which to conquer the 
human race.  A small force for the purposes of internal 
security, the correction of criminal and disorderly elements 
and the prevention of local disturbances, would 
be required--no more.  In this way the entire population 
would, first of all, be relieved of the crushing burden 
 
+F38 The foregoing paragraph, together with the later paragraph 
+F38 beginning "A few, unaware of the power latent in human
endeavor," 
+F38 was translated by Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the &amp;Baha'i 
+F38 Faith.  Cf. The World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, pp. 37-38.  
 
+P66 
of expenditure currently imposed for military purposes, 
and secondly, great numbers of people would cease to 
devote their time to the continual devising of new 
weapons of destruction--those testimonials of greed and 
bloodthirstiness, so inconsistent with the gift of life-- 
and would instead bend their efforts to the production 
of whatever will foster human existence and peace and 
well-being, and would become the cause of universal 
development and prosperity.  Then every nation on 
earth will reign in honor, and every people will be 
cradled in tranquillity and content.  
     A few, unaware of the power latent in human endeavor, 
consider this matter as highly impracticable, 
nay even beyond the scope of man's utmost efforts.  
Such is not the case, however.  On the contrary, thanks 
to the unfailing grace of God, the loving-kindness of 
His favored ones, the unrivaled endeavors of wise and 
capable souls, and the thoughts and ideas of the peerless 
leaders of this age, nothing whatsoever can be regarded 
as unattainable.  Endeavor, ceaseless endeavor, 
is required.  Nothing short of an indomitable determination 
can possibly achieve it.  Many a cause which past 
ages have regarded as purely visionary, yet in this day 
has become most easy and practicable.  Why should 
this most great and lofty Cause--the daystar of the 
firmament of true civilization and the cause of the 
glory, the advancement, the well-being and the success 
of all humanity--be regarded as impossible of achievement?  
Surely the day will come when its beauteous 
 
+P67 
light shall shed illumination upon the assemblage of 
man.  
 
     The apparatus of conflict will, as preparations 
go on at their present rate, reach the point 
where war will become something intolerable 
to mankind.  
     It is clear from what has already been said that man's 
glory and greatness do not consist in his being avid for 
blood and sharp of claw, in tearing down cities and 
spreading havoc, in butchering armed forces and civilians.  
What would mean a bright future for him would 
be his reputation for justice, his kindness to the entire 
population whether high or low, his building up countries 
and cities, villages and districts, his making life 
easy, peaceful and happy for his fellow beings, his laying 
down fundamental principles for progress, his raising 
the standards and increasing the wealth of the entire 
population.  
     Consider how throughout history many a king has 
sat on his throne as a conqueror.  Among them were 
&amp;Hulagu &amp;Khan and Tamerlane, who took over the vast 
continent of Asia, and Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon 
I, who stretched their arrogant fists over three 
of the earth's five continents.  And what was gained by 
 
+P68 
all their mighty victories?  Was any country made to 
flourish, did any happiness result, did any throne 
stand?  Or was it rather that those reigning houses lost 
their power?  Except that Asia went up in the flame of 
many battles and fell away to ashes, &amp;Changiz's &amp;Hulagu, 
the warlord, gathered no fruit from all his conquests.  
And Tamerlane, out of all his triumphs, reaped only 
the peoples blown to the winds, and universal ruin.  
And Alexander had nothing to show for his vast victories, 
except that his son toppled from the throne and 
Philip and Ptolemy took over the dominions he once 
had ruled.  And what did the first Napoleon gain from 
subjugating the kings of Europe, except the destruction 
of flourishing countries, the downfall of their inhabitants, 
the spreading of terror and anguish across 
Europe and, at the end of his days, his own captivity?  
So much for the conquerors and the monuments they 
leave behind them.  
     Contrast with this the praiseworthy qualities and the 
greatness and nobility of &amp;Anushirvan the Generous and 
the Just.+F39  That fair-minded monarch came to power at 
a time when the once solidly established throne of Persia 
was about to crumble away.  With his Divine gift 
of intellect, he laid the foundations of justice, uprooting 
oppression and tyranny and gathering the scattered 
peoples of Persia under the wings of his dominion.  
Thanks to the restoring influence of his continual care, 
Persia that had lain withered and desolate was quickened 
 
+F39 &amp;Sasaniyan king who reigned 531-578 A.D.  
 
+P69 
into life and rapidly changed into the fairest of all 
flourishing nations.  He rebuilt and reinforced the disorganized 
powers of the state, and the renown of his 
righteousness and justice echoed across the seven 
climes,+F39a until the peoples rose up out of their degradation 
and misery to the heights of felicity and honor.  
Although he was a Magian, &amp;Muhammad, that Center 
of creation and Sun of prophethood, said of him:  "I 
was born in the time of a just king," and rejoiced at 
having come into the world during his reign.  Did this 
illustrious personage achieve his exalted station by virtue 
of his admirable qualities or rather by reaching out 
to conquer the earth and spill the blood of its peoples?  
Observe that he attained to such a distinguished rank 
in the heart of the world that his greatness still rings 
out through all the impermanence of time, and he won 
eternal life.  Should We comment on the continuing life 
of the great, this brief essay would be unduly prolonged, 
and since it is by no means certain that public 
opinion in Persia will be materially affected by its perusal, 
We shall abridge the work, and go on to other 
matters which come within the purview of the public 
mind.  If, however, it develops that this abridgement 
produces favorable results, We shall, God willing, write 
a number of books dealing at length and usefully with 
fundamental principles of the Divine wisdom in its 
relation to the phenomenal world.  
 
+F39a i.e., the whole world.  
 
+P70 
     No power on earth can prevail against the armies 
of justice, and every citadel must fall before 
them; for men willingly go down under the 
triumphant strokes of this decisive blade, and desolate 
places bloom and flourish under the tramplings of this 
host.  There are two mighty banners which, when they 
cast their shadow across the crown of any king, will 
cause the influence of his government quickly and easily 
to penetrate the whole earth, even as if it were the 
light of the sun:  the first of these two banners is wisdom; 
the second is justice.  Against these two most potent 
forces, the iron hills cannot prevail, and Alexander's 
wall will break before them.  It is clear that life 
in this fast-fading world is as fleeting and inconstant as 
the morning wind, and this being so, how fortunate 
are the great who leave a good name behind them, and 
the memory of a lifetime spent in the pathway of the 
good pleasure of God.  
 
          It is all one, if it be a throne 
          Or the bare ground under the open sky, 
          Where the pure soul lays him 
          Down to die.+F39b  
 
     A conquest can be a praiseworthy thing, and there 
are times when war becomes the powerful basis of 
 
+F39b &amp;Sa'di, The &amp;Gulistan, On the Conduct of Kings.  
 
+P71 
peace, and ruin the very means of reconstruction.  If, 
for example, a high-minded sovereign marshals his 
troops to block the onset of the insurgent and the aggressor, 
or again, if he takes the field and distinguishes 
himself in a struggle to unify a divided state and people, 
if, in brief, he is waging war for a righteous purpose, 
then this seeming wrath is mercy itself, and this 
apparent tyranny the very substance of justice and this 
warfare the cornerstone of peace.  Today, the task befitting 
great rulers is to establish universal peace, for in 
this lies the freedom of all peoples.  
 
     The fourth phrase of the aforementioned Utterance 
which points out the way of salvation 
is:  "obedient to the commandments of his 
Lord."  It is certain that man's highest distinction is to 
be lowly before and obedient to his God; that his greatest 
glory, his most exalted rank and honor, depend on 
his close observance of the Divine commands and prohibitions.  
Religion is the light of the world, and the 
progress, achievement, and happiness of man result 
from obedience to the laws set down in the holy Books.  
Briefly, it is demonstrable that in this life, both outwardly 
and inwardly the mightiest of structures, the 
most solidly established, the most enduring, standing 
 
+P72 
guard over the world, assuring both the spiritual and 
the material perfections of mankind, and protecting the 
happiness and the civilization of society--is religion.  
     It is true that there are foolish individuals who have 
never properly examined the fundamentals of the Divine 
religions, who have taken as their criterion the 
behavior of a few religious hypocrites and measured all 
religious persons by that yardstick, and have on this 
account concluded that religions are an obstacle to 
progress, a divisive factor and a cause of malevolence 
and enmity among peoples.  They have not even observed 
this much, that the principles of the Divine religions 
can hardly be evaluated by the acts of those who 
only claim to follow them.  For every excellent thing, 
peerless though it may be, can still be diverted to the 
wrong ends.  A lighted lamp in the hands of an ignorant 
child or of the blind will not dispel the surrounding 
darkness nor light up the house--it will set both the 
bearer and the house on fire.  Can we, in such an instance, 
blame the lamp?  No, by the Lord God!  To the 
seeing, a lamp is a guide and will show him his path; 
but it is a disaster to the blind.  
     Among those who have repudiated religious faith 
was the Frenchman, Voltaire, who wrote a great number 
of books attacking the religions, works which are 
no better than children's playthings.  This individual, 
taking as his criterion the omissions and commissions 
of the Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic religion, 
and the intrigues and quarrels of the spiritual leaders of 
 
+P73 
Christendom, opened his mouth and caviled at the 
Spirit of God (Jesus).  In the unsoundness of his reasoning, 
he failed to grasp the true significance of the 
sacred Scriptures, took exception to certain portions of 
the revealed Texts and dwelt on the difficulties involved.  
"And We send down of the &amp;Qur'an that which 
is a healing and a mercy to the faithful:  But it shall 
only add to the ruin of the wicked."+F40  
 
          The Sage of &amp;Ghazna+F41 told the mystic story 
          To his veiled hearers, in an allegory:  
          If those who err see naught in the &amp;Qur'an 
          But only words, it's not to wonder on; 
          Of all the sun's fire, lighting up the sky 
          Only the warmth can reach a blind man's eye.+F42  
 
"Many will He mislead by such parables and many 
guide:  but none will He mislead thereby except the 
wicked..."+F43  
     It is certain that the greatest of instrumentalities for 
achieving the advancement and the glory of man, the 
supreme agency for the enlightenment and the redemption 
of the world, is love and fellowship and unity 
among all the members of the human race.  Nothing 
can be effected in the world, not even conceivably, 
without unity and agreement, and the perfect means 
for engendering fellowship and union is true religion.  
 
+F40 &amp;Qur'an 17:84.  
+F41 The poet &amp;Sana'i.  
+F42 &amp;Rumi, The &amp;Mathnavi, III, 4229-4231.  
+F43 &amp;Qur'an 2:24.  
 
+P74 
"Hadst Thou spent all the riches of the earth, Thou 
couldst not have united their hearts; but God hath 
united them..."+F44  
     With the advent of the Prophets of God, their power 
of creating a real union, one which is both external and 
of the heart, draws together malevolent peoples who 
have been thirsting for one another's blood, into the 
one shelter of the Word of God.  Then a hundred thousand 
souls become as one soul, and unnumbered individuals 
emerge as one body.  
 
          Once they were as the waves of the sea 
          That the wind made many out of one.  
          Then God shed down on them His sun, 
          And His sun but one can never be.  
          Souls of dogs and wolves go separately, 
          But the soul of the lions of God is one.+F45  
 
     The events that transpired at the advent of the 
Prophets of the past, and Their ways and works and 
circumstances, are not adequately set down in authoritative 
histories, and are referred to only in condensed 
form in the verses of the &amp;Qur'an, the Holy Traditions 
and the Torah.  Since, however, all events from the 
days of Moses until the present time are contained in 
 
+F44 &amp;Qur'an 8:64.  
+F45 See &amp;Rumi, The &amp;Mathnavi, II, 185 and 189.  Also the &amp;Hadith: 

+F45 "God created the creatures in darkness, then He sprinkled some

+F45 of His Light upon them.  Those whom some of that Light reached

+F45 took the right way, while those whom it missed wandered from 
+F45 the straight road."  Cf. R. A. Nicholson's "The &amp;Mathnawi of 
+F45 &amp;Jalalu'ddin &amp;Rumi" in the E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Series.  
 
+P75 
the mighty &amp;Qur'an, the authoritative Traditions, the 
Torah and other reliable sources, We shall content 
Ourself with brief references here, the purpose being to 
determine conclusively whether religion is the very 
basis and root-principle of culture and civilization, or 
whether as Voltaire and his like suppose, it defeats all 
social progress, well-being and peace.  
     To preclude once and for all objections on the part 
of any of the world's peoples, We shall conduct Our 
discussion conformably to those authoritative accounts 
which all nations are agreed upon.  
     At a time when the Israelites had multiplied in 
Egypt and were spread throughout the whole country, 
the Coptic Pharaohs of Egypt determined to strengthen 
and favor their own Coptic peoples and to degrade and 
dishonor the children of Israel, whom they regarded as 
foreigners.  Over a long period, the Israelites, divided 
and scattered, were captive in the hands of the tyrannical 
Copts, and were scorned and despised by all, so that 
the meanest of the Copts would freely persecute and 
lord it over the noblest of the Israelites.  The enslavement, 
wretchedness and helplessness of the Hebrews 
reached such a pitch that they were never, day or night, 
secure in their own persons nor able to provide any 
defense for their wives and families against the tyranny 
of their Pharaohic captors.  Then their food was the 
fragments of their own broken hearts, and their drink 
a river of tears.  They continued on in this anguish 
until suddenly Moses, the All-Beauteous, beheld the 
 
+P76 
Divine Light streaming out of the blessed Vale, the 
place that was holy ground, and heard the quickening 
voice of God as it spoke from the flame of that Tree 
"neither of the East nor of the West,"+F46 and He stood 
up in the full panoply of His universal prophethood.  
In the midst of the Israelites, He blazed out like a lamp 
of Divine guidance, and by the light of salvation He 
led that lost people out of the shadows of ignorance into 
knowledge and perfection.  He gathered Israel's scattered 
tribes into the shelter of the unifying and universal 
Word of God, and over the heights of union He 
raised up the banner of harmony, so that within a brief 
interval those benighted souls became spiritually educated, 
and they who had been strangers to the truth, 
rallied to the cause of the oneness of God, and were 
delivered out of their wretchedness, their indigence, 
their incomprehension and captivity and achieved a 
supreme degree of happiness and honor.  They emigrated 
from Egypt, set out for Israel's original homeland, 
and came to Canaan and Philistia.  They first 
conquered the shores of the River Jordan, and Jericho, 
and settled in that area, and ultimately all the neighboring 
regions, such as Phoenicia, Edom and Ammon, 
came under their sway.  In Joshua's time there were 
thirty-one governments in the hands of the Israelites, 
and in every noble human attribute--learning, stability, 
determination, courage, honor, generosity--this people 
came to surpass all the nations of the earth.  When in 
 
+F46 &amp;Qur'an 24:35.  
 
+P77 
those days an Israelite would enter a gathering, he was 
immediately singled out for his many virtues, and even 
foreign peoples wishing to praise a man would say that 
he was like an Israelite.  
     It is furthermore a matter of record in numerous historical 
works that the philosophers of Greece such as 
Pythagoras, acquired the major part of their philosophy, 
both divine and material, from the disciples of 
Solomon.  And Socrates after having eagerly journeyed 
to meet with some of Israel's most illustrious scholars 
and divines, on his return to Greece established the 
concept of the oneness of God and the continuing life 
of the human soul after it has put off its elemental 
dust.  Ultimately, the ignorant among the Greeks denounced 
this man who had fathomed the inmost mysteries 
of wisdom, and rose up to take his life; and then 
the populace forced the hand of their ruler, and in 
council assembled they caused Socrates to drink from 
the poisoned cup.  
     After the Israelites had advanced along every level of 
civilization, and had achieved success in the highest 
possible degree, they began little by little to forget the 
root-principles of the Mosaic Law and Faith, to busy 
themselves with rites and ceremonials and to show forth 
unbecoming conduct.  In the days of Rehoboam, the son 
of Solomon, terrible dissension broke out among them; 
one of their number, Jeroboam, plotted to get the 
throne, and it was he who introduced the worship of 
idols.  The strife between Rehoboam and Jeroboam led 
 
+P78 
to centuries of warfare between their descendants, with 
the result that the tribes of Israel were scattered and 
disrupted.  In brief, it was because they forgot the 
meaning of the Law of God that they became involved 
in ignorant fanaticism and blameworthy practices such 
as insurgence and sedition.  Their divines, having concluded 
that all those essential qualifications of humankind 
set forth in the Holy Book were by then a dead 
letter, began to think only of furthering their own 
selfish interests, and afflicted the people by allowing 
them to sink into the lowest depths of heedlessness and 
ignorance.  And the fruit of their wrong doing was this, 
that the old-time glory which had endured so long now 
changed to degradation, and the rulers of Persia, of 
Greece, and of Rome, took them over.  The banners of 
their sovereignty were reversed; the ignorance, foolishness, 
abasement and self-love of their religious leaders 
and their scholars were brought to light in the coming 
of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who destroyed 
them.  After a general massacre, and the sacking and 
razing of their houses and even the uprooting of their 
trees, he took captive whatever remnants his sword had 
spared and carried them off to Babylon.  Seventy years 
later the descendants of these captives were released 
and went back to Jerusalem.  Then Hezekiah and Ezra 
reestablished in their midst the fundamental principles 
of the Holy Book, and day by day the Israelites advanced, 
and the morning-brightness of their earlier ages 
dawned again.  In a short time, however, great dissensions 
 
+P79 
as to belief and conduct broke out anew, and 
again the one concern of the Jewish doctors became the 
promotion of their own selfish purposes, and the reforms 
that had obtained in Ezra's time were changed 
to perversity and corruption.  The situation worsened 
to such a degree that time and again, the armies of the 
republic of Rome and of its rulers conquered Israelite 
territory.  Finally the warlike Titus, commander of the 
Roman forces, trampled the Jewish homeland into 
dust, putting every man to the sword, taking the women 
and children captive, flattening their houses, tearing 
out their trees, burning their books, looting their treasures, 
and reducing Jerusalem and the Temple to an 
ash heap.  After this supreme calamity, the star of Israel's 
dominion sank away to nothing, and to this day, 
the remnant of that vanished nation has been scattered 
to the four winds.  "Humiliation and misery were 
stamped upon them."+F47  These two most great afflictions, 
brought on by Nebuchadnezzar and Titus, are 
referred to in the glorious &amp;Qur'an:  "And We solemnly 
declared to the children of Israel in the Book, `Twice 
surely will ye commit evil in the earth, and with great 
loftiness of pride will ye surely be uplifted.'  And when 
the menace for the first of the two came to be executed, 
We sent against you Our servants endowed with terrible 
prowess; and they searched the inmost part of 
your abodes, and the menace was accomplished...  
And when the punishment threatened for your latter 
 
+F47 &amp;Qur'an 2:58.  
 
+P80 
transgression came to be inflicted, then We sent an 
enemy to sadden your faces, and to enter the Temple 
as they entered it at first, and to destroy with utter destruction 
that which they had conquered."+F48  
     Our purpose is to show how true religion promotes 
the civilization and honor, the prosperity and prestige, 
the learning and advancement of a people once abject, 
enslaved and ignorant, and how, when it falls into the 
hands of religious leaders who are foolish and fanatical, 
it is diverted to the wrong ends, until this greatest of 
splendors turns into blackest night.  
     When for the second time the unmistakable signs of 
Israel's disintegration, abasement, subjection and annihilation 
had become apparent, then the sweet and holy 
breathings of the Spirit of God (Jesus) were shed 
across Jordan and the land of Galilee; the cloud of Divine 
pity overspread those skies, and rained down the 
copious waters of the spirit, and after those swelling 
showers that came from the most great Sea, the Holy 
Land put forth its perfume and blossomed with the 
knowledge of God.  Then the solemn Gospel song rose 
up till it rang in the ears of those who dwell in the 
chambers of heaven, and at the touch of Jesus' breath 
the unmindful dead that lay in the graves of their ignorance 
lifted up their heads to receive eternal life.  For 
the space of three years, that Luminary of perfections 
walked about the fields of Palestine and in the neighborhood 
of Jerusalem, leading all men into the dawn 
 
+F48 &amp;Qur'an 17:4 ff.  
 
+P81 
of redemption, teaching them how to acquire spiritual 
qualities and attributes well-pleasing to God.  Had the 
people of Israel believed in that beauteous Countenance, 
they would have girded themselves to serve and 
obey Him heart and soul, and through the quickening 
fragrance of His Spirit they would have regained their 
lost vitality and gone on to new victories.  
     Alas, of what avail was it; they turned away and opposed 
Him.  They rose up and tormented that Source 
of Divine knowledge, that Point where the Revelation 
had come down--all except for a handful who, turning 
their faces toward God, were cleansed of the stain of 
this world and found their way to the heights of the 
placeless Realm.  They inflicted every agony on that 
Wellspring of grace until it became impossible for 
Him to live in the towns, and still He lifted up the 
flag of salvation and solidly established the fundamentals 
of human righteousness, that essential basis of true 
civilization.  
     In the fifth chapter of Matthew beginning with the 
thirty-seventh verse He counsels:  "Resist not evil and 
injury with its like; but whosoever shall smite thee on 
thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."  And further, 
from the forty-third verse:  "Ye have heard that it 
hath been said, `Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and 
thou shalt not vex thine enemy with enmity.'+F49  But I 
 
+F49 The King James Bible reads:  "Ye have heard that it hath 
+F49 been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine
enemy."  
+F49 Scholars object to this reading because it is contrary to the
known 
+F49 Law as set forth in Leviticus 19:18, Exodus 23:4-5, Proverbs 
+F49 25:21, the Talmud, etc.  
 
+P82 
say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse 
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them 
which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye 
may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:  
for He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the 
good, and sendeth down the rain of His mercy on the 
just and on the unjust.  For if ye love them which love 
you, what reward have ye?  Do not even the publicans 
the same?"  
     Many were the counsels of this kind that were uttered 
by that Dayspring of Divine wisdom, and souls 
who have become characterized with such attributes of 
holiness are the distilled essence of creation and the 
sources of true civilization.  
     Jesus, then, founded the sacred Law on a basis of 
moral character and complete spirituality, and for those 
who believed in Him He delineated a special way of 
life which constitutes the highest type of action on 
earth.  And while those emblems of redemption were to 
outward seeming abandoned to the malevolence and 
persecution of their tormentors, in reality they had been 
delivered out of the hopeless darkness which encompassed 
the Jews and they shone forth in everlasting 
glory at the dawn of that new day.  
     That mighty Jewish nation toppled and crumbled 
away, but those few souls who sought shelter beneath 
 
+P83 
the Messianic Tree transformed all human life.  At that 
time the peoples of the world were utterly ignorant, 
fanatical and idolatrous.  Only a small group of Jews 
professed belief in the oneness of God and they were 
wretched outcasts.  These holy Christian souls now 
stood up to promulgate a Cause which was diametrically 
opposed and repugnant to the beliefs of the entire 
human race.  The kings of four out of the world's five 
continents inexorably resolved to wipe out the followers 
of Christ, and nevertheless in the end most of them set 
about promoting the Faith of God with their whole 
hearts; all the nations of Europe, many of the peoples 
of Asia and Africa, and some of the inhabitants of the 
islands of the Pacific, were gathered into the shelter of 
the oneness of God.  
     Consider whether there exists anywhere in creation 
a principle mightier in every sense than religion, or 
whether any conceivable power is more pervasive than 
the various Divine Faiths, or whether any agency can 
bring about real love and fellowship and union among 
all peoples as can belief in an almighty and all-knowing 
God, or whether except for the laws of God there 
has been any evidence of an instrumentality for educating 
all mankind in every phase of righteousness.  
     Those qualities which the philosophers attained 
when they had reached the very heights of their wisdom, 
those noble human attributes which characterized 
them at the peak of their perfection, would be exemplified 
by the believers as soon as they accepted the 
 
+P84 
Faith.  Observe how those souls who drank the living 
waters of redemption at the gracious hands of Jesus, 
the Spirit of God, and came into the sheltering shade 
of the Gospel, attained to such a high plane of moral 
conduct that Galen, the celebrated physician, although 
not himself a Christian, in his summary of Plato's 
Republic extolled their actions.  A literal translation of 
his words is as follows:  
     "The generality of mankind are unable to grasp a 
sequence of logical arguments.  For this reason they 
stand in need of symbols and parables telling of rewards 
and punishments in the next world.  A confirmatory 
evidence of this is that today we observe a people 
called Christians, who believe devoutly in rewards and 
punishments in a future state.  This group show forth 
excellent actions, similar to the actions of an individual 
who is a true philosopher.  For example, we all see 
with our own eyes that they have no fear of death, and 
their passion for justice and fair-dealing is so great that 
they should be considered true philosophers."+F50  
     The station of a philosopher, in that age and in the 
mind of Galen, was superior to any other station in the 
world.  Consider then how the enlightening and spiritualizing 
power of divine religions impels the believers 
to such heights of perfection that a philosopher like 
 
+F50 Cf. &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, ch. LXXXIV, 
+F50 and Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 385.  See also Galen
on 
+F50 Jews and Christians by Richard Walzer, Oxford University
Press, 
+F50 1949, p. 15.  The author states that Galen's summary here
referred 
+F50 to is lost, being preserved only in Arabic quotations.  
 
+P85 
Galen, not himself a Christian, offers such testimony.  
     One demonstration of the excellent character of the 
Christians in those days was their dedication to charity 
and good works, and the fact that they founded hospitals 
and philanthropic institutions.  For example, the 
first person to establish public clinics throughout the 
Roman Empire where the poor, the injured and the 
helpless received medical care, was the Emperor Constantine.  
This great king was the first Roman ruler to 
champion the Cause of Christ.  He spared no efforts, 
dedicating his life to the promotion of the principles 
of the Gospel, and he solidly established the Roman 
government, which in reality had been nothing but a 
system of unrelieved oppression, on moderation and 
justice.  His blessed name shines out across the dawn of 
history like the morning star, and his rank and fame 
among the world's noblest and most highly civilized is 
still on the tongues of Christians of all denominations.  
     What a firm foundation of excellent character was 
laid down in those days, thanks to the training of holy 
souls who arose to promote the teachings of the Gospel.  
How many primary schools, colleges, hospitals, were 
established, and institutions where fatherless and indigent 
children received their education.  How many 
were the individuals who sacrificed their own personal 
advantages and "out of desire to please the Lord"+F51 devoted 
the days of their lives to teaching the masses.  
     When, however, the time approached for the effulgent 
 
+F51 From &amp;Qur'an 4:114; 2:207, etc.  
 
+P86 
beauty of &amp;Muhammad to dawn upon the world, 
the control of Christian affairs passed into the hands 
of ignorant priests.  Those heavenly breezes, soft-flowing 
from the regions of Divine grace, died away, and 
the laws of the great Evangel, the rock-foundation on 
which the civilization of the world was based, turned 
barren of results, this out of misuse and because of the 
conduct of persons who, seemingly fair, were yet inwardly 
foul.  
     The noted historians of Europe, in describing the 
conditions, manners, politics, learning and culture, in 
all their aspects, of early, medieval and modern times, 
unanimously record that during the ten centuries constituting 
the Middle Ages, from the beginning of the 
sixth century of the Christian era till the close of the 
fifteenth, Europe was in every respect and to an extreme 
degree, barbaric and dark.  The principal cause of 
this was that the monks, referred to by European peoples 
as spiritual and religious leaders, had given up the 
abiding glory that comes from obedience to the sacred 
commandments and heavenly teachings of the Gospel, 
and had joined forces with the presumptuous and tyrannical 
rulers of the temporal governments of those 
times.  They had turned their eyes away from everlasting 
glory, and were devoting all their efforts to the 
furtherance of their mutual worldly interests and passing 
and perishable advantages.  Ultimately things 
reached a point where the masses were hopeless prisoners 
in the hands of these two groups, and all this 
 
+P87 
brought down in ruins the whole structure of the religion, 
culture, welfare and civilization of the peoples 
of Europe.  
     When the unworthy acts and thoughts and the discreditable 
purposes of the leaders had stilled the sweet 
savors of the Spirit of God (Jesus) and they ceased to 
stream across the world, and the darkness of ignorance 
and bigotry and of actions that were displeasing to God, 
encompassed the earth, then the dawn of hope shone 
out and the Divine spring drew on; a cloud of mercy 
overspread the world, and out of the regions of grace 
the fecund winds began to blow.  In the sign of &amp;Muhammad, 
the Sun of Truth rose over &amp;Yathrib (Medina) 
and the &amp;Hijaz and cast across the universe the lights of 
eternal glory.  Then the earth of human potentialities 
was transformed, and the words "The earth shall shine 
with the light of her Lord,"+F52 were fulfilled.  The old 
world turned new again, and its dead body rose into 
abundant life.  Then tyranny and ignorance were overthrown, 
and towering palaces of knowledge and justice 
were reared in their place.  A sea of enlightenment 
thundered, and science cast down its rays.  The savage 
peoples of the &amp;Hijaz, before that Flame of supreme 
Prophethood was lit in the lamp of Mecca, were the 
most brutish and benighted of all the peoples of the 
earth.  In all the histories, their depraved and vicious 
practices, their ferocity and their constant feuds, are a 
matter of record.  In those days the civilized peoples of 
 
+F52 &amp;Qur'an 39:69.  
 
+P88 
the world did not even consider the Arab tribes of 
Mecca and Medina as human beings.  And yet, after 
the Light of the World rose over them, they were-- 
because of the education bestowed on them by that 
Mine of perfections, that Focal Center of Revelation, 
and the blessings vouchsafed by the Divine Law-- 
within a brief interval gathered into the shelter of the 
principle of Divine oneness.  This brutish people then 
attained such a high degree of human perfection and 
civilization that all their contemporaries marveled at 
them.  Those very peoples who had always mocked the 
Arabs and held them up to ridicule as a breed devoid 
of judgment, now eagerly sought them out, visiting 
their countries to acquire enlightenment and culture, 
technical skills, statecraft, arts and sciences.  
     Observe the influence on material situations of that 
training which is inculcated by the true Educator.  Here 
were tribes so benighted and untamed that during the 
period of the &amp;Jahiliyyih they would bury their seven-year-old 
daughters alive--an act which even an animal, 
let alone a human being, would hate and shrink from 
but which they in their extreme degradation considered 
the ultimate expression of honor and devotion to principle 
--and this darkened people, thanks to the manifest 
teachings of that great Personage, advanced to such a 
degree that after they conquered Egypt, Syria and its 
capital Damascus, Chaldea, Mesopotamia and &amp;Iran, 
they came to administer single-handedly whatever matters 
 
+P89 
were of major importance in four main regions of 
the globe.  
     The Arabs then excelled all the peoples of the world 
in science and the arts, in industry and invention, in 
philosophy, government and moral character.  And 
truly, the rise of this brutish and despicable element, 
in such a short interval, to the supreme heights of human 
perfection, is the greatest demonstration of the 
rightfulness of the Lord &amp;Muhammad's Prophethood.  
     In the early ages of &amp;Islam the peoples of Europe acquired 
the sciences and arts of civilization from &amp;Islam 
as practiced by the inhabitants of Andalusia.  A careful 
and thorough investigation of the historical record will 
establish the fact that the major part of the civilization 
of Europe is derived from &amp;Islam; for all the writings of 
Muslim scholars and divines and philosophers were 
gradually collected in Europe and were with the most 
painstaking care weighed and debated at academic 
gatherings and in the centers of learning, after which 
their valued contents would be put to use.  Today, numerous 
copies of the works of Muslim scholars which 
are not to be found in Islamic countries, are available 
in the libraries of Europe.  Furthermore, the laws and 
principles current in all European countries are derived 
to a considerable degree and indeed virtually in their 
entirety from the works on jurisprudence and the legal 
decision of Muslim theologians.  Were it not for the 
fear of unduly lengthening the present text, We would 
cite these borrowings one by one.  
 
+P90 
     The beginnings of European civilization date from 
the seventh century of the Muslim era.  The particulars 
were these:  toward the end of the fifth century of the 
hegira, the Pope or Head of Christendom set up a great 
hue and cry over the fact that places sacred to the 
Christians, such as Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth, 
had fallen under Muslim rule, and he stirred up 
the kings and the commoners of Europe to undertake 
what he considered a holy war.  His impassioned outcry 
waxed so loud that all the countries of Europe responded, 
and crusading kings at the head of innumerable 
hosts passed over the Sea of Marmara and made 
their way to the continent of Asia.  In those days the 
&amp;Fatimid caliphs ruled over Egypt and some countries 
of the West, and most of the time the kings of Syria, 
that is the &amp;Saljuqs, were subject to them as well.  Briefly, 
the kings of the West with their unnumbered armies 
fell upon Syria and Egypt, and there was continuous 
warfare between the Syrian rulers and those of Europe 
for a period of two hundred and three years.  Reinforcements 
were always coming in from Europe, and time 
and time again the Western rulers stormed and took 
over every castle in Syria, and as often, the kings of 
&amp;Islam delivered them out of their hands.  Finally Saladin, 
in the year 693 A.H., drove the European kings 
and their armies out of Egypt and off the Syrian coast.  
Hopelessly beaten, they went back to Europe.  In the 
course of these wars of the Crusades, millions of human 
beings perished.  To sum up, from 490 A.H. until 
 
+P91 
693, kings, commanders and other European leaders 
continually came and went between Egypt, Syria and 
the West, and when in the end they all returned home, 
they introduced into Europe whatever they had observed 
over two hundred and odd years in Muslim 
countries as to government, social development and 
learning, colleges, schools and the refinements of living.  
The civilization of Europe dates from that time.  
 
     O people of Persia!  How long will your torpor 
and lethargy last?  You were once the lords 
of the whole earth; the world was at your 
beck and call.  How is it that your glory has lapsed and 
you have fallen from favor now, and crept away into 
some corner of oblivion?  You were the fountainhead of 
learning, the unfailing spring of light for all the earth, 
how is it that you are withered now, and quenched, 
and faint of heart?  You who once lit the world, how is 
it that you lurk, inert, bemused, in darkness now?  
Open your mind's eye, see your great and present need.  
Rise up and struggle, seek education, seek enlightenment.  
Is it meet that a foreign people should receive 
from your own forbears its culture and its knowledge, 
and that you, their blood, their rightful heirs, should 
go without?  How does it seem, when your neighbors 
 
+P92 
are at work by day and night with their whole hearts, 
providing for their advancement, their honor and prosperity, 
that you, in your ignorant fanaticism, are busy 
only with your quarrels and antipathies, your indulgences 
and appetites and empty dreams?  Is it commendable 
that you should waste and fritter away in 
apathy the brilliance that is your birthright, your native 
competence, your inborn understanding?  Again, We 
have digressed from Our theme.  
 
     Those European intellectuals who are well-informed 
as to the facts of Europe's past, 
and are characterized by truthfulness and a 
sense of justice, unanimously acknowledge that in 
every particular the basic elements of their civilization 
are derived from &amp;Islam.  For example Draper,+F53 the well-known 
 
+F53 The Persian text transliterates this author's name as
"&amp;Draybar" 
+F53 and titles his work The Progress of Peoples.  The reference 
+F53 is apparently to John William Draper, 1811-1882, celebrated 
+F53 chemist and widely-translated historian.  Detailed material on

+F53 Muslim contributions to the West, and on Gerbert (Pope
Sylvester II) 
+F53 appears in the second volume of the work cited.  Of 
+F53 some of Europe's systematically unacknowledged obligations to 
+F53 &amp;Islam the author writes:  "Injustice founded on religious
rancour 
+F53 and national conceit cannot be perpetuated for ever."  (Vol.
II, 
+F53 p. 42, Rev. ed.)  The Dictionary of American Biography states 
+F53 that Draper's father was a Roman Catholic who assumed the name

+F53 John Christopher Draper when disowned by his family for
becoming 
+F53 a Methodist, and that his real name is unknown.  The 
+F53 translator is indebted to Mr. Paul North Rice, Chief of the
New 
+F53 York Public Library's Reference Department, for the
information 
+F53 that available data on Draper's family history and nationality
are 
+F53 in conflict; The Drapers in America by Thomas Waln-Morgan 
+F53 (1892) states that Draper's father was born in London, while 
+F53 Albert E. Henschel in "Centenary of John William Draper" (New 
+F53 York University "Colonnade," June, 1911) has the following:  
+F53 "If there be among us any who trace their lineage to the sunny

+F53 fields of Italy, they may feel a just pride in John William
Draper, 
+F53 for his father, John C. Draper, was an Italian by birth..."  
+F53      The translator's thanks are also due to Madame Laura
Dreyfus-Barney 
+F53 for investigations in connection with this passage at the 
+F53 Library of Congress and the &amp;Bibliotheque Nationale.  
 
+P93 
French authority, a writer whose accuracy, ability 
and learning are attested by all European scholars, 
in one of his best-known works, The Intellectual Development 
of Europe, has written a detailed account 
in this connection, that is, with reference to the derivation 
by the peoples of Europe of the fundamentals of 
civilization and the bases of progress and well-being 
from &amp;Islam.  His account is exhaustive, and a translation 
here would unduly lengthen out the present work 
and would indeed be irrelevant to Our purpose.  If 
further details are desired the reader may refer to that 
text.  
     In essence, the author shows how the totality of 
Europe's civilization--its laws, principles, institutions, 
its sciences, philosophies, varied learning, its civilized 
manners and customs, its literature, art and industry, 
its organization, its discipline, its behavior, its commendable 
character traits, and even many of the words 
 
+P94 
current in the French language, derives from the Arabs.  
One by one, he investigates each of these elements in 
detail, even giving the period when each was brought 
over from &amp;Islam.  He describes as well the arrival of 
the Arabs in the West, in what is now Spain, and how 
in a short time they established a well-developed civilization 
there, and to what a high degree of excellence 
their administrative system and scholarship attained, 
and how solidly founded and well regulated were their 
schools and colleges, where sciences and philosophy, 
arts and crafts, were taught; what a high level of leadership 
they achieved in the arts of civilization and how 
many were the children of Europe's leading families 
who were sent to attend the schools of Cordova and 
Granada, Seville and Toledo to acquire the sciences 
and arts of civilized life.  He even records that a European 
named Gerbert came to the West and enrolled at 
the University of Cordova in Arab territory, studied 
arts and sciences there, and after his return to Europe 
achieved such prominence that ultimately he was elevated 
to the leadership of the Catholic Church and 
became the Pope.  
     The purpose of these references is to establish the 
fact that the religions of God are the true source of the 
spiritual and material perfections of man, and the 
fountainhead for all mankind of enlightenment and 
beneficial knowledge.  If one observes the matter justly 
it will be found that all the laws of politics are contained 
in these few and holy words:  
 
+P95 
     "And they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is 
unjust, and speed on in good works.  These are of the 
righteous."+F54  And again:  "that there may be among 
you a people who invite to the good, and enjoin the 
just, and forbid the wrong.  These are they with whom 
it shall be well."+F55  And further:  "Verily, God enjoineth 
justice and the doing of good ... and He forbiddeth 
wickedness and oppression.  He warneth you that 
haply ye may be mindful."+F56  And yet again, of the 
civilizing of human behavior:  "Make due allowances; 
and enjoin what is just, and withdraw from the ignorant."+F57  
And likewise:  "...who master their anger, 
and forgive others!  God loveth the doers of good."+F58  
And again:  "There is no righteousness in turning your 
faces toward the East or the West, but he is righteous 
who believeth in God, and the last day, and the angels, 
and the Scriptures, and the Prophets; who for the love 
of God disburseth his wealth to his kindred, and to 
orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer, and those 
who ask, and for ransom; who observeth prayer, and 
payeth the legal alms, and who is of those who perform 
their covenant when they have covenanted, and are 
patient under ills and hardships, and in time of 
trouble:  these are they who are just, and these are they

+P96 
who fear the Lord."+F59  And yet further:  "They prefer 
them before themselves, though poverty be their own 
lot."+F60  See how these few sacred verses encompass the 
highest levels and innermost meanings of civilization 
and embody all the excellencies of human character.  
     By the Lord God, and there is no God but He, even 
the minutest details of civilized life derive from the 
grace of the Prophets of God.  What thing of value to 
mankind has ever come into being which was not first 
set forth either directly or by implication in the Holy 
Scriptures?  
     Alas, of what avail is it.  When the weapons are in 
cowards' hands, no man's life and property are safe, 
and thieves only grow the stronger.  When, in the same 
way, a far-from-perfect priesthood acquire control of 
affairs, they come down like a massive curtain between 
the people and the light of Faith.  
     Sincerity is the foundation-stone of faith.  That is, a 
religious individual must disregard his personal desires 
and seek in whatever way he can wholeheartedly to 
serve the public interest; and it is impossible for a 
human being to turn aside from his own selfish advantages 
and sacrifice his own good for the good of the 
community except through true religious faith.  For 
self-love is kneaded into the very clay of man, and it 
is not possible that, without any hope of a substantial 
reward, he should neglect his own present material 
 
+F59 &amp;Qur'an 2:172.  
+F60 &amp;Qur'an 59:9.  
 
+P97 
good.  That individual, however, who puts his faith in 
God and believes in the words of God--because he is 
promised and certain of a plentiful reward in the next 
life, and because worldly benefits as compared to the 
abiding joy and glory of future planes of existence are 
nothing to him--will for the sake of God abandon his 
own peace and profit and will freely consecrate his 
heart and soul to the common good.  "A man, too, there 
is who selleth his very self out of desire to please 
God."+F61  
     There are some who imagine that an innate sense of 
human dignity will prevent man from committing evil 
actions and insure his spiritual and material perfection.  
That is, that an individual who is characterized with 
natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving zeal, 
will, without any consideration for the severe punishments 
consequent on evil acts, or for the great rewards 
of righteousness, instinctively refrain from inflicting 
harm on his fellow men and will hunger and thirst to 
do good.  And yet, if we ponder the lessons of history 
it will become evident that this very sense of honor 
and dignity is itself one of the bounties deriving from 
the instructions of the Prophets of God.  We also observe 
in infants the signs of aggression and lawlessness, 
and that if a child is deprived of a teacher's instructions 
his undesirable qualities increase from one moment to 
the next.  It is therefore clear that the emergence of this 
natural sense of human dignity and honor is the result 
 
+F61 &amp;Qur'an 2:203.  
 
+P98 
of education.  Secondly, even if we grant for the sake 
of the argument that instinctive intelligence and an 
innate moral quality would prevent wrongdoing, it is 
obvious that individuals so characterized are as rare as 
the philosopher's stone.  An assumption of this sort cannot 
be validated by mere words, it must be supported 
by the facts.  Let us see what power in creation impels 
the masses toward righteous aims and deeds!  
     Aside from this, if that rare individual who does exemplify 
such a faculty should also become an embodiment 
of the fear of God, it is certain that his strivings 
toward righteousness would be strongly reinforced.  
     Universal benefits derive from the grace of the Divine 
religions, for they lead their true followers to sincerity 
of intent, to high purpose, to purity and spotless 
honor, to surpassing kindness and compassion, to the 
keeping of their covenants when they have covenanted, 
to concern for the rights of others, to liberality, to justice 
in every aspect of life, to humanity and philanthropy, 
to valor and to unflagging efforts in the service 
of mankind.  It is religion, to sum up, which produces 
all human virtues, and it is these virtues which are the 
bright candles of civilization.  If a man is not characterized 
by these excellent qualities, it is certain that he has 
never attained to so much as a drop out of the fathomless 
river of the waters of life that flows through the 
teachings of the Holy Books, nor caught the faintest 
breath of the fragrant breezes that blow from the gardens 
of God; for nothing on earth can be demonstrated 
 
+P99 
by words alone, and every level of existence is known 
by its signs and symbols, and every degree in man's development 
has its identifying mark.  
     The purpose of these statements is to make it 
abundantly clear that the Divine religions, the holy 
precepts, the heavenly teachings, are the unassailable 
basis of human happiness, and that the peoples of the 
world can hope for no real relief or deliverance without 
this one great remedy.  This panacea must, however, be 
administered by a wise and skilled physician, for in the 
hands of an incompetent all the cures that the Lord of 
men has ever created to heal men's ills could produce 
no health, and would on the contrary only destroy the 
helpless and burden the hearts of the already afflicted.  
     That Source of Divine wisdom, that Manifestation 
of Universal Prophethood (&amp;Muhammad), encouraging 
mankind to acquire sciences and arts and similar advantages 
has commanded them to seek these even in 
the furthermost reaches of China; yet the incompetent 
and caviling doctors forbid this, offering as their justification 
the saying, "He who imitates a people is one 
of them."  They have not even grasped what is meant 
by the "imitation" referred to, nor do they know that 
the Divine religions enjoin upon and encourage all the 
faithful to adopt such principles as will conduce to 
continuous improvements, and to acquire from other 
peoples sciences and arts.  Whoever expresses himself 
to the contrary has never drunk of the nectar of knowledge 
 
+P100 
and is astray in his own ignorance, groping after 
the mirage of his desires.  
     Judge this aright:  which one of these modern developments, 
whether in themselves or in their application, 
is contrary to the Divine commandments?  If they mean 
the establishment of parliaments, these are enjoined by 
the very text of the holy verse:  "and whose affairs are 
guided by mutual counsel."+F62  And again, addressing 
the Dayspring of all knowledge, the Source of perfection 
(&amp;Muhammad), in spite of His being in possession 
of universal wisdom, the words are:  "and consult them 
in the affair."+F63  In view of this how can the question 
of mutual consultation be in conflict with the religious 
Law?  The great advantages of consultation can be established 
by logical arguments as well.  
     Can they say that it would be contrary to the laws of 
God to make a death sentence conditional on the most 
careful investigations, on the sanction of numerous 
bodies, on legal proof and the royal order?  Can they 
claim that what went on under the previous government 
was in conformity with the &amp;Qur'an?  For example, 
in the days when &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi was Prime Minister, 
it was heard from many sources that the governor 
of &amp;Gulpaygan seized thirteen defenseless bailiffs of 
that region, all of them of holy lineage, all of them 
guiltless, and without a trial, and without obtaining 
any higher sanction, beheaded them in a single hour.  
 
+F62 &amp;Qur'an 42:36.  
+F63 &amp;Qur'an 3:153.  
 
+P101 
     At one time the population of Persia exceeded fifty 
millions.  This has been dissipated partly through civil 
wars, but predominantly because of the lack of an adequate 
system of government and the despotism and 
unbridled authority of provincial and local governors.  
With the passage of time, not one-fifth of the population 
has survived, for the governors would select any 
victim they cared to, however innocent, and vent their 
wrath on him and destroy him.  Or, for a whim, they 
would make a pet out of some proven mass murderer.  
Not a soul could speak out, because the governor was 
in absolute control.  Can we say that these things were 
in conformity with justice or with the laws of God?  
     Can we maintain that it is contrary to the fundamentals 
of the Faith to encourage the acquisition of useful 
arts and of general knowledge, to inform oneself as to 
the truths of such physical sciences as are beneficial to 
man, and to widen the scope of industry and increase 
the products of commerce and multiply the nation's 
avenues of wealth?  Would it conflict with the worship 
of God to establish law and order in the cities and organize 
the rural districts, to repair the roads and build 
railroads and facilitate transportation and travel and 
thus increase the people's well-being?  Would it be inconsistent 
with the Divine commands and prohibitions 
if we were to work the abandoned mines which are the 
greatest source of the nation's wealth, and to build factories, 
from which come the entire people's comfort, 
security and affluence?  Or to stimulate the creation of 
 
+P102 
new industries and to promote improvements in our 
domestic products?  
     By the All-Glorious!  I am astonished to find what a 
veil has fallen across their eyes, and how it blinds them 
even to such obvious necessities as these.  And there is 
no doubt whatever that when conclusive arguments 
and proofs of this sort are advanced, they will answer, 
out of a thousand hidden spites and prejudices:  "On 
the Day of Judgment, when men stand before their 
Lord, they will not be questioned as to their education 
and the degree of their culture--rather will they be examined 
as to their good deeds."  Let us grant this and 
assume that man will not be asked as to his culture and 
education; even so, on that great Day of Reckoning, 
will not the leaders be called to account?  Will it not 
be said to them:  "O chiefs and leaders!  Why did ye 
cause this mighty nation to fall from the heights of its 
former glory, to pass from its place at the heart and 
center of the civilized world?  Ye were well able to take 
hold of such measures as would lead to the high honor 
of this people.  This ye failed to do, and ye even went 
on to deprive them of the common benefits enjoyed by 
all.  Did not this people once shine out like stars in an 
auspicious heaven?  How have ye dared to quench their 
light in darkness!  Ye could have lit the lamp of temporal 
and eternal glory for them; why did ye fail to 
strive for this with all your hearts?  And when by God's 
grace a flaming Light flared up, why did ye fail to 
shelter it in the glass of your valor, from the winds that 
 
+P103 
beat against it?  Why did ye rise up in all your might 
to put it out?"  
     "And every man's fate have We fastened about his 
neck:  and on the Day of Resurrection will We bring 
it forth to him a book which shall be proffered to him 
wide open."+F64  
     Again, is there any deed in the world that would be 
nobler than service to the common good?  Is there any 
greater blessing conceivable for a man, than that he 
should become the cause of the education, the development, 
the prosperity and honor of his fellow-creatures?  
No, by the Lord God!  The highest righteousness of all 
is for blessed souls to take hold of the hands of the helpless 
and deliver them out of their ignorance and abasement 
and poverty, and with pure motives, and only for 
the sake of God, to arise and energetically devote themselves 
to the service of the masses, forgetting their own 
worldly advantage and working only to serve the general 
good.  "They prefer them before themselves, though 
poverty be their own lot."+F65  "The best of men are those 
who serve the people; the worst of men are those who 
harm the people."  
     Glory be to God!  What an extraordinary situation 
now obtains, when no one, hearing a claim advanced, 
asks himself what the speaker's real motive might be, 
and what selfish purpose he might not have hidden behind 
the mask of words.  You find, for example, that an 
 
+F64 &amp;Qur'an 17:14.  
+F65 &amp;Qur'an 59:9.  
 
+P104 
individual seeking to further his own petty and personal 
concerns, will block the advancement of an entire 
people.  To turn his own water mill, he will let 
the farms and fields of all the others parch and wither.  
To maintain his own leadership, he will everlastingly 
direct the masses toward that prejudice and fanaticism 
which subvert the very base of civilization.  
     Such a man, at the same moment that he is perpetrating 
actions which are anathema in the sight of God 
and detested by all the Prophets and Holy Ones, if he 
sees a person who has just finished eating wash his 
hands with soap--an article the inventor of which was 
&amp;Abdu'llah &amp;Buni, a Muslim--will, because this unfortunate 
does not instead wipe his hands up and down 
the front of his robe and on his beard, set up a hue 
and cry to the effect that the religious law has been 
overthrown, and the manners and customs of heathen 
nations are being introduced into ours.  Utterly disregarding 
the evil of his own ways, he considers the very 
cause of cleanliness and refinement as wicked and 
foolish.  
     O People of Persia!  Open your eyes!  Pay heed!  Release 
yourselves from this blind following of the bigots, 
this senseless imitation which is the principal reason 
why men fall away into paths of ignorance and degradation.  
See the true state of things.  Rise up; seize hold 
of such means as will bring you life and happiness and 
greatness and glory among all the nations of the world.  
     The winds of the true springtide are passing over 
 
+P105 
you; adorn yourselves with blossoms like trees in the 
scented garden.  Spring clouds are streaming; then turn 
you fresh and verdant like the sweet eternal fields.  The 
dawn star is shining, set your feet on the true path.  The 
sea of might is swelling, hasten to the shores of high 
resolve and fortune.  The pure water of life is welling 
up, why wear away your days in a desert of thirst?  Aim 
high, choose noble ends; how long this lethargy, how 
long this negligence!  Despair, both here and hereafter, 
is all you will gain from self-indulgence; abomination 
and misery are all you will harvest from fanaticism, 
from believing the foolish and the mindless.  The confirmations 
of God are supporting you, the succor of 
God is at hand:  why do you not cry out and exult with 
all your heart, and strive with all your soul!  
 
     Among those matters which require thorough revision 
and reform is the method of studying the 
various branches of knowledge and the organization 
of the academic curriculum.  From lack of 
organization, education has become haphazard and confused.  
Trifling subjects which should not call for 
elaboration receive undue attention, to such an extent 
that students, over long periods of time, waste their 
minds and their energies on material that is pure supposition, 
 
+P106 
in no way susceptible of proof, such study consisting 
in going deep into statements and concepts 
which careful examination would establish as not even 
unlikely, but rather as unalloyed superstition, and representing 
the investigation of useless conceits and the 
chasing of absurdities.  There can be no doubt that to 
concern oneself with such illusions, to examine into 
and lengthily debate such idle propositions, is nothing 
but a waste of time and a marring of the days of one's 
life.  Not only this, but it also prevents the individual 
from undertaking the study of those arts and sciences 
of which society stands in dire need.  The individual 
should, prior to engaging in the study of any subject, 
ask himself what its uses are and what fruit and result 
will derive from it.  If it is a useful branch of knowledge, 
that is, if society will gain important benefits from it, 
then he should certainly pursue it with all his heart.  
If not, if it consists in empty, profitless debates and in 
a vain concatenation of imaginings that lead to no result 
except acrimony, why devote one's life to such 
useless hairsplittings and disputes.  
     Because this matter requires further elucidation and 
a thorough hearing, so that it can be fully established 
that some of the subjects which today are neglected are 
extremely valuable, while the nation has no need whatever 
of various other, superfluous studies, the point 
will, God willing, be developed in a second volume.  
Our hope is that a reading of this first volume will produce 
fundamental changes in the thinking and the behavior 
 
+P107 
of society, for We have undertaken the work 
with a sincere intent and purely for the sake of God.  
Although in this world individuals who are able to distinguish 
between sincere intentions and false words 
are as rare as the philosopher's stone, yet We fix Our 
hopes on the measureless bounties of the Lord.  
     To resume:  As for that group who maintains that in 
effecting these necessary reforms we must proceed with 
deliberation, exercise patience and gain the objectives 
one at a time, just what do they mean by this?  If by 
deliberation they are referring to that circumspection 
which the science of government requires, their 
thought is timely and appropriate.  It is certain that 
momentous undertakings cannot be brought to a successful 
conclusion in haste; that in such cases haste 
would only make waste.  
     The world of politics is like the world of man; he is 
seed at first, and then passes by degrees to the condition 
of embryo and foetus, acquiring a bone structure, 
being clothed with flesh, taking on his own special 
form, until at last he reaches the plane where he can 
befittingly fulfill the words:  "the most excellent of 
Makers."+F66  Just as this is a requirement of creation and 
is based on the universal Wisdom, the political world 
in the same way cannot instantaneously evolve from 
the nadir of defectiveness to the zenith of rightness and 
perfection.  Rather, qualified individuals must strive by 
 
+F66 &amp;Qur'an 23:14:  "Blessed therefore be God, the most excellent 
+F66 of Makers."  
 
+P108 
day and by night, using all those means which will conduce 
to progress, until the government and the people 
develop along every line from day to day and even from 
moment to moment.  
     When, through the Divine bestowals, three things 
appear on earth, this world of dust will come alive, and 
stand forth wondrously adorned and full of grace.  
These are first, the fruitful winds of spring; second, the 
welling plenty of spring clouds; and third, the heat of 
the bright sun.  When, out of the endless bounty of 
God, these three have been vouchsafed, then slowly, 
by His leave, dry trees and branches turn fresh and 
green again, and array themselves with many kinds of 
blossoms and fruits.  It is the same when the pure intentions 
and the justice of the ruler, the wisdom and 
consummate skill and statecraft of the governing authorities, 
and the determination and unstinted efforts 
of the people, are all combined; then day by day the 
effects of the advancement, of the far-reaching reforms, 
of the pride and prosperity of government and people 
alike, will become clearly manifest.  
     If, however, by delay and postponement they mean 
this, that in each generation only one minute section 
of the necessary reforms should be attended to, this is 
nothing but lethargy and inertia, and no results would 
be forthcoming from such a procedure, except the endless 
repetition of idle words.  If haste is harmful, inertness 
and indolence are a thousand times worse.  A middle 
course is best, as it is written:  "It is incumbent upon 
 
+P109 
you to do good between the two evils," this referring 
to the mean between the two extremes.  "And let not 
thy hand be tied up to thy neck; nor yet open it with 
all openness ... but between these follow a middle 
way."+F67  
     The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion 
of education.  It is inconceivable that any nation 
should achieve prosperity and success unless this paramount, 
this fundamental concern is carried forward.  
The principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples 
is ignorance.  Today the mass of the people are uninformed 
even as to ordinary affairs, how much less do 
they grasp the core of the important problems and complex 
needs of the time.  
     It is therefore urgent that beneficial articles and books 
be written, clearly and definitely establishing what the 
present-day requirements of the people are, and what 
will conduce to the happiness and advancement of society.  
These should be published and spread throughout 
the nation, so that at least the leaders among the 
people should become, to some degree, awakened, and 
arise to exert themselves along those lines which will 
lead to their abiding honor.  The publication of high 
thoughts is the dynamic power in the arteries of life; 
it is the very soul of the world.  Thoughts are a boundless 
sea, and the effects and varying conditions of existence 
are as the separate forms and individual limits 
of the waves; not until the sea boils up will the waves 
 
+F67 &amp;Qur'an 17:31; 110.  
 
+P110 
rise and scatter their pearls of knowledge on the shore 
of life.  
 
          Thou, Brother, art thy thought alone, 
          The rest is only thew and bone.+F68  
 
     Public opinion must be directed toward whatever is 
worthy of this day, and this is impossible except 
through the use of adequate arguments and the adducing 
of clear, comprehensive and conclusive proofs.  For 
the helpless masses know nothing of the world, and 
while there is no doubt that they seek and long for 
their own happiness, yet ignorance like a heavy veil 
shuts them away from it.  
     Observe to what a degree the lack of education will 
weaken and degrade a people.  Today [1875] from the 
standpoint of population the greatest nation in the 
world is China, which has something over four hundred 
million inhabitants.  On this account, its government 
should be the most distinguished on earth, its 
people the most acclaimed.  And yet on the contrary, 
because of its lack of education in cultural and material 
civilization, it is the feeblest and the most helpless of 
all weak nations.  Not long ago, a small contingent of 
English and French troops went to war with China 
and defeated that country so decisively that they took 
over its capital Peking.  Had the Chinese government 
 
+F68 &amp;Rumi, The &amp;Mathnavi, II 2:277.  The next line is:  
+F68      A garden close, if that thought be a rose, 
+F68      But if it be a thorn, then only fit to burn.  
 
+P111 
and people been abreast of the advanced sciences of 
the day, had they been skilled in the arts of civilization, 
then if all the nations on earth had marched against 
them the attack would still have failed, and the attackers 
would have returned defeated whence they 
had come.  
     Stranger even than this episode is the fact that the 
government of Japan was in the beginning subject to 
and under the protection of China, and that now for 
some years, Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the 
techniques of contemporary progress and civilization, 
promoting sciences and industries of use to the public, 
and striving to the utmost of their power and competence 
until public opinion was focused on reform.  
This government has currently advanced to such a 
point that, although its population is only one-sixth, or 
even one-tenth, that of China, it has recently challenged 
the latter government, and China has finally 
been forced to come to terms.  Observe carefully how 
education and the arts of civilization bring honor, prosperity, 
independence and freedom to a government 
and its people.  
     It is, furthermore, a vital necessity to establish schools 
throughout Persia, even in the smallest country towns 
and villages, and to encourage the people in every possible 
way to have their children learn to read and write.  
If necessary, education should even be made compulsory.  
Until the nerves and arteries of the nation stir into 
life, every measure that is attempted will prove vain; for 
 
+P112 
the people are as the human body, and determination 
and the will to struggle are as the soul, and a soulless 
body does not move.  This dynamic power is present to 
a superlative degree in the very nature of the Persian 
people, and the spread of education will release it.  
 
     As to that element who believe that it is neither 
necessary nor appropriate to borrow the principles 
of civilization, the fundamentals of 
progress toward high levels of social happiness in the 
material world, the laws which effect thorough reforms, 
the methods which extend the scope of culture--and 
that it is far more suitable that Persia and the Persians 
reflect over the situation and then create their own 
techniques of progress.  
     It is certain that if the vigorous intelligence and superior 
skill of the nation's great, and the energy and 
resolve of the most eminent men at the imperial court, 
and the determined efforts of those who have knowledge 
and capacity, and are well versed in the great 
laws of political life, should all be combined, and all 
should exert every effort and examine and reflect over 
every detail as well as on the main currents of affairs, 
there is every likelihood that because of the effective 
plans they would evolve, some situations would be 
 
+P113 
thoroughly reformed.  In the majority of cases, however, 
they would still be obliged to borrow; because, 
throughout the many-centuried past, hundreds of 
thousands of persons have devoted their entire lives to 
putting these things to the test until they were able to 
bring about these substantial developments.  If all that 
is to be ignored and an effort is made to re-create those 
agencies in our own country and in our own way, and 
thus effect the hoped-for advancement, many generations 
would pass by and still the goal would not be 
reached.  Observe for instance that in other countries 
they persevered over a long period until finally they 
discovered the power of steam and by means of it were 
enabled easily to perform the heavy tasks which were 
once beyond human strength.  How many centuries it 
would take if we were to abandon the use of this power 
and instead strain every nerve to invent a substitute.  
It is therefore preferable to keep on with the use of 
steam and at the same time continuously to examine 
into the possibility of there being a far greater force 
available.  One should regard the other technological 
advances, sciences, arts and political formulae of proven 
usefulness in the same light--i.e., those procedures 
which, down the ages, have time and again been put 
to the test and whose many uses and advantages have 
demonstrably resulted in the glory and greatness of the 
state, and the well-being and progress of the people.  
Should all these be abandoned, for no valid reason, and 
other methods of reform be attempted, by the time 
 
+P114 
such reforms might eventuate, and their advantages 
might be put to proof, many years would go by, and 
many lives.  Meanwhile, "we are still at the first bend 
in the road."+F69  
     The superiority of the present in relation to the past 
consists in this, that the present can take over and 
adopt as a model many things which have been tried 
and tested and the great benefits of which have been 
demonstrated in the past, and that it can make its own 
new discoveries and by these augment its valuable inheritance.  
It is clear, then, that the accomplishment 
and experience of the past are known and available to 
the present, while the discoveries peculiar to the present 
were unknown to the past.  This presupposes that 
the later generation is made up of persons of ability; 
otherwise, how many a later generation has lacked even 
so much as a drop out of the boundless ocean of knowledge 
that was its forbears'.  
     Reflect a little:  let us suppose that, through the 
power of God, certain individuals are placed on earth; 
these obviously stand in need of many things, to provide 
for their human dignity, their happiness and ease.  
Now is it more practicable for them to acquire these 
things from their contemporaries, or should they, in 
each successive generation, borrow nothing, but instead 
independently create one or another of the instrumentalities 
which are necessary to human existence?  
 
+F69 From the lines:  "&amp;Attar has passed through the seven cities 
+F69 of love, and we are still at the first bend in the road."  
 
+P115 
     Should some maintain that those laws, principles and 
fundamentals of progress on the highest levels of a 
fully developed society, which are current in other 
countries, are not suited to the condition and the traditional 
needs of Persia's people, and that on this account 
it is necessary that within &amp;Iran, the nations' 
planners should exert their utmost efforts to bring about 
reforms appropriate to Persia--let them first explain 
what harm could come from such foreign importations.  
     If the country were built up, the roads repaired, the 
lot of the helpless improved by various means, the poor 
rehabilitated, the masses set on the path to progress, 
the avenues of public wealth increased, the scope of 
education widened, the government properly organized, 
and the free exercise of the individual's rights, and the 
security of his person and property, his dignity and good 
name, assured--would all this be at odds with the character 
of the Persian people?  Whatever is in conflict 
with these measures has already been proved injurious, 
in every country, and does not concern one locality 
more than another.  
     These superstitions result in their entirety from lack 
of wisdom and understanding, and insufficient observation 
and analysis.  Indeed, the majority of the reactionaries 
and the procrastinators are only concealing their 
own selfish interests under a barrage of idle words, and 
confusing the minds of the helpless masses with public 
statements which bear no relation to their well-concealed 
objectives.  
 
+P116 
     O people of Persia!  The heart is a divine trust; 
cleanse it from the stain of self-love, adorn it with the 
coronal of pure intent, until the sacred honor, the abiding 
greatness of this illustrious nation may shine out 
like the true morning in an auspicious heaven.  This 
handful of days on earth will slip away like shadows 
and be over.  Strive then that God may shed His grace 
upon you, that you may leave a favorable remembrance 
in the hearts and on the lips of those to come.  "And 
grant that I be spoken of with honor by posterity."+F70  
     Happy the soul that shall forget his own good, and 
like the chosen ones of God, vie with his fellows in 
service to the good of all; until, strengthened by the 
blessings and perpetual confirmations of God, he shall 
be empowered to raise this mighty nation up to its 
ancient pinnacles of glory, and restore this withered 
land to sweet new life, and as a spiritual springtime, 
array those trees which are the lives of men with the 
fresh leaves, the blossoms and fruits of consecrated joy.
