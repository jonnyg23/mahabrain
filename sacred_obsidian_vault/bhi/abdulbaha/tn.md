                           TRAVELER'S 
                            NARRATIVE 
                      WRITTEN TO ILLUSTRATE 
                               THE 
                             EPISODE 
                             OF THE 
                              &amp;BAB 
 
 
     Touching the individual known as the &amp;Bab and the true 
nature of this sect diverse tales are on the tongues and in 
the mouths of men, and various accounts are contained in the 
pages of Persian history and the leaves of European chronicles.  
But because of the variety of their assertions and the diversity 
of their narratives not one is as worthy of confidence as 
it should be.  Some have loosed their tongues in extreme censure 
and condemnation; some foreign chronicles have spoken 
in a commendatory strain; while a certain section have recorded 
what they themselves have heard without addressing 
themselves either to censure or approbation.  
     Now since these various accounts are recorded in other 
pages, and since the setting forth thereof would lead to prolixity, 
therefore what relates to the history of this matter (sought 
out with the utmost diligence during the time of my travels in 
all parts of Persia, whether far or near, from those without and 
those within, from friends and strangers), and that whereon 
the disputants are agreed, shall be briefly set forth in writing, 
so that a summary of the facts of the case may be at the disposal 
 
+P4 
of those who are athirst after the fountain of knowledge and 
who seek to become acquainted with all events.  
     The &amp;Bab was a young merchant of the Pure Lineage.  He was 
born in the year one thousand two hundred and thirty-five 
[A.H.] on the first day of &amp;Muharram,+F1 and when after a few 
years His father Siyyid &amp;Muhammad-Rida died, He was 
brought up in &amp;Shiraz in the arms of His maternal uncle &amp;Mirza 
Siyyid &amp;Ali the merchant.  On attaining maturity He engaged in 
trade in &amp;Bushihr, first in partnership with His maternal uncle 
and afterwards independently.  On account of what was observed 
in Him He was noted for godliness, devoutness, virtue, 
and piety, and was regarded in the sight of men as so characterized.  
     In the year one thousand two hundred and sixty [A.H.], 
when He was in His twenty-fifth year, certain signs became 
apparent in His conduct, behavior, manners, and demeanor 
whereby it became evident in &amp;Shiraz that He had some 
conflict in His mind and some other flight beneath His wing.  
He began to speak and to declare the rank of &amp;Bab-hood.+F2  Now 
what He intended by the term &amp;Bab [Gate] was this, that He was 
the channel of grace from some great Person still behind the 
veil of glory, Who was the possessor of countless and boundless 
perfections, by Whose will He moved, and to the bond of 
Whose love He clung.  And in the first book which He wrote in 
explanation of the &amp;Surih of Joseph,+F3 He addressed Himself in 
all passages to that Person unseen from Whom He received 
help and grace, sought for aid in the arrangement of His 
preliminaries, and craved the sacrifice of life in the way of His 
love.  
     Amongst others is this sentence:  "O Remnant of God, I am 
wholly sacrificed to Thee; I am content with curses in Thy 
 
+F1 20 October 1819.  
+F2 23 May 1844.  
+F3 &amp;Qur'an 12.  
 
+P5 
way; I crave naught but to be slain in Thy love; and God the 
Supreme sufficeth as an Eternal Protection."  
     He likewise composed a number of works in explanation 
and elucidation of the verses of the &amp;Qur'an, of sermons, and of 
prayers in Arabic; inciting and urging men to expect the 
appearance of that Person; and these books He named "Inspired 
Pages" and "Word of Conscience."  But on investigation 
it was discovered that He laid no claim to revelation from 
an angel.  
     Now since He was noted amongst the people for lack of 
instruction and education, this circumstance appeared in the 
sight of men supernatural.  Some men inclined to Him, but 
the greater part manifested strong disapproval; whilst all the 
learned doctors and lawyers of repute who occupied chairs, 
altars, and pulpits were unanimously agreed on eradication 
and suppression, save some divines of the &amp;Shaykhi party who 
were anchorites and recluses, and who, agreeably to their 
tenets, were ever seeking for some great, incomparable, and 
trustworthy person, whom they accounted, according to their 
own terminology, as the "Fourth Support" and the central 
manifestation of the truths of the Perspicuous Religion.  
     Of this number &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn of &amp;Bushruyih, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Ahmad of &amp;Azghand, &amp;Mulla &amp;Sadiq Muqaddas [the Holy], 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Abu-Turab of &amp;Ishtihard, &amp;Mulla &amp;Yusuf of &amp;Ardibil, 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Jalil of &amp;Urumiyyih, &amp;Mulla &amp;Mihdi of Kand, &amp;Shaykh 
&amp;Sa'id the Indian, &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali of &amp;Bastam, and the like of these 
came out unto Him and spread themselves through all parts of 
Persia.  
     The &amp;Bab Himself set out to perform the circumambulation 
of the House of God.+F4  On His return, when the news of His 
arrival at &amp;Bushihr reached &amp;Shiraz, there was much discussion, 
and a strange excitement and agitation became apparent in 
 
+F4 Undertake the pilgrimage to Mecca.  
 
+P6 
that city.  The great majority of the doctors set themselves to 
repudiate Him, decreeing slaughter and destruction, and they 
induced &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan &amp;Ajudan-bashi, who was the governor of 
&amp;Fars, to inflict a beating on the &amp;Bab's missionaries, that is on 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Sadiq Muqaddas; then, having burnt his moustaches 
and beard together with those of &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali of 
&amp;Barfurush and &amp;Mulla &amp;Ali-Akbar of &amp;Ardistan, they put halters 
on all the three and led them round the streets and bazaars.  
     Now since the doctors of Persia have no administrative 
capacity, they thought that violence and interference would 
cause extinction and silence and lead to suppression and 
oblivion; whereas interference in matters of conscience causes 
stability and firmness and attracts the attention of men's sight 
and souls; which fact has received experimental proof many 
times and often.  So this punishment caused notoriety, and 
most men fell to making inquiry.  
     The governor of &amp;Fars, acting according to that which the 
doctors deemed expedient, sent several horsemen, caused the 
&amp;Bab to be brought before him, censured and blamed Him in 
the presence of the doctors and scholars, and loosed his tongue 
in the demand for reparation.  And when the &amp;Bab returned his 
censure and withstood him greatly, at a sign from the president 
they struck Him a violent blow, insulting and contemning 
Him, in such wise that His turban fell from His head and the 
mark of the blow was apparent on His face.  At the conclusion 
of the meeting they decided to take counsel, and, on receiving 
bail and surety from His maternal uncle &amp;Haji Siyyid &amp;Ali, sent 
Him to His house forbidding Him to hold intercourse with 
relations or strangers.  
     One day they summoned Him to the mosque urging and 
constraining Him to recant, but He discoursed from the pulpit 
in such wise as to silence and subdue those present and to 
stablish and strengthen His followers.  It was then supposed 
that He claimed to be the medium of grace from His Highness 
the Lord of the Age (upon Him be peace); but afterwards it 
 
+P7 
became known and evident that His meaning was the Gatehood 
[&amp;Babiyyat] of another city and the mediumship of the 
graces of another Person Whose qualities and attributes were 
contained in His books and treatises.  
     At all events, as has been mentioned, by reason of the 
doctors' lack of experience and skill in administrative science, 
and the continual succession of their decisions, comment was 
rife; and their interference with the &amp;Bab cast a clamor 
throughout Persia, causing increased ardor in friends and the 
coming forward of the hesitating.  For by reason of these 
occurrences men's interest increased, and in all parts of Persia 
some [of God's] servants inclined toward Him, until the matter 
acquired such importance that the late king &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah delegated a certain person named Siyyid &amp;Yahya of 
&amp;Darab, who was one of the best known of doctors and Siyyids 
as well as an object of veneration and confidence, giving him a 
horse and money for the journey so that he might proceed to 
&amp;Shiraz and personally investigate this matter.+F5 
     When the above-mentioned Siyyid arrived at &amp;Shiraz he 
interviewed the &amp;Bab three times.  In the first and second conferences 
questioning and answering took place; in the third 
conference he requested a commentary on the &amp;Surih called 
&amp;Kawthar+F6, and when the &amp;Bab, without thought or reflection, 
wrote an elaborate commentary on the &amp;Kawthar in his presence, 
the above-mentioned Siyyid was charmed and enraptured 
with Him, and straightway, without consideration for 
the future or anxiety about the results of this affection, hastened 
to &amp;Burujird to his father Siyyid &amp;Ja'far, known as &amp;Kashfi, 
and acquainted him with the matter.  And, although he was 
wise and prudent and was wont to have regard to the requirements 
of the time, he wrote without fear or care a detailed 
 
+F5 &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah died September 4, 1848; the English translation of 
+F5 A Traveler's Narrative first appeared in 1891.  
+F6 &amp;Qur'an 108.  
 
+P8 
account of his observations to &amp;Mirza &amp;Lutf-'Ali the chamberlain 
in order that the latter might submit it to the notice of the late 
king, while he himself journeyed to all parts of Persia, and in 
every town and station summoned the people from the pulpit-tops 
in such wise that other learned doctors decided that he 
must be mad, accounting it a sure case of bewitchment.  
     Now when the news of the decisions of the doctors and the 
outcry and clamor of the lawyers reached &amp;Zanjan, &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali the divine, who was a man of mark possessed 
of penetrating speech, sent one of those on whom he could 
rely to &amp;Shiraz to investigate this matter.  This person, having 
acquainted himself with the details of these occurrences in 
such wise as was necessary and proper, returned with some [of 
the &amp;Bab's] writings.  When the divine heard how matters were 
and had made himself acquainted with the writings, notwithstanding 
that he was a man expert in knowledge and noted for 
profound research, he went mad and became crazed as was 
predestined:  he gathered up his books in the lecture-room 
saying, "The season of spring and wine has arrived," and 
uttered this sentence:  "Search for knowledge after reaching the 
known is culpable."  Then from the summit of the pulpit he 
summoned and directed all his disciples [to embrace the 
doctrine], and wrote to the &amp;Bab his own declaration and 
confession.  
     The &amp;Bab in His reply signified to him the obligation of 
congregational prayer.  
     Although the doctors of &amp;Zanjan arose with heart and soul to 
exhort and admonish the people they could effect nothing.  
Finally they were compelled to go to &amp;Tihran and made their 
complaint before the late king &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah, requesting 
that &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Ali might be summoned to &amp;Tihran.  
So the royal order went forth that he should appear.  
     Now when he came to &amp;Tihran they brought him before a 
conclave of the doctors; but, so they relate, after many controversies 
 
+P9 
and disputations naught was effected with him in 
that assembly.  The late king therefore bestowed on him a staff 
and fifty &amp;tumans for his expenses, and gave him permission to 
return.  
     At all events, this news being disseminated through all parts 
and regions of Persia, and several proselytes arriving in &amp;Fars, 
the doctors perceived that the matter had acquired importance, 
that the power to deal with it had escaped from their 
hands, and that imprisonment, beating, tormenting, and contumely 
were fruitless.  So they signified to the governor of &amp;Fars, 
&amp;Husayn &amp;Khan, "If thou desirest the extinction of this fire, or 
seekest a firm stopper for this rent and disruption, an immediate 
cure and decisive remedy is to kill the &amp;Bab.  And the 
&amp;Bab has assembled a great host and meditates a rising."  
     So &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan ordered &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid &amp;Khan the high 
constable to attack the house of the &amp;Bab's maternal uncle at 
midnight on all sides, and to bring Him and all His followers 
handcuffed.  But &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid &amp;Khan and his hosts found no 
one in the house save the &amp;Bab, His maternal uncle, and Siyyid 
&amp;Kazim of &amp;Zanjan; and as it chanced that on that night the 
sickness of the plague and the extreme heat of the weather had 
compelled &amp;Husayn &amp;Khan to flee, he released the &amp;Bab on 
condition of His quitting the city.  
     On the morning after that night the &amp;Bab with Siyyid &amp;Kazim 
of &amp;Zanjan set out from &amp;Shiraz for &amp;Isfahan.  Before reaching 
&amp;Isfahan He wrote a letter to the &amp;Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih, the 
governor of the province, requesting a lodging in some suitable 
place with the sanction of the government.  The governor 
appointed the mansion of the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih.  There He abode 
forty days; and one day, agreeably to the request of the &amp;Imam, 
He wrote without reflection a commentary on [the &amp;Surih of] 
&amp;V'al-'Asr before the company.+F7  When this news reached the 
 
+F7 &amp;Qur'an 103.  
 
+P10 
&amp;Mu'tamid he sought an interview with Him and questioned 
Him concerning the "Special Mission."  At that same interview 
an answer proving the "Special Mission" was written.  
     The &amp;Mu'tamid then gave orders that all the doctors should 
assemble and dispute with Him in one conclave, and that the 
discussion should be faithfully recorded without alteration by 
the instrumentality of his private secretary, in order that it 
might be sent to &amp;Tihran, and that whatever the royal edict and 
decree should ordain might be carried out.  
     The doctors, however, considering this arrangement as a 
weakening of the Law, did not agree, but held a conclave and 
wrote, "If there be doubt in the matter there is need of 
assembly and discussion, but as this person's disagreement 
with the most luminous Law is clearer than the sun therefore 
the best possible thing is to put in practice the sentence of the 
Law."  
     The &amp;Mu'tamid then desired to hold the assembled conference 
in his own presence so that the actual truth might be 
disclosed and hearts be at peace, but these learned doctors and 
honorable scholars, unwilling to bring the Perspicuous Law 
into contempt, did not approve discussion and controversy 
with a young merchant, with the exception of that most 
erudite sage &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-Mihdi, and that eminent 
Platonist &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan of &amp;Nur.  So the conference terminated 
in questionings on certain points relating to the science of 
fundamental dogma, and the elucidation and analysis of the 
doctrines of &amp;Mulla &amp;Sadra.  So, as no conclusion was arrived at 
by the governor from this conference, the severe sentence and 
harsh decision of the learned doctors was not carried out; but, 
anxious to abate the great anxiety quickly and prevent a public 
tumult effectually, he gave currency to a report that a decree 
had been issued ordering the &amp;Bab to be sent to &amp;Tihran in order 
that some decisive settlement might be arrived at, or that some 
courageous divine might be able to confute [Him].  
     He accordingly sent Him forth from &amp;Isfahan with a company 
 
+P11 
of his own mounted bodyguard; but when they reached 
&amp;Murchih-Khar he gave secret orders for His return to &amp;Isfahan, 
where he afforded Him a refuge and asylum in his own roofed 
private quarters; and not a soul save the confidential and trusty 
dependents of the &amp;Mu'tamid knew aught of the &amp;Bab.  
     A period of four months passed in this fashion, and the 
&amp;Mu'tamid passed away to the mercy of God.  &amp;Gurgin &amp;Khan, 
the &amp;Mu'tamid's nephew, was aware of the &amp;Bab's being in the 
private apartments, and represented the matter to the Prime 
Minister.  &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, that celebrated minister, issued a 
decisive command and gave instructions that they should send 
the &amp;Bab secretly in disguise under the escort of &amp;Nusayri horsemen 
to the capital.  
     When He reached &amp;Kinar-Gird a fresh order came from the 
Prime Minister appointing the village of Kulayn as an abode 
and dwelling-place.  There He remained for a period of twenty 
days.  After that, the &amp;Bab forwarded a letter to the Royal 
Presence craving audience to set forth the truth of His condition, 
expecting this to be a means for the attainment of great 
advantages.  The Prime Minister did not admit this, and made 
representation to the Royal Presence:  "The royal cavalcade is 
on the point of starting, and to engage in such matters as the 
present will conduce to the disruption of the kingdom.  
Neither is there any doubt that the most notable doctors of the 
capital also will behave after the fashion of the doctors of 
&amp;Isfahan, which thing will be the cause of a popular outbreak, 
or that, according to the religion of the immaculate &amp;Imam, 
they will regard the blood of this siyyid as of no account, yea, 
as more lawful than mother's milk.  The imperial train is 
prepared for travel, neither is there hindrance or impediment 
in view.  There is no doubt that the presence of the &amp;Bab will be 
the cause of the gravest trouble and the greatest mischief.  
Therefore, on the spur of the moment, the wisest plan is this:  
to place this person in the Castle of &amp;Maku during the period of 
absence of the royal train from the seat of the imperial throne, 
 
+P12 
and to defer the obtaining of an audience to the time of 
return."  
     Agreeably to this view a letter was issued addressed to the 
&amp;Bab in his Majesty's own writing, and, according to the traditional 
account of the tenor of this letter, the epitome thereof is 
this:  
     (After the titles).  "Since the royal train is on the verge of 
departure from &amp;Tihran, to meet in a befitting manner is 
impossible.  Do you go to &amp;Maku and there abide and rest for 
a while, engaged in praying for our victorious state; and we 
have arranged that under all circumstances they shall show 
you attention and respect.  When we return from travel we will 
summon you specially."  
     After this they sent Him off with several mounted guards 
(amongst them &amp;Muhammad Big, the courier) to &amp;Tabriz and 
&amp;Maku.  
     Besides this the followers of the &amp;Bab recount certain messages 
conveyed [from Him] by the instrumentality of 
&amp;Muhammad Big (amongst which was a promise to heal the 
foot of the late king, but on condition of an interview, and the 
suppression of the tyranny of the majority), and the Prime 
Minister's prevention of the conveyance of these letters to the 
Royal Presence.  For he himself laid claim to be a spiritual 
guide and was prepared to perform the functions of religious 
directorship.  But others deny these accounts.  
     At all events in the course of the journey He wrote a letter to 
the Prime Minister saying, "You summoned Me from &amp;Isfahan 
to meet the doctors and for the attainment of a decisive 
settlement.  What has happened now that this excellent intention 
has been changed for &amp;Maku and &amp;Tabriz?"  
     Although He remained forty days in the city of &amp;Tabriz the 
learned doctors did not condescend to approach Him and did 
not deem it right to meet Him.  Then they sent Him off to the 
Castle of &amp;Maku, and for nine months lodged Him in the 
inaccessible castle which is situated on the summit of that lofty 
 
+P13 
mountain.  And &amp;Ali &amp;Khan of &amp;Maku, because of his excessive 
love for the family of the Prophet, paid Him such attention as 
was possible, and gave permission [to some persons] to converse 
with Him.  
     Now when the accomplished divines of &amp;Adhirbayjan perceived 
that in all the parts round about &amp;Tabriz it was as though 
the last day had come by reason of the excessive clamor, they 
requested the government to punish the [&amp;Bab's] followers, and 
to remove the &amp;Bab to the Castle of &amp;Chihriq.  So they sent Him 
to that castle and consigned Him to the keeping of &amp;Yahya 
&amp;Khan the Kurd.  
     Glory be to God!  Notwithstanding these decisions of great 
doctors and reverend lawyers, and severe punishments and 
reprimands--beatings, banishments, and imprisonments
--on the part of governors, this sect was daily on the increase, 
and the discussion and disputation was such that in meetings 
and assemblies in all parts of Persia there was no conversation 
but on this topic.  Great was the commotion which arose:  the 
doctors of the Perspicuous Religion were lamenting, the 
common folk clamorous and agitated, and the Friends rejoicing 
and applauding.  
     But the &amp;Bab Himself attached no importance to this uproar 
and tumult, and, alike on the road and in the castles of &amp;Maku 
and &amp;Chihriq, evening and morning, nay, day and night, in 
extremest rapture and amazement, He would restrict Himself 
to repeating and meditating on the qualities and attributes of 
that absent-yet-present, regarded-and-regarding Person of 
His.+F8  Thus He makes a mention of Him whereof this is the 
purport:  
     "Though the ocean of woe rageth on every side, and the 
bolts of fate follow in quick succession, and the darkness of 
griefs and afflictions invade soul and body, yet is My heart 
 
+F8 A reference to &amp;Baha'u'llah, "Him Whom God shall make manifest," 
+F8 whose precursor the &amp;Bab considered Himself to be.  
 
+P14 
brightened by the remembrance of Thy countenance and My 
soul is as a rosegarden from the perfume of Thy nature."  
     In short, after He had remained for three months in the 
Castle of &amp;Chihriq, the eminent doctors of &amp;Tabriz and scholars 
of &amp;Adhirbayjan wrote to &amp;Tihran and demanded a severe 
punishment in regard to the &amp;Bab for the intimidation and 
frightening of the people.  When the Prime Minister &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Aqasi beheld the ferment and clamor of the learned doctors in 
all districts of Persia, he perforce became their accomplice and 
ordered Him to be brought from &amp;Chihriq to &amp;Tabriz.  In the 
course of His transit by &amp;Urumiyyih the governor of the district 
&amp;Qasim &amp;Mirza treated Him with extraordinary deference, and a 
strange flocking together of high and low was apparent.  These 
conducted themselves with the utmost respectfulness.  
     When the &amp;Bab reached &amp;Tabriz they brought Him after some 
days before the government tribunal.  Of the learned doctors 
the &amp;Nizamu'l-'Ulama, &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-i-Mamaqani, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Ahmad the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih, &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Asghar the 
&amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam, and several other divines were present.  
They asked concerning the claims of the &amp;Bab.  He advanced 
the claim of &amp;Mihdi-hood; whereon a mighty tumult arose.  
Eminent doctors in overwhelming might compassed Him on 
all sides, and such was the onset of orthodoxy that it had been 
no great wonder if a mere youth had not withstood the mountain 
of Elburz.  They demanded proof.  Without hesitation He 
recited texts, saying, "This is the permanent and most mighty 
proof."  They criticized His grammar.  He adduced arguments 
from the &amp;Qur'an, setting forth therefrom instances of similar 
infractions of the rules of grammar.  So the assembly broke up 
and the &amp;Bab returned to His own dwelling.  
     The heaven-cradled Crown-Prince was at that time governor 
of &amp;Adhirbayjan.  He pronounced no sentence with regard 
to the &amp;Bab, nor did he desire to interfere with Him.  The 
doctors, however, considered it advisable at least to inflict a 
severe chastisement, and beating was decided on.  But none of 
 
+P15 
the corps of &amp;farrashes would agree to become the instruments 
of the infliction of this punishment.  So &amp;Mirza &amp;Ali-Asghar the 
&amp;Shaykhu'l-Islam, who was one of the noble Siyyids, brought 
Him to his own house and applied the rods with his own hand.  
After this they sent the &amp;Bab back to &amp;Chihriq and subjected Him 
to a strict confinement.  
     Now when the news of this beating, chastisement, imprisonment, 
and rigor reached all parts of Persia, learned divines 
and esteemed lawyers who were possessed of power and 
influence girt up the loins of endeavor for the eradication and 
suppression of this sect, exerting their utmost efforts therefore.  
And they wrote notice of their decision, to wit "that this person 
and his followers are in absolute error and are hurtful to 
Church and State."  And since the governors in Persia enjoyed 
the fullest authority, in some provinces they followed this 
decision and united in uprooting and dispersing the &amp;Babis.  But 
the late King &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah acted with deliberation in this 
matter, reflecting, "This Youth is of the Pure Lineage and of 
the family of him addressed with `were it not for thee.'  So long 
as no offensive actions which are incompatible with the public 
peace and well-being proceed from him, the government 
should not interfere with him."  And whenever the learned 
doctors appealed to him from the surrounding districts, he 
either gave no answer, or else commanded them to act with 
deliberation.  
     Notwithstanding this, between eminent doctors and illustrious 
scholars and those learned persons who were followers 
of the &amp;Bab opposition, discussion, and strife did so increase 
that in some provinces they desired [to resort to] mutual 
imprecation; and for the governors of the provinces, too, a 
means of acquiring gain was produced, so that great tumult 
and disturbance arose.  And since the malady of the gout had 
violently attacked the king's foot and occupied his world-ordering 
thought, the good judgment of the Chief Minister, 
the famous &amp;Haji &amp;Mirza &amp;Aqasi, became the pivot of the conduct 
 
+P16 
of affairs, and his incapacity and lack of resource became 
apparent as the sun.  For every hour he formed a new opinion 
and gave a new order:  at one moment he would seek to support 
the decision of the doctors, accounting the eradication and 
suppression of the &amp;Babis as necessary:  at another time he would 
charge the doctors with aggressiveness, regarding undue interference 
as contrary to justice:  at another time he would become 
a mystic and say, "All these voices are from the King,"+F9 
or repeat with his tongue, "Moses is at war with Moses,"+F10 or 
recite, "This is nought but Thy trial."+F11  In short this changeable 
minister, by reason of his mismanagement of important 
matters and failure to control and order the affairs of the 
community, so acted that disturbance and clamor arose from 
all quarters and directions:  the most notable and influential of 
the doctors ordered the common folk to molest the followers of 
the &amp;Bab, and a general onslaught took place.  More especially 
when the claim of &amp;Mihdi-hood reached the hearing of eminent 
divines and profound doctors they began to make lamentation 
and to cry and complain from their pulpits, saying, 
"One of the essentials of religion and of the authentic traditions 
transmitted from the holy &amp;Imams, nay, the chief basis of 
the foundations of the church of His Highness &amp;Ja'far, is the 
Occultation of the immaculate twelfth &amp;Imam (upon both of 
them be peace).  What has happened to &amp;Jabulqa?  Where has 
&amp;Jabulsa gone?  What was the Minor Occultation?  What has 
become of the Major Occultation?  What are the sayings of 
&amp;Husayn ibn &amp;Ruh, and what the tradition of Ibn &amp;Mihriyar?  
What shall we make of the flight of the Guardians and the 
Helpers?  How shall we deal with the conquest of the East and 
the West?  Where is the Ass of Antichrist?  When will the 
appearance of the &amp;Sufyan be?  Where are the signs which are in 
 
+F9 The &amp;Mathnavi.  
+F10 The &amp;Mathnavi.  
+F11 &amp;Qur'an 7:154 
 
+P17 
the traditions of the Holy Family?  Where is that whereon the 
Victorious Church is agreed?  The matter is not outside one of 
two alternatives:  either we must repudiate the traditions of the 
Holy &amp;Imams, grow wearied of the Church of &amp;Ja'far, and 
account the clear indications of the &amp;Imam as disturbed dreams; 
or, in accordance with the primary and subsidiary doctrines of 
the Faith and the essential and explicit declarations of the 
most luminous Law, we must consider the repudiation, nay, 
the destruction of this person as our chief duty.  If so be that we 
shut our eyes to these authentic traditions and obvious doctrines 
universally admitted, no remnant will endure of the 
fundamental basis of the Church of the immaculate &amp;Imam:  we 
shall neither be Sunnites, nor shall we be of the prevalent sect 
to continue awaiting the promised Saint and believing in the 
begotten &amp;Mihdi.+F12  Otherwise we must regard as admissible the 
opening of the Gate of Saintship, and consider that He Who is 
to arise of the family of &amp;Muhammad possesses two signs:  the 
first condition, Holy Lineage; the second, [that He is divinely] 
fortified with brilliant verses.  What can we do with these 
thousand-year-old beliefs of the delivered band of &amp;Shi'ites, or 
what shall we say concerning their profound doctors and 
preeminent divines?  Were all these in error?  Did they journey 
in the vale of transgression?  What an evidently false assertion 
is this!  By God, this is a thing to break the back!  O people, 
extinguish this fire and forget these words!  Alas!  woe to our 
Faith, woe to our Law!"  
     Thus did they make complaint in mosques and chapels, in 
pulpits and congregations.  
     But the &amp;Babi chiefs composed treatises against them, and set 
in order replies according to their own thought.  Were these to 
be discussed in detail it would conduce to prolixity, and our 
object is the statement of history, not of arguments for believing 
or rejecting; but of some of the replies the gist is this:  that 
 
+F12 The &amp;Shi'ites.  
 
+P18 
they held the Proof as supreme, and the evidence as outweighing 
traditions, considering the former as the root and the latter 
as the branch, and saying, "If the branch agree not with the 
root it serves not as an argument and is unworthy of reliance; 
for the reported consequence has no right to oppose itself to 
the established principle, and cannot argue against it."  Indeed 
in such cases they regarded interpretation as the truth of 
revelation and the essence of true exegesis:  thus, for instance, 
they interpreted the sovereignty of the &amp;Qa'im as a mystical 
sovereignty, and His conquests as conquests of the cities of 
hearts, adducing in support of this the meekness and defeat of 
the Chief of Martyrs (may the life of all being be a sacrifice for 
him).  For he was the true manifestation of the blessed verse 
"And verily our host shall overcome for them,"+F13 yet, notwithstanding 
this, he quaffed the cup of martyrdom with perfect 
meekness, and, at the very moment of uttermost defeat, 
triumphed over his enemies and became the most mighty of 
the troops of the Supreme Host.  Similarly they regarded the 
numerous writings which, in spite of His lack of education, 
the &amp;Bab had composed, as due to the promptings of the Holy 
Spirit; extracted from books contrary sayings handed down by 
men of mark; adduced traditions apparently agreeing with 
their objects; and clung to the announcements of certain 
notables of yore.  They also considered the conversion of 
austere and recluse doctors and eminent votaries of the Perspicuous 
Religion [of &amp;Islam] as a valid proof, deemed the 
steadfastness and constancy of the &amp;Bab a most mighty sign, and 
related miracles and the like; which things, being altogether 
foreign to our purpose, we have passed by with brevity, and 
will now proceed with our original topic.  
     At the time of these events certain persons appeared 
amongst the &amp;Babis who had a strange ascendancy and appearance 
in the eyes of this sect.  Amongst these was &amp;Mirza 
 
+F13 &amp;Qur'an 37:173.  
 
+P19 
&amp;Muhammad-'Ali of &amp;Mazindaran, who was the disciple of the 
illustrious Siyyid (may God exalt his station) &amp;Haji Siyyid 
&amp;Kazim of &amp;Rasht, and who was the associate and companion of 
the &amp;Bab in His pilgrimage journey.  After a while certain 
manners and states issued from him such that all, acting with 
absolute confidence, considered obedience to him as an impregnable 
stronghold, so that even &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn of &amp;Bushruyih, 
who was the leader of all and the arbiter appealed to alike 
by the noble and the humble of this sect, used to behave in his 
presence with great humility and with the self-abasement of a 
lowly servant.  
     This personage set himself to exalt the word of the &amp;Bab with 
the utmost steadfastness, and the &amp;Bab did full justice to speech 
in praising and glorifying him, accounting his uprising as an 
assistance from the Unseen.  In delivery and style he was 
"evident magic," and in firmness and constancy superior to 
all.  At length in the year [A.H.] 1265 at the sentence of the 
chief of lawyers the &amp;Sa'idu'l-'Ulama the chief divine of 
&amp;Barfurush, he yielded his head and surrendered his life amidst 
extremest clamor and outcry.  
     And amongst them was she who was entitled &amp;Qurratu'l-'Ayn 
the daughter of &amp;Haji &amp;Salih, the sage of &amp;Qazvin, the erudite 
doctor.  She, according to what is related, was skilled in diverse 
arts, amazed the understandings and thoughts of the most 
eminent masters by her eloquent dissertations on the exegesis 
and tradition of the Perspicuous Book, and was a mighty sign 
in the doctrines of the glorious &amp;Shaykh of &amp;Ahsa.  At the Supreme 
Shrines she borrowed light on matters divine from the 
lamp of &amp;Kazim, and freely sacrificed her life in the way of the 
&amp;Bab.  She discussed and disputed with the doctors and sages, 
loosing her tongue to establish her doctrine.  Such fame did 
she acquire that most people who were scholars or mystics 
sought to hear her speech and were eager to become acquainted 
with her powers of speculation and deduction.  She 
had a brain full of tumultuous ideas, and thoughts vehement 
 
+P20 
and restless.  In many places she triumphed over the contentious, 
expounding the most subtle questions.  When she was 
imprisoned in the house of [&amp;Mahmud] the Kalantar of &amp;Tihran, 
and the festivities and rejoicings of a wedding were going on, 
the wives of the city magnates who were present as guests were 
so charmed with the beauty of her speech that, forgetting the 
festivities, they gathered round her, diverted by listening to her 
words from listening to the melodies, and rendered indifferent 
by witnessing her marvels to the contemplation of the pleasant 
and novel sights which are incidental to a wedding.  In short in 
elocution she was the calamity of the age, and in ratiocination 
the trouble of the world.  Of fear or timidity there was no trace 
in her heart, nor had the admonitions of the kindly-disposed 
any profit or fruit for her.  Although she was of [such as are] 
damsels [meet] for the bridal bower, yet she wrested preeminence 
from stalwart men, and continued to strain the feet of 
steadfastness until she yielded up her life at the sentence of the 
mighty doctors in &amp;Tihran.  But were we to occupy ourselves 
with these details the matter would end in prolixity.  
     Well, Persia was in this critical state and the learned doctors 
perplexed and anxious, when the late Prince &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Shah died, and the throne of sovereignty was adorned with the 
person of the new monarch.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Taqi &amp;Khan &amp;Amir-Nizam, 
who was Prime Minister and Chief Regent, seized in the grasp 
of his despotic power the reins of the affairs of the commonwealth, 
and urged the steed of his ambition into the arena of 
willfulness and sole possession.  This minister was a person 
devoid of experience and wanting in consideration for the 
consequences of actions; bloodthirsty and shameless; and swift 
and ready to shed blood.  Severity in punishing he regarded as 
wise administration, and harshly entreating, distressing, intimidating, 
and frightening the people he considered as a 
fulcrum for the advancement of the monarchy.  And as His 
Majesty the King was in the prime of youthful years the 
minister fell into strange fancies and sounded the drum of 
 
+P21 
absolutism in [the conduct of] affairs:  on his own decisive 
resolution, without seeking permission from the Royal Presence 
or taking counsel with prudent statesmen, he issued 
orders to persecute the &amp;Babis, imagining that by overweening 
force he could eradicate and suppress matters of this nature, 
and that harshness would bear good fruit; whereas [in fact] to 
interfere with matters of conscience is simply to give them 
greater currency and strength; the more you strive to extinguish 
the more will the flame be kindled, more especially in 
matters of faith and religion, which spread and acquire 
influence so soon as blood is shed, and strongly affect men's 
hearts.  These things have been put to the proof, and the 
greatest proof is this very transaction.  Thus they relate that the 
possessions of a certain &amp;Babi in &amp;Kashan were plundered, and 
his household scattered and dispersed.  They stripped him 
naked and scourged him, defiled his beard, mounted him face 
backwards on an ass, and paraded him through the streets and 
bazaars with the utmost cruelty, to the sound of drums, 
trumpets, guitars, and tambourines.  A certain gabr who knew 
absolutely naught of the world or its denizens chanced to be 
seated apart in a corner of a caravansary.  When the clamor of 
the people rose high he hastened into the street, and, becoming 
cognizant of the offence and the offender, and the cause of 
his public disgrace and punishment in full detail, he fell to 
making search, and that very day entered the society of the 
&amp;Babis, saying, "This very ill-usage and public humiliation is a 
proof of truth and the very best of arguments.  Had it not been 
thus it might have been that a thousand years would have 
passed ere one like me became informed."  
     At all events the minister with the utmost arbitrariness, 
without receiving any instructions or asking permission, sent 
forth commands in all directions to punish and chastise the 
&amp;Babis.  Governors and magistrates sought a pretext for amassing 
wealth, and officials a means of [acquiring] profits; celebrated 
doctors from the summits of their pulpits incited men to 
 
+P22 
make a general onslaught; the powers of the religious and the 
civil law linked hands and strove to eradicate and destroy this 
people.  
     Now this people had not yet acquired such knowledge as 
was right and needful of the fundamental principles and 
hidden doctrines of the &amp;Bab's teachings, and did not recognize 
their duties.  Their conceptions and ideas were after the former 
fashion, and their conduct and behavior in correspondence 
with ancient usage.  The way of approach to the &amp;Bab was, 
moreover, closed, and the flame of trouble visibly blazing on 
every side.  At the decree of the most celebrated of the doctors, 
the government, and indeed the common people, had, with 
irresistible power, inaugurated rapine and plunder on all 
sides, and were engaged in punishing and torturing, killing 
and despoiling, in order that they might quench this fire and 
wither these [poor] souls.  In towns where these were but a 
limited number all of them with bound hands became food for 
the sword, while in cities where they were numerous they 
arose in self-defense agreeably to their former beliefs, since it 
was impossible for them to make inquiry as to their duty, and 
all doors were closed.  
     In &amp;Mazindaran amongst other places the people of the city 
of &amp;Barfurush at the command of the chief of the lawyers the 
&amp;Sa'idu'l-'Ulama made a general attack on &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn of 
&amp;Bushruyih and his followers, and slew six or seven persons.  
They were busy compassing the destruction of the rest also 
when &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn ordered the &amp;adhan to be sounded and 
stretched forth his hand to the sword, whereupon all sought 
flight, and the nobles and lords coming before him with the 
utmost penitence and deference agreed that he should be 
permitted to depart.  They further sent with them as a guard 
&amp;Khusraw of &amp;Qadi-Kala with horsemen and footmen, so that, 
according to the terms of the agreement, they might go forth 
safe and protected from the territory of &amp;Mazindaran.  When 
they, being ignorant of the fords and paths, had emerged from 
 
+P23 
the city, &amp;Khusraw dispersed his horsemen and footmen and set 
them in ambush in the forest of &amp;Mazindaran, scattered and 
separated the &amp;Babis in that forest on the road and off the road, 
and began to hunt them down singly.  When the reports of 
muskets arose on every side the hidden secret became manifest, 
and several wanderers and other persons were suddenly 
slain with bullets.  &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn ordered the &amp;adhan to be 
sounded to assemble his scattered followers, while &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Lutf-'Ali the secretary drew his dagger and ripped open 
&amp;Khusraw's vitals.  Of &amp;Khusraw's host some were slain and 
others wandered distractedly over the field of battle.  &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Husayn quartered his host in a fort near the burial-place of 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Tabarsi, and, being aware of the wishes of the community, 
relaxed and interrupted the march.  This detachment 
was subsequently further reinforced by &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
of &amp;Mazindaran with a number of other persons, so that the 
garrison of the fort numbered three hundred and thirteen 
souls.  Of these, however, all were not capable of fighting, only 
one hundred and ten persons being prepared for war.  Most of 
them were doctors or students whose companions had been 
during their whole life books and treatises; yet, in spite of the 
fact that they were unaccustomed to war or to the blows of shot 
and sword, four times were camps and armies arrayed against 
them and they were attacked and hemmed in with cannons, 
muskets, and bomb-shells, and on all four occasions they 
inflicted defeat, while the army was completely routed and 
dispersed.  On the occasion of the fourth defeat &amp;Abbas-Quli 
&amp;Khan of &amp;Larijan was captain of the forces and Prince 
&amp;Mihdi-Quli &amp;Mirza commander in the camp.  The &amp;Khan above 
mentioned used at nights to conceal and hide himself in 
disguise amongst the trees of the forest outside the camp, while 
during the day he was present in the encampment.  The last 
battle took place at night and the army was routed.  The &amp;Babis 
fired the tents and huts, and night became bright as day.  The 
foot of &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn's horse caught in a noose, for he was 
 
+P24 
riding, the others being on foot.  &amp;Abbas-Quli &amp;Khan recognized 
him from the top of a tree afar off, and with his own hand 
discharged several bullets.  At the third shot he threw him from 
his feet.  He was borne by his followers to the fort, and there 
they buried him.  Notwithstanding this event [the troops] 
could not prevail by superior force.  At length the Prince made 
a treaty and covenant, and swore by the Holy &amp;Imams, 
confirming his oath by vows plighted on the glorious &amp;Qur'an, 
to this effect:  "You shall not be molested; return to your own 
places."  Since their provisions had for some time been exhausted, 
so that even of the skins and bones of horses naught 
remained, and they had subsisted for several days on pure 
water, they agreed.  When they arrived at the army food was 
prepared for them in a place outside the camp.  They were 
engaged in eating, having laid aside their weapons and armor, 
when the soldiers fell on them on all sides and slew them all.  
Some have accounted this valor displayed by these people as a 
thing miraculous, but when a band of men are besieged in 
some place where all avenues and roads are stopped and all 
hope of deliverance is cut off they will assuredly defend themselves 
desperately and display bravery and courage.  
     In &amp;Zanjan and &amp;Nayriz likewise at the decree of erudite 
doctors and notable lawyers a bloodthirsty military force attacked 
and besieged.  In &amp;Zanjan the chief was &amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
the mujtahid, while in &amp;Nayriz Siyyid &amp;Yahya 
of &amp;Darab was the leader and arbiter.  At first they sought to 
bring about a reconciliation, but, meeting with cruel ferocity, 
they reached the pitch of desperation; and, the overpowering 
force of the victorious troops having cut off every passage of 
flight, they unclosed their hands in resistance.  But although 
they were very strong in battle and amazed the chiefs of the 
army by their steadfastness and endurance, the overwhelming 
military force closed the passage of flight and broke their wings 
and feathers.  After numerous battles they too at last yielded to 
covenants and compacts, oaths and promises, vows registered 
 
+P25 
on the &amp;Qur'an, and the wonderful stratagems of the officers, 
and were all put to the edge of the sword.  
     Were we to occupy ourselves in detail with the wars of 
&amp;Nayriz and &amp;Zanjan, or to set forth these events from beginning 
to end, this epitome would become a bulky volume.  So, since 
this would be of no advantage to history, we have passed them 
over briefly.  
     During the course of the events which took place at &amp;Zanjan 
the Prime Minister devised a final and trenchant remedy.  
Without the royal command, without consulting with the 
ministers of the subject-protecting court, he, acting with arbitrary 
disposition, fixed determination, and entirely on his own 
authority, issued commands to put the &amp;Bab to death.  This 
befell in brief as follows.  The governor of &amp;Adhirbayjan, Prince 
&amp;Hamzih &amp;Mirza, was unwilling that the execution of this sentence 
should be at his hands, and said to the brother of the 
&amp;Amir, &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan &amp;Khan, "This is a vile business and an easy 
one; anyone is capable and competent.  I had imagined that 
His Excellency the Regent would commission me to make war 
on the Afghans or Uzbegs or appoint me to attack and invade 
the territory of Russia or Turkey."  So &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan &amp;Khan 
wrote his excuse in detail to the &amp;Amir.  
     Now the Siyyid &amp;Bab had disposed all His affairs before 
setting out from &amp;Chihriq towards &amp;Tabriz, had placed His 
writings and even His ring and pen-case in a specially prepared 
box, put the key of the box in an envelope, and sent it by 
means of &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir, who was one of His first associates, to 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim of &amp;Qazvin.  This trust &amp;Mulla &amp;Baqir delivered 
over to &amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim at Qum in presence of a 
numerous company.  At the solicitations of those present he 
opened the lid of the box and said, "I am commanded to 
convey this trust to &amp;Baha'u'llah:  more than this ask not of me, 
for I cannot tell you."  Importuned by the company, he produced 
a long epistle in blue, penned in the most graceful 
manner with the utmost delicacy and firmness in a beautiful 
 
+P26 
minute &amp;shikastih hand, written in the shape of a man so 
closely that it would have been imagined that it was a single 
wash of ink on the paper.  When they had read this epistle 
[they perceived that] He had produced three hundred and sixty 
derivatives from the word &amp;Baha.  Then &amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim 
conveyed the trust to its destination.  
     Well, we must return to our original narrative.  The Prime 
Minister issued a second order to his brother &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan 
&amp;Khan, the gist of which order was this:  "Obtain a formal and 
explicit sentence from the learned doctors of &amp;Tabriz who are 
the firm support of the Church of &amp;Ja'far (upon him be peace) 
and the impregnable stronghold of the &amp;Shi'ite faith; summon 
the Christian regiment of &amp;Urumiyyih; suspend the &amp;Bab before 
all the people; and give orders for the regiment to fire a volley."  
     &amp;Mirza &amp;Hasan &amp;Khan summoned his chief of the &amp;farrashes, 
and gave him his instructions.  They removed the &amp;Bab's turban 
and sash which were the signs of His Siyyid-hood, brought 
Him with four of His followers to the barrack square of &amp;Tabriz, 
confined Him in a cell, and appointed forty of the Christian 
soldiers of &amp;Tabriz to guard Him.  
     Next day the chief of the &amp;farrashes delivered over the &amp;Bab 
and a young man named &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-'Ali who was of a 
noble family of &amp;Tabriz to &amp;Sam &amp;Khan, colonel of the Christian 
regiment of &amp;Urumiyyih, at the sentences of the learned divine 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Muhammad of &amp;Mamaqan, of the second ecclesiastical 
authority &amp;Mulla &amp;Mirza &amp;Baqir, and of the third ecclesiastical 
authority &amp;Mulla &amp;Murtada-Quli and others.  An iron nail was 
hammered into the middle of the staircase of the very cell 
wherein they were imprisoned, and two ropes were hung 
down.  By one rope the &amp;Bab was suspended and by the other 
rope &amp;Aqa &amp;Muhammad-'Ali, both being firmly bound in such 
wise that the head of that young man was on the &amp;Bab's breast.  
The surrounding housetops billowed with teeming crowds.  A 
regiment of soldiers ranged itself in three files.  The first file 
fired; then the second file, and then the third file discharged 
 
+P27 
volleys.  From the fire of these volleys a mighty smoke was 
produced.  When the smoke cleared away they saw that young 
man standing and the &amp;Bab seated by the side of His amanuensis 
&amp;Aqa Siyyid &amp;Husayn in the very cell from the staircase of 
which they had suspended them.  To neither one of them had 
the slightest injury resulted.  
     &amp;Sam &amp;Khan the Christian asked to be excused; the turn of 
service came to another regiment, and the chief of the 
&amp;farrashes withheld his hand.  &amp;Aqa &amp;Jan Big of &amp;Khamsih, colonel 
of the bodyguard, advanced; and they again bound the &amp;Bab 
together with that young man to the same nail.  The &amp;Bab 
uttered certain words which those few who knew Persian 
understood, while the rest heard but the sound of His voice.  
     The colonel of the regiment appeared in person:  and it was 
before noon on the twenty-eighth day of &amp;Sha'ban in the year 
[A.H.] one thousand two hundred and sixty-six.+F14  Suddenly he 
gave orders to fire.  At this volley the bullets produced such an 
effect that the breasts [of the victims] were riddled, and their 
limbs were completely dissected, except their faces, which 
were but little marred.  
     Then they removed those two bodies from the square to the 
edge of the moat outside the city, and that night they remained 
by the edge of the moat.  Next day the Russian consul came 
with an artist and took a picture of those two bodies in the 
posture wherein they had fallen at the edge of the moat.  
     On the second night at midnight the &amp;Babis carried away the 
two bodies.  
     On the third day the people did not find the bodies, and 
some supposed that the wild beasts had devoured them, so that 
the doctors proclaimed from the summits of their pulpits 
saying, "The holy body of the immaculate &amp;Imam and that of 
the true &amp;Shi'ite are preserved from the encroachments of beasts 
of prey and creeping things and wounds, but the body of this 
 
+F14 9 July 1850.  
 
+P28 
person have the wild beasts torn in pieces."  But after the fullest 
investigation and inquiry it hath been proved that when the 
&amp;Bab had dispersed all His writings and personal properties and 
it had become clear and evident from various signs that these 
events would shortly take place, therefore, on the second day 
of these events, &amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan the son of &amp;Yahya &amp;Khan, one 
of the nobles of &amp;Adhirbayjan devoted to the &amp;Bab, arrived, and 
proceeded straightway to the house of the mayor of &amp;Tabriz.  
And since the mayor was an old friend, associate, and 
confidant of his; since, moreover, he was of the mystic temperament 
and did not entertain aversion or dislike for any sect, 
&amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan divulged this secret to him saying, "Tonight 
I, with several others, will endeavor by every means and 
artifice to rescue the body.  Even though it be not possible, 
come what may we will make an attack, and either attain our 
object or pour out our lives freely in this way."  "Such troubles," 
answered the mayor, "are in no wise necessary."  He 
then sent one of his private servants named &amp;Haji &amp;Allah-Yar, 
who, by whatever means and proceedings it was, obtained the 
body without trouble or difficulty and handed it over to &amp;Haji 
&amp;Sulayman &amp;Khan.  And when it was morning the sentinels, to 
excuse themselves, said that the wild beasts had devoured it.  
That night they sheltered the body in the workshop of a &amp;Babi of 
&amp;Milan:  next day they manufactured a box, placed it in the box, 
and left it as a trust.  Afterwards, in accordance with instructions 
which arrived from &amp;Tihran, they sent it away from 
&amp;Adhirbayjan.  And this transaction remained absolutely secret.  
     Now in these years [A.H. one thousand two hundred and] 
sixty-six and sixty-seven throughout all Persia fire fell on the 
households of the &amp;Babis, and each one of them, in whatever 
hamlet he might be, was, on the slightest suspicion arising, 
put to the sword.  More than four thousand souls were slain, 
and a great multitude of women and children, left without 
protector or helper, distracted and confounded, were trodden 
down and destroyed.  And all these occurrences were brought 
 
+P29 
about solely by the arbitrary decision and command of &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Taqi &amp;Khan, who imagined that by the enactment of a crushing 
punishment this sect would be dispersed and disappear in such 
wise that all sign and knowledge of them would be cut off.  
Ere long had passed the contrary of his imagination appeared, 
and it became certain that [the &amp;Babis] were increasing.  The 
flame rose higher and the contagion became swifter:  the affair 
waxed grave and the report thereof reached other climes.  At 
first it was confined to Persia:  later it spread to the rest of the 
world.  Quaking and affliction resulted in constancy and stability, 
and grievous pains and punishment caused acceptance 
and attraction.  The very events produced an impression; impression 
led to investigation; and investigation resulted in 
increase.  Through the ill-considered policy of the Minister this 
edifice became fortified and strengthened, and these foundations 
firm and solid.  Previously the matter used to be regarded 
as commonplace:  subsequently it acquired a grave importance 
in men's eyes.  Many persons from all parts of the world set out 
for Persia, and began to seek with their whole hearts.  For it 
hath been proved by experience in the world that in the case 
of such matters of conscience laceration causeth healing; 
censure produceth increased diligence; prohibition induceth 
eagerness; and intimidation createth avidity.  The root is hidden 
in the very heart, while the branch is apparent and 
evident.  When one branch is cut off other branches grow.  
Thus it is observed that when such matters occur in other 
countries they become extinct spontaneously through lack of 
attention and exiguity of interest.  For up to the present moment 
of movements pertaining to religion many have appeared 
in the countries of Europe, but, noninterference and 
absence of bigotry having deprived them of importance, in a 
little while they became effaced and dispelled.  
     After this event there was wrought by a certain &amp;Babi a great 
error and a grave presumption and crime, which has blackened 
the page of the history of this sect and given it an ill name 
 
+P30 
throughout the civilized world.  Of this event the marrow is 
this, that during the time when the &amp;Bab was residing in 
&amp;Adhirbayjan a youth, &amp;Sadiq by name, became affected with 
the utmost devotion to the &amp;Bab, night and day was busy in 
serving Him, and became bereft of thought and reason.  Now 
when that which befell the &amp;Bab in &amp;Tabriz took place, this 
servant, actuated by his own fond fancies, fell into thoughts of 
seeking blood-revenge.  And since he knew naught of the 
details of the events, the absolute autocracy of the 
&amp;Amir-Nizam, his unbridled power, and sole authority; nor 
[was aware] that this sentence had been promulgated absolutely 
without the cognizance of the Royal Court, and that the 
Prime Minister had presumptuously issued the order on his 
own sole responsibility; since, on the contrary, he supposed 
that agreeably to ordinary custom and usage the attendants of 
the court had had a share in, and a knowledge of this sentence, 
therefore, [impelled by] folly, frenzy, and his evil star, nay, by 
sheer madness, he rose up from &amp;Tabriz and came straight to 
&amp;Tihran, one other person being his accomplice.  Then, since 
the Royal Train had its abode in &amp;Shimiran, he thither directed 
his steps.  God is our refuge!  By him was wrought a deed so 
presumptuous that the tongue is unable to declare and the pen 
loath to describe it.  Yet to God be praise and thankfulness that 
this madman had charged his pistol with shot, imagining this 
to be preferable and superior to all projectiles.  
     Then all at once commotion arose, and this sect became of 
such ill repute that still, strive and struggle as they may to 
escape from the curse and disgrace and dishonor of this deed, 
they are unable to do so.  They will recount from the first 
manifestation of the &amp;Bab until the present time; but when the 
thread of the discourse reaches this event they are abashed and 
hang their heads in shame, repudiating the presumptuous 
actor and accounting him the destroyer of the edifice and the 
cause of shame to mankind.  
     Now after the occurrence of this grave matter all of this sect 
 
+P31 
were suspected.  At first there was neither investigation nor 
inquiry, but afterwards in mere justice it was decided that 
there should be investigation, inquiry, and examination.  All 
who were known to be of this sect fell under suspicion.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah was passing the summer in the village of &amp;Afchih 
situated one stage from &amp;Tihran.  When this news was spread 
abroad and punishment began, everyone who was able hid 
himself in some retreat or fled the country.  Amongst these 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, the brother of &amp;Baha'u'llah, concealed himself, 
and, a bewildered fugitive, in the guise of a dervish, with 
&amp;kashkul in hand, wandered in mountains and plains on the 
road to &amp;Rasht.  But &amp;Baha'u'llah rode forth with perfect composure 
and calmness from &amp;Afchih, and came to &amp;Niyavaran, 
which was the abode of the Royal Train and the station of the 
imperial camp.  Immediately on His arrival He was placed 
under arrest, and a whole regiment guarded Him closely.  
After several days of interrogation they sent Him in chains and 
fetters from &amp;Shimiran to the jail of &amp;Tihran.  And this harshness 
and punishment was due to the immoderate importunity of 
&amp;Haji &amp;Ali &amp;Khan, the &amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih, nor did there seem any 
hope of deliverance, until His Majesty the King, moved by his 
own kindly spirit, commanded circumspection, and ordered 
this occurrence to be investigated and examined particularly 
and generally by means of the ministers of the imperial court.  
     Now when &amp;Baha'u'llah was interrogated on this matter He 
answered in reply, "The event itself indicates the truth of the 
affair and testifies that this is the action of a thoughtless, 
unreasoning, and ignorant man.  For no reasonable person 
would charge his pistol with shot when embarking on so grave 
an enterprise.  At least he would so arrange and plan it that the 
deed should be orderly and systematic.  From the very nature 
of the event it is clear and evident as the sun that it is not the act 
of such as Myself."  
     So it was established and proven that the assassin had on his 
own responsibility engaged in this grievous action and monstrous 
 
+P32 
deed with the idea and design of taking blood revenge 
for his Master, and that it concerned no one else.  And when 
the truth of the matter became evident the innocence of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah from this suspicion was established in such wise 
that no doubt remained for anyone; the decision of the court 
declared His purity and freedom from this charge; and it 
became apparent and clear that what had been done with 
regard to Him was due to the efforts of His foes and the hasty 
folly of the &amp;Hajibu'd-Dawlih.  Therefore did the government 
of eternal duration desire to restore certain properties and 
estates which had been confiscated, that thereby it might 
pacify Him.  But since the chief part of these was lost and only 
an inconsiderable portion was forthcoming, none came forward 
to claim them.  Indeed &amp;Baha'u'llah requested permission 
to withdraw to the Supreme Shrines+F15 [of &amp;Karbila and Najaf] 
and, after some months, by the royal permission and with the 
leave of the Prime Minister, set out accompanied by one of the 
King's messengers for the Shrines.  
     Let us return, however, to our original subject.  Of the &amp;Bab's 
writings many remained in men's hands.  Some of these were 
commentaries on, and interpretations of the verses of the 
&amp;Qur'an; some were prayers, homilies, and hints of [the true 
significance of certain] passages; others were exhortations, 
admonitions, dissertations on the different branches of the 
doctrine of the Divine Unity, demonstrations of the special 
prophetic mission of the Lord of existing things [&amp;Muhammad], 
and (as it hath been understood) encouragements 
to amendment of character, severance from worldly 
states, and dependence on the inspirations of God.  But the 
 
+F15 &amp;Atabat &amp;Aliyat, literally Supreme Shrines, a term by which the &amp;Shi'ih 
+F15 Muslims referred to the cities of &amp;Kazimayn, Najaf, and &amp;Karbila and 
+F15 generally applied to the region of eastern &amp;Iraq, of which &amp;Baghdad was 
+F15 the center.  When &amp;Baha'u'llah was released from prison and banished from 
+F15 Persia, He chose &amp;Baghdad for the place of His exile.  
 
+P33 
essence and purport of His compositions were the praises and 
descriptions of that Reality soon to appear which was His only 
object and aim, His darling, and His desire.+F16  For He regarded 
His own appearance as that of a harbinger of good tidings, and 
considered His own real nature merely as a means for the 
manifestation of the greater perfections of that One.  And 
indeed He ceased not from celebrating Him by night or day for 
a single instant, but used to signify to all His followers that they 
should expect His arising:  in such wise that He declares in His 
writings, "I am a letter out of that most mighty book and a 
dewdrop from that limitless ocean, and, when He shall appear, 
My true nature, My mysteries, riddles, and intimations 
will become evident, and the embryo of this religion shall 
develop through the grades of its being and ascent, attain to the 
station of `the most comely of forms,'+F17 and become adorned 
with the robe of `blessed be God, the Best of Creators.'+F18  And 
this event will disclose itself in the year [A.H. one thousand two 
hundred and] sixty-nine,+F19 which corresponds to the number 
of the year of `after a while,' and `thou shalt see the mountains 
which thou thinkest so solid passing away like the passing of 
the clouds'+F20 shall be fulfilled."  In short He so described Him 
that, in His own expression, He regarded approach to the 
divine bounty and attainment of the highest degrees of perfection 
in the worlds of humanity as dependent on love for Him, 
and so inflamed was He with His flame that commemoration 
of Him was the bright candle of His dark nights in the fortress 
 
+F16 That is, &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
+F17 &amp;Qur'an 95:4.  
+F18 &amp;Qur'an 23:14.  
+F19 1852.  &amp;Hin, according to the Abjad notation, equals 68.  Cf. The 
+F19 Dawn-Breakers:  &amp;Nabil's Narrative of the Early Days of the &amp;Baha'i 
+F19 Revelation, trans. and ed. Shoghi Effendi (Wilmette, Ill.:  &amp;Baha'i 
+F19 Publishing Trust, 1932), p. 18, note 1:  In 1268 &amp;Baha'u'llah, chained 
+F19 in the Black Pit of &amp;Tihran, received the first intimations of His 
+F19 Divine Mission, and that same year hinted of this in His odes.  
+F20 &amp;Qur'an 27:90.  
 
+P34 
of &amp;Maku, and remembrance of Him was the best of companions 
in the straits of the prison of &amp;Chihriq.  Thereby He 
obtained spiritual enlargements; with His wine was He inebriated; 
and at remembrance of Him did He rejoice.  All of His 
followers too were in expectation of the appearance of these 
signs, and each one of His intimates was seeking after the 
fulfillment of these forecasts.  
     Now from the beginning of the manifestation of the &amp;Bab 
there was in &amp;Tihran (which the &amp;Bab called the Holy Land) a 
Youth of the family of one of the ministers and of noble 
lineage, gifted in every way, and adorned with purity and 
nobility.  Although He combined lofty lineage with high connection, 
and although His ancestors were men of note in 
Persia and universally sought after, yet He was not of a race of 
doctors or a family of scholars.  Now this Youth was from His 
earliest adolescence celebrated amongst those of the ministerial 
class, both relatives and strangers, for single-mindedness, 
and was from childhood pointed out as remarkable for sagacity, 
and held in regard in the eyes of the wise.  He did not, 
however, after the fashion of His ancestors, desire elevation to 
lofty ranks nor seek advancement to splendid but transient 
positions.  His extreme aptitude was nevertheless admitted by 
all, and His excessive acuteness and intelligence were universally 
avowed.  In the eyes of the common folk He enjoyed a 
wonderful esteem, and in all gatherings and assemblies He 
had a marvelous speech and delivery.  Notwithstanding lack of 
instruction and education such was the keenness of His penetration 
and the readiness of His apprehension that when during 
His youthful prime He appeared in assemblies where questions 
of divinity and points of metaphysic were being discussed, 
and, in presence of a great concourse of doctors and 
scholars loosed His tongue, all those present were amazed, 
accounting this as a sort of prodigy beyond the discernment 
natural to the human race.  From His early years He was the 
 
+P35 
hope of His kindred and the unique one of His family and 
race, nay, their refuge and shelter.  
     However, in spite of these conditions and circumstances, as 
He wore a &amp;kulah on His head and locks flowing over His 
shoulder, no one imagined that He would become the source 
of such matters, or that the waves of His flood would reach the 
zenith of this firmament.  
     When the question of the &amp;Bab was noised abroad signs of 
partiality appeared in Him.  At the first He apprised His relatives 
and connections, and the children and dependents of His 
own circle; subsequently He occupied His energies by day and 
night in inviting friends and strangers [to embrace the new 
faith].  He arose with mighty resolution, engaged with the 
utmost constancy in systematizing the principles and consolidating 
the ethical canons of that society in every way, and 
strove by all means to protect and guard these people.  
     When He had [thus] established the foundations in &amp;Tihran 
He hastened to &amp;Mazindaran, where He displayed in assemblies, 
meetings, conferences, inns, mosques, and colleges a 
mighty power of utterance and exposition.  Whoever beheld 
His open brow or heard His vivid eulogies perceived Him with 
the eye of actual vision to be a patent demonstration, a latent 
magnetic force, and a pervading influence.  A great number 
both of rich and poor and of erudite doctors were attracted by 
His preaching and washed their hands of heart and life, being 
so enkindled that they laid down their lives under the sword 
dancing [with joy].  
     Thus, amongst many instances, one day four learned and 
accomplished scholars of the divines of &amp;Nur were present in 
His company, and in such wise did He expound that all four 
were involuntarily constrained to entreat Him to accept them 
for His service.  For by dint of His eloquence, which was like 
"evident sorcery," He satisfied these eminent doctors that they 
were in reality children engaged in the rudiments of study and 
 
+P36 
the merest tyros, and that therefore they must read the alphabet 
from the beginning.  Several protracted conferences 
were passed in expounding and elucidating the Point and the 
Alif of the Absolute, wherein the doctors present were astounded, 
and filled with amazement and astonishment at the 
seething and roaring of the ocean of His utterance.  The report 
of this occurrence reached the hearing of far and near, and 
deep despondency fell on the adversaries.  The regions of &amp;Nur 
were filled with excitement and commotion at these events, 
and the noise of this mischief and trouble smote the ears of the 
citizens of &amp;Barfurush.  The chief divine of &amp;Nur, &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Muhammad, was in &amp;Qishlaq.  When he heard of these occurrences 
he sent two of the most distinguished and profound of 
the doctors, who were possessed of wondrous eloquence, 
effective oratorical talent, conclusiveness of argument, and 
brilliant powers of demonstration, to quench this fire, and to 
subdue and overcome this Young Man by force of argument, 
either reducing Him to penitence, or causing Him to despair 
of the successful issue of His projects.  Glory be to God for His 
wondrous decrees!  When those two doctors entered the presence 
of that Young Man, saw the waves of His utterance, and 
heard the force of His arguments, they unfolded like the rose 
and were stirred like the multitude, and, abandoning altar and 
chair, pulpit and preferment, wealth and luxury, and evening 
and morning congregations, they applied themselves to the 
furtherance of the objects of this Person, even inviting the 
chief divine to tender his allegiance.  So when this Young Man 
with a faculty of speech like a rushing torrent set out for &amp;Amul 
and &amp;Sari He met with that experienced doctor and that illustrious 
divine in &amp;Qishlaq of &amp;Nur.  And the people assembled from 
all quarters awaiting the result.  His accomplished reverence 
the divine, although he was of universally acknowledged excellence, 
and in science the most learned of his contemporaries, 
nevertheless decided to have recourse to augury as to 
[whether he should engage in] discussion and disputation.  
 
+P37 
This did not prove favorable and he therefore excused himself, 
deferring [the discussion] until some other time.  His incompetency 
and shortcoming thereby became known and suspected, 
and this caused the adherence, confirmation, and edification 
of many.  
     In brief outline the narrative is this.  For some while He 
wandered about in those districts.  After the death of the late 
prince &amp;Muhammad &amp;Shah He returned to &amp;Tihran, having in 
His mind [the intention of] corresponding and entering into 
relations with the &amp;Bab.  The medium of this correspondence 
was the celebrated &amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim of &amp;Qazvin, who was 
the &amp;Bab's mainstay and trusted intimate.  Now since a great 
celebrity had been attained for &amp;Baha'u'llah in &amp;Tihran, and the 
hearts of men were disposed towards Him, He, together with 
&amp;Mulla &amp;Abdu'l-Karim, considered it as expedient that, in face 
of the agitation amongst the doctors, the aggressiveness of the 
greater part of [the people of] Persia, and the irresistible power 
of the &amp;Amir-Nizam, whereby both the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah 
were in great danger and liable to incur severe punishment, 
some measure should be adopted to direct the thoughts of men 
towards some absent person, by which means &amp;Baha'u'llah 
would remain protected from the interference of all men.  And 
since further, having regard to sundry considerations, they did 
not consider an outsider as suitable, they cast the lot of this 
augury to the name of &amp;Baha'u'llah's brother &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya.  
     By the assistance and instruction of &amp;Baha'u'llah, therefore, 
they made him notorious and famous on the tongues of friends 
and foes, and wrote letters, ostensibly at his dictation, to the 
&amp;Bab.  And since secret correspondences were in process the 
&amp;Bab highly approved of this scheme.  So &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya was 
concealed and hidden while mention of him was on the 
tongues and in the mouths of men.  And this mighty plan was 
of wondrous efficacy, for &amp;Baha'u'llah, though He was known 
and seen, remained safe and secure, and this veil was the cause 
that no one outside [the sect] fathomed the matter or fell into 
 
+P38 
the idea of molestation, until &amp;Baha'u'llah quitted &amp;Tihran at the 
permission of the King and was permitted to withdraw to the 
Supreme Shrines.  
     When He reached &amp;Baghdad and the crescent moon of the 
month of &amp;Muharram of the year [A.H. one thousand two 
hundred and] sixty-nine (which was termed in the books of the 
&amp;Bab "the year of `after a while'" and wherein He had promised 
the disclosure of the true nature of His religion and its mysteries) 
shone forth from the horizon of the world, this covert 
secret, as is related, became apparent amongst all within and 
without [the society].  &amp;Baha'u'llah with mighty steadfastness 
became a target for the arrows of all amongst mankind, while 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya in disguise passed his time, now in the environs 
and vicinity of &amp;Baghdad engaged for better concealment in 
various trades, now in &amp;Baghdad itself in the garb of the Arabs.  
     Now &amp;Baha'u'llah so acted that the hearts of this sect were 
drawn towards Him, while most of the inhabitants of &amp;Iraq 
were reduced to silence and speechlessness, some being 
amazed and others angered.  After remaining there for one 
year He withdrew His hand from all things, abandoned relatives 
and connections, and, without the knowledge of His 
followers, quitted &amp;Iraq alone and solitary, without companion, 
supporter, associate, or comrade.  For nigh upon two 
years He dwelt in Turkish &amp;Kurdistan, generally in a place 
named &amp;Sar-Galu, situated in the mountains, and far removed 
from human habitations.  Sometimes on rare occasions He 
used to frequent &amp;Sulaymaniyyih.  Ere long had elapsed the 
most eminent doctors of those regions got some inkling of His 
circumstances and conditions, and conversed with Him on 
the solution of certain difficult questions connected with the 
most abstruse points of theology.  Having witnessed on His part 
ample signs and satisfactory explanations they observed towards 
Him the utmost respectfulness and deference.  In consequence 
of this He acquired a great fame and wonderful reputation 
in those regions, and fragmentary accounts of Him were 
 
+P39 
circulated in all quarters and directions, to wit that a stranger, 
a Persian, had appeared in the district of &amp;Sulaymaniyyih 
(which hath been, from of old, the place whence the most 
expert doctors of the Sunnites have arisen), and that the people 
of that country had loosed their tongues in praise of Him.  
From the rumor thus heard it was known that that Person was 
none other than &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Several persons, therefore, hastened 
thither, and began to entreat and implore, and the 
urgent entreaty of all brought about His return.  
     Now although this sect had not been affected with quaking 
or consternation at these grievous events, such as the slaughter 
of their Chief and the rest, but did rather increase and multiply; 
still, since the &amp;Bab was but beginning to lay the foundations 
when He was slain, therefore was this community ignorant 
concerning its proper conduct, action, behavior, and 
duty, their sole guiding principle being love for the &amp;Bab.  This 
ignorance was the reason that in some parts disturbances 
occurred; for, experiencing violent molestation, they unclosed 
their hands in self-defense.  But after His return 
&amp;Baha'u'llah made such strenuous efforts in educating, teaching, 
training, regulating, and reconstructing this community 
that in a short while all these troubles and mischiefs were 
quenched, and the utmost tranquility and repose reigned in 
men's hearts; so that, according to what hath been heard, it 
became clear and obvious even to statesmen that the fundamental 
intentions and ideas of this sect were things spiritual, 
and such as are connected with pure hearts; that their true and 
essential principles were to reform the morals and beautify the 
conduct of the human race, and that with things material they 
had absolutely no concern.  
     When these principles, then, were established in the hearts 
of this sect they so acted in all lands that they became celebrated 
amongst statesmen for gentleness of spirit, steadfastness 
of heart, right intent, good deeds, and excellence of conduct.  
For this people are most well-disposed towards obedience and 
 
+P40 
submissiveness, and, on receiving such instruction, they conformed 
their conduct and behavior thereto.  Formerly exception 
was taken to the words, deeds, demeanor, morals, and 
conduct of this sect:  now objection is made in Persia to their 
tenets and spiritual state.  Now this is beyond the power of 
man, that he should be able by interference or objection to 
change the heart and conscience, or meddle with the convictions 
of anyone.  For in the realm of conscience naught but the 
ray of God's light can command, and on the throne of the 
heart none but the pervading power of the King of Kings 
should rule.  Thus it is that one can arrest and suspend [the 
action of] every faculty except thought and reflection; for a 
man cannot even by his own volition withhold himself from 
reflection or thought, nor keep back his musings and imaginings.  
     At all events the undeniable truth is this, that for nigh upon 
thirty-five years no action opposed to the government or prejudicial 
to the nation has emanated from this sect or been 
witnessed [on their part], and that during this long period, 
notwithstanding the fact that their numbers and strength are 
double what they were formerly, no sound has arisen from any 
place, except that every now and then learned doctors and 
eminent scholars (really for the extension of this report 
through the world and the awakening of men) sentence some 
few to death.  For such interference is not destruction but 
edification when thou regardest the truth, which will not 
thereby become quenched and forgotten, but rather stimulated 
and advertised.  
     I will at least relate one short anecdote of what actually took 
place.  A certain person violently molested and grievously 
injured a certain &amp;Babi.  The victim unclosed his hand in 
retaliation and arose to take vengeance, unsheathing his 
weapon against the aggressor.  Becoming the object of censure 
and reprimand of this sect, however, he took refuge in flight.  
 
+P41 
When he reached &amp;Hamadan his character became known, 
and, as he was of the clerical class, the doctors vehemently 
pursued him, handed him over to the government, and ordered 
chastisement to be inflicted.  By chance there fell out 
from the fold of his collar a document written by &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
the subject of which was reproof of attempts at retaliation, 
censure and reprobation of the search after vengeance, and 
prohibition from following after lusts.  Amongst other matters 
they found these expressions contained in it:  "Verily God is 
quit of the seditious," and likewise:  "If ye be slain it is better for 
you than that ye should slay.  And when ye are tormented have 
recourse to the controllers of affairs and the refuge of the 
people; and if ye be neglected then entrust your affairs to the 
Jealous Lord.  This is the mark of the sincere, and the characteristic 
of the assured."  When the governor became cognizant 
of this writing he addressed that person saying, "By the decree 
of that Chief whom you yourself obey correction is necessary 
and punishment and chastisement obligatory."  "If," replied 
that person, "you will carry out all His precepts I shall have the 
utmost pleasure in [submitting to] punishment and death."  
The governor smiled and let the man go.  
     So &amp;Baha'u'llah made the utmost efforts to educate [His 
people] and incite [them] to morality, the acquisition of the 
sciences and arts of all countries, kindly dealing with all the 
nations of the earth, desire for the welfare of all peoples, 
sociability, concord, obedience, submissiveness, instruction 
of [their] children, production of what is needful for the 
human race, and inauguration of true happiness for mankind; 
and He continually kept sending tracts of admonition to all 
parts, whereby a wonderful effect was produced.  Some of 
these epistles have, after extreme search and inquiry, been 
examined, and some portions of them shall now be set down 
in writing.  
     All these epistles consisted of [exhortations to] purity of 
 
+P42 
morals, encouragement to good conduct, reprobation of certain 
individuals, and complaints of the seditious.  Amongst 
others this sentence was recorded:  
     "My captivity is not My abasement:  by My life, it is indeed a 
glory unto Me!  But the abasement is the action of My friends 
who connect themselves with Us and follow the devil in their 
actions.  Amongst them is he who taketh lust and turneth aside 
from what is commanded; and amongst them is he who 
followeth the truth in right guidance.  As for those who commit 
sin and cling to the world they are assuredly not of the 
people of &amp;Baha."  
     So again:  
     "Well it is with him who is adorned with the decoration of 
manners and morals:  verily he is of those who help their Lord 
with clear perspicuous action."  
     "He is God, exalted is His state, wisdom and utterance.  The 
True One (glorious is His glory) for the showing forth of the 
gems of ideals from the mine of man, hath, in every age, sent a 
Trusted One.  The primary foundation of the faith of God and 
the religion of God is this, that they should not make diverse 
sects and various paths the cause and reason of hatred.  These 
principles and laws and firm sure roads appear from one 
dawning-place and shine from one dayspring, and these diversities 
were out of regard for the requirements of the time, 
season, ages, and epochs.  O unitarians, make firm the girdle 
of endeavor, that perchance religious strife and conflict may 
be removed from amongst the people of the world and be 
annulled.  For love of God and His servants engage in this great 
and mighty matter.  Religious hatred and rancor is a world-consuming 
fire, and the quenching thereof most arduous, 
unless the hand of Divine Might give men deliverance from 
this unfruitful calamity.  Consider a war which happeneth 
between two states:  both sides have foregone wealth and life:  
how many villages were beheld as though they were not!  This 
precept is in the position of the light in the lamp of utterance."  
 
+P43 
     "O people of the world, ye are all the fruit of one tree and 
the leaves of one branch.  Walk with perfect charity, concord, 
affection, and agreement.  I swear by the Sun of Truth, the 
light of agreement shall brighten and illumine the horizons.  
The all-knowing Truth hath been and is the witness to this 
saying.  Endeavor to attain to this high supreme station which 
is the station of protection and preservation of mankind.  This 
is the intent of the King of intentions, and this the hope of the 
Lord of hopes."  
     "We trust that God will assist the kings of the earth to 
illuminate and adorn the earth with the refulgent light of the 
Sun of Justice.  At one time We spoke in the language of the 
Law, at another time in the language of the Truth and the 
Way; and the ultimate object and remote aim was the showing 
forth of this high supreme station.  And God sufficeth for 
witness."  
     "O friends, consort with all the people of the world with joy 
and fragrance.  If there be to you a word or essence whereof 
others than you are devoid, communicate it and show it forth 
in the language of affection and kindness:  if it be received and 
be effective the object is attained, and if not leave it to him, 
and with regard to him deal not harshly but pray.  The language 
of kindness is the lodestone of hearts and the food of the 
soul; it stands in the relation of ideas to words, and is as an 
horizon for the shining of the Sun of Wisdom and Knowledge."  
     "If the unitarians had in the latter times acted according to 
the glorious Law [which came] after His Highness the Seal [of 
the Prophets] (may the life of all beside Him be His sacrifice!), 
and had clung to its skirt, the foundation of the fortress of 
religion would not have been shaken, and populous cities 
would not have been ruined, but rather cities and villages 
would have acquired and been adorned with the decoration of 
peace and serenity."  
     "Through the heedlessness and discordance of the favored 
 
+P44 
people and the smoke of wicked souls the Fair Nation is seen to 
be darkened and enfeebled.  Had they acted [according to what 
they knew] they would not have been heedless of the light of 
the Sun of Justice."  
     "This Victim hath from earliest days until now been 
afflicted at the hands of the heedless.  They exiled Us without 
cause at one time to &amp;Iraq, at another time to Adrianople, and 
thence to &amp;Akka, which was a place of exile for murderers and 
robbers; neither is it known where and in what spot We shall 
take up Our abode after this greatest prison-house.  Knowledge 
is with God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust and the 
Lord of the lofty seat.  In whatever place We may be, and 
whatever befall Us, the saints must gaze with perfect steadfastness 
and confidence towards the Supreme Horizon and occupy 
themselves in the reformation of the world and the 
education of the nations.  What hath befallen and shall befall 
hath been and is an instrument and means for the furtherance 
of the Word of Unity.  Take hold of the command of God and 
cling thereto:  verily it hath been sent down from beside a wise 
Ordainer."  
     "With perfect compassion and mercy have We guided and 
directed the people of the world to that whereby their souls 
shall be profited.  I swear by the Sun of Truth which hath 
shone forth from the highest horizons of the world that the 
people of &amp;Baha had not and have not any aim save the prosperity 
and reformation of the world and the purifying of the 
nations.  With all men they have been in sincerity and charity.  
Their outward [appearance] is one with their inward [heart], 
and their inward [heart] identical with their outward 
[appearance].  The truth of the matter is not hidden or concealed, 
but plain and evident before [men's] faces.  Their very 
deeds are the witness of this assertion.  Today let everyone 
endowed with vision win his way from deeds and signs to the 
object of the people of &amp;Baha and from their speech and 
conduct gain knowledge of their intent.  The waves of the 
 
+P45 
ocean of divine mercy appear at the utmost height, and the 
showers of the clouds of His grace and favor descend every 
moment.  During the days of sojourn in &amp;Iraq this Oppressed 
One sat down and consorted with all classes without veil or 
disguise.  How many of the denizens of the horizons entered in 
enmity and went forth in sympathy!  The door of grace was 
open before the faces of all.  With rebellious and obedient did 
We outwardly converse after one fashion, that perchance the 
evildoers might win their way to the ocean of boundless 
forgiveness.  The splendors of the Name of the Concealer were 
in such wise manifested that the evildoer imagined that he was 
accounted of the good.  No messenger was disappointed and 
no inquirer was turned back.  The causes of the aversion and 
avoidance of men were certain of the doctors of Persia and the 
unseemly deeds of the ignorant.  By [the term] `doctors' in 
these passages are signified those persons who have withheld 
mankind from the shore of the Ocean of Unity; but as for the 
learned who practice [their knowledge] and the wise who act 
justly, they are as the spirit unto the body of the world.  Well is 
it with that learned man whose head is adorned with the crown 
of justice, and whose body glorieth in the ornament of honesty.  
The Pen of Admonition exhorteth the friends and enjoineth 
on them charity, pity, wisdom, and gentleness.  The 
Oppressed One is this day a prisoner; His allies are the hosts of 
good deeds and virtues; not ranks, and hosts, and guns, and 
cannons.+F21  One holy action maketh the world of earth highest 
paradise.  
     "O friends, help the Oppressed One with well-pleasing 
virtues and good deeds!  Today let every soul desire to attain the 
highest station.  He must not regard what is in him, but what is 
in God.  It is not for him to regard what shall advantage 
himself, but that whereby the Word of God which must be 
 
+F21 Throughout His Writings the "Oppressed One" refers to &amp;Baha'u'llah 
+F21 Himself.  
 
+P46 
obeyed shall be upraised.  The heart must be sanctified from 
every form of selfishness and lust, for the weapons of the 
unitarians and the saints were and are the fear of God.  That is 
the buckler which guardeth man from the arrows of hatred and 
abomination.  Unceasingly hath the standard of piety been 
victorious, and accounted amongst the most puissant hosts of 
the world.  Thereby do the saints subdue the cities of [men's] 
hearts by the permission of God, the Lord of hosts.  Darkness 
hath encompassed the earth:  the lamp which giveth light was 
and is wisdom.  The dictates thereof must be observed under 
all circumstances.  And of wisdom is the regard of place and 
the utterance of discourse according to measure and state.  And 
of wisdom is decision; for man should not accept whatsoever 
anyone sayeth.  
     "Under all circumstances desire of the True One (glorious 
is His glory) that He will not deprive His servants of the sealed 
wine+F22 and the lights of the Name of the Self-Subsistent.  
     "O friends of God, verily the Pen of Sincerity enjoineth on 
you the greatest faithfulness.  By the Life of God, its light is 
more evident than the light of the sun!  In its light and its 
brightness and its radiance every light is eclipsed.  We desire of 
God that He will not withhold from His cities and lands the 
radiant effulgence of the Sun of Faithfulness.  We have directed 
all in the nights and in the days to faithfulness, chastity, 
purity, and constancy; and have enjoined good deeds and 
well-pleasing qualities.  In the nights and in the days the shriek 
of the pen ariseth and the tongue speaketh, that against the 
sword the word may arise, and against fierceness patience, and 
in place of oppression submission, and at the time of martyrdom 
resignation.  For thirty years and more, in all that hath 
befallen this oppressed community they have been patient, 
referring it to God.  Everyone endowed with justice and fairness 
hath testified and doth testify to that which hath been 
 
+F22 The ordinances of God.  
 
+P47 
said.  During this period this Oppressed One was engaged in 
good exhortations and efficacious and sufficient admonitions, 
till it became established and obvious before all that this 
Victim had made Himself a target for the arrows of calamity 
unto the showing forth of the treasures deposited in [men's] 
souls.  Strife and contest were and are seemly in the beasts of 
prey of the earth, [but] laudable actions are seemly in man.  
     "Blessed is the Merciful One:  Who created man:  and taught 
him utterance.+F23  After all these troubles, neither are the 
ministers of state content, nor the doctors of the church.  Not 
one soul was found to utter a word for God before the court of 
His Majesty the King (may God perpetuate his kingdom).  
There shall not befall Us aught save that which God hath 
decreed unto Us.  They acted not kindly, nor was there any 
shortcoming in the display of evil.  Justice became like the 
phoenix, and faithfulness like the philosopher's stone:  none 
spake for the right.  It would seem that justice had become 
hateful to men and cast forth from all lands like the people of 
God.  Glory be to God!  In the episode of the land of &amp;Ta not one 
spoke for that which God had commanded.  Having regard to 
the display of power and parade of service in the presence of 
the King (may God perpetuate his kingdom) they have called 
good evil and the reformer a sedition-monger.  The like of 
these persons would depict the drop as an ocean, and the mote 
as a sun.  They call the house at Kulayn `the strong fortress,' 
and close their eyes to the perspicuous truth.  They have 
attacked a number of reformers of the world with the charge of 
seditiousness.  As God liveth, these persons had and have no 
intent nor hope save the glory of the state and service to their 
nation!  For God they spoke and for God they speak, and in the 
way of God do they journey.  
     "O friends, ask of Him Who is the Desire of the denizens of 
earth that He will succor His Majesty the King (may God 
 
+F23 &amp;Qur'an 55:3-4.  
 
+P48 
perpetuate his kingdom) so that all the dominions of Persia 
may by the light of the Sun of Justice become adorned with the 
decoration of tranquility and security.  According to statements 
made, he, at the promptings of his blessed nature, 
loosed those who were in bonds, and bestowed freedom on the 
captives.  The representation of certain matters before the faces 
of [God's] servants is obligatory, and natural to the pious, so 
that the good may be aware and become cognizant [thereof].  
Verily He inspireth whom He pleaseth with what He desireth, 
and He is the Powerful, the Ordainer, the Knowing, the Wise.  
     "A word from that land hath reached the Oppressed One 
which in truth was the cause of wonder.  His Highness the 
&amp;Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih, &amp;Farhad &amp;Mirza, said concerning the 
Imprisoned One that whereof the repetition is not pleasing.  
This Victim consorted very little with him or the like of him.  
So far as is recollected on [only] two occasions did he visit 
&amp;Murgh-Mahallih in &amp;Shimiran where was the abode of the 
Oppressed One.  On the first occasion he came one day in the 
afternoon, and on the second one Friday morning, returning 
nigh unto sundown.  He knows and is conscious that he should 
not speak contrary to the truth.  If one enter his presence let 
him repeat these words before him on behalf of the Oppressed 
One:  `O Prince!  I ask justice and fairness from your Highness 
concerning that which hath befallen this poor Victim.'  Well is 
it for that soul whom the doubts of the perverse withhold not 
from the display of justice, and deprive not of the lights of the 
luminary of equity.  O saints of God! at the end of Our 
discourse We enjoin on you once again chastity, faithfulness, 
godliness, sincerity, and purity.  Lay aside the evil and adopt 
the good.  This is that whereunto ye are commanded in the 
Book of God, the Knowing, the Wise.  Well is it with those 
who practice [this injunction].  At this moment the pen crieth 
out, saying, `O saints of God, regard the horizon of uprightness, 
and be quit, severed, and free from what is beside this.  
There is no strength and no power save in God.'"  
 
+P49 
     In short, formerly in all provinces in Persia accounts and 
stories concerning this sect diverse and discordant, yea, incompatible 
with the character of the human race and opposed 
to the divine endowment, passed on the tongues and in the 
mouths of men and obtained notoriety.  But when their principles 
acquired fixity and stability and their conduct and 
behavior were known and appreciated, the veil of doubt and 
suspicion fell, the true character of this sect became clear and 
evident, and it reached the degree of certainty that their 
principles were unlike men's fancies, and that their foundation 
differed from [the popular] opinion and estimate.  In their 
conduct, action, morality, and demeanor was no place for 
objection; the objection in Persia is to certain of the ideas and 
tenets of this sect.  And from the indications of various circumstances 
it hath been observed that the people have acquired 
belief and confidence in the trustworthiness, faithfulness, and 
godliness of this sect in all transactions.  
     Let us return to our original topic.  During the period of 
their sojourn in &amp;Iraq these persons became notorious 
throughout the world.  For exile resulted in fame, in such wise 
that a great number of other parties sought alliance and union, 
and devised means of [acquiring] intimacy [with them].  But 
the Chief of this sect, discovering the aims of each faction, 
acted with the utmost consistency, circumspection, and 
firmness.  Reposing confidence in none, He applied Himself 
as far as possible to the admonition of each, inciting and 
urging them to good resolutions and aims beneficial to the 
state and the nation.  And this conduct and behavior of the 
Chief acquired notoriety in &amp;Iraq.  
     So likewise during the period of their sojourn in &amp;Iraq 
certain functionaries of foreign governments were desirous of 
intimacy, and sought friendly relations [with them], but the 
Chief would not agree.  Amongst other strange haps was this, 
that in &amp;Iraq certain of the Royal Family came to an understanding 
with these [foreign] governments, and, [induced] by 
 
+P50 
promises and threats, conspired with them.  But this sect 
unloosed their tongues in reproach and began to admonish 
them, saying, "What meanness is this, and what evident 
treason; that man should, for worldly advantages, personal 
profit, easy circumstances, or protection of life and property, 
cast himself into this great detriment and evident loss, and 
embark in a course of action which will conduce to the greatest 
abasement and involve the utmost infamy and disgrace both 
here and hereafter!  One can support any baseness save treason 
to one's country, and every sin admits of pardon and forgiveness 
save [that of] dishonoring one's government and injuring 
one's nation."  And they imagined that they were acting patriotically, 
displaying sincerity and loyalty, and accounting 
sacred the duties of fidelity; which noble aim they regarded as a 
moral obligation.  So rumors of this were spread abroad 
through &amp;Iraq-i-'Arab, and such as wished well to their country 
loosed their tongues in uttering thanks, expressing approval 
and respect.  And it was supposed that these events would be 
represented in the Royal Presence; but after a while it became 
known that certain of the &amp;Shaykhs at the Supreme Shrines 
who were in correspondence with the court, yea, even with 
the King, were in secret continually attributing to this sect 
strange affinities and relations, imagining that such attempts 
would conduce to favor at the Court and cause advancement of 
[their] condition and rank.  And since no one could speak 
freely on this matter at that court which is the pivot of justice, 
whilst just ministers aware [of the true state of the case] also 
regarded silence as their best policy, the &amp;Iraq question, 
through these misrepresentations and rumors, assumed gravity 
in &amp;Tihran, and was enormously exaggerated.  But the 
consuls-general, being cognizant of the truth, continued to 
act with moderation, until &amp;Mirza Buzurg &amp;Khan of &amp;Qazvin 
became consul-general in &amp;Baghdad.  Now since this person 
was wont to pass the greater portion of his time in a state of 
intoxication and was devoid of foresight, he became the accomplice 
 
+P51 
and confederate of those &amp;Shaykhs in &amp;Iraq, and 
girded up his loins stoutly to destroy and demolish.  Such 
power of description and [strength] of fingers as he possessed 
he employed in making representations and statements.  Each 
day he secretly wrote a dispatch to &amp;Tihran, made vows and 
compacts with the &amp;Shaykhs, and sent diplomatic notes to His 
Excellency the Ambassador-in-chief [at Constantinople].  But 
since these statements and depositions had no basis or foundation, 
they were all postponed and adjourned; until at length 
these &amp;Shaykhs convened a meeting to consult with the 
[Consul-] General, assembled a number of learned doctors 
and great divines in the [mosque of the] `two &amp;Kazims' (upon 
them be peace), and, having come to an unanimous agreement, 
wrote to the divines of &amp;Karbila the exalted and Najaf the 
most noble, convoking them all.  They came, some knowing, 
others not knowing.  Amongst the latter the illustrious and 
expert doctor, the noble and celebrated scholar, the seal of 
seekers after truth, &amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtada, now departed and assoiled, 
who was the admitted chief of all, arrived without 
knowledge [of the matter in hand].  But, so soon as he was 
informed of their actual designs, he said, "I am not properly 
acquainted with the essential character of this sect, nor with 
the secret tenets and hidden theological doctrines of this 
community; neither have I hitherto witnessed or perceived in 
their demeanor or conduct anything at variance with the 
Perspicuous Book which would lead me to pronounce them 
infidels.  Therefore hold me excused in this matter, and let 
him who regards it as his duty take action."  Now the design of 
the &amp;Shaykhs and the Consul was a sudden and general attack, 
but, by reason of the noncompliance of the departed &amp;Shaykh, 
this scheme proved abortive, resulting, indeed, only in shame 
and disappointment.  So that concourse of &amp;Shaykhs, doctors, 
and common folk which had come from &amp;Karbila dispersed.  
     Just at this time mischievous persons--[including] even 
certain dismissed ministers--endeavored on all sides so to 
 
+P52 
influence this sect that they might perchance alter their course 
and conduct.  From every quarter lying messages and disquieting 
reports continually followed one another in uninterrupted 
and constant succession to the effect that the deliberate intention 
of the court of Persia was the eradication, suppression, 
annihilation, and destruction of this sect; that correspondence 
was continually being carried on with the local authorities; 
and that all [the &amp;Babis] in &amp;Iraq would shortly be delivered over 
with bound hands to Persia.  But the &amp;Babis passed the time in 
calmness and silence, without in any way altering their behavior 
and conduct.  
     So when &amp;Mirza Buzurg &amp;Khan failed to effect and accomplish 
the designs of his heart by such actions also, he ill-advisedly 
fell to reflecting how he might grieve and humiliate 
[the &amp;Babis].  Every day he sought some pretext for offering 
insult, aroused some disturbance and tumult, and raised up 
the banner of mischief, until the matter came nigh to culminating 
in the sudden outbreak of a riot, the lapse of the reins 
of control from the hand, and the precipitation of [men's] 
hearts into disquietude and perturbation and [their] minds 
into anguish and agony.  
     Now when [the &amp;Babis] found themselves unable to treat this 
humor by any means (for, strive as they would, they were 
foiled and frustrated), and when they failed to find any remedy 
for this disorder or any fairness in this flower, they deliberated 
and hesitated for nine months, and at length a certain number 
of them, to stop further mischief, enrolled themselves as 
subjects of the Sublime Ottoman Government, that [thereby] 
they might assuage this tumult.  By means of this device the 
mischief was allayed, and the consul withdrew his hand from 
molesting them; but he notified this occurrence to the Royal 
Court in a manner at variance with the facts and contrary to 
the truth, and, together with the confederate &amp;Shaykhs, applied 
himself in every way to devices for distracting the senses [of the 
 
+P53 
&amp;Babis].  Finally, however, being dismissed, and overwhelmed 
with disaster, he became penitent and sorry.  
     Let us proceed with our original topic.  For eleven years and 
somewhat over, &amp;Baha'u'llah abode in &amp;Iraq-i-'Arab.  The behavior 
and conduct of the sect were such that [His] fame and 
renown increased.  For He was manifest and apparent amongst 
men, consorted and associated with all parties, and would 
converse familiarly with doctors and scholars concerning the 
solution of difficult theological questions and the verification 
of the true sense of abstruse points of divinity.  As is currently 
reported by persons of every class, He used to please all, 
whether inhabitants or visitors, by His kindly intercourse and 
courteous address; and this sort of demeanor and conduct on 
His part led them to suspect sorcery and account Him an adept 
in the occult sciences.  
     During this period &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya remained concealed and 
hidden, continuing and abiding in his former conduct and 
behavior, until, when the edict for the removal of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
from &amp;Baghdad was issued by His Majesty the Ottoman 
monarch, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya would neither quit nor accompany 
[Him]:  at one time he meditated setting out for India, at 
another settling in &amp;Turkistan; but, being unable to decide on 
either of these two plans, he finally, at his own wish, set out 
before all in the garb of a dervish, in disguise and change of 
raiment, for &amp;Karkuk and &amp;Arbil.  Thence, by continuous advance, 
he reached Mosul, where, on the arrival of the main 
body, he took up his abode and station alongside their caravan.  
And although throughout this journey the governors and 
officials observed the utmost consideration and respectfulness, 
while march and halt were alike dignified and honorable, 
nevertheless was he always concealed in change of raiment, 
and acted cautiously, on the idea that some act of aggression 
was likely to occur.  
     In this fashion did they reach Constantinople, where they 
 
+P54 
were appointed quarters in a guesthouse on the part of the 
glorious Ottoman monarchy.  And at first the utmost attention 
was paid to them in every way.  On the third day, because of 
the straitness of their quarters and the greatness of their numbers, 
they migrated and moved to another house.  Certain of 
the nobles came to see and converse with them, and these, as 
is related, behaved with moderation.  Notwithstanding that 
many in their assemblies and gatherings continued to condemn 
and vilify them saying, "This sect are a mischief to all 
the world and destructive of treaties and covenants; they are a 
source of trouble and baleful to all lands; they have kindled a 
fire and consumed the earth; and though they be outwardly 
fair-seeming yet are they deserving of every chastisement and 
punishment," yet still the &amp;Babis continued to conduct themselves 
with patience, calmness, deliberation, and constancy, 
so that they did not, even in self-defense, importune [the 
occupants of] high places or frequent the houses of any of the 
magnates of that kingdom.  Whomsoever amongst the great 
He [&amp;Baha] interviewed on His own account, they met, and no 
word save of sciences and arts passed between them; until 
certain noblemen sought to guide Him, and loosed their 
tongues in friendly counsel, saying, "To appeal, to state your 
case, and to demand justice is a measure demanded by custom."  
He replied in answer, "Pursuing the path of obedience 
to the King's command We have come to this country.  
Beyond this We neither had nor have any aim or desire that 
We should appeal and cause trouble.  What is [now] hidden 
behind the veil of destiny will in the future become manifest.  
There neither has been nor is any necessity for supplication 
and importunity.  If the enlightened-minded leaders [of your 
nation] be wise and diligent, they will certainly make inquiry, 
and acquaint themselves with the true state of the case; if not, 
then [their] attainment of the truth is impracticable and impossible.  
Under these circumstances what need is there for 
importuning statesmen and supplicating ministers of the 
 
+P55 
Court?  We are free from every anxiety, and ready and prepared 
for the things predestined to Us.  `Say, all is from God'+F24 
is a sound and sufficient argument, and `if God toucheth thee 
with a hurt there is no dispeller thereof save Him'+F25 is a healing 
medicine."  
     After some months a royal edict was promulgated appointing 
Adrianople in the district of Roumelia as their place of 
abode and residence.  To that city the &amp;Babis, accompanied by 
[Turkish] officers, proceeded all together, and there they made 
their home and habitation.  According to statements heard 
from sundry travelers and from certain great and learned men 
of that city, they behaved and conducted themselves there also 
in such wise that the inhabitants of the district and the government 
officials used to eulogize them, and all used to show 
them respect and deference.  In short, since &amp;Baha'u'llah was 
wont to hold intercourse with the doctors, scholars, magnates, 
and nobles [thereby] obtaining fame and celebrity throughout 
Roumelia, the materials of comfort were gathered together, 
neither fear nor dread remained, they reposed on the couch of 
ease, and passed their time in quietude, when one Siyyid 
&amp;Muhammad by name, of &amp;Isfahan, one of the followers [of the 
&amp;Bab], laid the foundations of intimacy and familiarity with 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, and [thereby] became the cause of vexation and 
trouble.  In other words, he commenced a secret intrigue and 
fell to tempting &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, saying, "The fame of this sect 
hath risen high in the world, and their name hath become 
noble:  neither dread nor danger remaineth, nor is there any 
fear or [need for] caution before you.  Cease, then, to follow, 
that thou mayest be followed by the world; and come out from 
amongst adherents, that thou mayest become celebrated 
throughout the horizons."  &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya, too, through lack of 
reflection and thought as to consequences, and want of experience, 
 
+F24 &amp;Qur'an 4:80.  
+F25 &amp;Qur'an 6:17; 10:107.  
 
+P56 
became enamored of his words and befooled by his 
conduct.  This one was [like] the sucking child, and that one 
became as the much-prized breast.  At all events, how much 
soever some of the chiefs of the sect wrote admonitions and 
pointed out to him the path of discretion saying, "For many a 
year hast thou been nurtured in thy brother's arms and hast 
reposed on the pillow of ease and gladness; what thoughts are 
these which are the results of madness?  Be not beguiled by this 
empty name,+F26 which, out of regard for certain considerations 
and as a matter of expediency, was bestowed [upon thee]; 
neither seek to be censured by the community.  Thy rank and 
worth depend on a word, and thine exaltation and elevation 
were for a protection and a consideration," yet still, the more 
they admonished him, the less did it affect him; and how 
much soever they would direct him, he continued to account 
opposition as identical with advantage.  Afterwards, too, the 
fire of greed and avarice was kindled, and although there was 
no sort of need, their circumstances being easy in the extreme, 
they fell to thinking of salary and stipend, and certain of the 
women dependent on &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya went to the [governor's] 
palace and craved assistance and charity.  So when &amp;Baha'u'llah 
beheld such conduct and behavior on his part He dismissed 
and drove away both [him and Siyyid &amp;Muhammad] from 
Himself.  
     Then Siyyid &amp;Muhammad set out for Constantinople to get 
his stipend, and opened the door of suffering.  According to the 
account given, this matter caused the greatest sorrow and 
brought about cessation of intercourse.  In Constantinople, 
moreover, he presumptuously set afloat certain reports, asserting, 
 
+F26 &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya's title was &amp;Subh-i-Azal, the Morning of Eternity.  
+F26 &amp;Baha'u'llah, in this connection, cites Amos 4:12-13, which says that God 
+F26 "maketh the morning darkness."  Cf.  &amp;Baha'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of 
+F26 the Wolf (Wilmette, Ill.:  &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1953), p. 146.  See 
+F26 Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By (Wilmette, Ill.:  &amp;Baha'i Publishing 
+F26 Trust, 1974), p.114, for other titles of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya.  
 
+P57 
amongst other things, that the notable personage who had 
come from &amp;Iraq was &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya.  Sundry individuals, perceiving 
that herein was excellent material for mischief-making 
and a means for the promotion of mutiny, ostensibly supported 
and applauded him, and stimulated and incited him, 
saying, "You are really the chief support and acknowledged 
successor:  act with authority, in order that grace and blessing 
may become apparent.  The waveless sea hath no sound, and 
the cloud without thunder raineth no rain."  By such speech, 
then, was that unfortunate man entrapped into his course of 
action, and led to utter vain words which caused the disturbance 
of [men's] thoughts.  Little by little those who were wont 
to incite and encourage began without exception to utter 
violent denunciations in every nook and corner, nay in the 
court itself, saying, "The &amp;Babis say thus, and expound in this 
wise:  [their] behavior is such, and [their] speech so-and-so."  
Such mischief-making and plots caused matters to become 
misapprehended, and furthermore certain schemes got afloat 
which were regarded as necessary measures of self-protection; 
the expediency of banishing the &amp;Babis came under consideration; 
and all of a sudden an order came, and &amp;Baha'u'llah was 
removed from Roumelia; nor was it known for what purpose or 
whither they would bear Him away.  Diverse accounts were 
current in [men's] mouths, and many exaggerations were 
heard [to the effect] that there was no hope of deliverance.  
     Now all those persons who were with Him with one accord 
entreated and insisted that they should [be permitted to] accompany 
Him, and, how much soever the government admonished 
and forbade them, it was fruitless.  Finally one &amp;Haji 
&amp;Ja'far by name was moved to lamentation, and with his own 
hand cut his throat.  When the government beheld it thus, it 
gave permission to all of them to accompany Him, conveyed 
them from Adrianople to the seashore, and thence transported 
them to &amp;Akka.  &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya they sent in like manner to 
Famagusta.  
 
+P58 
     During the latter days [passed] in Adrianople &amp;Baha'u'llah 
composed a detailed epistle setting forth all matters clearly and 
minutely.  He unfolded and expounded the main principles of 
the sect, and made clear and plain its ethics, manners, course, 
and mode of conduct:  He treated certain political questions in 
detail, and adduced sundry proofs of His truthfulness:  He 
declared the good intent, loyalty, and sincerity of the sect, and 
wrote some fragments of prayers, some in Persian, but the 
greater part in Arabic.  He then placed it in a packet and 
adorned its address with the royal name of His Majesty the 
King of Persia, and wrote [on it] that some person pure of heart 
and pure of life, dedicated to God, and prepared for martyr-sacrifice, 
must, with perfect resignation and willingness, convey 
this epistle into the presence of the King.  A youth named 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Badi, a native of &amp;Khurasan, took the epistle, and 
hastened toward the presence of His Majesty the King.  The 
Royal Train had its abode and station outside &amp;Tihran, so he 
took his stand alone on a rock in a place far off but opposite to 
the Royal Pavilion, and awaited day and night the passing of 
the Royal escort or the attainment of admission into the 
Imperial Presence.  Three days did he pass in a state of fasting 
and vigilance:  an emaciated body and enfeebled spirit remained.  
On the fourth day the Royal Personage was examining 
all quarters and directions with a telescope when suddenly 
his glance fell on this man who was seated in the utmost 
respectful attitude on a rock.  It was inferred from the indications 
[perceived] that he must certainly have thanks [to offer], 
or some complaint or demand for redress and justice [to 
prefer].  [The King] commanded one of those in attendance at 
the court to inquire into the circumstances of this youth.  On 
interrogation [it was found that] he carried a letter which he 
desired to convey with his own hand into the Royal Presence.  
On receiving permission to approach, he cried out before the 
pavilion with a dignity, composure, and respectfulness surpassing 
description, and in a loud voice, "O King, I have come 
 
+P59 
unto thee from Sheba with a weighty message!"+F27  [The King] 
commanded to take the letter and arrest the bearer.  His Majesty 
the King wished to act with deliberation and desired to 
discover the truth, but those who were present before him 
loosed their tongues in violent reprehension, saying, "This 
person has shown great presumption and amazing audacity, 
for he hath without fear or dread brought the letter of him 
against whom all peoples are angered, of him who is banished 
to Bulgaria and Sclavonia, into the presence of the King.  If so 
be that he do not instantly suffer a grievous punishment there 
will be an increase of this great presumption."  So the ministers 
of the court signified [that he should suffer] punishment and 
ordered the torture.  As the first torment they applied the chain 
and rack, saying, "Make known thy other friends that thou 
mayest be delivered from excruciating punishment, and make 
thy comrades captive that thou mayest escape from the torment 
of the chain and the keenness of the sword."  But, 
torture, brand, and torment him as they might, they saw 
naught but steadfastness and silence, and found naught but 
dumb endurance [on his part].  So, when the torture gave no 
result, they [first] photographed him (the executioners on his 
left and on his right, and he sitting bound in fetters and chains 
beneath the sword with perfect meekness and composure), 
and then slew and destroyed him.  This photograph I sent for, 
and found worthy of contemplation, for he was seated with 
wonderful humility and strange submissiveness, in utmost 
resignation.  
     Now when His Majesty the King had perused certain passages 
and become cognizant of the contents of the epistle, he 
was much affected at what had taken place and manifested 
regret, because his courtiers had acted hastily and put into 
execution a severe punishment.  It is even related that he said 
thrice, "Doth anyone punish [one who is but] the channel of 
 
+F27 Cf. &amp;Qur'an 27:22.  
 
+P60 
correspondence?"  Then the Royal Command was issued that 
their Reverences the learned doctors and honorable and accomplished 
divines should write a reply to that epistle.  But 
when the most expert doctors of the capital became aware of 
the contents of the letter they ordained:  "That this person, 
without regarding [the fact] that he is at variance with the 
Perspicuous Religion, is a meddler with custom and creed, 
and a troubler of kings and emperors.  Therefore to eradicate, 
subdue, repress, and repel [this sect] is one of the requirements 
of the Well-established Path, and indeed the chief of obligations."  
     This answer was not approved before the [Royal] Presence, 
for the contents of this epistle had no obvious discordance with 
the Law or with reason, and did not meddle with political or 
administrative matters, nor interfere with or attack the Throne 
of Sovereignty.  They ought, therefore, to have discussed the 
real points at issue, and to have written clearly and explicitly 
such an answer as would have caused the disappearance of 
doubts and the solution of difficulties, and would have become 
a fulcrum for discussion to all.  
     Now of this epistle sundry passages shall be set forth in 
writing to conduce to a better understanding [of the matter] by 
all people.  At the beginning of the epistle was a striking passage 
in the Arabic language [treating] of questions of faith and 
assurance; the sacrifice of life in the way of the Beloved; the 
state of resignation and contentment; the multiplicity of misfortunes, 
calamities, hardships, and afflictions; and falling 
under suspicion of seditiousness through the machinations of 
foes; the establishment of His innocence in the presence of His 
Majesty the King; the repudiation of seditious persons and 
disavowal of the rebellious party; the conditions of sincere 
belief in the verses of the &amp;Qur'an; the needfulness of godly 
virtues, distinction from all other creatures in this transitory 
abode, obedience to the commandments, and avoidance of 
things prohibited; the evidence of divine support in the affair 
 
+P61 
of the &amp;Bab; the inability of whosoever is upon the earth to 
withstand a heavenly thing; His own awakening at the divine 
afflux, and His falling thereby into unbounded calamities; His 
acquisition of the divine gift, His participation in spiritual 
God-given grace, and His illumination with immediate knowledge 
without study; the excusableness of His [efforts for the] 
admonition of mankind, their direction toward the attainment 
of human perfections, and their enkindlement with the fire of 
divine love; encouragements to the directing of energy towards 
the attainment of a state greater than the degree of earthly 
sovereignty; eloquent prayers [written] in the utmost self-abasement, 
devotion, and humility; and the like of this.  Afterwards 
He discussed [other] matters in the Persian language.  
And the form of it is this:  
     "O God, this is a letter which I wish to send to the King; and 
Thou knowest that I have not desired aught of him save the 
display of his justice to Thy people, and the showing forth of 
his favors to the dwellers in Thy Kingdom.  And verily, by My 
soul, I have not desired aught save what Thou hast desired, 
neither, by Thy Might, do I desire aught save what Thou 
desirest.  Perish that being which desireth of Thee aught save 
Thyself!  And, by Thy Glory, Thy good pleasure is the limit of 
My hope, and Thy Will the extremity of My desire!  Be 
merciful then, O God, to this poor [soul] Who hath caught 
hold of the skirt of Thy richness, and to this humble [suppliant] 
Who calleth on Thee, for Thou art indeed the Mighty, 
the Great.  Help, O God, His Majesty the King to execute Thy 
laws amongst Thy servants and to show forth Thy justice 
amidst Thy creatures, that he may rule over this sect as he 
ruleth over those who are beside them.  Verily Thou art the 
Potent, the Mighty, the Wise.  
     "Agreeably to the permission and consent of the King of the 
age, this Servant turned from the place of the Royal Throne+F28 
 
+F28 &amp;Tihran.  
 
+P62 
toward &amp;Iraq-i-'Arab, and in that land abode twelve years.  
During the period of [His] sojourn [there] no description of His 
condition was laid before the Royal Presence, neither did any 
representation go to foreign states.  Relying upon God did He 
abide in that land, until a certain functionary came to &amp;Iraq, 
who, on his arrival, fell to designing the affliction of a company 
of poor unfortunates.  Every day, beguiled by certain of 
the doctors of Persia, he persecuted these servants; although 
nothing prejudicial to Church or State, or at variance with the 
principles and customs of their countrymen had been observed 
in them.  So this Servant [was moved] by this reflection:  
`May it not be that by reason of the deeds of the transgressors 
some action at variance with the world-ordering counsel of the 
King should be engendered!'  Therefore was an epitome [of the 
matter] addressed to &amp;Mirza &amp;Sa'id &amp;Khan, the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, that he might submit it to the [Royal] Presence, 
and that it might be done according to that which the 
Royal command might promulgate.  A long while elapsed, 
and no command was issued; until matters reached such a 
state that it was to be feared that sedition might suddenly break 
out and the blood of many be shed.  Of necessity, for the 
protection of the servants of God, a certain number [of the 
&amp;Babis] appealed to the governor of &amp;Iraq.  If [the King] will 
consider what has happened with just regard, it will become 
clear in the mirror of his luminous heart that what occurred 
was [done] from considerations of expediency, and that there 
was apparently no resource save this.  The Royal Personage 
can bear witness and testify to this, that in whatever land there 
were some few of this sect the fire of war and conflict was wont 
to be kindled by reason of the aggression of certain governors.  
But this Transient One after His arrival in &amp;Iraq withheld all 
from sedition and strife; and the witness of this Servant is His 
action, for all are aware and will testify that the multitude of 
this faction in Persia at that time was more than [it had been] 
before, yet, notwithstanding this, none transgressed his proper 
 
+P63 
bounds nor assailed anyone.  It is nigh on fifteen years that all 
continue tranquil, looking unto God and relying on Him, and 
bear patiently what hath come upon them, casting it on God.  
And after the arrival of this Servant in this city which is called 
Adrianople certain of this community enquired concerning 
the meaning of `victory.'  Diverse answers were sent in reply, 
one of which answers will be submitted on this page, so that it 
may become clear before the [Royal] Presence that this Servant 
hath in view naught save peace and reform.  And if some 
of the divine favors, which, without merit [on My part], have 
been graciously bestowed [on Me], do not become evident and 
apparent, this much [at least] will be known, that [God], in 
[His] abounding grace and undeserved mercy, hath not deprived 
this Oppressed One of the ornament of reason.  The form 
of words which was set forth on the meaning of `victory' is this:  
          "`He is God, exalted is He.  
     "`It hath been known that God (glorious is His mention) is 
sanctified from the world and what is therein, and that the 
meaning of "victory" is not this, that anyone should fight or 
strive with anyone.  The Lord of He doeth what He will+F29 hath 
committed the kingdom of creation, both land and sea, into 
the hand of kings, and they are the manifestations of the 
Divine Power according to the degrees of their rank:  verily He 
is the Potent, the Sovereign.  But that which God (glorious is 
His mention) hath desired for Himself is the hearts of His 
servants, which are treasures of praise and love of the Lord and 
stores of divine knowledge and wisdom.  The will of the Eternal 
King hath ever been to purify the hearts of [His] servants 
from the promptings of the world and what is therein, so that 
they may be prepared for illumination by the effulgences of 
the Lord of the Names and Attributes.  Therefore must no 
 
+F29 &amp;Qur'an 3:35; 22:19.  
 
+P64 
stranger find his way into the city of the heart, so that the 
Incomparable Friend may come unto His own place--that is, 
the effulgence of His Names and Attributes, not His Essence 
(exalted is He), for that Peerless King hath been and will be 
holy for everlasting above ascent or descent.  Therefore today 
"victory" neither hath been nor will be opposition to anyone, 
nor strife with any person; but rather what is well-pleasing is 
that the cities of [men's] hearts, which are under the dominion 
of the hosts of selfishness and lust, should be subdued by the 
sword of the Word, of Wisdom, and of Exhortation.  
Everyone, then, who desireth "victory" must first subdue the 
city of his own heart with the sword of spiritual truth and of the 
Word, and must protect it from remembering aught beside 
God:  afterwards let him turn his regards towards the cities of 
[others'] hearts.  This is what is intended by "victory":  sedition 
hath never been nor is pleasing to God, and that which certain 
ignorant persons formerly wrought was never approved.  If ye 
be slain for His good pleasure verily it is better for you than that 
ye should slay.  Today the friends of God must appear in such 
fashion amidst [God's] servants that by their actions they may 
lead all unto the pleasure of the Lord of Glory.  I swear by the 
Sun of the Horizon of Holiness that the friends of God never 
have regarded nor will regard the earth or its transitory riches.  
God hath ever regarded the hearts of [His] servants, and this 
too is by reason of [His] most great favor, that perchance 
mortal souls may be cleansed and sanctified from earthly states 
and may attain unto everlasting places.  But that Real King is in 
Himself sufficient unto Himself [and independent] of all:  
neither doth any advantage accrue to Him from the love of 
contingent beings, nor doth any hurt befall Him from their 
hatred.  All earthly places appear through Him and unto Him 
return, and God singly and alone abideth in His own place 
which is holy above space and time, mention and utterance, 
sign, description, and definition, height and depth.  And none 
knoweth this save Him and whosoever hath knowledge of the 
 
+P65 
Book.  There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bountiful.'  
Finis.  
     "But good deeds depend on this, that the Royal Person 
should himself look into that [matter] with just and gracious 
regard, and not be satisfied with the representations of certain 
persons unsupported by proof or evidence.  We ask God to 
strengthen the King unto that which He willeth:  and what He 
willeth should be the wish of the worlds.  
     "Afterwards they summoned this Servant to Constantinople.  
We reached that city along with a number of poor unfortunates, 
and after Our arrival did not hold intercourse with a 
single soul, for We had naught to say [unto them], and there 
was no wish save that it should be clearly demonstrated by 
proof to all that this Servant had no thought of sedition and 
had never associated with the seditious.  And, by Him in praise 
of Whose spirit the tongues of all things speak, to turn in any 
direction was difficult in consideration of certain circumstances; 
but these things were done for the protection of lives.  
Verily My Lord knoweth what is in My soul, and verily He is 
witness unto what I say.  The just king is the shadow of God in 
the earth; all should take refuge under the shadow of his justice 
and rest in the shade of his favor.  This is not the place for 
personalities, or censures [directed] specially against some 
apart from others; for the shadow tells of him who casteth the 
shadow.  God (glorious is His mention) hath called Himself 
the Lord of the worlds for that He hath nurtured and doth 
nurture all; exalted is His favor which hath preceded contingent 
beings and His mercy which hath preceded the worlds.  
     "This is sufficiently clear, that, [whether] right or wrong 
according to the imagination of the people, this community 
have accepted as true and adopted the religion for which they 
are notorious, and that on this account they have foregone 
what they had, seeking after what is with God.  And this same 
renunciation of life in the way of love for the Merciful [God] is 
a faithful witness and an eloquent attest unto that whereunto 
 
+P66 
they lay claim.  Hath it [ever] been beheld that a reasonable 
man renounced his life without proof or evidence [of the truth 
of that for which he died]?  And if it be said, `This people are 
mad,' this [too] is very improbable, for it is not [a thing] 
confined to one or two persons, but rather have a great multitude 
of every class, inebriated with the &amp;Kawthar of divine 
wisdom, hastened with heart and soul to the place of martyrdom 
in the way of the Friend.  If these persons, who for God 
have foregone all save Him, and who have poured forth life 
and wealth in His way, can be belied, then by what proof and 
evidence shall the truth of that which others assert concerning 
that wherein they are be established in the presence of the 
King?  
     "The late &amp;Haji Siyyid &amp;Muhammad (may God exalt his 
station and overwhelm him in the depth of the ocean of His 
mercy and forgiveness), although he was of the most learned of 
the doctors of the age and the most pious and austere of his 
contemporaries, and although the splendor of his worth was of 
such a degree that the tongues of all creatures spoke in praise 
and eulogy of him and confidently asserted his asceticism and 
godliness, did nevertheless in the war against the Russians 
forego much good and turn back after a little contest, although 
he himself had decreed a holy war, and had set out from his 
native country with conspicuous ensign in support of the 
Faith.  O would that the covering might be withdrawn, and 
that what is hidden from [men's] eyes might appear!  
     "But as to this sect, it is twenty years and more that they 
have been tormented by day and by night with the fierceness 
of the Royal anger, and that they have been cast each one into 
a [different] land by the blasts of the tempests of the King's 
wrath.  How many children have been left fatherless!  How 
many fathers have become childless!  How many mothers have 
not dared, through fear and dread, to mourn over their slaughtered 
children!  Many [were] the servants [of God] who at eve 
were in the utmost wealth and opulence, and at dawn were 
 
+P67 
beheld in the extreme of poverty and abasement!  There is no 
land but hath been dyed with their blood and no air whereunto 
their groanings have not arisen.  And during these few years the 
arrows of affliction have rained down without intermission 
from the clouds of fate.  Yet, notwithstanding all these visitations 
and afflictions, the fire of divine love is in such fashion 
kindled in their hearts that, were they all to be hewn in pieces, 
they would not forswear the love of the Beloved of all the 
dwellers upon earth; nay rather with their whole souls do they 
yearn and hope for what may befall [them] in the way of God.  
     "O King!  The gales of the mercy of the Merciful One have 
converted these servants and drawn them to the region of the 
[Divine] Unity--`The witness of the faithful lover is in his 
sleeve'--but some of the doctors of Persia have troubled the 
most luminous heart of the King of the Age with regard to 
those who are admitted into the Sanctuary of the Merciful One 
and those who make for the Kaaba of Wisdom.  O would that 
the world-ordering judgment of the King might decide that 
this Servant should meet those doctors, and, in the presence of 
His Majesty the King, adduce arguments and proofs!  This 
Servant is ready, and hopeth of God that such a conference 
may be brought about, so that the truth of the matter may 
become evident and apparent before His Majesty the King.  
And afterwards the decision is in thy hand, and I am ready to 
confront the throne of thy sovereignty; then give judgment for 
Me or against Me.  The Merciful Lord saith in the &amp;Furqan, 
which is the enduring proof amidst the host of existences, 
`Desire death, then, if ye be sincere.'+F30  He hath declared the 
desiring of death to be the proof of sincerity; and it will be 
apparent in the mirror of the [King's] luminous mind which 
party it is that hath this day foregone life in the way of Him 
[Who is] adored by the dwellers upon earth.  Had the doctrinal 
books of this people, [composed] in proof of that wherein they 
 
+F30 &amp;Qur'an 2:88; 62:6.  
 
+P68 
are, been written with the blood which has been shed in His 
way (exalted is He), books innumerable would assuredly have 
been apparent and visible amongst mankind.  
     "How, then, can one repudiate this people, whose words 
and deeds are consistent, and accept those persons who 
neither have foregone nor will forego one atom of the consideration 
[which they enjoy] in the way of [God] the Sovereign?  
     "Some of the doctors of Persia who have denounced this 
Servant have never either met or seen Him, nor [even] become 
cognizant of [His] intent:  nevertheless they said what 
they desired and do what they will.  Every statement requires 
proof, and is not [established] merely by assertion or by outward 
gear of asceticism.  
     "A translation of some passages from the contents of the 
Hidden Book of &amp;Fatimih (upon her be the blessings of God) 
which are apposite to this place will [now] be submitted in the 
Persian language, in order that some things [now] concealed 
may be revealed before the [Royal] Presence.  Those addressed 
in these utterances in the above-mentioned book (which is 
today known as `Hidden Words') are those people who are 
outwardly notable for science and piety, but who are inwardly 
subservient to their passions and lust.  He says:  
     "`O faithless ones!  Why do ye outwardly claim to be 
shepherds, while inwardly ye have become the wolves of My 
sheep?  Your likeness is like unto the star before the morning, 
which is apparently bright and luminous, but really causeth 
the misguidance and destruction of the caravans of My city 
and country.'  
     "So likewise He saith:  
     "`O outwardly fair and inwardly faulty!  Thy likeness is like 
unto clear bitter water, wherein outwardly the utmost sweetness 
and purity is beheld, but when it falleth into the assaying 
hands of the taste of the [Divine] Unity He doth not accept a 
single drop thereof.  The radiance of the sun is on the earth and 
on the mirror alike; but regard the difference as from the 
 
+P69 
guard-stars to the earth; nay, between them is a limitless 
distance.'  
     "`So likewise He saith:  
     "`O child of the world!  Many a morning hath the effulgence 
of My grace come unto thy place from the day-spring 
of the placeless, found thee on the couch of ease busied with 
other things, and returned like the lightning of the spirit to the 
bright abode of glory.  And I, desiring not thy shame, declared 
it not in the retreats of nearness to the hosts of holiness.'  
     "`So likewise He saith:  
     "`O pretender to My friendship!  In the morning the breeze 
of My grace passed by thee, and found thee sleeping on the bed 
of heedlessness, and wept over thy condition, and turned 
back.'  
          Finis.  
     "In the presence of the King's justice, therefore, the statement 
of an adversary ought not to be accepted as sufficient.  
And in the &amp;Furqan, which distinguisheth between truth and 
falsehood, He says, `O ye who believe, if there come unto you 
a sinner with a message, then discriminate, lest you fall upon a 
people in ignorance and on the morrow repent of what ye have 
done.'+F31   And it hath come down in holy tradition, `Credit not 
the calumniator.'  The matter hath been misapprehended by 
certain doctors, neither have they seen this Servant.  But those 
persons who have met [Him] testify that this Servant hath not 
spoken contrary to that which God hath ordained in the Book, 
and recite this blessed verse:  He saith (exalted is He) `Do ye 
disavow Us for aught save that We believe in God, and what 
hath been sent down unto Us, and what was sent down 
before?'+F32 
     "O King of the age!  The eyes of these wanderers turn and 
gaze in the direction of the mercy of the Merciful One, and 
 
+F31 &amp;Qur'an 49:6.  
+F32 &amp;Qur'an 5:64.  
 
+P70 
assuredly to these afflictions shall the greatest mercy succeed, 
and after these most grievous hardships shall follow great ease.  
But [Our] hope is this, that His Majesty the King will himself 
turn his attention to [these] matters, which thing will be the 
cause of hope in [Our] hearts.  And this is unmixed good which 
hath been submitted, and God sufficeth for a witness.  
     "Glory be to Thee, O God!  O God, I bear witness that the 
heart of the King is between the fingers of Thy power:  if Thou 
pleasest, turn it, O God, in the direction of mercy and kindliness:  
verily Thou art the Exalted, the Potent, the Beneficent:  
there is no God but Thee, the Mighty from whom help is 
sought.  
     "Concerning the qualifications of the doctors, He saith:  
`But amongst the lawyers he who guardeth himself, observeth 
his religion, opposeth his lust, and obeyeth the command of 
his Lord--it is incumbent on the people to follow him...' 
unto the end.  And if the King of the age will regard this 
utterance, which proceeded from the tongue of the recipient 
of divine inspiration, he will observe that those characterized 
by the qualities transmitted in the aforementioned tradition 
are rarer than the philosopher's stone.  Therefore the claim of 
every person pretending to science neither hath been nor is 
heard.  
     "So likewise in describing the lawyers of the latter time He 
says:  `The lawyers of that time are the most evil of lawyers 
under the shadow of heaven:  from them cometh forth mischief, 
and unto them it returneth.'  
     "And if any person deny these traditions, the establishing 
thereof is [incumbent] on this Servant; but since [Our] object 
is brevity therefore the detail of the authorities hath not been 
submitted.  
     "Those doctors who have indeed drunk of the cup of renunciation 
never interfered with this Servant, even as the late 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Murtada (may God exalt his station and cause him to 
dwell under the shadow of the domes of His grace) used to 
 
+P71 
show [Us] affection during the days of [Our] sojourn in &amp;Iraq, 
and used not to speak concerning this matter otherwise than 
God hath permitted.  We ask God to help all [men] unto that 
which He loveth and approveth.  
     "Now all people have shut their eyes to all [these] matters, 
and are bent on the persecution of this sect; so that should it be 
demanded of certain persons, who (after God's grace) rest in 
the shadow of the King's clemency and enjoy unbounded 
blessings, `In return for the King's favor what service have ye 
wrought?  Have ye by wise policy added any country to [his] 
countries?  Or have ye applied yourselves to aught which 
would cause the comfort of the people, the prosperity of the 
kingdom, and the continuance of fair fame for the state?', they 
have no reply save this, that, falsely or truly, they designate a 
number of persons in the presence of the King by the name of 
&amp;Babis, and forthwith engage in slaughter and plunder; even as 
in &amp;Tabriz and elsewhere they sold certain ones, and received 
much wealth; and this was never represented before the presence 
of the King.  All these things have occurred because of 
this, that they have found these poor people without a helper.  
They have foregone matters of moment, and have fallen upon 
these poor unfortunates.  
     "Many sects and diverse tribes rest tranquil in the shadow of 
the King, and of these sects one is this people.  Were it not best 
that the lofty endeavor and magnanimity of those who surround 
the King should be so witnessed:  that they should be 
scheming for all factions to come under the King's shadow, 
and that they should govern amidst all with justice?  To put in 
force the ordinances of God is unmixed justice, and with this 
all are satisfied; nay, the ordinances of God [ever] have been 
and will be the instrument and means for the protection of 
[His] creatures, as He saith (exalted is He) `And in retaliation ye 
have life, O people of understanding.'+F33  [But] it is far from the 
 
+F33 &amp;Qur'an 2:175.  
 
+P72 
justice of His Majesty the King that, for the fault of one 
person, a number of persons should become the objects of the 
scourges of wrath.  God (glorious is His mention) saith:  `None 
shall bear the burden of another.'+F34  And this is sufficiently 
evident, that in every community there have been and will be 
learned and ignorant, wise and foolish, sinful and pious.  And 
to commit abominable actions is far from the wise man.  For 
the wise man either seeketh the world or abandoneth it.  If he 
abandoneth it, assuredly he will not regard aught save God, 
and, apart from this, the fear of God will withhold him from 
committing forbidden and culpable actions.  And if he seeketh 
the world, he will assuredly not commit deeds which will 
cause and induce the aversion of [God's] servants and produce 
horror in those who are in all lands; but rather will he practice 
such deeds as will cause the adhesion of mankind.  So it hath 
been demonstrated that detestable actions have been and will 
be [wrought only] by ignorant persons.  We ask God to keep 
His servants from regarding aught but Him, and to bring them 
near to Him:  verily He is potent over all things.  
     "Glory be to Thee, O God!  O My God, Thou hearest My 
groaning, and seest My state and My distress and My 
affliction, and knowest what is in My soul.  If My cry be 
sincerely for Thy sake, then draw thereby the hearts of Thy 
creatures unto the horizon of the heaven of Thy recognition, 
and turn the King unto the right hand of the throne of Thy 
Name the Merciful; then bestow on him, O My God, the 
blessing which hath descended from the heaven of Thy favor 
and the clouds of Thy mercy, that he may sever himself from 
that which he hath and turn toward the region of Thy bounties.  
O Lord, help him to support the oppressed amongst [Thy] 
servants, and to raise up Thy Word amidst Thy people; then 
aid him with the hosts of the unseen and the seen, that he may 
subdue cities in Thy Name and rule over all who are upon the 
 
+F34 &amp;Qur'an 6:164; 17:16; 35:19; 39:9; 53:39.  
 
+P73 
earth by Thy power and authority, O Thou in Whose hand is 
the Kingdom of creation:  and verily Thou art He who ruleth at 
the beginning and in the end:  there is no God save Thee, the 
Potent, the Mighty, the Wise.  
     "They have misrepresented matters before the presence of 
the King in such a way that if any ill deed proceed from any 
one of this sect they account it as [a part] of the religion of these 
servants.  But, by God, beside Whom there is none other God, 
this Servant hath not sanctioned the committing of sins, much 
less that whereof the prohibition hath been explicitly revealed 
in the Book of God!  God hath prohibited unto men the 
drinking of wine, and the unlawfulness thereof hath been revealed 
and recorded in the Book of God,+F35 and the doctors of 
the age (may God multiply the like of them) have unanimously 
prohibited unto men this abominable action; yet withal 
do some commit it.  Now the punishment of this action falls on 
these heedless persons, while those manifestations of the glory 
of sanctity [continue] holy and undefiled:  unto their sanctity 
all Being, whether of the unseen or the seen, testifieth.  
     "Yea, these servants [of God] regard God as `doing what He 
pleaseth and ordering what He willeth.'+F36  There is no retreat 
nor way of flight for anyone save unto God, and no refuge nor 
asylum but in Him.  And at no time hath the caviling of men, 
whether learned or unlearned, been a thing to rely on, nor will 
it be so.  The [very] prophets, who are the pearls of the Ocean 
of Unity and the recipients of Divine Revelation, have [ever] 
been the objects of men's aversion and caviling; much more 
these servants.  Even as He saith:  `Every nation schemed 
against their apostle to catch him.  And they contended with 
falsehood therewith to refute the truth.'+F37  So likewise He 
saith, `There came not unto them any apostle but they mocked 
 
+F35 &amp;Qur'an 5:92.  
+F36 &amp;Qur'an 2:254; 3:35; 22:14, 19.  
+F37 &amp;Qur'an 40:5.  
 
+P74 
at him.'+F38  Consider the appearance of the Seal of the 
Prophets, the King of the Elect (the soul of the worlds be His 
sacrifice); after the dawning of the Sun of Truth from the 
horizon of the &amp;Hijaz what wrongs befell that Manifestation of 
the Might of the Lord of Glory at the hands of the people of 
error!  So heedless were men that they were wont to consider 
the vexation of that Holy One as one of the greatest of good 
works and as the means of approaching God Most High.  For 
in the first years the doctors of that age, whether Jews or 
Christians, turned aside from that Sun of the Highest Horizon; 
and, at the turning aside of those persons, all, whether 
humble or noble, girt up their loins to quench the radiance of 
that Light of the Horizon of Ideals.  The names of all are 
recorded in books:  amongst them were Wahb ibn &amp;Rahib, &amp;Ka'b 
ibn &amp;Ashraf, &amp;Abdu'llah [ibn] Ubayy, and the like of these 
persons; till at length the matter reached such a point that they 
convened a meeting to take counsel as to the shedding of the 
most pure blood of that Holy One, as God (glorious is His 
mention) hath declared:  `And when those who misbelieved 
plotted against thee to confine thee, or slay thee, or drive thee 
out; and they plotted, and God plotted; and God is the best of 
plotters.'+F39  So likewise He saith:  `And if their aversion be 
grievous unto thee, then, if thou art able to seek out a hole 
down into the earth, or a ladder up into the sky, that thou 
mayest show them a sign--[do so]:  but if God pleased He 
would assuredly bring them all to the true guidance:  be not 
therefore one of the ignorant.'+F40  By God, the hearts of those 
near [unto God] are scorched at the purport of these two 
blessed verses; but the like of these matters certainly transmitted 
[to Us] are blotted out of sight, and [men] have not reflected, 
neither do reflect, what was the reason of the turning aside of 
 
+F38 &amp;Qur'an 15:11; 36:29.  
+F39 &amp;Qur'an 8:30.  
+F40 &amp;Qur'an 6:35.  
 
+P75 
[God's] servants at the appearance of the daysprings of divine 
lights.  
     "So, too, before the Seal of the Prophets, consider Jesus the 
Son of Mary.  After the appearance of that Manifestation of the 
Merciful One all the doctors charged that Quintessence of 
Faith with misbelief and rebelliousness; until at length, with 
the consent of Annas, who was the chief of the doctors of that 
age, and likewise Caiaphas,+F41 who was the most learned of the 
judges, they wrought upon that Holy One that which the pen 
is ashamed and unable to repeat.  The earth with its amplitude 
was too strait for Him, until God took Him up into the heaven.  
But were a detailed account of the prophets to be submitted it 
is feared that weariness might result.  
     "O would that thou mightest permit, O King, that We 
should send unto Thy Majesty that whereby eyes would be 
refreshed, souls tranquilized, and every just person assured 
that with Him [i.e., &amp;Baha'u'llah] is knowledge of the Book.  
Were it not for the turning aside of the ignorant and the willful 
blindness of the doctors, verily I would utter a discourse 
whereat hearts would be glad and would fly unto the air from 
the murmur of whose winds is heard, `There is no God but 
He.'  But now, because the time admitteth it not, the tongue is 
withheld from utterance, and the vessel of declaration is sealed 
until God shall unclose it by His power:  verily He is the 
Potent, the Powerful.  
     "Glory be to Thee, O God!  O My God, I ask of Thee in Thy 
Name, whereby Thou hast subdued whomsoever is in the 
heavens and the earth, that Thou wilt keep the lamp of Thy 
religion with the glass of Thy power and Thy favors, so that the 
winds of denial pass not by it from the region of those who are 
heedless of the mysteries of Thy Sovereign Name:  then increase 
its light by the oil of Thy wisdom:  verily Thou art Potent 
over whomsoever is in Thy earth and Thy heaven.  
 
+F41 See John 11:49-50; 18:13-28; Acts 4:6-10.  
 
+P76 
     "O Lord, I ask of Thee by the Supreme Word, whereat 
whosoever is in the earth and the heaven feareth save him who 
taketh hold of the `Most Firm Handle,'+F42 that Thou wilt not 
abandon Me amongst Thy creatures:  lift Me up unto Thee, 
and make Me to enter in under the shadow of Thy mercy, and 
give Me to drink of the pure wine of Thy grace, that I may 
dwell under the canopy of Thy glory and the domes of Thy 
favors:  verily Thou art powerful unto that Thou wishest, and 
verily Thou art the Protecting, the Self-Sufficing.  
     "O King!  The lamps of justice are extinguished, and the fire 
of persecution is kindled on all sides, until that they have made 
My people captives.  This is not the first honor which hath 
been violated in the way of God.  It behooveth everyone to 
regard and recall what befell the kindred of the Prophet until 
that the people made them captives and brought them in unto 
Damascus the spacious; and amongst them was the Prince of 
Worshipers, the Stay of the elect, the Sanctuary of the eager 
(the soul of all beside him be his sacrifice).  It was said unto 
them, `Are ye seceders?'  He said, `No, by God, we are servants 
who have believed in God and in His signs, and through us the 
teeth of faith are disclosed in a smile, and the sign of the 
Merciful One shineth forth; through our mention spreadeth 
&amp;Al-Batha,+F43 and the darkness which intervened between earth 
and heaven is dispelled.'  It was said, `Have ye forbidden what 
God hath sanctioned, or sanctioned what God hath forbidden?'  
He said, `We were the first who followed the commandments 
of God:  we are the source of command and its 
origin, and the firstfruits of all good and its consummation:  we 
are the sign of the Eternal, and His commemoration amongst 
the nations.'  It was said, `Have ye abandoned the &amp;Qur'an?'  He 
said, `Through us did the Merciful One reveal it; and we are 
gales of the All-Glorious amidst [His] creatures; we are streams 
 
+F42 &amp;Qur'an 2:257; 31:21.  
+F43 Mecca.  
 
+P77 
which have arisen from the most mighty Ocean whereby God 
revived the earth after its death; from us His signs are diffused, 
His evidences are manifested, and His tokens appear; and with 
us are His mysteries and His secrets.'  It was said, `For what 
fault [then] were ye afflicted?'  He said, `For the love of God 
and our severance from all beside Him.'  
     "Verily We have not repeated his expressions (upon him be 
peace), but rather We have made manifest a spray from the 
Ocean of Life which was deposited in his words, that by it 
those who advance may live and be aware of what hath 
befallen the trusted ones of God on the part of an evil and most 
reprobate people.  And today We see the people censuring 
those who acted unjustly of yore, while they oppress more 
vehemently than those oppressed, and know it not.  By God, I 
do not desire sedition, but the purification of [God's] servants 
from all that withholdeth them from approach to God, the 
King of the Day of Invocation.  
     "I was asleep on My couch:  the breaths of My Lord the 
Merciful passed over Me and awakened Me from sleep:  to this 
bear witness the denizens [of the realms] of His Power and His 
Kingdom, and the dwellers in the cities of His Glory, and 
Himself, the True.  I am not impatient of calamities in His 
way, nor of afflictions for His love and at His good pleasure.  
God hath made affliction as a morning shower to this green 
pasture, and as a match for His lamp whereby earth and 
heaven are illumined.  
     "Shall that which anyone hath of wealth endure unto him, 
or avail him tomorrow with him who holdeth his forelock?  If 
any should look on those who sleep under slabs and keep 
company with the dust, can he distinguish the bones of the 
king's skull from the knuckles of the slave?  No, by the King of 
Kings!  Or doth he know governors from herdsmen, or discern 
the wealthy and the rich from him who was without shoes or 
carpet?  By God, distinction is removed, save for him who 
fulfilled righteousness and judged uprightly.  Where are the 
 
+P78 
doctors, the scholars, the nobles?  Where is the keenness of 
their glances, the sharpness of their sight, the subtlety of their 
thoughts, the soundness of their understandings?  Where are 
their hidden treasures and their apparent gauds, their bejeweled 
thrones and their ample couches?  Alas!  All have been laid 
waste, and the decree of God hath rendered them as scattered 
dust!  Emptied is what they treasured up, and dissipated is what 
they collected, and dispersed is what they concealed:  they have 
become [such that] thou seest naught but their empty places, 
their gaping roofs, their uprooted beams, their new things 
waxed old.  As for the discerning man, verily wealth will not 
divert him from regarding the end; and for the prudent man, 
riches will not withhold him from turning toward [God] the 
Rich, the Exalted.  Where is he who held dominion over all 
whereon the sun arose, and who spent lavishly and sought 
after curious things in the world and what is therein created?  
Where is the lord of the swarthy squadron and the yellow 
standard?  Where is he who ruled &amp;Zawra,+F44 and where he who 
wrought injustice in [Damascus] the spacious?  Where are they 
at whose bounty treasures were afraid, at whose openhandedness 
and generosity the ocean was dismayed?  Where is he 
whose arm was stretched forth in rebelliousness, whose heart 
turned away from the Merciful One?  Where is he who used to 
make choice of pleasures and cull the fruits of desires?  Where 
are the dames of the bridal chambers, and the possessors of 
beauty?  Where are their waving branches and their spreading 
boughs, their lofty palaces and trellised gardens?  Where is the 
smoothness of the expanses thereof and the softness of their 
breezes, the rippling of their waters and the murmur of their 
winds, the cooing of their doves and the rustling of their trees?  
Where are their laughing hearts and their smiling teeth?  Woe 
unto them!  They have descended to the abyss and become 
companions to the pebbles; today no mention is heard of them 
 
+F44 &amp;Baghdad.  
 
+P79 
nor any sound; nothing is known of them nor any hint.  Will 
the people dispute it while they behold it?  Will they deny it 
when they know it?  I know not in what valley they wander 
erringly:  do they not see that they depart and return not?  How 
long will they be famous in the low countries and in the high, 
descend and ascend?  `Is not the time yet come to those who 
believe for their hearts to become humble for the remembrance 
of God?'+F45  Well is it with that one who hath said or 
shall say, `Yea, O Lord, the time is ripe and hath come,' and 
who severeth himself from all that is.  Alas! naught is reaped 
but what is sown, and naught is taken but what is laid up, save 
by the grace of God and His favor.  Hath the earth conceived 
Him whom the veils of glory prevent not from ascending into 
the Kingdom of His Lord, the Mighty, the Supreme?  Have 
We any good works whereby defects shall be removed or 
which shall bring Us near unto the Lord of causes?  We ask 
God to deal with Us according to His grace, not His justice, 
and to make Us of those who turn toward Him and sever 
themselves from all beside Him.  
     "O King, I have seen in the way of God what no eye hath 
seen and no ear hath heard.  Friends have disclaimed Me; ways 
are straitened unto Me; the pool of safety is dried up; the plain 
of ease is [scorched] yellow.  How many calamities have descended, 
and how many will descend!  I walk advancing toward 
the Mighty, the Bounteous, while behind Me glides the 
serpent.  My eyes rain down tears until My bed is drenched; but 
My sorrow is not for Myself.  By God, My head longeth for the 
spears for the love of its Lord, and I never pass by a tree but My 
heart addresseth it [saying], `O would that thou wert cut down 
in My name and My body were crucified upon thee in the way 
of My Lord'; yea, because I see mankind going astray in their 
intoxication, and they know it not:  they have exalted their 
lusts, and put aside their God, as though they took the command 
 
+F45 &amp;Qur'an 57:15.  
 
+P80 
of God for a mockery, a sport, and a plaything; and they 
think that they do well, and that they are harbored in the 
citadel of security.  The matter is not as they suppose:  tomorrow 
they shall see what they [now] deny.  
     "We are about to shift from this most remote place of 
banishment+F46 unto the prison of &amp;Akka.  And, according to 
what they say, it is assuredly the most desolate of the cities of 
the world, the most unsightly of them in appearance, the most 
detestable in climate, and the foulest in water; it is as though it 
were the metropolis of the owl; there is not heard from its 
regions aught save the sound of its hooting.  And in it they 
intend to imprison the Servant, and to shut in Our faces the 
doors of leniency and take away from Us the good things of the 
life of the world during what remaineth of Our days.  By God, 
though weariness should weaken Me, and hunger should 
destroy Me, though My couch should be made of the hard 
rock and My associates of the beasts of the desert, I will not 
blench, but will be patient, as the resolute and determined are 
patient, in the strength of God, the King of Preexistence, the 
Creator of the nations; and under all circumstances I give 
thanks unto God.  And We hope of His graciousness (exalted is 
He) the freedom of Our necks from chains and shackles in this 
imprisonment:  and that He will render [all men's] faces sincere 
toward Him, the Mighty, the Bounteous.  Verily He 
answereth him who prayeth unto Him, and is near unto him 
who calleth on Him.  And We ask Him to make this dark 
calamity a buckler for the body of His saints, and to protect 
them thereby from sharp swords and piercing blades.  Through 
affliction hath His light shone and His praise been bright 
unceasingly:  this hath been His method through past ages and 
bygone times.  
     "The people shall know what today they understand not 
when their steeds shall stumble, their beds be rolled up, their 
 
+F46 Adrianople.  
 
+P81 
swords be blunted, and their footsteps slip.  I know not how 
long they shall ride the steed of desire and wander erringly in 
the desert of heedlessness and error.  Of glory shall any glory 
endure, or of abasement any abasement?  Or shall he endure 
who used to stay himself on high cushions, and who attained 
in splendor the utmost limit?  No, by My Lord the Merciful!  
`All that is thereon is transient, and there remaineth [only] the 
face of My Lord' the Mighty, the Beneficent.  What buckler 
hath not the arrow of destruction smitten, or what pinion hath 
not the hand of fate plucked?  From what fortress hath the 
messenger of death been kept back when he came?  What 
throne hath not been broken, or what palace hath not been left 
desolate?  Did men but know what pure wine of the mercy of 
their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, was beneath the 
seal, they would certainly cast aside reproach and seek to be 
satisfied by this Servant; but now have they veiled Me with the 
veil of darkness which they have woven with the hands of 
doubts and fancies.  The White Hand shall cleave an opening 
to this sombre night.  On that day the servants [of God] shall 
say what those caviling women said of yore, that there may 
appear in the end what began in the beginning.  Do they desire 
to tarry when their foot is in the stirrup?  Or do they see any 
return in their going?  No, by the Lord of Lords, save in the 
Resurrection!  On that day men shall arise from the tombs and 
shall be questioned concerning their riches.  Happy that one 
whom burdens shall not oppress on that day whereon the 
mountains shall pass away and all shall appear for the questioning 
in the presence of God the Exalted!  Verily He is severe 
in punishing.  
     "We ask God to sanctify the hearts of certain of the doctors 
from rancor and hatred that they may regard things with eyes 
which closure overcometh not; and to raise them unto a 
station where the world and the lordship thereof shall not turn 
them aside from looking toward the Supreme Horizon, and 
where [anxiety for] gaining a livelihood and [providing] 
 
+P82 
household goods shall not divert them from [the thought of] 
that day whereon the mountains shall be made like carpets.  
Though they rejoice at that which hath befallen Us of calamity, 
there shall come a day whereon they shall wail and weep.  
By My Lord, were I given the choice between the glory and 
opulence, the wealth and dignity, the ease and luxury wherein 
they are, and the distress and affliction wherein I am, I would 
certainly choose that wherein I am today, and I would not now 
exchange one atom of these afflictions for all that hath been 
created in the kingdom of production!  Were it not for 
afflictions in the way of God My continuance would have no 
sweetness for Me, nor would My life profit Me.  Let it not be 
hidden from the discerning and such as look towards the 
chiefest outlook that I, during the greater part of My days, was 
as a Servant sitting beneath a sword suspended by a single hair 
who knoweth not when it shall descend upon Him, whether it 
shall descend instantly or after a while.  And in all this We give 
thanks to God the Lord of the worlds, and We praise Him 
under all circumstances:  verily He is a witness unto all things.  
     "We ask God to extend His shadow,+F47 that the unitarians 
may haste thereto, and that the sincere may take shelter therein; 
and to bestow on [these] servants flowers from the garden 
of his grace and stars from the horizon of his favors; and to assist 
him in that which he liketh and approveth; and to help him 
unto that which shall bring him near to the Dayspring of His 
Most Comely Names, that he may not shut his eyes to the 
wrong which he seeth, but may regard his subjects with the eye 
of favor and preserve them from violence.  And we ask Him 
(exalted is He) to make thee a helper unto His religion and a 
regarder of His justice, that thou mayest rule over [His] servants 
as thou rulest over those of thy kindred, and mayest 
choose for them what thou wouldest choose for thyself.  Verily 
 
+F47 Reference to the &amp;Shah of Persia.  
 
+P83 
He is the Potent, the Exalted, the Protecting, the Self-Subsistent."  
     Now since suitable occasion hath arisen it hath been considered 
appropriate that some of the precepts of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
which are contained in tracts and epistles should also be 
inserted briefly in this treatise, so that the main principles and 
practice and [their] foundations and basis may become clear 
and apparent.  And these texts have been copied from numerous 
tracts.  
     Amongst them [is this]:  "Consort with [people of all] religions 
with spirituality and fragrance....  Beware lest the zeal 
of ignorance possess you amongst mankind.  All originated 
from God and returneth unto Him:  verily He is the Source of 
creation and the Goal of the worlds."  
     And amongst them [is this]:  "Ye are forbidden sedition and 
strife in the books and epistles; and herein I desire naught save 
your exaltation and elevation, whereunto beareth witness the 
heaven and its stars, the sun and its radiance, the trees and 
their leaves, the seas and their waves, and the earth and its 
treasures.  We ask God to continue His saints and strengthen 
them unto that which befitteth them in this blessed, precious, 
and wondrous station, and We ask Him to assist those who 
surround Me to act according to that whereunto they have 
been commanded on the part of the Supreme Pen."  
     And amongst them [is this]:  "The fairest tree of knowledge is 
this sublime word:  `Ye are all the fruit of one tree and the 
leaves of one branch.'  Pride is not for him who loves his 
country, but for him who loves the [whole] world."  
     And amongst them [is this]:  "Verily he who educateth his 
son, or one of the sons [of another], it is as though he educated 
one of My sons.  Upon him be the splendor of God, and His 
grace, and His mercy which preceded the worlds."  
     Amongst them [is this]:  "O people of &amp;Baha!  Ye have been 
and are the dawnings of affection and the daysprings of divine 
 
+P84 
grace:  defile not the tongue with cursing or execration of 
anyone, and guard the eye from that which is not seemly.  
Show forth that which ye have:  if it be accepted, the object is 
attained; if not, interference is vain:  leave him to himself, 
[while] advancing toward God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsistent.  
Be not a cause of grief, much less of strife and 
sedition.  It is hoped that ye will be nurtured in the shade of the 
lote-tree of Divine Grace, and practice that which God desireth.  
Ye are all leaves of one tree and drops of one sea."  
     Amongst them [is this]:  "The faith of God and religion of 
God hath been revealed and manifested from the heaven of 
the Will of the King of Preexistence only for the union and 
concord of the dwellers upon earth:  make it not a cause of 
discord and dissension.  The principal means and chief instrument 
for [bringing about] the appearance and irradiance of 
the luminary of concord is the religion of God and the Law of 
the Lord; while the growth of the world, the education of the 
nations, and the peace and comfort of those in all lands are 
through the divine ordinances and decrees.  This is the principal 
means for this most great gift; it giveth the cup of life, 
bestoweth everlasting life, and conferreth eternal blessedness.  
The chiefs of the earth, especially the exemplars of divine 
justice, must make strenuous efforts to guard this state and to 
upraise and preserve it.  So likewise that which is necessary is 
inquiry into the condition of the people, and cognizance of 
the deeds and circumstances of each one of the different 
classes.  We desire of the exemplars of God's power, namely of 
kings and chiefs, that they will make endeavor:  perchance 
discord may depart out of [their] midst, and the horizons may 
be illumined with the light of concord.  All must hold to that 
which floweth from the Pen of Reminder, and practice it.  God 
witnesseth and [all] the atoms of existences testify that we have 
mentioned that which will be the cause of the exaltation, 
elevation, education, preservation, and reformation of the 
dwellers upon earth.  We desire of God that He will strengthen 
 
+P85 
[His] servants.  That which this Oppressed One seeketh of all is 
justice and fairness:  let them not be satisfied with listening; let 
them ponder on what hath become manifest from this Oppressed 
One.  I swear by the Sun of Revelation, which hath 
shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Kingdom 
of the Merciful One, that, if any [other] expositor or speaker 
had been beheld, I would not have made Myself an object 
for the malevolence and the calumnies of mankind."  Finis.  
     By these sentences a clue to the principles, ideas, line of 
conduct, behavior, and intentions of this sect is placed in the 
hand; whereas if we seek to become acquainted with the truth 
of this matter through the accounts and stories which are in 
the mouths of men, the truth will be entirely concealed and 
hidden by reason of their manifold differences and contrariety.  
It is therefore best to discover the principles and objects of 
this sect from the contents of their teachings, tracts, and 
epistles.  There is no authority nor are there any proofs or texts 
superior to these, for this is the foundation of foundations and 
the ultimate criterion.  One cannot judge of the generality by 
the speech or action of individuals, for diversity of states is one 
of the peculiarities and concomitants of the human race.  
     At all events, in the beginning of the year one thousand two 
hundred and eighty-five [A.H.] they transferred &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and all those persons who were with Him from Adrianople to 
the prison of &amp;Akka, and &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya to the fortress of 
Famagusta, and there they remained.+F48  But in Persia after a 
while sundry persons who were discerning in matters, notable 
for wise policy, and aware and cognizant of the truth of the 
earlier and later events, made representation before the presence 
of His Majesty the King saying, "What has hitherto been 
reported, related, asserted, and alleged concerning this sect in 
the Royal Presence was either an exaggeration, or else [the 
speakers] fabricated statements with a view to [their own] 
 
+F48 1868.  
 
+P86 
individual designs and the attainment of personal advantages.  
If so be that His Majesty the King will investigate matters in his 
own noble person, it is believed that it will become clear 
before his presence that this sect have no worldly object nor 
any concern with political matters.  The fulcrum of their 
motion and rest and the pivot of their cast and conduct is 
restricted to spiritual things and confined to matters of conscience; 
it has nothing to do with the affairs of government nor 
any concern with the powers of the throne; its principles are 
the withdrawal of veils, the verification of signs, the education 
of souls, the reformation of characters, the purification of 
hearts, and illumination with the gleams of enlightenment.  
That which befits the kingly dignity and beseems the world-ordering 
diadem is this, that all subjects of every class and 
creed should be the objects of bounty, and [should abide] in 
the utmost tranquility and prosperity under the wide shadow 
of the King's justice.  For the divine shadow is the refuge of all 
the dwellers upon earth and the asylum of all mankind; it is not 
limited to one party.  In particular, the true nature and real 
doctrine of this sect have [now] become evident and well 
known:  all their writings and tracts have repeatedly and frequently 
fallen into [our] hands, and are to be found preserved 
in the possession of the government.  If they be perused, the 
actual truth and inward verity will become clear and apparent.  
These pages are entirely taken up with prohibitions of sedition, 
[recommendations of] upright conduct amongst mankind, 
obedience, submission, loyalty, conformity, and acquisition 
of laudable qualities, and encouragements to become 
endowed with praiseworthy accomplishments and characteristics.  
They have absolutely no reference to political questions, 
nor do they treat of that which could cause disturbance or 
sedition.  Under these circumstances a just government can 
[find] no excuse, and possesses no pretext [for further persecuting 
this sect] except [a claim to the right of] interference in 
thought and conscience, which are the private possessions of 
 
+P87 
the heart and soul.  And, as regards this matter, there has 
[already] been much interference, and countless efforts have 
been made.  What blood has been shed!  What heads have been 
hung up!  Thousands of persons have been slain; thousands of 
women and children have become wanderers or captives; 
many are the buildings which have been ruined; and how 
many noble races and families have become headless and 
homeless!  Yet naught has been effected and no advantage has 
been gained; no remedy has been discovered for this ill, nor 
any easy salve for this wound.  [To insure] freedom of conscience 
and tranquility of heart and soul is one of the duties and 
functions of government, and is in all ages the cause of 
progress in development and ascendency over other lands.  
Other civilized countries acquired not this preeminence, nor 
attained unto these high degrees of influence and power, till 
such time as they put away the strife of sects out of their midst, 
and dealt with all classes according to one standard.  All are 
one people, one nation, one species, one kind.  The common 
interest is complete equality; justice and equality amongst 
mankind are amongst the chief promoters of empire and the 
principal means to the extension of the skirt of conquest.  From 
whatever section of earth's denizens signs of contentiousness 
appear, prompt punishment is required by a just government; 
while any person who girds up the loins of endeavor and 
carries off the ball of priority is deserving of royal favors and 
worthy of splendid gifts.  Times are changed, and the need and 
fashion of the world are changed.  Interference with creed and 
faith in every country causes manifest detriment, while justice 
and equal dealing towards all peoples on the face of the earth 
are the means whereby progress is effected.  It is right to 
exercise caution and care with regard to political factions, and 
to be fearful and apprehensive of materialist sects; for the 
subjects occupying the thoughts of the former are [designs of] 
interference in political matters and [desire of] ostentation, 
while the actions and conduct of the latter are subversive of 
 
+P88 
safety and tranquility.  But this sect are steadfast in their own 
path and firmly established in conduct and faith; they are 
pious, devoted, tenacious, and consistent in such sort that 
they freely lay down their lives, and, after their own way, seek 
to please God; they are strenuous in effort and earnest in 
endeavor; they are the essence of obedience and most patient 
in hardship and trouble; they sacrifice their existence and raise 
no complaint or cry; what they utter is in truth the secret 
longing of the heart, and what they seek and pursue is by the 
direction of a leader.  It is therefore necessary to regard their 
principles and their Chief, and not to make a trivial thing a 
pretext.  Now since the conduct of the Chief, the teachings of 
His epistles, and the purport of His writings are apparent and 
well known, the line of action of this sect is plain and obvious 
as the sun.  Of whatever was possible and practicable by way of 
discouragement, determent, eradication, intimidation, reprehension, 
slaughter, banishment, and stripes there was no 
lack, yet nothing was thereby effected.  In other countries 
when they perceived severity and persecution in such instances 
to be identical with stimulation and incitement, and 
saw that paying no attention was more effectual, they abated 
the fire of revolution.  Therefore did they universally proclaim 
the equal rights of all denominations, and sounded the liberty 
of all classes from east to west.  This clamor and outcry, this 
uproar and conflagration, are the consequences of instigation, 
temptation, incitement, and provocation.  For thirty years 
there has been no rumor of disturbance or rebellion, nor any 
sign of sedition.  Notwithstanding the duplication of adherents 
and the increase and multiplication of this body, through 
many admonitions and encouragements to virtue this sect are 
all in the utmost repose and stability:  they have made obedience 
their distinctive trait, and in extreme submissiveness and 
subordination are the loyal subjects of the King.  On what 
lawful grounds can the government further molest them, or 
permit them to be slighted?  Besides this, interference with the 
 
+P89 
consciences and beliefs of peoples, and persecution of diverse 
denominations of men is an obstacle to the expansion of the 
kingdom, an impediment to the conquest of other countries, 
an obstruction to multiplication of subjects, and contrary to 
the established principles of monarchy.  In the time when the 
mighty government of Persia did not interfere with [men's] 
consciences, diverse sects entered in and abode beneath the 
banner of the great king, and [many] different peoples reposed 
and served under the shadow of that mighty government's 
protection.  The extent of the empire increased from day to 
day; the greater portion of the continent of Asia was under the 
just rule of its administration; and the majority of the different 
religions and races were [represented] amongst the subjects of 
him who wore its crown.  But when the custom of interference 
with the creeds of all sects arose, and the principle of inquiring 
into men's thoughts became the fashion and practice, the 
extensive dominions of the empire of Persia diminished, and 
many provinces and vast territories passed out of her hands, 
until it reached such a point that the great provinces of &amp;Turan, 
Assyria, and Chaldea were lost; until--what need of prolixity?
--the greater part of the regions of &amp;Khurasan likewise 
passed out of the control of the government of Persia by reason 
of the interference with matters of conscience and the fanaticism 
of its governors.  For the cause of the Afghan independency 
and the revolt of the Turcoman tribes was in truth this 
thing, else were they at no time or period separate from Persia.  
In face of its evident harmfulness what necessity is there for 
persecuting the harmless?  But if we desire to put in force the 
sentence [of the doctors of religion] no one will escape fetters 
and chains and the keenness of the sword, for in Persia, apart 
from this sect, there exist diverse sects, such as the 
&amp;Mutasharris, the &amp;Shaykhis, the &amp;Sufis, the &amp;Nusayris, and 
others, each one of whom regards the other as infidels and 
accuses them of crime.  Under these circumstances what need 
that the government should persecute this one or that one, or 
 
+P90 
disturb itself about the ideas and consciences of its subjects and 
people?  All are the subjects of the king, and are under the 
shadow of the royal protection.  Everyone who hears and obeys 
should be undisturbed and unmolested, while everyone who 
is rebellious and disobedient deserves punishment at the 
hands of his Majesty the King.  Above all, the times are 
completely changed, while principles and institutions have 
undergone alteration.  In all countries such actions hinder 
development and progress, and cause decline and deterioration.  
Of the violent agitation which has befallen the supports 
of Oriental government the chief cause and principal factor 
are in truth these laws and habits of interference; while that 
state the seat of whose dominion over the Atlantic and the 
Baltic is in the furthest regions of the North has, by reason of 
equal dealing with its different subjects and the establishment 
of the uniform political rights of diverse nationalities, acquired 
extensive colonies in each of the five continents of the 
world.+F49  Where is this little island in the North Atlantic, and 
where the vast territory of the East Indies?  Can such extension 
be obtained save by equal justice to all peoples and classes?  At 
all events, by means of just laws, freedom of conscience, and 
uniform dealing and equity towards all nationalities and peoples, 
they have actually brought under their dominion nearly 
all of the inhabited quarter of the world, and by reason of these 
principles of freedom they have added day by day to the 
strength, power, and extent of their empire, while most of the 
peoples on the face of the earth celebrate the name of this state 
for its justice.  As regards religious zeal and true piety, their 
touchstone and proof are firmness and steadfastness in noble 
qualities, virtues, and perfections, which are the greatest blessings 
of the human race; but not interference with the belief of 
this one or that one, demolition of edifices, and cutting off of 
the human race.  In the middle ages, whereof the beginning 
 
+F49 England.  
 
+P91 
was the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, and the end the 
capture of Constantinople at the hands of [the followers of] 
&amp;Islam, fierce intolerance and molestation of far and near arose 
in [all] the countries of Europe by reason of the paramount 
influence of religious leaders.  The matter came to such a pass 
that the edifice of humanity seemed tottering to its fall, and the 
peace and comfort of chief and vassal, king and subject, 
became hidden behind the veil of annihilation.  Night and day 
all parties were slaves to apprehension and disquietude:  civilization 
was utterly destroyed:  the control and order of countries 
was neglected:  the principles and essentials of the happiness of 
the human race were in abeyance:  the supports of kingly 
authority were shaken:  but the influence and power of the 
heads of religion and of the monks were in all parts complete.  
But when they removed these differences, persecution, and 
bigotries out of their midst, and proclaimed the equal rights of 
all subjects and the liberty of men's consciences, the lights of 
glory and power arose and shone from the horizons of that 
kingdom in such wise that those countries made progress in 
every direction; and whereas the mightiest monarchy of 
Europe had been servile to and abased before the smallest 
government of Asia, now the great states of Asia are unable to 
oppose the small states of Europe.  These are effectual and 
sufficient proofs that the conscience of man is sacred and to be 
respected; and that liberty thereof produces widening of ideas, 
amendment of morals, improvement of conduct, disclosure of 
the secrets of creation, and manifestation of the hidden verities 
of the contingent world.  Moreover, if interrogation of conscience, 
which is one of the private possessions of the heart and 
the soul, take place in this world, what further recompense 
remains for man in the court of divine justice at the day of 
general resurrection?  Convictions and ideas are within the 
scope of the comprehension of the King of kings, not of kings; 
and soul and conscience are between the fingers of control of 
the Lord of hearts, not of [His] servants.  So in the world of 
 
+P92 
existence two persons unanimous in all grades [of thought] 
and all beliefs cannot be found.  `The ways unto God are as the 
number of the breaths of [His] creatures' is a mysterious truth, 
and `To every [people] We have appointed a [separate] rite'+F50 is 
one of the subtleties of the &amp;Qur'an.  If this vast energy and 
precious time which have been expended in persecuting other 
religions, and whereby no sort of result or effect has been 
obtained, had been spent in strengthening the basis of the 
monarchy, fortifying the imperial throne, making prosperous 
the realms of the sovereign, and quickening the subjects of the 
king, ere now the royal dominions would have become prosperous, 
the seed-plot of the people would have been watered 
by the bounty of princely justice, and the splendor of the 
kingdom of Persia would be evident and apparent as the true 
dawn throughout the horizons of the world."  
     These questions and considerations, at all events, certain 
persons have reported.  But let us return to our original subject.  
The Royal Personage was pleased to investigate the hidden 
secret in his own noble person.  According to the account 
transmitted, it became clear and obvious before the [Royal] 
Presence that most of these suspicions arose from the intrigues 
of persons of influence who were continually engaged in 
fabricating matters behind the veil of fancy and casting suspicion 
upon the community, and who, to attain advantages for 
themselves and preserve their own positions, were wont to 
make motes appear as globes, and straws as mountains in the 
mirror of their imagination.  For these suspicions there was 
absolutely no foundation or basis, nor had these assertions any 
proof or verisimilitude.  What power and ability have the 
helpless people, or what boldness and strength have poor 
subjects that they should inflict injury or hurt on the sovereign 
might, or be able to oppose the military forces of the crown?  
     From that time till now disturbance and sedition have been 
 
+F50 &amp;Qur'an 22:35.  
 
+P93 
on the wane in Persia, and clamor and strife have ceased; 
although [still] on rare occasions certain of the official doctors 
do, for their own personal and private advantage, stir up the 
common folk, raise a hue and cry, and, by their importunity 
and pertinacity, molest one or two individuals of this sect, as 
happened ten or twelve years ago in &amp;Isfahan.  For there were 
amongst the inhabitants of &amp;Isfahan two brothers, Siyyids of 
&amp;Tabataba, Siyyid &amp;Hasan and Siyyid &amp;Husayn, celebrated in those 
parts for piety, trustworthiness, and nobility; men of wealth, 
engaged in commerce, behaving towards all men with perfect 
kindliness and courtesy.  And to all outward appearance no 
one had observed in either of these two brothers any swerving 
from what was best, much less any conduct or behavior which 
could deserve torment or punishment; for, as is related, they 
were admitted by all [preeminent] in all praiseworthy and 
laudable qualities, while their deeds and actions were like 
exhortations and admonitions.  These had transacted business 
with &amp;Mir &amp;Muhammad &amp;Husayn the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih of &amp;Isfahan; 
and when they came to make up their accounts it appeared 
that the sum of eighteen thousand &amp;tumans was due to them.  
They [therefore] broke off [further] transactions, prepared a 
bond for this sum, and desired it to be sealed.  This thing was 
grievous to the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih, so that he came to the stage of 
anger and enmity.  Finding himself in debt, and having no 
recourse but to pay, he raised clamor and outcry saying "These 
two brothers are &amp;Babis and deserve severe punishment from 
the king."  A crowd at once attacked their house, plundered 
and pillaged all their goods, distressed and terrified their wives 
and children, and seized and despoiled all their possessions.  
Then, fearing that they might refer the punishment to the step 
of the king's throne and loose their tongues in demand of 
redress, he [i.e., the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih] fell to thinking how to 
compass their death and destroy them.  He therefore persuaded 
certain of the doctors to cooperate with him, and they pronounced 
sentence of death.  Afterwards they arrested those two 
 
+P94 
brothers, put them in chains, and brought them before the 
public assembly.  Yet seek as they might to fix on them some 
accusation, find some fault, or discover some pretext, they 
were unable to do so.  At length they said, "You must either 
renounce this faith, or else lay down your heads beneath the 
sword of punishment."  Although some of those present urged 
them saying, "Say merely `We are not of this sect,' and it is 
sufficient, and will be the means of your deliverance and 
protection," they would by no means consent, but rather 
confirmed and declared it with eloquent speech and affecting 
utterance, so that the rage and violence of the &amp;Imam-Jum'ih 
boiled over, and, not satisfied with killing and destroying 
them, they inflicted sundry indignities on their bodies after 
death to mention which is not fitting, and of which the details 
are beyond the power of speech.  Indeed in such wise was the 
blood of these two brothers shed that even the Christian priest 
of &amp;Julfa cried out, lamented, and wept on that day; and this 
event befell after such sort that everyone wept over the fate of 
those two brothers, for during the whole period of their life 
they had never distressed the feelings even of an ant, while by 
general report they had in the time of the famine in Persia 
spent all their wealth in relieving the poor and distressed.  Yet, 
notwithstanding this reputation, were they slain with such 
cruelty in the midst of the people!  
     But now for a long while the justice of the King has 
prevented and withheld, and none dares attempt such grievous 
molestations.</p></body>
