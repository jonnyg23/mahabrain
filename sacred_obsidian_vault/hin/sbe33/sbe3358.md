 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> fragments of B<i>ri</i>haspati are among the most precious relics of the early legal literature of India. Apart from<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Importance of B<i>ri</i>haspati.</font></span> their intrinsic value and interest, as containing a very full exposition of the whole range of the Hindu law, their close connexion with the Code of Manu gives them a special claim to consideration, and renders them a valuable link in the chain of evidence <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">1</font></a> by which the date of the most authoritative code of ancient India has been approximately determined <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>The connexion between the Manu and B<i>ri</i>haspati Sm<i>ri</i>tis appears first from the way in which B<i>ri</i>haspati refers to,<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">He refers to Manu.</font></span> and quotes from, the Code of Manu. In the chapter on Gambling and Betting, B<i>ri</i>haspati says (XXVI, I), 'Gambling has been prohibited by Manu, because it destroys truth, honesty, and wealth. It has been permitted by others, when conducted so as to allow the king a share (of every stake).' The observation that Manu disagrees with the other legislators as to the permissibility of gambling is perfectly just. See Manu IX, 221-228; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 199-203; Âpastamba II, 25, 12, 13; Nârada XVII, 1-8; Kâtyâyana XXV, 1. B<i>ri</i>haspati goes on to say (XXVI, 2) that 'Gambling shall take place under the superintendence of keepers of gaming-houses, for the purpose of discovering thieves.' This rule agrees almost literally with Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 203, and the fact that B<i>ri</i>haspati does not refer to Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya by name, although he names Manu, can only be accounted for by his very particular veneration for the latter, as the fountain-head of Sacred Law.On the</p>

 <p>subject of weights or coins, B<i>ri</i>haspati says (X, 10), 'The quantities beginning with a floating particle of dust and ending with a Kârshâpa<i>n</i>a have been declared by Manu.' The statements of Manu which are thus referred to by B<i>ri</i>haspati may be found, Manu VIII, 132-137.In speaking of the Niyoga or appointment of a widow to raise offspring to her deceased husband, B<i>ri</i>haspati says (XXIV, 12), 'The Niyoga has been declared by Manu, and again prohibited by the same; on account of the successive deterioration of the (four) ages of the world, it must not take place (in the present or Kali age).' This text shows that the conflicting statements of Manu (IX, 57-68) with regard to the Niyoga, which have been the matter of so much comment among European philologists, had already struck his follower B<i>ri</i>haspati, and were ingeniously explained by him, in accordance with the practice of his own times.In the chapter on Inheritance (XXV, 33), B<i>ri</i>haspati observes that out of the thirteen sons declared by Manu, a legitimate son of the body (aurasa) and an appointed daughter (putrikâ) are the only ones that represent real issue. It is true that Manu (IX, 158, 180) speaks emphatically of twelve sons only, but the appointed daughter or her son is not among these, and he advocates in strong terms the rights of an appointed daughter's son (IX, 127-140), and cuts down very much the rights of all the other substitutes for a son (IX, 180, 181). This shows that B<i>ri</i>haspati's rules on this head are perfectly in keeping with the teaching of Manu.In the chapter on Sale without Ownership (XIII, 1) he refers to Manu (VIII, 197) by the name of Bh<i>ri</i>gu.</p>  
 <p>Secondly, in a number of other instances, the Code of Manu, though not appealed to by name, is nevertheless<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Indirect references.</font></span> distinctly referred to by B<i>ri</i>haspati. Thus, in the chapter on Inheritance (XXV, 79), he observes that 'those by whom clothes and so forth have been declared impartible have not decided properly.' The well-known versus memorialis concerning impartible property, the contents of which are further discussed in the sequel by B<i>ri</i>haspati, occurs both in the Code of Manu (IX, 219) and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the Vish<i>n</i>u-sm<i>ri</i>ti; and it may be presumed either that the authors of these two works are the authorities referred to by B<i>ri</i>haspati, or that Manu is referred to in the pluralis majestatis, as is often the case with teachers. The reason why Manu is not referred to by name may be sought in the fact that B<i>ri</i>haspati does not care to openly avow his dissent from so eminent an authority.In the chapter on Debts, B<i>ri</i>haspati remarks (XI, 4) that interest is divided into four species by some, into five by others, and by others again into six sorts. Four sorts of interest are mentioned by Manu, VIII, 153.In the chapter on Inheritance (XXV, 35), he declares that an appointed daughter or her son has been pronounced equal to a legitimate son of the body. The rights of an appointed daughter, as shown before, are laid great stress upon by Manu, and he actually states that an (appointed) daughter is equal to a son (IX, 130).</p>  
 <p>Thirdly, B<i>ri</i>haspati, even when not expressly referring to Manu, presupposes throughout an acquaintance with <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Comments on Manu.</font></span>his Code, and a very large portion of his Sm<i>ri</i>ti is devoted to the interpretation of technical terms or to the elucidation or amplification of the somewhat laconic enunciations of Manu. Thus, for example, in the chapter on Debts (XI, 5-11), he explains, comments on, and amplifies the four sorts of interest mentioned by Manu (VIII, 153). In the same chapter (XI, 55-58) he interprets the curious terms used by Manu (VIII, 49) to denote the various modes of recovering an outstanding debt. In the chapter on Sale without Ownership (XIII, 2), he explains the technical term asvâmin, 'another person than the owner,' which had been first used by Manu. From the general maxim of Manu (VIII, 2, 11) that the allotment of shares among partners in any undertaking shall be arranged in the same way as for a company of officiating priests, B<i>ri</i>haspati (XIV, 20-32) has developed a series of elaborate rules regarding partnership in tillage, workmanship, trade, musical performances, and robbery. In the same way, the threefold law of breach of promised obedience, non-payment of wages, and disputes between the owner of cattle and his servants has been</p>  
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>  
 <p>developed by B<i>ri</i>haspati (XVI, 1,2) from Manu's two titles of non-payment of wages and disputes between master and servant. An analogous course of development may be observed in the chapters on Ordeals, Resumption of Gift, and Violation of Agreements, as compared to the scanty provisions of Manu (VIII, 114-116, 212-214, 218-221) on the same subjects. In the chapter on Boundary Disputes, Manu's technical term maula, 'an original inhabitant of a place,' is interpreted by B<i>ri</i>haspati (XIX, 12). It would be easy to multiply examples. One more analogy between the Manu and B<i>ri</i>haspati Sm<i>ri</i>tis seems to be specially deserving of notice. Both agree in arranging the whole field of legal controversies under eighteen heads, and it appears from the introductory verses to several chapters (XII, I; XIII, 1; XV, 1; XVI, 1; XVII, 1, &amp;c.) that B<i>ri</i>haspati was anxious to discuss the eighteen titles of law in the same order as Manu. Nevertheless, he applies an interesting new principle of division to the eighteen titles of law by distinguishing fourteen titles relating to civil law, and four titles relating to criminal law (II, 3-9), and introduces a number of subdivisions (II, 2, 10; XVI, 1-3; XXII, 1, 2).</p>  
 <p>Fourthly, B<i>ri</i>haspati declares emphatically that any Sm<i>ri</i>ti text opposed to the teaching of Manu has no validity (XXVII, 4).</p>  
 <p>Under these circumstances the tradition preserved in the Skanda-purâ<i>n</i>a that there are four versions of the Code of <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Result.</font></span>Manu, by Bh<i>ri</i>gu, Nârada, B<i>ri</i>haspati, and Aṅgiras, acquires a peculiar significance. Taking the version attributed to Bh<i>ri</i>gu to be identical with the Code of Manu, the soi-disant composition of Bh<i>ri</i>gu, it is impossible to doubt its connexion with the Nârada. <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">1</font></a> and B<i>ri</i>haspati Sm<i>ri</i>tis. It is but natural to find, therefore, that Nârada and B<i>ri</i>haspati agree very closely inter se, as e.g. in adding a title called 'Miscellaneous' to Manu's eighteen titles of law (B<i>ri</i>haspati XXVII, 1), in enumerating and describing three sorts of proof, eleven or twelve kinds of witnesses, eight or ten 'members of a lawsuit,' four parts of a judicial proceeding, four sorts of answer in a suit,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a></p>  
 <p>various 'defects of a plaint,' three kinds of officiating priests, four species of gifts, four divisions of violence (sâhasa), five modes of recovery of a debt, &amp;c. Many other analogies between the two works may be gathered from a mere cursory comparison of their contents; they agree particularly in the use of many technical terms. One of these, the designation of a gold coin by the Roman or Greek term dînâra, i.e. denarius (X, 15), is an important test for the date of both works, and compels us to refer the earlier date of the composition of B<i>ri</i>haspati's law-book to the first century A.D., the period to which belong the earliest Indian coins corresponding in weight to the gold denarius of the Romans <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">1</font></a>. As regards the lower limit, one might feel inclined to assign an earlier date to B<i>ri</i>haspati than to Nârada, on the ground of his being a faithful follower of Manu in a far higher degree than is Nârada, who differs from Manu on such important points as the names and order of several titles of law, the legitimacy of the Niyoga, &amp;c. <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">2</font></a> Nevertheless, the enlightened views of B<i>ri</i>haspati on the subject of women's rights <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the advanced character of his teaching generally, render it probable that his learned composition belongs to a somewhat more recent period than the Nârada-sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>  
 <p>The fact that B<i>ri</i>haspati was considered an inspired writer by the very earliest commentators of law-books, such as e.g. by Medhâtithi (ninth century), proves him to have preceded those commentators by several centuries. An analogous result may be obtained by comparing the laws of B<i>ri</i>haspati with the corresponding portions of the Burmese <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Dhammathats.</font></span>Dhammathats, the Buddhist Indian originals of which, according to Dr. Forchhammer, were composed in the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries. The coincidences between B<i>ri</i>haspati and the Dhammathats are both numerous and striking <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">4</font></a>. It may be added that</p>

 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p>the judicial proceeding described in the well-known drama M<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>aka<i>t</i>ika corresponds to the rules laid down by B<i>ri</i>haspati, as has been shown elsewhere. For all these reasons, the composition of the B<i>ri</i>haspati-sm<i>ri</i>ti cannot be referred to a later period than the sixth or seventh century A.D.</p>  
 <p>Hitherto, those texts of B<i>ri</i>haspati have been entirely left aside which relate to other parts of the sacred law than Civil <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Religious texts.</font></span>and Criminal Law and Procedure. Hemâdri's <i>K</i>aturvarga<i>k</i>intâma<i>n</i>i, Devâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>abha<i>t</i><i>t</i>a's Sm<i>ri</i>ti<i>k</i>andrikâ, and most other standard Dharmanibandhas contain a number of texts of B<i>ri</i>haspati on Dâna, Vrata, Prâya<i>s</i><i>k</i>itta, and all other parts of the religious law. However, an examination of these texts has yielded no definite result, and they are not sufficiently numerous by far to admit of reconstructing the purely religious portion of the ancient B<i>ri</i>haspati-sm<i>ri</i>ti from them. Nor is it at all improbable that the legal texts of B<i>ri</i>haspati may have formed an independent work from the outset, just like the Nârada-sm<i>ri</i>ti, or like the Burmese Dhammathats, in which forensic law was treated by itself, without any admixture of religious elements.</p>  
 <p>The legal texts attributed to B<i>ri</i>haspati are so numerous as to make up in their entirety a law-book which contains a <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Arrangement.</font></span>full exposition of forensic law, hardly inferior in size to the Nârada-sm<i>ri</i>ti. The principles on which the texts have been collected and arranged are the same as in the case of the Quotations from Nârada. The preservation of the introductory texts to several titles of law, and the occurrence of many long series of consecutive texts of B<i>ri</i>haspati in the Dharmanibandhas, facilitate considerably the task of arrangement, though the original position of many texts in B<i>ri</i>haspati's Dharma<i>s</i>âstra must needs remain doubtful. For the chapter on Inheritance the following other works have been used, besides those consulted for the Quotations from Nârada: G. Sarkar's translation of the Vîramitrodaya on Inheritance (V.); Dr. Burnell's Mâdhavîya and Varadarâ<i>g</i>a; Professor Baler's edition of the U<i>g</i><i>g</i>valâ of Haradatta; Haradatta's Gautamîyâ Mitâksharâ (MS.); Nandapa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita's Vai<i>g</i>ayantî (MS.).</p>
