 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:2">4:5:3:2</a></font></span>2. Indra then bethought himself, 'How can I stand forth over everything here, and how may everything here be beneath me?' He saw that graha, and drew it for himself. Then he stood forth over everything here, and everything here was</p>  
 <p><a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 399</font></a></p>  
 <p>beneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup of Soma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:3">4:5:3:3</a></font></span>3. Wherefore it has been said by the <i>Ri</i>shi (Rig-veda III, 32, 11), 'The sky hath not reached thy greatness, when thou didst rest on the earth with thine other thigh,'--for, verily, yonder sky did not reach up to his other thigh <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">1</font></a>: so did he stand forth over everything here, and everything here was beneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup of Soma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:4">4:5:3:4</a></font></span>4. He draws it with a verse to the lord of the bay steeds (Indra Harivant); they (the Udgât<i>ri</i>s) chant verses to (Indra) Harivant, and he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) afterwards recites verses to (Indra) Harivant. For Indra seized upon the strength, the fury (haras) of his enemies, the Asuras; and in like manner does he (the sacrificer) now seize upon the strength, the fury of his enemies: therefore he draws the graha with a verse to (Indra) Harivant; they chant verses to Harivant, and he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) afterwards recites verses to Harivant.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:5">4:5:3:5</a></font></span>5. He draws it with an Anush<i>t</i>ubh verse; for the morning press-feast belongs to the Gâyatrî, the midday feast to the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, and the evening feast to the <i>G</i>agatî. The Anush<i>t</i>ubh, then, is over and above <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">2</font></a> (ati-rikta), and he thus makes that (Soma of the</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:6">4:5:3:6</a></font></span>6. He draws it in a square cup; for there are three worlds: these same worlds he gains by three corners, and by the fourth corner he makes that (Soma) to remain over;--therefore he draws it in a square cup.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:7">4:5:3:7</a></font></span>7. Let him draw it at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgraya<i>n</i>a. Having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that time: he thus makes it to outlast all (three) pressings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:8">4:5:3:8</a></font></span>8. Or he may draw it at the midday pressing, after drawing the Âgraya<i>n</i>a,--but this is mere speculation: let him rather draw it at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgraya<i>n</i>a: having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that time.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:9">4:5:3:9</a></font></span>9. He thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 33; Rig-veda I, 84, 3), 'Mount the chariot, O slayer of V<i>ri</i>tra, thy bay steeds have been harnessed by prayer! May the stone by its sound draw hitherward thy mind!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in (the sixteenfold)!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:10">4:5:3:10</a></font></span>10. Or with this (verse, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 34; Rig-veda I, 10, 3), 'Harness thy long-maned, girth-filling bay steeds! Come hither to us, O Indra, drinker of Soma, to hear our songs! Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:3:11">4:5:3:11</a></font></span>11. Thereupon he returns (to the sadas) and bespeaks the chant with, 'Soma has been left over:</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Turn ye back <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' for he indeed causes it to remain over by that (Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in graha). He (the Adhvaryu) bespeaks it <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">2</font></a> before the setting of the sun; and after sunset he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) follows it up by reciting the <i>s</i>astra: thus he thereby joins day and night together,--therefore he bespeaks (the stotra) <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">3</font></a> before the</p>

 <p><a name="fn_928"></a><a href="sbe2662.htm#fr_932">397:2</a> The author has now completed his exposition of the simplest form of Soma-sacrifice, viz. the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, the libations of which are accompanied by twelve chants (stotra) and as many recitations (<i>s</i>astra), and which (on the press-day) requires one victim to Agni (see <a href="sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:14">IV, 2, 5, 14</a>). He has also incidentally (<a href="sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18">IV, 4, 2, 18</a>) touched upon the characteristic features of the Ukthya sacrifice, viz. its second victim, a he-goat to Indra-Agni, and three additional Uktha stotras and <i>s</i>astras (<a href="sbe2657.htm#page_370">p. 370</a> note <a href="sbe2656.htm#fn_856">1</a>). He now proceeds to <a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 398</font></a> consider another libation which, with its accompanying stotra and <i>s</i>astra, forms the distinctive feature of the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in sacrifice, i.e. the one having sixteen or a sixteenth (hymn). This sacrifice also requires a third victim on the press-day, viz. a ram to Indra. By the addition, on the other hand, of the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in graha, with its chant and recitation, to an ordinary Agnish<i>t</i>oma, another form of one day's (ekâha) Soma-sacrifice is obtained, viz. the Atyagnish<i>t</i>oma, or redundant Agnish<i>t</i>oma, with thirteen stotras and <i>s</i>astras. This form of sacrifice is, however, comparatively rarely used, and was probably devised on mere theoretic grounds, to complete the sacrificial system. A somewhat more common form is the Atirâtra, lit. 'that which has a night over and above,' differing as it does from the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in in that--besides a fourth victim (a he-goat to Sarasvatî)--it has in addition a night performance of libations, with three rounds (paryâyas) of four stotras and <i>s</i>astras each (one for the Hot<i>ri</i> and for each of his three assistants), and concluding at daybreak with one more stotra, the sandhi (twilight) stotra, and the A<i>s</i>vina <i>s</i>astra and offering. These are the forms of Soma-sacrifice referred to in the present book, as required for the performance of sacrificial sessions (twelve days and more) of which its concluding portion treats. With another form, the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya sacrifice, the author deals in the next Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a. These--with the Aptoryâma, which to the Atirâtra adds another course of four Atirikta, or superadded stotras--constitute in the later official classification the seven fundamental forms (sa<i>m</i>sthâ) of Soma-sacrifice. This term, meaning properly 'termination, consummation,' probably applied originally to the concluding rites of the Soma-sacrifice proper, as the distinctive features of the several forms of sacrifice, but by a natural transition, became the generic terms for the complete forms of sacrifice. See Professor Weber's somewhat different explanation, Ind. Stud. IX, 229.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_930"></a><a href="sbe2662.htm#fr_934">399:2</a> Or, additional, in excess; see <a href="sbe2657.htm#4:4:3:4">IV, 4, 3, 4</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_931"></a><a href="sbe2662.htm#fr_935">401:1</a> See <a href="sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:8">IV, 2, 5, 8</a>. The verb, here and elsewhere translated by 'to bespeak,' is upâ-k<i>ri</i>, the proper meaning of which would seem 'to be to prepare, to introduce, to bring up' the chant. As the same verb is, however, also used for the 'driving up, or bringing up' of cattle (to the stable), it may perhaps have a similar meaning in connection with the stotra; the metres of the chant (which are often called the cattle of the gods) being, as it were, 'led up' (or put to') by the Adhvaryu, to be 'harnessed' or 'yoked' (yu<i>g</i>) by the Udgât<i>ri</i>; see <a href="sbe2649.htm#page_311">p. 311</a>, note <a href="sbe2649.htm#fn_748">1</a>. Instead of the Prastara, handed to the Udgât<i>ri</i> on the occasion of the Pavamânas, two stalks of sacrificial grass are generally used with other chants; but certain stotras and sâmans require to be 'introduced' by special objects, such as a fan, or the two churning sticks (for producing fire), or water mixed with avakâ plants, or an arrow.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_932"></a><a href="sbe2662.htm#fr_936">401:2</a> ? Read 'tad' for 'tam;' or 'he calls upon him (the Udgât<i>ri</i>).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_933"></a><a href="sbe2662.htm#fr_937">401:3</a> The Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>i-stotra usually consists of the Gaurivita Sâman (S. V. II, 302-4); but the Nânada Sâman (ib. II, 790-3) may be used instead. It is performed in the ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a stoma, i.e. the three verses are chanted in three turns, so as, by repetitions, to produce twenty-one verses; the usual form being a a a-b b b-c; a-b b b-c c c; a a a-b-c c c. For some modifications in the present case, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 258 note. The first turn is to be performed in a low voice, while the sun is going down; the second in a middle voice, when the sun has disappeared, but not entirely the daylight; and the third turn in a loud voice, when darkness is closing in. If, for some reason or other, the stotra is entirely performed after sunset, it is chanted with a loud voice throughout. During the chanting a horse (black, if possible), or a bullock, or he-goat is to stand at the front (or back) gate of the sadas, facing the latter. Besides, a piece of gold is to circulate among the chanters, each of them holding it, while his turn of chanting lasts, and the Udgât<i>ri</i> (or all three) doing so during the nidhana or finale.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_934"></a><a href="sbe2662.htm#fr_938">402:1</a> The Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>i-<i>s</i>astra is minutely described in the Ait. Br. IV, 3 seq. The opening verses are in the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre (of sixteen syllables), but otherwise also the Hot<i>ri</i> has by means of pauses and insertions of formulas (nivid) to bring out its 'sixteenfold' character so as to accord with its designation.</p>
