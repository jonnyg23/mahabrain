 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:1">4:3:5:1</a></font></span>1. Now there are three kinds of gods,--the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Âdityas. Between them the press-feasts are divided: the morning pressing belongs to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third pressing to the Âdityas. But the morning pressing belonged to the Vasus exclusively, and the midday pressing to the Rudras exclusively, and the third pressing to the Âdityas conjointly (with others).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:2">4:3:5:2</a></font></span>2. The Âdityas then said, 'As that morning pressing belongs exclusively to the Vasus, and that midday pressing exclusively to the Rudras, so offer ye now to us a libation before the common (pressing).' The gods said, 'So be it!' After the completion of the midday pressing, they offered that (libation) previous to the third pressing <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And in like manner is that libation offered to this day after the completion of the midday pressing and previous to the third pressing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:3">4:3:5:3</a></font></span>3. The Âdityas said, 'Neither in the one pressing have we a share nor in the other: we fear lest the Rakshas might injure us!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:4">4:3:5:4</a></font></span>4. They said to the (cups) belonging to two deities (dvidevatya <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">2</font></a>), 'We are afraid of the Rakshas: pray, let us enter into you!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:5">4:3:5:5</a></font></span>5. The Dvidevatyas said, 'What will be our reward then?'--'By us ye shall be supplied with the Anuvasha<i>t</i> <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">1</font></a>!', said the Âdityas.--'So be it!'--They entered into the dvidevatya cups.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:6">4:3:5:6</a></font></span>6. Hence, when at the morning pressing he (the Adhvaryu) proceeds with the dvidevatya cups, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> draws Soma juice from the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a into the Âditya vessel, with this much (of the formula, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, I), 'Thou art taken with a support!' The Adhvaryu calls for the (Agnîdh's) <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, and after the Adhvaryu's libation the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> pours (his juice into the fire), and with this much 'Thee to the Âdityas!' he pours the remains (into the Âditya-sthâlî). In the same way at all (three dvidevatya libations).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:7">4:3:5:7</a></font></span>7. Thus, the reason why the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> draws the Soma-juice, is that they entered into the dvidevatya cups. And the Âdityas then said, 'By us ye shall be supplied with the Anuvasha<i>t</i>!' For, that second libation which he (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) makes, he makes to (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, and by means of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t these (dvidevatyas) are supplied with the Anuvasha<i>t</i>; and thus those (libations) of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a></p>  
 <p>his are supplied with the Anuvasha<i>t</i>, having the (oblation to Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t performed for them. He offers on the north part (of the fire), for that is the region of that god <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">1</font></a>: hence he offers on the north part.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:8">4:3:5:8</a></font></span>8. And again, why the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> draws the Soma. They entered into the Dvidevatyas; and from those which they entered he thereby draws them out. He then covers it <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">2</font></a>--for they were afraid of the Rakshas--with 'O Vish<i>n</i>u, Far-strider, here is thy Soma, protect it lest they should injure it!' For Vish<i>n</i>u is the sacrifice: to the sacrifice he thus makes it over for protection. Now, after the completion of the midday Soma feast and before the evening feast he says, 'Come hither, Sacrificer!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:9">4:3:5:9</a></font></span>9. They enter (the Havirdhâna) together,--the Adhvaryu, Sacrificer, Âgnîdhra, Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, Unnet<i>ri</i>, and whatever other attendant (of the Adhvaryu) there is <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">3</font></a>. They close both doors,--for they (the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He (the Adhvaryu) takes up the Âditya-sthâlî and Âditya-pâtra, and holds them close over the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t, 'lest (any Soma juice) should be spilt.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:10">4:3:5:10</a></font></span>10. He then draws (the juice from the sthâlî into the pâtra) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 2; Rig-veda VIII, 51, 7), 'At no time art thou barren, and never failest thou the worshipper, O Indra; but</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a></p>  
 <p>more and ever more is thy divine gift increased, O mighty lord!--Thee to the Âdityas!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:11">4:3:5:11</a></font></span>11. Let him not draw it with a 'support'--for it was originally drawn with a support--to avoid a repetition (of sacrificial performance); but were he now also to draw it with a support, he would certainly commit a repetition.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:12">4:3:5:12</a></font></span>12. Having withdrawn (the cup for a moment from the flowing juice), he again pours it in with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 3; Rig-veda VIII, 52, 7), 'At no time art thou heedless, but watchest over both generations; the Soma feast <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">1</font></a> is thy strength, O fourth Âditya: the ambrosia is ready for thee in the heavens!--Thee to the Âdityas!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:13">4:3:5:13</a></font></span>13. Thereupon he takes sour milk; for the evening pressing belongs to the Âdityas, and cattle are after (the manner of) the Âdityas <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thereby puts milk into the cattle, and thus that milk in cattle is beneficial <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 'He should put it right in the centre (of the Âditya cup),' they say, 'for that milk is right in the centre of cattle.' But let him rather put it in the back part (of the cup), for that milk is in the hind part of cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:14">4:3:5:14</a></font></span>14. And the reason why he takes sour milk is that those remains (of Soma) poured together are the leavings of offerings, and insufficient for an oblation: he now increases those (remains), and thus they</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a></p>  
 <p>become sufficient for an oblation. This is why he takes sour milk.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:15">4:3:5:15</a></font></span>15. He takes it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 4; Rig-veda I, 107, I), 'The sacrifice draweth nigh to the glory of the gods: be ye merciful, O Âdityas! Let your favour incline unto us, that it may set us free from all trouble!--Thee to the Âdityas!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:16">4:3:5:16</a></font></span>16. He mixes it by means of the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>usavana stone <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">1</font></a>. For, indeed, that Âditya Vivasvat (the sun) is really the same as the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>usavana, and this is the Âditya libation: thus he makes him delight in his own share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:17">4:3:5:17</a></font></span>17. He touches it neither with the fringe nor with (the woven part of) the straining-cloth; for those two pressings, the morning pressing and midday pressing, forsooth are rich in pure Soma, rich in juice, but this, the third pressing, is emptied of its pure Soma. Now, in that he does not touch it either with the fringe or the straining-cloth, thereby that third pressing of his also becomes rich in pure Soma and juice: therefore he touches it neither with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:18">4:3:5:18</a></font></span>18. He mixes it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 5), 'O Âditya Vivasvat, this is thy draught of Soma: feast thou upon it!' Thereupon he hands the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>usavana to the Unnet<i>ri</i>. Then he says to the Unnet<i>ri</i>, 'Drop in the pressing-stones!' He drops them either into the Âdhavanîya or into a cup <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:19">4:3:5:19</a></font></span>19. After drawing the king (Soma)--the third press-feast belonging to the Âdityas, and the pressing-stones being after (the manner of <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">1</font></a>) the Âdityas, he thus makes them delight in their own share--they open the doors.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:20">4:3:5:20</a></font></span>20. He now walks out, covering (the cup with his hand or the sthâlî); for they (the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He then says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Âdityas!' If he likes, he may now enumerate (their qualities); but let him rather enumerate them, after he has called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>,--'Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the offering prayer) to the Âdityas, the beloved, rite-loving, law-loving lords of the great abode, the rulers of the wide air.' He offers, as the Vasha<i>t</i> is pronounced. He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces no Anuvasha<i>t</i>, lest he should consign the cattle to the fire. The remains (of juice in the sthâlî and graha) he (the Adhvaryu) hands to the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:21">4:3:5:21</a></font></span>21. Thereupon he again enters (the Havirdhâna) and draws the Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">2</font></a>. They spread (over the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t) a straining-cloth with the fringe towards the north. The Adhvaryu pours out (the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 356</font></a></p>  
 <p>juice) of the Âgraya<i>n</i>a; the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> holds out (and pours in) the two residues (of the Âditya graha <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">1</font></a>); the Unnet<i>ri</i> adds thereto (some juice from the Âdhavanîya) by means of a <i>k</i>amasa cup or a dipping-vessel (uda<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ana).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:22">4:3:5:22</a></font></span>22. Thus he draws the Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha from four streams; for the evening pressing belongs to the .Âdityas, and cows are after the manner of the Âdityas; whence this milk of cows is of a fourfold nature: therefore he draws the Âgraya<i>n</i>a from four streams <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:23">4:3:5:23</a></font></span>23. And as to why the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> holds out the two residues: this is (the remains of) the Âditya libation, and for the Âditya libation he pronounces no Anuvasha<i>t</i>; and from that (Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha) he intends to draw the Sâvitra graha,--so that the Anuvasha<i>t</i> is performed for it by means of the Sâvitra graha.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:5:24">4:3:5:24</a></font></span>24. And again why the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> holds out the two residues. Previous to that mixed (press-feast), previous to the evening feast, they have offered that (unmixed or special) libation to those (Âdityas); but this libation is taken for the evening feast: thereby the Âdityas take part in the evening feast, and thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice. This is why the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> holds out the two residues <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_817"></a><a href="sbe2654.htm#fr_820">350:1</a> The Âditya-graha, with which the succeeding paragraphs deal, is considered as not belonging to the T<i>ri</i>tîya Savana proper, but as a preliminary ceremony.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_819"></a><a href="sbe2654.htm#fr_822">351:1</a> At the three dvidevatya libations no Anuvasha<i>t</i>kâra is permitted; that is to say, the Hot<i>ri</i> is not to pronounce the words, 'O Agni, accept of the Soma!' after the Vasha<i>t</i>, with which the offering prayer (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) concludes. But as the libation, ordinarily made at the Anuvasha<i>t</i>, corresponds to the oblation to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t made after each chief oblation at the havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (see I, 7,3; Ait. Br. III, 5), there is apparently no such Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t oblation at the dvidevatya libations. Now, as each of these chief libations, made by the Adhvaryu, is followed by one made by the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> from the Âditya vessel (see <a href="sbe2649.htm#page_316">p. 316</a>, note <a href="sbe2650.htm#fn_763">1</a>), these latter libations are here, as it were, identified with the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t and the Anuvasha<i>t</i>kâra.</p>
