MADE pure by this man's urgent zeal and impulse the God hath to the Gods his juice imparted.<br> He goes, effused and singing, to the filter, like priest to measured seats supplied with cattle.<br> 2 Robed in fair raiment meet to wear in battle, a mighty Sage pronouncing invocations.<br> Roll onward to the beakers as they cleanse thee, far-seeing at the feast of Gods, and watchful.<br> 3 Dear, he is brightened on the fleecy summit, a Prince among us, nobler than the noble.<br> Roar out as thou art purified, run forward. Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.<br> 4 Let us sing praises to the Gods: sing loudly, send ye the Soma forth for mighty riches.<br> Let him flow, sweetly-flavoured, through the filter, and let our pious one rest in the pitcher.<br> 5 Winning the friendship of the Deities, Indu flows in a thousand streams to make them joyful.<br> Praised by the men after the ancient statute, he hath come nigh, for our great bliss, to Indra.<br> 6 Flow, Gold-hued, cleansing thee, to enrich the singer: let thy juice go to Indra to support him.<br> Come nigh, together with the Gods, for bounty. Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.<br> 7 The God declares the Deities' generations, like Uśanā, proclaiming lofty wisdom.<br> With brilliant kin, far-ruling, sanctifying, the Boar advances, singing, to the places.<br> 8 The Swans, the Vrsaganas from anear us have brought their restless spirit to our dwelling.<br> Friends come to Pavamana meet for praises, and sound in concert their resistless music.<br> 9 He follows the Wide-strider's rapid movement: cows low, as twere, to him who sports at pleasure.<br> He with the sharpened horns brings forth abundance: the Silvery shines by night, by day the Golden.<br> 10 Strong Indu, bathed in milk, flows on for Indra, Soma exciting strength, to make him joyful.<br> He quells malignities and slays the demons, the King of mighty power who brings us comfort.<br> 11 Then in a stream he flows, milked out with press-stones, mingled with sweetness, through the fleecy filter-<br> Indu rejoicing in the love of Indra, the God who gladdens, for the God's enjoyment.<br> 12 As he is purified he pours out treasures, a God bedewing Gods with his own juices.<br> Indu hath, wearing qualities by seasons, on the raised fleece engaged, the ten swift fingers.<br> 13 The Red Bull bellowing to the kine advances, causing the heavens and earth to roar and tbunder.<br> Well is he beard like Indra's shout in battle: letting this voice be known he hastens hither.<br> 14 Swelling with milk, abounding in sweet flavours, urging the meath-rich plant thou goest onward.<br> Raising a shout thou flowest as they cleanse thee, when thou, O Soma, art effused for Indra.<br> 15 So flow thou on inspiriting, for rapture, aiming deatb-shafts at him who stays the waters,<br> Flow to us wearing thy resplendent colour, effused and eager for the kine, O Soma.<br> 16 Pleased with us, Indu, send us as thou flowest good easy paths in ample space and comforts.<br> Dispelling, as twere with a club, misfortunes, run oer the height, run oer the fleecy summit.<br> 17 Pour on us rain celestial, quickly streaming, refreshing, fraught with health and ready bounty.<br> Flow, Indu, send these Winds thy lower kinsmen, setting them free like locks of hair unbraided.<br> 18 Part, like a knotted tangle, while they cleanse thee, O Soma, righteous and unrighteous conduct.<br> Neigh like a tawny courser who is loosened, come like a youth, O God, a house-possessor.<br> 19 For the God's service, for delight, O Indu, run oer the height, run o'ver the fleecy summit.<br> With thousand streams, inviolate, sweet-scented, flow on for gain of strength that conquers heroes.<br> 20 Without a car, without a rein to guide them, unyoked, like coursers started in the contest,<br> These brilliant drops of Soma juice run forward. Do ye, O Deities, come nigh to drink them.<br> 21 So for our banquet of the Gods, O Indu, pour down the rain of heaven into the vessels.<br> May Soma grant us riches sought with longing, mighty, exceeding strong, with store of heroes.<br> 22 What time the loving spirit's word had formed him Chief of all food, by statute of the Highest,<br> Then loudly lowing came the cows to Indu, the chosen, well-loved Master in the beaker.<br> 23 The Sage, Celestial, liberal, raining bounties, pours as he flows the Genuine for the Truthful.<br> The King shall be effectual strength's upholder: he by the ten bright reins is mostly guided.<br> 24 He who beholds mankind, made pure with filters, the King supreme of Deities and mortals,<br> From days of old is Treasure-Lord of riches: he, Indu, cherishes fair well-kept Order.<br> 25 Haste, like a steed, to vittory for glory, to Indra's and to Vāyu's entertainment.<br> Give us food ample, thousandfold: be, Soma, the finder-out of riches when they cleanse thee.<br> 26 Effused by us let God-delighting Somas bring as they flow a home with noble heroes.<br> Rich in all boons like priests acquiring favour, the worshippers of heaven, the best of Cheerers.<br> 27 So, God, for service of the Gods flow onward, flow, drink of Gods, for ample food, O Soma.<br> For we go forth to war against the mighty make heaven and earth well stablished by thy cleansing.<br> 28 Thou, yoked by strong men, neighest like a courser, swifter than thought is, like an awful lion.<br> By paths directed hitherward, the straightest, send thou us happiness, Indu, while they cleanse thee.<br> 29 Sprung from the Gods, a hundred streams, a thousand, have been effused: sages prepare and purge them.<br> Bring us from heaven the means of winnning, Indu; thou art-forerunnner of abundant riches.<br> 30 The streams of days, were poured as twere from heaven: the wise King doth not treat his friend unkindly.<br> Like a son following his father's wishes, grant to this family success and safety.<br> 31 Now are thy streams poured forth with all their sweetness, when, purified. thou goest through the filter.<br> The race of kine is thy gift, Pavarridna: when born thou madest Sūrya rich with brightness.<br> 32 Bright, bellowing aiong the path of Order, thou shinest as the form of life eternal.<br> Thou flowest on as gladdening drink for Indra, sending thy voice out with the hymns of sages.<br> 33 Pouring out streams at the Gods feast with service, thou, Soma, lookest down, a heavenly Eagle.<br> Enter the Soma-holding beaker, Indu, and with a roar approach the ray of Sarya.<br> 34 Three are the voices that the Courser utters: he speaks the thought of prayer, the law of Order.<br> To the Cow's Master come the Cows inquiring: the hymns with eager longing come to Soma.<br> 35 To Soma come the Cows, the Milch-kine longing, to Soma sages with their hvmns inquiring.<br> Soma, effused, is purified and blended our hymns and Tṛṣṭup songs unite in Soma.<br> 36 Thus, Soma, as we pour thee into vessels, while thou art purified flow for our welfare.<br> Pass into Indra with a mighty roaring make the voice swell, and generate abundance.<br> 37 Singer of true songs, ever-watchful, Soma hath settled in the ladles when they cleanse him.<br> Him the Adhvaryus, paired and eager, follow, leaders of sacrifice and skilful-handed.<br> 38 Cleansed near the Sun as twere he as Creator hath filled full heaven and earth, and hath disclosed them.<br> He by whose dear help men gain all their wishes shall yield the precious meed as to a victor.<br> 39 He, being cleansed, the Strengthener and Increaser, Soma the Bounteous, helped us with his lustre,<br> Wherewith our sires of old who knew the footsteps found light and stole the cattle from the mountain.<br> 40 In the first vault of heaven loud roared the Ocean, King of all being, generating creatures.<br> Steer, in the filter, on the fleecy summit, Soma, the Drop effused, hath waxen mighty.<br> 41 Soma the Steer, in that as Child of Waters he chose the Gods, performed that great achievement.<br> He, Pavamana, granted strength to Indra; he, Indu, generated light in Sūrya.<br> 42 Make Vāyu glad,, for furtherance and bounty: cheer Varuṇa and Mitra, as they cleanse thee.<br> Gladden the Gods, gladden the host of Maruts: make Heaven and Earth rejoice, O God, O Soma.<br> 43 Flow onward righteous slayer of the wicked, driving away our enemies and sickness,<br> Blending thy milk with milk which cows afford us.
