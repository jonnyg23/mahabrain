 <p>1. O VARUNA and Mitra, Sūrya spreading the beauteous light of you Twain Gods ariseth.<br> He who beholdetb all existing creatures observetb well the zeal that is in mortals.<br> 2 The holy sage, renowned afar, directeth his hymns to you, O Varuṇa and Mitra,<br> He whose devotions, sapient Gods, ye favour so that ye fill, as twere, with power his autumns.<br> 3 From the wide earth, O Varuṇa and Mitra from the great lofty heaven, ye, Bounteous Givers, -<br> Have in the fields and houses set your warder-, who visit every spot and watch unceasing.<br> 4 I praise the strength of Varuṇa and Mitra that strength, by mightiness, keeps both worlds asunder.<br> Heroless pass the months of the ungodly he who loves sacrifice makes his home enduring.<br> 5 Steers, all infallible are these your people in whom no wondrous thing is seen, no worship.<br> Guile follows close the men who are untruthful: no secrets may be hidden from your knowledge.<br> 6 I will exalt your sacrifice with homage: as priest, I, Mitra-Varuṇa, invoke you.<br> May these new hymns and prayers that I have fashioned delight you to the profit of the singer.<br> 7 This priestly task, Gods! Varuṇa and Mitra! hath been performed for you at sacrifices.<br> Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
