 <p>1. WHAT time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding from the sea or upper waters,<br> Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed, thy birth is nigh and must be lauded.<br> 2 This Steed which Yama gave hath Trita harnessed, and him, the first of all, hath Indra mounted.<br> His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the Sun ye fashioned forth the Courser.<br> 3 Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Āditya; Trita art thou by secret operation.<br> Thou art divided thoroughly from Soma. They say thou hast three bonds in heaven<br> that hold thee.<br> 4 Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven that bind thee, three in the waters,<br> three within the ocean.<br> To me thou seemest Varuṇa, O Courser, there where they say is thy sublimest birth-place.<br> 5 Here-, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee, here are the traces of thy hoofs as winner.<br> Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which those who guard the holy Law keep safely.<br> 6 Thyself from far I recognized in spirit,a Bird that from below flew through the heaven.<br> I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled by dust, pleasant to travel.<br> 7 Here I beheld thy form, matchless in glory, eager to win thee food at the Cow's station.<br> Wheneer a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou swallowest the plants most greedy eater.<br> 8 After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine come after, and the charm of maidens.<br> Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern of thy vigour Gods have copied.<br> 9 Horns made of gold hath he: his feet are iron: less fleet than he, though swift as thought, is Indra.<br> The Gods have come that they may taste the oblation of him who mounted, first of all, the Courser.<br> 10 Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like heroes, the Celestial Coursers<br> Put forth their strength, like swans in lengthened order, when they, the Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.<br> 11 A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the wind in motion is thy spirit.<br> Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions: they move with restless beat in wildernesses.<br> 12 The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward.<br> The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after.<br> 13 The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother.<br> This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.</p>
