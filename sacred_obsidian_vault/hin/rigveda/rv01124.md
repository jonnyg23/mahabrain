 <p>1. THE Dawn refulgent when the fire is kindled, and the Sun rising, far diffuse their brightness.<br> Savitar, God, hath sent us forth to labour, each quadruped, each biped, to be active.<br> 2 Not interrupting heavenly ordinances, although she minisheth human generations.<br> The last of endless morns that have departed, the first of those that come, Dawn brightly shineth.<br> 3 There in the eastern region she, Heaven's Daughter, arrayed in garments all of light, appeareth.<br> Truly she followeth the path of Order, nor faileth, knowing well, the heavenly quarters.<br> 4 Near is she seen, as twere the Bright One's bosom: she showeth sweet things like a new song-singer.<br> She cometh like a fly awaking sleepers, of all returning dames most true and constant.<br> 5 There in the east half of the watery region the Mother of the Cows hath shown her ensign.<br> Wider and wider still she spreadeth onward, and filleth full the laps of both heir Parents.<br> 6 She, verily, exceeding vast to look on debarreth from her light nor kin nor stranger.<br> Proud of her spotless form she, brightly shining, turneth not from the high nor from the humble.<br> 7 She seeketh men, as she who hath no brother, mounting her car, as twere to gather riches.<br> Dawn, like a loving matron for her husband, smiling and well attired, unmasks her beauty.<br> 8 The Sister quitteth, for the elder Sister, her place, and having looked on her departeth.<br> She decks her beauty, shining forth with sunbeams, like women trooping to the festal meeting.<br> 9 To all these Sisters who ere now have vanished a later one each day in course succeedeth.<br> So, like the past, with days of happy fortune, may the new Dawns shine forth on us with riches.<br> 10 Rouse up, O Wealthy One, the liberal givers; let niggard traffickers sleep on unwakened:<br> Shine richly, Wealthy One, on those who worship, richly, glad.<br> Dawn while wasting, on the singer.<br> 11 This young Maid from the east hath shone upon us; she harnesseth her team of bright red oxen.<br> She will beam forth, the light will hasten hither, and Agni will be present in each dwelling.<br> 12 As the birds fly forth from their resting places, so men with store of food rise at thy dawning.<br> Yea, to the liberal mortal who remaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much good thou bringest.<br> 13 Praised through my prayer be ye who should be lauded. Ye have increased our wealth, ye Dawns who love us.<br> Goddesses, may we win by your good favour wealth to be told by hundreds and by thousands.</p>
