 <p>1. WISELY have I enjoyed the savoury viand, religious-thoughted, best to find out treasure,<br> The food to which all Deities and mortals, calling it meath, gather themselves together.<br> 2 Tlou shalt be Aditi as thou hast entered within, appeaser of celestial anger.<br> Indu, enjoying Indra's friendship, bring usas a swift steed the carforward to riches.<br> 3 We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light, the Gods discovered.<br> Now what may foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal man's deception?<br> 4 Absorbed into the heart, be sweet, O Indu, as a kind father to his son, O Soma,<br> As a wise Friend to friend: do thou, wide-ruler, O Soma, lengthen out our days for living.<br> 5 These glorious drops that give me freedom have I drunk. Closely they knit my joints as straps secure a car.<br> Let them protect my foot from slipping on the way: yea, let the drops I drink preserve me from disease.<br> 6 Make me shine bright like fire produced by friction: give us a clearer sight and make us better.<br> For in carouse I think of thee, O Soma, Shall I, as a rich man, attain to comfort?<br> 7 May we enjoy with an enlivened spirit the juice thou givest, like ancestral riches.<br> O Soma, King, prolong thou our existence as Sūrya makes the shining days grow longer.<br> 8 King Soma, favour us and make us prosper: we are thy devotees; of this be mindful.<br> Spirit and power are fresh in us, O Indu give us not up unto our foeman's pleasure.<br> 9 For thou hast settled in each joint, O Soma, aim of men's eyes and guardian of our bodies.<br> When we offend against thine holy statutes, as a kind Friend, God, best of all, be gracious.<br> 10 May I be with the Friend whose heart is tender, who, Lord of Bays! when quaffed will never harm me-<br> This Soma now deposited within me. For this, I pray for longer life to Indra.<br> 11 Our maladies have lost their strength and vanished: they feared, and passed away into the darkness.<br> Soma hath risen in us, exceeding mighty, and we are come where men prolong existence.<br> 12, Fathers, that Indu which our hearts have drunken, Immortal in himself, hath entered mortals.<br> So let us serve this Soma with oblation, and rest securely in his grace and favour.<br> 13 Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself abroad through earth and heaven.<br> So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become the lords of riches,<br> 14 Give us your blessing, O ye Gods preservers. Never may sleep or idle talk control us.<br> But evermore may we, as friends of Soma, speak to the synod with brave sons around us.<br> 15 On all sides,. Soma, thou art our life-giver: aim of all eyes, light-finder, come within us.<br> Indu, of one accord with thy protections both from behind and from before preserve us.</p>
