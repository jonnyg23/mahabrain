 <p>1. FAR is that secret name by which, in terror, the worlds invoked thee and thou gavest vigour<br> The earth and heaven thou settest near each other, and Maghavan, madest bright thy Brother's Children.<br> 2 Great is that secret name and far-extending, whereby thou madest all that is and shall be.<br> The Five Tribes whom he loveth well have entered the light he loveth that was made aforetime.<br> 3 He filled the heaven and earth and all between them, Gods five times sevenfold in their proper seasons.<br> With four-and-thirty lights he looks around him, lights of one colour though their ways are divers.<br> 4 As first among the lights, O Dawn, thou shonest, whereby thou broughtest forth the Stay of Increase,<br> Great art thou, matchless is thine Asura nature, who, high above, art kin to those beneath thee.<br> 5 The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his circling course with many round him.<br> Behold the Gods high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day is living.<br> 6 Strong is the Red Bird in his strength, great Hero, who from of old hath had no nest to dwell in.<br> That which he knows is truth and never idle: he wins and gives the wealth desired of many.<br> 7 Through these the Thunderer gained strong manly vigour, through whom he waxed in power to smite down Vṛtra,<br> Who through the might of Indra's operation came forth as Gods in course of Law and Order.<br> 8 All-strong, performing works with his companion, All-marking, rapid Victor, Curse-averter,<br> The Hero, waxing, after draughts of Soma, blew far from heaven the Dasyus with his weapon.</p>
