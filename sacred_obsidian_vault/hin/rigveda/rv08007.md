 <p>1. O MARUTS, when the sage hath poured the Tṛṣṭup forth as food for you,<br> Ye shine amid the mountain-clouds.<br> 2 When, Bright Ones, fain to show your might ye have determined on your course,<br> The mountain-clouds have bent them down.<br> 3 Loud roaring with the winds the Sons of Pṛśni have upraised themselves:<br> They have poured out the streaming food.<br> 4 The Maruts spread the mist abroad and make mountains rock and reel,<br> When with the winds they go their way<br> 5 What time the rivers and the hills before your coming bowed them down,<br> So to sustain your mighty force.<br> 6 We call on you for aid by night, on you for succour in the day,<br> On you while sacrifice proceeds.<br> 7 These, verily, wondrous, red of hue, speed on their courses with a roar<br> Over the ridges of the sky.<br> 8 With might they drop the loosened rein so that the Sun may run his course,<br> And spread themselves with beams of light.<br> 9 Accept, ye Maruts, this my song, accept ye this mine hymn of praise,<br> Accept, Ṛbhukṣans, this my call.<br> 10 The dappled Cows have poured three lakes, meath for the Thunder-wielding God,<br> From the great cask, the watery cloud.<br> 11 O Maruts, quickly come to us when, longing for felicity,<br> We call you hither from the sky.<br> 12 For, Rudras and Ṛbhukṣans, ye, Most Bountiful, are in the house,<br> Wise when the gladdening draught is drunk.<br> 13 O Maruts, send us down from heaven riches distilling rapturous joy,<br> With plenteous food, sustaining all.<br> 14 When, Bright Ones, hither from the hills ye have resolved to take your way,<br> Ye revel in the drops effused.<br> 15 Man should solicit with his lauds happiness which belongs to them,<br> So great a band invincible.<br> 16 They who like fiery sparks with showers of rain blow through the heaven and earth,<br> Milking the spring that never fails.<br> 17 With chariots and tumultuous roar, with tempests and with hymns of praise<br> The Sons of Pṛśni hurry forth.<br> 18 For wealth, we think of that whereby ye aided Yadu, Turvaśa,<br> And KanVa who obtained the spoil.<br> 19 May these our viands Bounteous Ones I that flow in streams like holy oil,<br> With Kaṇva's hymns, increase your might.<br> 20 Where, Bounteous Lords for whom the grass is trimmed, are ye rejoicing now?<br> What Brahman is adoring you?<br> 21 Is it not there where ye of old, supplied with sacred grass, for lauds<br> Inspired the strong in sacrifice?<br> 22 They brought together both the worlds, the mighty waters, and the Sun,<br> And, joint by joint, the thunderbolt.<br> 23 They sundered Vṛtra limb from limb and split the gloomy mountain-clouds,<br> Performing a heroic deed.<br> 24 They reinforced the power and strength of Trita as he fought, and helped<br> Indra in battle with the foe.<br> 25 They deck themselves for glory, bright, celestial, lightning in their hands,<br> And helms of gold upon their heads.<br> 26 When eagerly ye from far away came to the cavern of the Bull,<br> He bellowed in his fear like Heaven.<br> 27 Borne by your golden-footed steeds, O Gods, come hither to receive<br> The sacrifice we offer you.<br> 28 When the red leader draws along their spotted deer yoked to the car.<br> The Bright Ones come, and shed the rain.<br> 29 Susoma, Saryakiavan, and Arjika full of homes, have they.<br> These Heroes, sought with downward car.<br> 30 When, Maruts, ye come to him, the singer who invokes you thus,<br> With favours to your suppliant?<br> 31 What now? where have ye still a friend since ye left Indra all alone?<br> Who counteth on your friendship now?<br> 32 The Kaṇvas sing forth Agni's praise together with our Maruts who<br> Wield thunder and wear swords of gold.<br> 33 Hither for new felicity may I attract the Impetuous Ones,<br> The Heroes with their wondrous strength<br> 34 Before them sink the very hills deerning themseives abysses: yea,<br> Even the mountains bend them down.<br> 35 Steeds flying on their tortuous path through mid-air carry them, and give<br> The man who lauds them strength and life.<br> 36 Agni was born the first of all, like Sūrya lovely with his light:<br> With lustre these have spread abroad.</p>
