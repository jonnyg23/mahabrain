 <p>1. THE drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One,<br> And, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering robe wherewith the udders stream.<br> 2 He bellows with a roar arourd the highest twigs: the Tawny One is sweetened as he breaks them up.<br> Then passing through the sieve into the ample room, the God throws off the dregs according to his wish.<br> 3 The gladdening drink that measured out the meeting Twins fills full with milk the Eternal Ever-waxing Pair.<br> Bringing to light the Two great Regions limitless, moving above them he gained sheen that never fades.<br> 4 Wandering through, the Parents, strengthening the floods, the Sage makes his place swell with his own native might.<br> The stalk is mixed with grain: he comes led by the men together with the sisters, and preserves the Head.<br> 5 With energetic intellect the Sage is born, deposited as germ of Law, far from the Twins.<br> They being young at first showed visibly distinct the Creature that is half-concealed and half-exposed.<br> 6 The sages knew the form of him the Gladdener, what time the Falcon brought the plant from far away.<br> Him who assures success they beautified in streams, the stalk who yearned therefor, mighty and meet for praise.<br> 7 Together with the Ṛṣis, with their prayers and hymns ten women deck thee, Soma, friendly when effused.<br> Led by the men, with invocations of the Gods, through the fleece, thou hast given us strength to win the spoil.<br> 8 Songs resonant with praise have celebrated him. Soma, Friend, springing forth with his fair company.<br> Even him who rich in meath, with undulating stream, Winnner of Wealth, Immortal, sends his voice from heaven,<br> 9 He sends it into all the region forth from heaven. Soma, while he is filtcred, settles in the jars.<br> With milk and waters is he decked when pressed with stones: Indu, when purified, shall find sweet rest and room.<br> 10 Even thus poured forth How on thy way, O Soma, vouchsafing us most manifold lively vigour.<br> We will invoke benevolent Earth and Heaven. Give us, ye Gods, riches with noble heroes.</p>
