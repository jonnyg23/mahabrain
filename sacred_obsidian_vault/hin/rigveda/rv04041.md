 <p>1. WHAT laud, O Indra-Varuṇa, with oblation, hath like the Immortal Priest obtained your favour?<br> Hath our effectual laud, addressed with homage, touched you, O Indra-Varuṇa, in spirit?<br> 2 He who with dainty food hath won you, Indra and Varuṇa, Gods, as his allies to friendship,<br> Slayeth the Vṛtras and his foes in battles, and through your mighty favours is made famous.<br> 3 Indra and Varuṇa are most liberal givers of treasure to the men who toil to serve them,<br> When they, as Friends inclined to friendship, honoured with dainty food, delight in flowing Soma.<br> 4 Indra and Varuṇa, ye hurl, O Mighty, on him your strongest flashing bolt of thunder<br> Who treats us ill, the robber and oppressor: measure on him your overwhelming vigour.<br> 5 O Indra-Varuṇa, be ye the lovers of this my song, as steers who love the milch-Cow.<br> Milk may it yield us as, gone forth to pasture, the great Cow pouring out her thousand rivers.<br> 6 For fertile fields, for worthy sons and grandsons, for the Sun's beauty and for steer-like vigour,<br> May Indra-Varuṇa with gracious favours work marvels for us in the stress of battle.<br> 7 For you, as Princes, for your ancient kindness, good comrades of the man who seeks for booty,<br> We choose to us for the dear bond of friendship, most liberal Heroes bringing bliss like parents.<br> 8 Showing their strength, these hymns for grace, Free-givers I have gone to you, devoted, as to battle.<br> For glory have they gone, as milk to Soma, to Indra-Varuṇa my thoughts and praises.<br> 9 To Indra and to Varuṇa, desirous of gaining wealth have these my thoughts proceeded.<br> They have come nigh to you as treasure-lovers, like mares, fleet-footed, eager for the glory.<br> 10 May we ourselves be lords of during riches, of ample sustenance for car and hones.<br> So may the Twain who work with newest succours bring yoked teams hitherward to us and riches.<br> 11 Come with your mighty succours, O ye Mighty; come, Indra-Varuṇa, to us in battle.<br> What time the flashing arrows play in combat, may we through you be winners in the contest.</p>
