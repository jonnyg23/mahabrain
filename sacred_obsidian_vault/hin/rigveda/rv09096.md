 <p>1. IN forefront of the cars forth goes the Hero, the Leader, winning spoil: his host rejoices.<br> Soma endues his robes of lasting colours, and blesses, for his friends, their calls on Indra.<br> 2 Men decked with gold adorn his golden tendril, incessantly with steed-impelling homage.<br> The Friend of Indra mounts his car well-knowing, he comes thereon to meet the prayer we offer.<br> 3 O God, for service of the Gods flow onward, for food sublime, as Indra's drink, O Soma.<br> Making the floods, bedewing earth and heaven, come from the vast, comfort us while we cleanse thee<br> 4 Flow for prosperity and constant Vigour, flow on for happiness and high perfection.<br> This is the wish of these friends assembled: this is my wish, O Soma Pavamana.<br> 5 Father of holy hymns, Soma flows onward the Father of the earth, Father of heaven:<br> Father of Agni, Sūrya's generator, the Father who begat Indra and Viṣṇu.<br> 6 Brahman of Gods, the Leader of the poets, Ṛṣi of sages, Bull of savage creatures,<br> Falcon amid the vultures, Axe of forests, over the cleansing sieve goes Soma singing.<br> 7 He, Soma Pavamana, like a river, hath stirred the wave of voice, our songs and praises.<br> Beholding these inferior powers in cattle, he rests among them as a Steer well-knowing.<br> 8 As Gladdener, Warrior never harmed in battle, with thousand genial streams, pour strength and vigour.<br> As thoughtful Pavamana, urge O Indu, speeding the kine, the plant's wave on to Indra.<br> 9 Dear, grateful to the Gods, on to the beaker moves Soma, sweet to Indra, to delight him.<br> With hundred powers, with thousand currents, Indu, like a strong car-horse, goes to the assembly.<br> 10 Born in old time as finder-out of treasures, drained with the stone, decking himself in waters,<br> Warding off curses, King of all existence, he shall find way for prayer the while they cleanse him.<br> 11 For our sage fathers, Soma Pavamana, of old performed, by thee, their sacred duties.<br> Fighting unvanquished, open the enclosures: enrich us with large gifts of steeds and heroes.<br> 12 As thou didst flow for Manu Life-bestowing, Foe-queller, Comforter, rich in oblations,<br> Even thus flow onward now conferring riches: combine with Indra, and bring forth thy weapons.<br> 13 Flow onward, Soma, rich in sweets and holy,. enrobed in waters on the fleecy summit.<br> Settle in vessels that are full of fatness, as cheering and most gladdening drink for Indra.<br> 14 Pour, hundred-streamed, winner of thousands, mighty at the Gods banquet, Pour the rain of heaven,<br> While thou with rivers roarest in the beaker, and blent with milk prolongest our existence.<br> 15 Purified with our holy hymns, this Soma oertakes malignities like some strong charger,<br> Like fresh milk poured by Aditi, like passage in ample room, or like a docile car-horse.<br> 16 Cleansed by the pressers, armed with noble weapons, stream to us the fair secret name thou bearest.<br> Pour booty, like a horse, for love of glory God, Soma, send us kine, and send us Vāyu.<br> 17 They deck him at his birth, the lovely Infant, the Maruts with their troop adorn the Car-horse.<br> By songs a Poet and a Sage by wisdom, Soma joes singing through the cleansing filter.<br> 18 Light-winner, Ṛṣi-mindcd, Ṛṣi-maker, hymned in a thousand hymns, Leader of sages,<br> A Steer who strives to gain his third form, Soma is, like Virāj, resplendent as a Singer.<br> 19 Hawk seated in the bowls, Bird wide-extended, the Banner seeking kine and wielding weapons,<br> Following close the sea, the wave of waters, the great Bull tells his fourth form and declares it.<br> 20 Like a fair youth who decorates his body, a courser rushing to the gain of riches,<br> A steer to herds, so, flowing to the pitcher, he with a roar hath passed into the beakers.<br> 21 Flow on with might as Pavamana, Indu flow loudly roaring through the fleecy filter.<br> Enter the beakers sporting, as they cleanse thee, and let thy gladdening juice make Indra joyful.<br> 22 His streams have been effused in all their fulness, and he hath entered, balmed with milk, the goblets.<br> Singing his psalm, well-skilled in song, a Chanter, be comes as twere to his friend's sister roaring.<br> 23 Chasing our foes thou comest, Pavamana Indu, besting, as lover to his darling.<br> As a bird flies and settles in the forest, thus Soma settles, purified, in goblets.<br> 24 With full stream and abundant milk, O Soma, thy beams come, like a woman, as they cleanse thee.<br> He, gold-hued, rich in boons, brought to the waters, hath roared within the goblet of the pious.</p>
