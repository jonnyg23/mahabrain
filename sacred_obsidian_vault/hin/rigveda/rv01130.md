 <p>1. Come to us, Indra, from afar, conducting us even as a lord of heroes to the gatherings, home, like a King, his heroes' lord.<br> We come with gifts of pleasant food, with juice poured forth, invoking thee,<br> As sons invite a sire, that thou mayst get thee strength thee, bounteousest, to get thee strength.<br> 2 O Indra, drink the Soma juice pressed out with stones. poured from the reservoir, as an ox drinks the spring, a very thirsty bull the spring.<br> For the sweet draught that gladdens thee, for mightiest freshening of thy strength.<br> Let thy Bay Horses bring thee hither as the Sun, as every day they bring the Sun.<br> 3 He found the treasure brought from heaven that lay concealed, close-hidden, like the nestling of a bird, in rock, enclosed in never-ending rock.<br> Best Aṅgiras, bolt-armed, he strove to win, as twere, the stall of kine;<br> So Indra hath disclosed the food concealed, disclosed the doors, the food that lay concealed.<br> 4 Grasping his thunderbolt with both hands, Indra made its edge most keen, for hurling, like a carving-knife for Ahi's slaughter made it keen.<br> Endued with majesty and strength, O Indra, and with lordly might,<br> Thou crashest down the trees, as when a craftsman fells, crashest them down as with an axe.<br> 5 Thou, Indra, without effort hast let loose the floods to run their free course down,<br> like chariots, to the sea, like chariots showing forth their strength.<br> They, reaching hence away, have joined their strength for one eternal end,<br> Even as the cows who poured forth every thing for man, Yea, poured forth all things for mankind.<br> 6 Eager for riches, men have formed for thee this song, like as a skilful craftsman fashioneth a car, so have they wrought thee to their bliss;<br> Adorning thee, O Singer, like a generous steed for deeds of might,<br> Yea, like a steed to show his strength and win the prize, that he may bear each prize away.<br> 7 For Pūru thou hast shattered, Indra ninety forts, for Divodāsa thy boon servant with thy bolt, O Dancer, for thy worshipper.<br> For Atithigva he, the Strong, brought Śambara. from the mountain down,<br> Distributing the mighty treasures with his strength, parting all treasures with his strength.<br> 8 Indra in battles help his Āryan worshipper, he who hath hundred helps at hand in every fray, in frays that win the light of heaven.<br> Plaguing the lawless he gave up to Manu's seed the dusky skin;<br> Blazing, twere, he burns each covetous man away, he burns, the tyrannous away.<br> 9 Waxed strong in might at dawn he tore the Sun's wheel off. Bright red, he steals away their speech, the Lord of Power, their speech he steals away from them,<br> As thou with eager speed, O Sage, hast come from far away to help,<br> As winning for thine own all happiness of men, winning all happiness each day.<br> 10 Lauded with our new hymns, O vigorous in deed, save us with strengthening help, thou Shatterer of the Forts!<br> Thou, Indra, praised by Divodāsa's clansmen, as heaven grows great with days, shalt wax in glory.</p>
