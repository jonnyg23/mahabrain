 <p>1. THE men from fire-sticks, with their hands' swift movement, have, in deep thought, engendered glorious Agni,<br> Far-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the homestead.<br> 2 The Vasus set that Agni in the dwelling, fair to behold, for help from every quarter:<br> Who, in the home for ever, must be honoured.<br> 3 Shine thou before us, Agni, well-enkindled, with flame, Most Youthful God, that never fadeth.<br> To thee come all our sacrificial viands.<br> 4 Among all fires these fires have shone most brightly, splendid with light, begirt by noble heroes,<br> Where men of lofty birth sit down together.<br> 5 Victorious Agni, grant us wealth with wisdom, wealth with brave sons, famous and independent,<br> Which not a foe who deals in magic conquers.<br> 6 To whom, the Strong, at morn and eve comes, maid-like, the ladle dropping oil, with its oblation.<br> Wealth-seeking comes to him his own devotion.<br> 7 Burn up all malice with those flames, O Agni, wherewith of old thou burntest up Jarutha,<br> And drive away in silence pain and sickness.<br> 8 With him who lighteth up thy splendour, Agni, excellent, pure, refulgent, Purifier,<br> Be present, and with us through these our praises.<br> 9 Agni, the patriarchal men, the mortals who have in many places spread thy lustre,<br> Be gracious to us here for their sake also.<br> 10 Let these men, heroes in the fight with foemen, prevail against all godless arts of 4magic,<br> These who ipprove the noble song I sing thee.<br> 11 Let us not sit in want of men, O Agni, without descendants, heroleu, about thee:<br> But, O House-Friend, in houses full of children.<br> 12 By sacrifice which the Steeds' Lord ever visits, there make our dwelling rich in seed and offspring,<br> Increasing still with lineal successors.<br> 13 Guard us, O Agni, from the hated demon, guard us from malice of the churlish sinner:<br> Allied with thee may I subdue assailants.<br> 14 May this same fire of mine surpass all others, this fire where offspring, vigorous and firm-handed,<br> Wins, on a thousand paths, what neer shall perish.<br> 15 This is that Agni, saviour from the foeman, who guards the kindler of the flame from sorrow:<br> Heroes of noble lineage serve and tend him.<br> 16 This is that Agni, served in many places, whom the rich lord who brings oblation kindles,<br> And round him goes the priest at sacrifices.<br> 17 Agni, may we with riches in possession bring thee continual ofierings in abundance,<br> Using both means to draw thee to our worship.<br> 18 Agni, bear thou, Eternal, these most welcome oblations to the Deities' assembly:<br> Let them enjoy our very fragrant presents.<br> 19 Give us not up, Agni, to want of heroes, to wretched clothes, to need, to destitution.<br> Yield us not, Holy One, to fiend or hunger; injure us not at home or in the forest.<br> 20 Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour blessings on our chiefs and nobles.<br> Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings.<br> 21 Thou Agni, swift to hear, art fair of aspect: beam forth, O Son of Strength, in full effulgence.<br> Let me not want, with thee, a son for ever: let not a manly hero ever fail us.<br> 22 Condemn us not to indigence, O Agni, beside these flaming fires which Gods have kindled;<br> Nor, even after fault, let thy displeasure, thine as a God, O Son of Strength, oertake us.<br> 23 O Agni, fair of face, the wealthy mortal who to the Immortal offers his oblation.<br> Hath him who wins him treasure by his Godhead, to whom the prince, in need, goes supplicating.<br> 24 Knowing our chief felicity, O Agni, bring hither ample riches to our nobles,<br> Wherewith we may enjoy ourselves, O Victor, with undiminished life and hero children.<br> 25 Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour blessings on bur chiefs and nobles.<br> Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings.</p>
