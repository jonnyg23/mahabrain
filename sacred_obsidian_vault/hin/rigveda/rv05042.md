 <p>1. Now may our sweetest song with deep devotion reach Varuṇa, Mitra, Aditi, and Bhaga.<br> May the Five Priests' Lord, dwelling in oblations, bliss-giving Asura, hear, whose paths are open.<br> 2 May Aditi welcome, even as a mother her dear heart-gladdening son, my song that lauds her.<br> The prayer they love, bliss-giving, God-appointed, I offer unto Varuṇa and Mitra.<br> 3 In spirit him, the Sagest of the Sages; with sacrificial oil and meath bedew him <br> So then let him, God Savitar, provide us excellent, ready, and resplendent treasures.<br> 4 With willing mind, Indra, vouchsafe us cattle, prosperity, Lord of Bays! and pious patrons;<br> And, with the sacred prayer by Gods appointed, give us the holy Deities' lovingkindness.<br> 5 God Bhaga, Savitar who deals forth riches, Indra, and they who conquer Vṛtra's treasures,<br> And Vāja and Ṛbhukṣan and Purandhi, the Mighty and Immortal Ones, protect us!<br> 6 Let us declare his deeds, the undecaying unrivalled Victor whom the Maruts follow.<br> None of old times, O Maghavan, nor later, none of these days hath reached thy hero prowess.<br> 7 Praise him the Chief who gives the boon of riches, Bṛhaspati distributor of treasures,<br> Who, blessing most the man who sings and praises, comes with abundant wealth to his invoker.<br> 8 Tended, Bṛhaspati, with thy protections, the princes are unharmed and girt by heroes.<br> Wealth that brings bliss is found among the givers of horses and of cattle and of raiment.<br> 9 Make their wealth flee who, through our hymns enjoying their riches, yield us not an ample guerdon.<br> Far from the sun keep those who hate devotion, the godless, prospering in their vocation.<br> 10 With wheelless chariots drive down him, O Maruts, who at the feasts of Gods regards the demons.<br> May he, though bathed in sweat, form empty wishes, who blames his sacred rite who toils to serve you.<br> 11 Praise him whose bow is strong and sure his arrow, him who is Lord of every balm that bealeth.<br> Worship thou Rudra for his great good favour: adore the Asura, God, with salutations.<br> 12 May the House-friends, the cunning-handed Artists, may the Steer's Wives, the streams carved out by Vibhvan,<br> And may the fair Ones honour and befriend us, Sarasvatī, Brhaddiva, and Rākā.<br> 13 My newest song, thought that now springs within me, I offer to the Great, the Sure Protector,<br> Who made for us this All, in fond love laying each varied form within his Daughter's bosom.<br> 14 Now, even now, may thy fair praise, O Singer, attain Idaspati who roars and thunders,<br> Who, rich in clouds and waters with his lightning speeds forth bedewing both the earth and heaven.<br> 15 May this my laud attain the troop of Maruts, those who are youths in act, the Sons of Rudra.<br> The wish calls me to riches and well-being: praise the unwearied Ones whose steeds are dappled.<br> 16 May this my laud reach earth and air's mid-region, and forest trees and plants to win me riches.<br> May every Deity be swift to listen, and Mother Earth with no ill thought regard me.<br> 17 Gods, may we dwell in free untroubled bliss.<br> 18 May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.<br> Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!</p>
