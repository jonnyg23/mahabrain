 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="m12b057.htm#fr_369">153:1</a> The Burdwan translator misunderstands the word <i>anavajnata</i>. K.P. Singha skips over it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_370"></a><a href="m12b057.htm#fr_370">153:2</a> The sense is this: though really unattached, he seems to be attached. In this there is especial merit. A man doing the duties of a householder, without, however, being attached to wife and children and possessions, is a very superior person. Such a one has been compared to a lotus leaf, which, when dipped in water, is never soaked or drenched by it. Some, seeing the difficulty of the combat, fly away. In this there is little merit. To face all objects of desire, to enjoy them, but all the while to remain so unattached to them as not to feel the slightest pang if dissociated from them, is more meritorious.</p>
