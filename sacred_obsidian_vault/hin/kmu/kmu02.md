 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. VI</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">TO THE KUNDALINI—THE MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE.</h3>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">  "What Yogis now, what Rishis of old,<br> The greatness of that Mother hath told,<br> Who from her own breast gave birth<br> To the sky and to the earth.  
 <p>  Thou hung the Heavens in empty space,<br> And holds the earth in its place,<br> Thou made and lighted up the sun<br> To stay and shine this earth upon.</p>  
 <p>  Thy power transcendent, since their birth<br> Asunder holds the heaven and earth,<br> As chariot wheels are kept apart<br> By axles made thru workman's art.</p>  
 <p>  In Shakti, who with thee can vie,<br> Thou fills the earth, the air, the sky;<br> Thy presence, unperceived, extends<br> Beyond the world's remotest ends.</p>  
 <p>  A million earths, if such there be,<br> A million skies fall short of thee;<br> A billion suns can not out shine<br> The effulgence of thy light divine.</p>  
 <p>  The worlds, which mortals boundless deem<br> To thee but as a handfull seem.<br> Mother, Thou art without a peer.<br> On earth, or in yonder heavenly sphere. <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. VII</font></a></p>  
 <p>  Thee, God, such matchless powers adorn<br> That thou without a foe was born.<br> Thou art the Lord of Lords,<br> Adored by Men—<a href="errata.htm#0">revered</a> by Gods.</p>  
 <p>  The circling times which wear away,<br> All else, to thee can not decay;<br> Thou shinest on in youthful force,<br> While countless Yugas run their course.</p>  
 <p>  Unvexed by cares, or fears, or strife,<br> In bliss serene flow on thy life,<br> With faith we claim thine aid divine,<br> As thou art Mother, and we are thine.</p></div>  
 <p>An old Hindu prayer. The metrical translation from the Sanskrit writers, by Mr. J. Muir, with modifications by author.</p>  
 <p align="center">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>  
 <p>My sincere thanks to every author and publisher, here quoted in my book and I also want to add my thanks to Irene Ward, Grace Curtis and Clare McKinney for their unceasing efforts to help me bring it out in three weeks.</p>

 <p align="center">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>  
 <p>If all great men were good and all good men would write a book this world would be made better by their activities.</p>  
 <p>Rishi Gherwal's books are observations of nature and nature is God's "Master-piece". They are historical records of true facts of the Hindu books on philosophy, and are like a visit to that old ancient Temple of Mathra.</p>  
 <p>His manner of teaching and writing inspires us with the knowledge of ourselves, to be the same as the Universal Brotherhood—, Self of the Universe, with God's poise and sense of mastery.</p>  
 <p>His books give us the blessed assurance that we no longer need to travel to get wisdom. Study TRUTH and absorb its teachings, and the world will come to you, as it has to him.</p>  
 <p>May Peace be Unto him, together with a benediction of love, with our blessings.</p>  
 <p>Dr. and Mrs. J. D. Ward.</p>
