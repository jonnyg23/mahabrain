 This text was deposited some time ago in the RLIN by Robert Khan.  There
 is no date for its completion.  Rutgers thereafter forwarded the text to
 the Oxford Text Archive (OTA), where it was "found."  They can be
 reached at archive@vax.ox.ac.uk The edition used was that of Aufrecht,
 1877.  Apparently, according to the RLIN, the edition was compiled by H.
 S. Ananthanarayana and W. P. Lehman.  It is a "research-only" text.
 Reputedly, it was verified against Grassmann, 1876-77.

 Ananthanarayana and Lehman's achievement is, as with any encoding of a
 text--especially a non-roman script language, quite momentous.
 Nonetheless, whether from their edition, their text-entry/storage
 protocol, or other factors, the text was significantly corrupt.  Major
 sections were missing, others completely chaotic in their order, and the
 whole scheme of representing Devanagari in ASCII characters had to be
 deciphered.

 Subsequently John Robert Gardner, at University of Iowa, collaborated with
 Avinash Sothaye in cross-checking this edited version.
 They employed Max Mueller, Aufrecht, and Barend Van Nooten's Metrically
 Restored RV (Harvard University Press, #50).

 Credit should go next to Kim Poulsen, who found the text, Nandu
 Abhyankar for initiating its conversion, and Avinash Chopde for
 performing the conversion to ITRANS.  ITRANS is the wetnurse of proper
 multi-lingual computing in non- roman scripts.  Saving the scholar or
 enthusiast the trouble of learning a new keyboard map and keystrokes
 designed for torture, ITRANS uses regular ASCII alphabet characters to
 represent, phonetically, the various phonetics of the Sanskrit (and many
 others) alphabet (s).  Nonetheless, some of these characters are less
 intuitive than others- R^I for the "r" svara, so this is transcribed "R," and
 several other conventions which, while familiar on the net, are not
 effective for the ITRANS coding.  ITRANS proper allows machine
 conversion from simple ASCII to full Devanagari per Velthuis' fonts.

 Lastly, the text was converted to HTML in 1999 at sacred-texts.com using
 a C program; in June 2004 additional programming was performed to
 convert it to Unicode.
 N.B.: the following hymns for which Sanskrit transliterations
 are available were apparently not translated by
 Griffith: 2:44-48, 3:63-69, and 6:76-84.
