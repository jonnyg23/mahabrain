   <h1 align="center">Black Marigolds</h1>  
 <p><i>11th century</i><br> <i>A free interpretation of the Chauraspanchasika</i> </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> My thought is all of this gold-tinted king's daughter<br> With garlands tissue and golden buds,<br> Smoke tangles of her hair, and sleeping or waking<br> Feet trembling in love, full of pale languor;<br> My thought is clinging as to a lost learning<br> Slipped down out of the minds of men,<br> Labouring to bring her back into my soul. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> If I see in my soul the citron-breasted fair one<br> Still gold-tinted, her face like our night stars,<br> Drawing unto her; her body beaten about with flame,<br> Wounded by the flaring spear of love,<br> My first of all by reason of her fresh years,<br> Then is my heart buried alive in snow. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> If my girl with lotus eyes came to me again<br> Weary with the dear weight of young love,<br> Again I would give her to these starved twins of arms<br> And from her mouth drink down the heavy wine,<br> As a reeling pirate bee in fluttered ease<br> Steals up the honey from the nenuphar. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I bring her back, ah, wearied out with love<br> So that her slim feet could not bear her up;<br> Curved falls of her hair down on her white cheeks;<br> In the confusion of her coloured vests<br> Speaking that guarded giving up, and her scented arms<br> Lay like cool bindweed over against my neck. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I bring her back to me in her quick shame,<br> Hiding her bright face at the point of day;<br> Making her grave eyes move in watered stars,<br> For love's great sleeplessness wandering all night,<br> Seeming to sail gently, as that pink bird,<br> Down the water of love in a harvest of lotus. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> If I saw her lying all wide eyes<br> And with collyrium the indent of her cheek<br> Lengthened to the bright ear and her pale side<br> So suffering the fever of my distance,<br> Then would my love for her be ropes of flowers, and night<br> A black-haired lover on the breasts of day. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I see the heavy startled hair of this reed-flute player<br> Who curved her poppy lips to love dances,<br> Having a youth's face madding like the moon<br> Lying at her full; limbs ever moving a little in love,<br> Too slight, too delicate, tired with the small burden<br> Of bearing love ever on white feet. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> She is present to me on her beds,<br> Balmed with the exhalation of a flattering musk,<br> Rich with the curly essence of santal;<br> Girl with eyes dazing as the seeded-wine,<br> Showing as a pair of gentle nut-hatches<br> Kissing each other with their bills, each hidden<br> By turns within a little grasping mouth. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> She swims back in the crowning hour of love<br> All red with wine her lips have given to drink,<br> Soft round the mouth with camphor and faint blue<br> Tinted upon the lips, her slight body,<br> Her great live eyes, the colourings of herself<br> A clear perfection; sighs of musk outstealing<br> And powdered wood spice heavy of Cashmir. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I see her; fair face blond like gold<br> Rich with small lights, and tinted shadows surprised<br> Over and over all of her; with glittering eyes<br> All bright for love but very love-weary,<br> As it were the conjuring disk of the moon when Rahu ceases<br> With his dark stumbling-block to hide her rays. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> She is art-magically present to my soul<br> And that one word of strange heart's ease, good-bye,<br> That in the night, in loth moving to go,<br> And bending over to a golden mouth,<br> I said softly to the turned away<br> Tenderly tired hair of this king's daughter. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> My eyes that hurry to see no more are painting, painting<br> Faces of my lost girl. O golden rings,<br> That tap against cheeks of small magnolia leaves,<br> O whitest so soft parchment where<br> My poor divorced lips have written excellent<br> Stanzas of kisses, and will write no more. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Death sends me the flickering of powdery lids<br> Over wild eyes and the pity of her slim body<br> All broken up with the weariness of joy;<br> The little red flowers of her breasts to be my comfort<br> Moving above scarves, and for my sorrow<br> Wet crimson lips that once I marked as mine. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> By a cool noise of waters in the spring<br> The asoka with young flowers that feign her fingers<br> And bud in red; and in the green vest pearls kissing<br> As it were rose leaves in the gardens of God; the shining at night<br> Of white cheeks in the dark; smiles from light thoughts within,<br> And her walking as of a swan; these trouble me. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> The pleased intimacy of rough love<br> Upon the patient glory of her form<br> Racks me with memory; and her bright dress<br> As it were yellow flame, which the white hand<br> Shamefastly gathers in her rising haste,<br> The slender grace of her departing feet. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> When all my heavy heart is broken up<br> I seem to see my prison walls breaking<br> And then a light, and in that light a girl<br> Her fingers busied about her hair, her cool white arms<br> Faint rosy at the elbows, raised in the sunlight,<br> And temperate eyes that wander far away. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I seem to see my prison walls come close,<br> Built up of darkness, and against that darkness<br> A girl no taller than my breast and very tired,<br> Leaning upon the bed and smiling, feeding<br> A little bird and lying slender as ash-trees,<br> Sleepily aware as I told of the green<br> Grapes and the small bright-coloured river flowers. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I see her, as I used, in her white palace<br> Under black torches throwing cool red light,<br> Woven with many flowers and tearing the dark.<br> I see her rising, showing all her face<br> Defiant timidly, saying clearly;<br> Now I shall go to sleep, good-night, my ladies. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Though I am so far separate, a flight of birds<br> Swinging from side to side over the valley trees,<br> Passing my prison with their calling and crying,<br> Bring me to see my girl. For very bird-like<br> Is her song singing, and the state of a swan<br> In her light walking, like the shaken wings<br> Of a black eagle falls her nightly hair. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I know my princess was happy. I see her stand<br> Touching her breasts with all her flower-soft fingers,<br> Looking askance at me with smiling eyes.<br> There is a god that arms him with a flower<br> And she was stricken deep. Her, oh die here.<br> Kiss me and I shall be purer than quick rivers. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> They chatter her weakness through the two bazaars<br> Who was so strong to love me. And small men<br> That buy and sell for silver being slaves<br> Crinkle the fat about their eyes; and yet<br> No Prince of the Cities of the Sea has taken her,<br> Leading to his grim bed. Little lonely one,<br> You clung to me as a garment clings, my girl. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Only one dawn shall rise for me. The stars<br> Revolve to-morrow's night and I not heed.<br> One brief cold watch beside an empty heart<br> And that is all. This night she rests not well;<br> Oh, sleep; for there is heaviness for all the world<br> Except for the death-lighted heart of me. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> My sole concern the slipping of her vests,<br> Her little breasts the life beyond this life.<br> One night of disarray in her green hems,<br> Her golden cloths, outweighs the order of the earth,<br> Making of none effect the tides of the sea.<br> I have seen her enter the temple meekly and there seem<br> The flag of flowers that veils the very god. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind the coming and talking of wise men from towers<br> Where they had thought away their youth. And I, listening,<br> Found not the salt of the whispers of my girl,<br> Murmur of confused colours, as we lay near sleep;<br> Little wise words and little witty words<br> Wanton as water, honeyed with eagerness. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I call to mind her weariness in the morning<br> Close lying in my arms, and tiredly smiling<br> At my disjointed prayer for her small sake.<br> Now in my morning the weariness of death<br> Sends me to sleep. Had I made coffins<br> I might have lived singing to three score. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> The woodcutter and fisherman turn home,<br> With on his axe the moon and in his dripping net<br> Caught yellow moonlight. The purple flame of fire<br> Calls them to love and sleep. From the hot town<br> The maker of scant songs for bread wanders<br> To lie under the clematis with his girl.<br> The moon shines on her breasts, and I must die. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I have a need to make up prayers, to speak<br> My last consideration of the world<br> To the great thirteen gods, to make my balance<br> Ere the soul journeys on. I kneel and say:<br> Father of Light. Leave we it burning still<br> That I may look at you. Mother of the Stars,<br> Give me your feet to kiss; I love you, dear. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I seem to see the face of my lost girl<br> With frightened eyes, like a wood wanderer,<br> In travail with sorrowful waters, unwept tears<br> Labouring to be born and fall; when white face turned<br> And little ears caught at the far murmur,<br> The pleased snarling of the tumult of dogs<br> When I was buried away down the white road. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> When slow rose-yellow moons looked out at night<br> To guard the sheaves of harvest and mark down<br> The peach's fall, how calm she was and love worthy.<br> Glass-coloured starlight falling as thin as dew<br> Was wont to find us at the spirit's starving time<br> Slow straying in the orchard paths with love. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Love is a god and Rati the dark his bride;<br> But once I found their child and she was fairer,<br> That could so shine. And we were each to each<br> Wonderful and a presence not yet felt<br> In any dream. I knew the sunset earth<br> But as a red gold ring to bear my emerald<br> Within the little summer of my youth. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I marvel at the bravery of love,<br> She, whose two feet might be held in one hand<br> And all her body on a shield of the guards,<br> Lashed like a gold panther taken in a pit<br> Tearfully valiant, when I too was taken'<br> Bearding her black-beard father in his wrath,<br> Striking the soldiers with white impotent hands. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind that I loved cypress and roses, dear,<br> The great blue mountains and the small grey hills,<br> The sounding of the sea. Upon a day<br> I saw strange eyes and hands like butterflies;<br> For me at morning larks flew from the thyme<br> And children came to bathe in little streams. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Sleep left me all these nights for your white bed<br> And I am sure you sistered lay with sleep<br> After much weeping. Piteous little love,<br> Death is in the garden, time runs down,<br> The year that simple and unexalted ran till now<br> Ferments in winy autumn, and I must die. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind our going, full of bewilderment<br> As who should walk from sleep into great light,<br> Along the running of the winter river,<br> A dying sun on the cool hurrying tide<br> No more by green rushes delayed in dalliance,<br> With a clear purpose in his flower-flecked length<br> Informed, to reach Nirvana and the sea. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I love long black eyes that caress like silk,<br> Ever and ever sad and laughing eyes,<br> Whose lids make such sweet shadow when they close<br> It seems another beautiful look of hers.<br> I love a fresh mouth, ah, a scented mouth,<br> And curving hair, subtle as a smoke,<br> And light fingers, and laughter of green gems. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind asking: Where love and how love Rati's priestesses?<br> You can tell me of their washings at moon-down<br> And if that warm basin have silver borders.<br> Is it so that when they comb their hair<br> Their fingers, being purple-stained, show<br> Like coral branches in the black sea of their hair? </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I remember that you made answer very softly,<br> We being one soul, your hand on my hair,<br> The burning memory rounding your near lips;<br> I have seen the priestesses of Rati make love at moon-fall<br> And then in a carpeted hall with a bright gold lamp<br> Lie down carelessly anywhere to sleep. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I have no surety that she is not Mahadevi<br> Rose red of Siva, or Kapagata<br> The wilful ripe Companion of the King,<br> Or Krishna's own Lakshmi, the violet-haired.<br> I am not certain but that dark Brahma<br> In his high secret purposes<br> Has sent my soft girl down to make the three worlds mad<br> With capering about her scented feet. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Call not the master painters from all the world,<br> Their thin black boards, their rose and green and grey,<br> Their ashes of lapis ultramarine, Their earth of shadows the umber. Laughing at art<br> Sunlight upon the body of my bride,<br> For painting not nor any eyes for ever.<br> Oh warm tears on the body of my bride. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind when the red crowds were passed and it was raining<br> How glad those two that shared the rain with me;<br> For they talked happily with rich young voices<br> And at the storm's increase, closer and with content,<br> Each to the body of the other held<br> As there were no more severance for ever. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> The stainless fair appearance of the moon<br> Rolls her gold beauty over an autumn sky<br> And the stiff anchorite forgets to pray;<br> How much the sooner I, if her wild mouth<br> Tasting of the taste of manna came to mine<br> And kept my soul at balance above a kiss. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Her mouth careless scented as with lotus dust<br> Is water of love to the great heat of love,<br> A tirtha very holy, a lover's lake<br> Utterly sacred. Might I go down to it<br> But one more time, then should I find a way<br> To hold my lake for ever and ever more<br> Sobbing out my life beside the waters. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind that the time of the falling of blossoms started my dream<br> Into a wild life, into my girl;<br> Then was the essence of her beauty spilled<br> Down on my days so that it fades not,<br> Fails not, subtle and fresh, in perfuming<br> That day, and the days, and this the latest day. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> She with young limbs as smooth as flower pollen,<br> Whose swaying body is laved in the cool<br> Waters of languor, this dear bright-coloured bird,<br> Walks not, changes not, advances not<br> Her weary station by the black lake<br> Of Gone Forever, in whose fountain vase<br> Balance the water-lilies of my thought. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Spread we our nets beyond the farthest rims<br> So surely that they take the feet of dawn<br> Before you wake and after you are sleeping<br> Catch up the visible and invisible stars<br> And web the ports the strongest dreamer dreamed,<br> Yet is it all one, Vidya, yet it is nothing. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> The night is full of silver straws of rain,<br> And I will send my soul to see your body<br> This last poor time. I stand beside our bed;<br> Your shadowed head lies leaving a bright space<br> Upon the pillow empty, your sorrowful arm<br> Holds from your side and clasps not anything.<br> There is no covering upon you. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I think your feet seek mine to comfort them.<br> There is some dream about you even now<br> Which I'll not hear at waking. Weep not at dawn,<br> Though day brings wearily your daily loss<br> And all the light is hateful. Now is it time<br> To bring my soul away. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I mind that I went round with men and women,<br> And underneath their brows, deep in their eyes,<br> I saw their souls, which go slippng aside<br> In swarms before the pleasure of my mind;<br> The world was like a flight of birds, shadow or flame<br> Which I saw pass above the engraven hills.<br> Yet was there never one like to my woman. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> Death I take up as consolation.<br> Nay, were I free as the condor with his wings<br> Or old kings throned on violet ivory,<br> Night would not come without beds of green floss<br> And never a bed without my bright darling.<br>  Most fit that you strike now, black guards,<br> And let the fountain out before the dawn. </p>  
 <p>Even now<br> I know that I have savoured the hot taste of life<br> Lifting green cups and gold at the great feast.<br> Just for a small and a forgotten time<br> I have had full in my eyes from off my girl<br> The whitest pouring of eternal light.<br> The heavy knife. As to a gala day. </p>
