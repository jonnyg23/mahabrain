That tiger among men, the son of Pandu, going first into the great country of the Panchalas, began by various means to conciliate that tribe.

And Bhima thereupon represented unto him the intentions of king Yudhishthira. And Bhima dwelt there, O king, for thirty nights, duly entertained by Sisupala. And after this he set out from Chedi with his troops and vehicles."</p>
