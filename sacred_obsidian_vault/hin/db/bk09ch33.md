Dharmarâjan said :-- Those that are in Haris service, pure, the Siddhas in Yoga (those that have attained success in Yoga), the performers of Vratas (vows), the chaste, the ascetics, the Brahmachâris never go to hells. There is no doubt in this. Those persons that are proud of their strong positions and who use very harsh burning words to their friends, they go to Vah<u>n</u>i Ku<u>nd</u>a and live there for as many years as  there are hairs on his body; next they attain animal births for three births and get themselves scorched under the strong heat of the Sun.

He lives there for as many years as there are hairs on his body and he has to sleep on a bed of fire, very tormenting. Then he will have to be born for seven births as birds. If anybody washes any clothing with any salt on Sunday, or on the day of Samkrânti (when the Sun enters another sign), or on any new-moon day or on any Srâddha day (when funeral ceremonies are performed), he will have to go to the K<u>s</u>âra Ku<u>nd</u>a hell where he remains for as many years as there are threads in that clothing and finally he becomes born for seven births as a veritable washerman. The wretch that abuses Mûla Prakriti, the Vedas, the Sâstras, Purâ<u>n</u>as, Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Siva and the other Devas, Gaurî, Lak<u>s</u>mî, Sarasvatî and the other Devîs, goes to the hell named Bhayânaka Narakaku<u>nd</u>a. There is no other hell more tormenting than this. The sinners live here for many Kalpas and ultimately become serpents. There is no sin greater than the abuse of the Devî. There is no expiation for it. So one ought never to abuse the Devî. If one discontinues the allowances given by oneself or other persons to the Devas or Brâhma<u>n</u>as, one goes to Vi<u>st</u>hâ Ku<u>nd</u>a and has to eat the faeces there for sixty thousand years and finally to be born in Bhârata as worms in faeces the same number of years. If any person without the owners permission digs anothers tank dried of water, or makes water in the water of any tank, he goes to Mûtra Ku<u>nd</u>a and drinks urine for as many years as there are the particles in that tank. Then he becomes born in this Bhârata its an ox for one hundred years. If any person eats good things himself without giving any portion thereof to the member of his family, he goes to Sle<u>s</u>ma Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats phlegm, for full one hundred years. Then he becomes born as Preta (disembodied spirits) in this Bhârata for hundred years and drinks phlegm, urine and pus; then he becomes pure. He who does not support his father, mother, spiritual teacher, wife, sons, daughters and the helpless persons, goes to Gara Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats poison for full one hundred years. Finally he becomes born and wanders as Bhûtas (disembodied spirits). Then he becomes pure.</p>

He who becomes angry and shrinks his eyes at the sight of a guest who has come to his house offends the Devas or Pitris, who do not accept the water offered to them by that villain. On the contrary, he earns all the sins of Brahmahatyâ (murder of a Brâhmi<u>n</u> and so forth) and finally goes to Dû<u>s</u>ikâku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for one hundred years and eats polluted things. Then wandering as Bhûtas for one hundred years he becomes purified.

Then he has to roam as Châ<u>nd</u>âla for three births and then he becomes pure. He who always cheats his friends, lives for one hundred years in Gâtramala Ku<u>nd</u>a. Then roaming about for three births as an ass and for three births as a fox concurrently, he becomes purified. Out of vanity, if anybody jests at a deaf person, he goes to Kar<u>n</u>amalaku<u>nd</u>a where he eats for one hundred years the wax of the ear. Next he comes to the earth as a deaf and very poor man for seven births, when at last he gets purified. If anybody commits murder out of greed to support his family, he goes to the hell Majjâku<u>nd</u>a where he eats marrow for one lakh years.

If any stupid person sells the daughter whom he has supported, out of greed for money, he goes to Mâ<u>n</u>saku<u>nd</u>a and lives there for as many years as there are hairs on her body. The Yamas servants beat him with their clubs. His head becomes overloaded with the burden of the flesh; and, out of hunger, he licks the blood coming out of his head.

One who shaves on the day of observing vows, fasting and funeral ceremony day, becomes impure and unfit to do any action, and, in the end, he goes to the Nakha Ku<u>nd</u>a where he receives blows of clubs and eats nails for one hundred Deva years. If anybody worships, out of carelessness, the earthen Siva phallic symbol with any hairs on it, he goes to the hell Kesa Ku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for as many years as there are particles in that hair; then he gets to the yoni (womb) a Yâvanânî (a Mlechcha woman) out of Haras wrath.

If any foul-mouthed person uses always harsh and filthy language to his master, he will have to go to Tîk<u>sn</u>a Kan<u>t</u>aka Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats thorns.

If any man ministers poison to another and so takes away his life, he will have to remain for endless years in Vi<u>s</u>aku<u>nd</u>a, where he will have to eat poison. Then he will have to pass for one hundred years as a murderer Bhilla, full of sores and boils, and for seven births he will have to be a leper when at last he gets purified.
