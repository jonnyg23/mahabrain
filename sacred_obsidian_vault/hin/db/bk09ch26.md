 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">3-4. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Muni! She was first worshipped by Brahmâ. Next the Vedas worshipped her. Subsequently the learned men worshipped her. Next the King Asvapati worshipped Her in India. Next the four Var<u>n</u>as (castes) worshipped Her.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">5. Nârada said :-- O Brâhma<u>n</u>! Who is that Asvapati? What for did he worship? When the Devî Sâvitrî became adorable by all, by which persons was She first worshipped and by which persons subsequently?</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">6-14. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Muni! The King Asvapati reigned in Bhadradesa, rendering his enemies powerless and making his friends painless. He had a queen very religious; her name was Mâlatî; She was like a second Lak<u>s</u>mî. She was barren; and desirous of an issue, She under the instruction of Vasi<u>st</u>ha, duly worshipped Sâvitrî with devotion. But She did not receive any vision nor any command; therefore She returned home with a grievous heart. Seeing her sorry, the king consoled her with good words and himself accompanied her to Pu<u>s</u>kara with a view to perform Tapas to Sâvitrî with devotion and, being self-controlled, practised tapasyâ for one hundred years. Still he could not see Sâvitrî, but voice came to him. An incorporeal, celestial voice reached his ears :-- Perform Japam (repeat) ten lakhs of Gâyatrî Mantram. At this moment Parâsara came up there. The king bowed down to him. The Muni said :-- O King! One japa of Gâyatrî, destroys the days sins. Ten Japams of Gâyatrî destroy day and nights sins.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">15-40. One hundred Gâyatrî Japams destroy one months sins. One thousand Japams destroy one years sins. One lakh Gâyatrî Japams destroy the sins of the present birth and ten lakh Gâyatrî Japams destroy the sins of other births. One hundred lakhs of Japams destroy the sins of all the births. If ten times that (i.e., 1,000 lakhs) be done, then liberation is obtained. (Now the method, how to make Japam). Make the palm of the (right) hand like a snakes hood; see that the fingers are all close, no holes are seen; and make the ends of the fingers bend downwards; then being calm and quiet and with ones face eastward, practise Japam. Then count from the middle of the ring (name-less) finger and go on counting right-handed (with the hands of the watch) till you come to the bottom of the index finger. This is the rule of counting by the hand. O King! The rosary is to be of the seed of white lotus or of the crystals; it should be consecrated and purified. Japam is to be done then in a sacred Tîrtha or in a temple. Becoming self-controlled one should place the rosary on a banyan leaf or on a lotus leaf and smear it with cowdung; wash it, uttering Gâyatrî Mantra and over it perform one hundred times Gâyatrî Japam intently in accordance with</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">the rules. Or wash it with Pañchagavya, milk, curds, clarified butter, cow urine and cowdung, and then consecrate it well. Then wash it with the Ganges water and perform best the consecrations. O Râjar<u>s</u>i! Then perform ten lakhs of Japam in due order. Thus the sins of your three births will be destroyed and then you will see the Devî Sâvitrî. O King! Do this Japam, being pure, everyday in the morning, mid-day, and in the evening. If one be impure and devoid of Sandhyâ, one has no right to do any action; and even if one performs an action, one does not get any fruit thereby. He who does not do the morning Sandhyâ and the evening Sandhyâ, is driven away from all the Brâhmi<u>n</u>ic Karmas and he becomes like Sûdras. He who does Sandhyâ three times throughout his life, becomes like the Sun by his lustre and brilliance of tapas. What more than this, the earth is always purified by the dust of his feet. The Dvîja who does his Sandhyâ Bandanam and remains pure, becomes energetic and liberated while living. By his contact all the Tîrthas become purified. All sins vanish away from him as snakes fly away at the sight of Garu<u>d</u>a. The Dvîja who becomes void of Sandhyâ three times a day, the Devas do not accept his worship nor the Pitris accept his Pi<u>nd</u>as. He who has no Bhakti towards the Mûla Prakriti, who does not worship the specific seed Mantra of Mâyâ and who does not hold festivities in honour of Mûla Prakriti, know him verily to be an Ajagara snake without poison. Devoid of the Vi<u>sn</u>u mantra, devoid of the three Sandhyâs and devoid of the fasting on the Ekâdasi Tithi (the eleventh clay of the fortnight), the Brâhmi<u>n</u> becomes a snake devoid of poison. The vile Brâhmi<u>n</u> who does not like to take the offerings dedicated to Hari and who does the washermans work and eats the food of Sûdra and drives the buffaloes, becomes a snake devoid of poison. The Brâhmi<u>n</u> who burns the dead bodies of the Sûdras, becomes like the man who is the husband of an unmarried girl. The Brâhmi<u>n</u> also who becomes a cook of a Sûdra, becomes a snake void of poison. The Brâhmi<u>n</u> who accepts the gifts of a Sûdra, who performs the sacrifice of a Sûdra, who lives as clerks and warriors becomes like a snake void of poison. The Brâhmi<u>n</u> who sells his daughter, who sells the name of Hari or eats the food of a woman who is without husband and son, as well as of one who has just bathed after her menstruation period, becomes like a serpent void of poison. The Brâhmi<u>n</u> who takes the profession of pimps and pampers and lives on the interest, is also like a serpent void of poison. The Brâhmi<u>n</u> who sleeps even when the Sun has risen, eats fish, and does not worship the Devî is also like a poisonless serpent. Thus stating all the rules of worship in order, the best of the Munis told him the Dhyânam, etc., of the Devî</p>

Nârada said :-- What is the Sâvitrîs Dhyân, what are the modes of her worship, what is stotra, mantra, that Parâsara gave to the King before he went away? And how did the King worship and what boon did he get? This great mystery, grand and well renowned in the Srutis, about Sâvitrî, I am desirous to hear in brief on all the points.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">44-78. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- On the thirteenth day (the trayodasi tithi) of the black fortnight in the month Jyaistha or on any other holy period, the fourteenth day (the chaturdasi tithi) this vow is to be observed with great care and devotion. Fourteen fruits and fourteen plates with offerings of food on them, flowers and incense are to be offered and this vow is to be observed for fourteen years consecutively. Garments, holy threads and other articles are also offered and after the Vrata is over, the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s are to be fed. The lucky pot (mangal gha<u>t</u>) is to be located duly according to the rules of worship with branches and fruits. Ga<u>n</u>esa, Ag<u>n</u>i, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Siva and Sivâ are to be worshipped duly.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">In that gha<u>t</u> Sâvitrî is to be next invoked and worshipped. Now hear the Dhyânam of Sâvitrî, as stated in the Mâdhyan Dina Sakhâ, as well the stotra, the modes of worship, and the Mantra, the giver of all desires. I meditate and adore that Sâvitrî, the Mother of the Vedas, of the nature of Pra<u>n</u>ava (Om), whose colour is like the burnished gold, who is burning with Brahmâ teja (the fire of Brahmâ), effulgent with thousands and thousands of rays of the midday summer Sun, who is of a smiling countenance adorned with jewels and ornaments, wearing celestial garment (purified and uninflammable by fire), and ready to grant blessings to Her Bhaktas; who is the bestower of happiness and liberation, who is peaceful and the consort of the Creator of the world, who is all wealth and the giver of all riches and prosperity, who is the Presiding Deity of the Vedas and who is the Vedas incarnate, I meditate on Thee. Thus reciting the Dhyânam, mantra and meditating on Her, one is to offer Naivedyas (offerings of food) to Her and then place ones fingers on ones head; one is to meditate again, and then invoke the Devî within the pot. One should next present fourteen things, uttering proper mantras according to the Vedas. Then one must perform special pûjâ and chant hymns to the Devî and worship Her. The fourteen articles of worship are as under :-- </p>

The Radical or the Specific Seed Mantra mantra is the eight lettered mantra Srîm Hrîm Klîm Svâitrai Svâhâ; So the sages know. The Stotra, as stated in the Mâdhyandîna</p>

Sâvitrî was given to Brahmâ, in the ancient times of old in the region of Goloka by Kri<u>sn</u>a; but Sâvitrî did not come to Brahmâ loka with Brahmâ. Then by the command of Kri<u>sn</u>a, Brahmâ praised the mother of the Vedas. And when She got pleased, She accepted Brahmâ as Her husband.</p>

Brahmâ said :-- Thou art the everlasting existence intelligence and bliss; Thou art Mûlaprakriti; thou art Hira<u>n</u>ya Garbha; Thou didst get pleased, O Fair one! Thou art of the nature of fire and Energy; Thou art the Highest; Thou art the Highest Bliss, and the caste of the twice-born. Dost thou get appeased, O Fair One! Thou art eternal, dear to the Eternal; thou art of the nature of the Everlasting Bliss. O Devî, O Thou, the all auspicious One! O Fair One! Beest thou satisfied. Thou art the form of all (omnipresent)! Thou art the essence of all mantras of the Brâhma<u>n</u>as, higher than the highest! Thou art the bestower of happiness and the liberator O Devî, O Fair One! Beest thou appeased. Thou art like the burning flame to the fuel of sins of the Brâhma<u>n</u>as! O Thou, the Bestower of Brahmâ teja (the light of Brahmâ) O Devî! O Fair One! Beest appeased. By Thy mere remembrance, all the sins to me by body, mind and speech are burnt to ashes. Thus saying, the Creator of the world reached the assembly there. Then Sâvitrî came to the Brahmaloka with Brahmâ. The King Asvapati chanted this stotra to Sâvitrî and saw Her and got from Her the desired boons. Whosoever recites this highly sacred king of Stotras after Sandhyâ Bandanam, quickly acquires the fruits of studying the Vedas.</p>
