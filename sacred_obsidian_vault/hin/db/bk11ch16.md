Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Now I am speaking of the very holy Sandhyopâsanâ method of Sandhyâ worship of Gâyatrî, the Presiding Deity of the morning, midday and evening, and of the twice-born. Listen. The greatness of using Bhasma has been described in detail. No further need be stated on the subject. I shall talk, first of all, of the morning Sandhyâ. The morning Sandhyâ is to be done early in the morning while the stars are visible. When the Sun is in the meridian, the midday Sandhyâ is to be performed; and while the Sun is visibly going down, the</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">evening Sandhyâ is to be recited over. Now again, the distinctions are made in the above three Sandhyâs :-- The morning Sandhyâ with stars seen is the best; with stars disappeared, middling; and with the Sun risen above the horizon, inferior. So the evening Sandhyâ, again, is of three kinds :-- best, middling, and inferior. When the Sun is visibly disappearing, the evening Sandhyâ is the best; when the Sun has gone down the horizon, it is middling and when the stars are visible, it is inferior. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as are the root of the Tree, the Sandhyâ Vandanam; the Vedas are the branches; the religious actions are the leaves. Therefore its root should be carefully preserved. If the root be cut, no branches or leaves of the tree will remain. That Brâhma<u>n</u>a who knows not his Sandhyâ or who does not perform the Sandhyâs is a living Sûdra. That Brâhma<u>n</u>a after his death verily becomes a dog. Therefore the Sandhyâs must be observed every day. Otherwise no right comes at all to do any action. At the sunrise and the sunset the time for Sandhyâ is two Da<u>nd</u>as (48 minutes) and if Sandhyâ be not done or rather neglected in the interval, the Prâyaschitta (penance) is to he paid duly (performed duly). If the proper time for Sandhyâ expires, one more offering of Arghya is to be made in addition to the three Arghayas daily made or the Gâyatrî is to be repeated one hundred and eight times before the Sandhyâ is commenced. In whichever time any action ought to be done, worship, first of all, the Sandhyâ Devî, the Presiding Deity of that time and do the actions proper to that time afterwards. The Sandhyâ performed in dwelling houses is ordinary; the Sandhyâ done in enclosures of cows is middling and on the banks of the rivers is good and the Sandhyâ performed before the Devîs temple or the Devîs seat is very excellent. The Sandhyopâsanâ ought to be done before the Devî, because that is the worship of the very Devî. The three Sandhyâs done before the Devî give infinitely excellent fruits. There is no other work of the Brâhma<u>n</u>as better than this Sandhyâ. One can rather avoid worshipping Siva or Vi<u>sn</u>u; because that is not daily done as obligatory; but the Sandhyopâsanâ ought to be done daily. The Gâyatrî of the Great Devî is the Essence of all the mantras in the Vedas. In the Veda Sâstras, the worship of Gâyatrî is most definitely pronounced. Brahmâ and the other Devas meditate in the Sandhyâ times on this Devî Gâyatrî and make a japam of that. The Vedas always make japams of Her. For this reason the Gâyatrî has been mentioned as the object of worship by the Vedas. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as are called Sâktas inasmuch as they worship the Primal Sakti (Force) Gâyatrî, the Mother of the Vedas. They are not Saivas nor Vai<u>sn</u>avas.</p>

While doing Âchaman, make the palm and the fingers all united and close, of the form of a Gokar<u>n</u>a (the ear of a cow) and spreading the thumb and the little finger, drink the water of the measure of a pea. If a greater or less quantity be sipped, then that would amount to drinking liquor. Then thinking of the Pra<u>n</u>ava, make the Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma, and repeat mentally the Gâyatrî with her head and the Turîya pâda, i.e., Âpojyoti<u>h</u> rasomritam Brahmâ  Bhurbhuvah svarom. Inhale the air by the left nostril (Pûrak), close both the nostrils (Kumbhak) and exhale the air, by the right nostril (Rechak). Thus Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma is effected. While doing Pûrak, Kumbhak and Rechak repeat the Gâyatrî every time; hold the right nostril with the right thumb and hold the left nostril with the ringfinger and little finger (i.e., dont use forefinger and middle finger).</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">The Yogis who have controlled their minds say that Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma is effected by the three processes Pûraka, Kûmbhaka and Rechaka. The external air is inhaled in Pûraka; air is not exhaled nor inhaled (it is retained inside) in Kûmbhaka; and air is exhaled in Rechaka. While</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">doing Pûraka, meditate on the navel, the four-armed high-souled Vi<u>sn</u>u, of the blue colour (Syâma) like the blue lotus. While doing Kûmbhaka, meditate in the heart lotus the four-faced grandsire Brahmâ Prajâpati, the Creator seated on the lotus and while doing Rechaka meditate, on the fore-head, on the white sin-destroying Sankara, pure as crystal. In Pûraka, the union with Vi<u>sn</u>u is obtained; in Kûmbhaka, the knowledge of Brahmâ is attained and in Rechaka, the highest position of Îsvara (Siva) is attained. This is the method of Âchaman according to the Purâ<u>n</u>as. Now I am speaking of the all sin destroying Vaidik Âchaman. Listen. Reciting the Gâyatrî mantra Om Bhurbhuvah, sip a little water; this is the Vaidik Âchaman after repeating the seven great Vyâhritis Om Bhu<u>h</u>; Om Bhuva<u>h</u>, Om Sva<u>h,</u> Om Maha<u>h</u>, Om Jana<u>h</u>, Om Tapa<u>h</u>, Om Satyam, repeat Gâyatrî and the head of the Gâyatrî Âpojyoti Rasomritam Brahmâ  Bhurbhuva<u>h</u> svarom and practise Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma three times. Hereby all sins are destroyed and all virtues spring. Now another sort of Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma Mudrâ is described :-- The Vânaprasthîs and Grihasthas would do Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma with five fingers, holding the tip of the nose; the Brahmâchâris and Yatis would do Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma with the thumbs, little finger, and ring finger (avoiding middle and fore). Now I am speaking of the Âghama<u>s</u>a<u>n</u>a Mârjana mantra. Listen. The Mantra of this Mârjana is Âpohi<u>st</u>hâ Mayobhuvah, etc. There are three mantras in this. There are three Pâdas in every mantra, prefix Om to every pâda (thus nine times Om is to be prefixed); at the end of every pâda sprinkle water on the head with the sacrificial thread and the Kusa grass. Or at the end of every mantra do so. By the above Mârjana (cleaning) the sins of one hundred years are instantly destroyed. Then making Âchaman (taking a sip of water to rinse the mouth before worship), repeat the three Mantras Om Sûryascha mâ manyuscha, etc. By this act, the mental sins are destroyed. As mârjana is done with Pra<u>n</u>ava, Vyârhitis, and Gâyatrî, so make Mârjana by the three mantras Âpohi<u>st</u>hâ, etc. Make your right palm of the shape of a cows ear; take water in it and carry it before your nose and think thus :-- There is a terrible sinful person in my left abdomen, his colour is dark black and he is horrible looking. Recite, then, the mantras Om ritamcha satyamchâbhîdhyât, etc. and Drupâdâdiva Mumuchâna, etc. and bring that Sinful Person through your right nostril to the water in the palm. Dont look at that water; throw it away on a bit of stone to your left. And think that you are now sinless. Next, rising from the seat, keep your two feet horizontal and with the fingers save forefinger and thumb, take a palmful of water and with your face towards the Sun, recite the Gâyatrî three times</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">and offer water to the Sun three times. Thus, O Muni! The method of offering the Arghyas has been mentioned to you.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">51-80. Then circumambulate, repeating the Sûrya Mantra. The one thing to be noted in offering Arghyas is this :-- Offer once in the midday, and three times in the morning and three times in the evening. While offering the Arghya in the morning, bend yourself a little low; in offering the arghya in the midday, stand up; and while offering the arghya in the evening, it can be done while sitting. Now I will tell you why the Arghya is offered to the Sun. Hear. Thirty Ko<u>t</u>i Râk<u>s</u>asas known as the Mandehas, always roam on the path of the Sun (the mental Sun also). They are great heroes, treacherous and ferocious. They always try to devour the Sun, while they assume terrible forms. For this reason the Devas and the Ri<u>s</u>is combined offer the water with their folded hands to the Sun, while they perform the great Sandhyâ Upâsanâ. The water thus offered, becomes transformed into the thunderbolt and burns the heads of the cruel demons (and throws them on the island Mandehâru<u>n</u>a) Therefore the Brâhma<u>n</u>as daily do their Sandhyopâsana. Infinite merits accrue from this Sandhyâ Upâsanâ. O Nârada! Now I am speaking to you of the Mantras pertaining to the Arghya. No sooner they are pronounced the full effects of performing the Sandhyâs are obtained. I am That Sun; I am That Light; I am That Âtman (Self); I am Siva; I am the Light of Âtman; I am clear and transparently white; I am of the nature of all energy; and I am of the nature of Râsa (the sweetness, all the sweet sentiments). O Devî! O Gâyatrî! O Thou! Who art of the nature of Brahmâ! Let Thee come and preside in my heart to grant me success in this Japa Karma. O Devî! O Gâyatrî! Entering into my heart, go out again with this water. But Thou wouldst have to come again. Sit thus on a pure seat and with a single intent repeat the Gâyatrî, the Mother of the Vedas. O Muni! In this Sandhyopâsanâ, the Khhecharî Mudrâ ought to be done after practising the Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma. Hear now the meaning of the Khhechâri Mudrâ. When the soul of a being leaves the objects of senses, it roams in the Âkâsa, i.e., it becomes aimless when the tongue also goes to the Âkâsa and roams there; and then the sight is fixed between the eyebrows; this is called the Khhechâri Mudrâ. There is no Âsana (seat) equal to Siddhâsana and there is no Vâyu (air) equal to the Khumbaka Vâya (suspension of air in the body).</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">O Nârada! There is no Mudrâ equal to the Khhechâri Mudrâ. One is to pronounce Pra<u>n</u>ava in Pluta (protracted) accents like the sound of a bell and, suspending his breath, sit quiet motionless in Sthirâsana without any Ahamkâra (egoism). O Nârada! I am now talking of</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Siddhâsana and its characteristic qualities. Hear. Keep one heel below the root of the genital and the other heel below the scrotum; keep the whole body and breast straight and motionless; withdraw the senses from their objects and look at the point, the pituitary body, between the eyebrows. This posture is called the Siddhâsan and is pleasant to the yogis. After taking this seat, invoke the Gâyatrî. O Mother of the Vedas! O Gâyatrî! Thou art the Devî granting boons to the Bhaktas. Thou art of the nature of Brahmâ. Be gracious unto Me. O Devî! Whoever worships Thee in the day gets his day sins destroyed and in the night, night sins destroyed. O Thou! Who art all the letters of the alphabet! O Devî! O Sandhye! O Thou who art of the nature of Vidyâ! O Sarasvatî! O Ajaye! O Thou immortal! Free from disease and decay. O Mother! Who art all the Devas! I bow down to Thee. Invoke the Devî again by the mantra Ojosi, etc , and then pray :-- O Mother! Let my japam and other acts in Thy worship be fulfilled with success by Thy Grace. Next for the freedom of the curse of Gâyatrî, do the things properly. Brahmâ gave a curse to Gâyatrî; Visvâmitra gave a curse to Her and Vasi<u>st</u>ha also cursed Her. These are the three curses; they are removed in due order by recollecting Brahmâ, Visvâmitra and Vasi<u>st</u>ha. Before doing Nyâsa, one ought to collect oneself and remember the Highest Self; think in the lotus of the heart that Puru<u>s</u>a (Person) who is Truth; who is all this Universe, who is the Highest Self and who is All knowledge and who cannot be comprehended by words. Now I am speaking of the Amganyâsa of Sandhyâ; Hear. First utter Om and then utter the mantra.</p>

The Rig Veda is one; the Yajurveda is the second, the Sâmaveda is the third and the Atharva veda is the fourth foot. The Gâyatrî has eight bellies; the east side is the one; the south is the second; the west is the third; the north is the fourth; the zenith is the fifth; the nadir is the sixth; the intermediate space is the seventh and all the corners are the eighth belly. Gâyatrî has seven Siras (heads); Vyâkara<u>n</u>am (Grammar) is one; Sik<u>s</u>â is the second (that Amga of the Veda, the science which teaches the proper pronunciation of words and laws of euphony); Kalpa is the third (the Vedânga which lays down the ritual and prescribes rules for ceremonial and sacrificial acts); Nirukta is the fourth (the Vedânga that contains glossarial explanation of obscure words, especially those occurring in the Vedas); Jyotish or astronomy is the fifth; Itahâsa (history) and Purâ<u>n</u>as is the sixth head; and Upani<u>s</u>adas is the seventh head.

Thus twenty-four syllabled Sâvitrî, Jâtavedase sunavâma, etc., forty-four syllabled mantra; and the thirty two syllabled mantra, Tryamvakam Jajâmahe, etc. These three mantras united make up one hundred lettered Gâyatrî.
