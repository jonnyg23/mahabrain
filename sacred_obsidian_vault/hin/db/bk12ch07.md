Nârada said :-- I have heard the one thousand names or nâma stotras equivalent in its fruits to Srî Gâyatrî, highly potent in making a good fortune and tending to a splendid increase of the wealth and prosperity. Now I want to hear about how initiations in Mantrams are performed, without which nobody, be he a Brâhmi<u>n</u>, a K<u>s</u>attriya, a Vaisya or a Sûdra, is entitled to have the Devî Mantra. O Lord! Kindly describe the ordinary (Sâmânya) and the special (vise<u>s</u>a) rules thereof.</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">4-41. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! Listen. I am now telling you about the rules of initiation (Dîk<u>s</u>â) of the disciples, pure in heart. When they are initiated, they become entitled then and not before that, to worship the Devas, the Fire and the Guru. That method of instruction, and religious act and ceremony is called the Dîk<u>s</u>â (initiation) by which the Divine Knowledge is imparted; and at once flashes in the heart and mind of the initiated that Knowledge and all his sins are then destroyed. So the Pundits of the Vedas and the Tantras, say. (The Divine Knowledge is like lightning, fire, arising and permeating the body, mind, and spirit.) This Dîk<u>s</u>â ought to be taken by all means. This gives excellent merits and pure results. Both the Guru and the Si<u>s</u>ya (disciple) ought to be very pure and true. (This is the first essential requisite. Then the results are instantaneous). First of all, the Guru is to perform all the morning duties, he is to take his bath and perform his Sandhyâ Vandanams. He is to return home from the banks of the river with his Kama<u>nd</u>alu and observe maunam (silence). Then, in order to give Dîk<u>s</u>â, he is to enter into the assigned room (Yâga Ma<u>nd</u>apa) and take his seat on an Âsana that is excellent and calculated to please all. He is to perform Âchanara and do Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma. Then he should take water in his Arghya vessel and putting scents and flowers in that, charge that water with Pha<u>t</u>kâra mantra (that is, condense electricity Spirit in that). Then uttering the Pha<u>t</u> mantra, he is to sprinkle the water on the doorways of the worshiproom and begin his Pûjâ. Firstly, on the top of the door at one end invoke the Deity Ga<u>n</u>anâthâ by His mantra, at the other end invoke Sarasvatî by Her mantra and at the middle, invoke Lak<u>s</u>mî Devî by Her mantra duly and worship them, with flowers. Then, on the right side worship Gangâ and Bigh<u>n</u>esa; and on the left side worship K<u>s</u>ettrapâla and Yamunâ, the daughter of the Sun. Similarly, on the bottom of the door, worship the Astra Devatâ by the</p>

Then consider the whole Ma<u>nd</u>apa as inspired with the presence of the Devî, and see the whole place as pervaded by Her through and through. Then, repeat the Pha<u>t</u> mantra and destroy the Celestial obstacles as well as those from the middle space (Antarîk<u>s</u>a); strike the ground thrice with the left heel and thus destroy the Terrene obstacles. Then touching the left branch on the left side of the choukâ<u>t</u>, put the right foot forward and enter into the Ma<u>nd</u>apa. Then instal the Sânti Kumbha (the peace jar) and offer the ordinary Arghya (Sâmânyârgha). Next worship the Vâstunâtha and Padmayoni with flowers and Âtapa rice and the Arghya water, on the south-west and then purify the Pa<u>n</u>cha Gavya. Next sprinkle all the Ma<u>nd</u>apa and the entrance gate with that Arghya water. And, while sprinkling with Arghya water, consider the whole space right through as inspired with the presence of the Devî and repeat the Mûla Mantra with devotion and sprinkle with Pha<u>t</u> mantra. The Kartâ, then, uttering the mantra Pha<u>t</u>, is to drive away all the evils from the Ma<u>nd</u>apa and uttering the mantra Hûm sprinkle water, all around, thus pacifying the atmosphere and bringing peace into the hearts of all present.</p>

Then he should bow down to his own Guru and take his seat humbly on the soft Âsanam allotted to him with his face eastwards and meditate on the Deity (Î<u>st</u>a Deva) of the mantra that is to be imparted to the disciple. After meditating thus, he is to do the Bhûta sûddhi (purification of elements) and perform Nyâsa, etc., of the Deya mantra (the mantra that is to be imparted to the disciple) according to the rules stated below, i.e., the Ri<u>s</u>i on the head; the chhandas in the mouth, the Î<u>st</u>a Devatâ in the heart, Bîja on the anus and Sakti Nyâsa on the two legs.

Then, by the command of the Guru, the disciple is to take his bath and perform his Sandhyâ, etc., and put on new clothes (cloth and châdar) and golden ornaments. He is to come then, to the Ku<u>nd</u>a with Kama<u>nd</u>alu in his hand and with a pure heart. He is to bow down to the elders and superiors seated in the assembly and take his seat in his Âsana. Srî Guru Deva then would look at the disciple with kind eyes and think the Chaitanya of the disciple within his own (the Gurus) body. Then the Guru Deva would perform the Homa and look at the disciple with a divine gaze, so that the disciple becomes pure-hearted and able to get the favours of the Devas. Thus the Guru must purify all the Adhvas (the passages) of the body of the disciple.</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Then the Guru is to touch respectively the feet, generative organ, navel, heart, forehead, and the head of the disciple with Kûrcha (a bundle of Kusa grass) and til soaked in ghee, in his left hand and offer at each touch eight oblations, repeating the mantra O<u>m</u> adya Si<u>s</u>yasya Kalâdhvânam Sodhayâmi Svâhâ, etc. Thus the Guru would purify Kalâdhva (in the feet) Tattvâdhva (in the generative organ), Bhûvanâdhva (in the navel), Var<u>n</u>âdhva (in the heart), Padâdhva (in the fore-head) and Mantrâdhva (on the head), the six Adhvâs and think these all to be dissolved in Brahmâ (Brahmalîna).</p>

He is to perform again the Vyârhiti Homa and offer all the A<u>m</u>gâhutis (oblations to all the limbs) of the fire and take leave of the fire withdrawing the Deity from the jar, into his own body. Uttering then the Vau<u>s</u>a<u>t</u> Mantra he would tie the eyes of the disciple with a piece of cloth and would bring him from the Ku<u>nd</u>a to the ma<u>nd</u>ala and make the disciple offer pu<u>s</u>pâ<u>n</u>jali (flowers in his palm) to the Î<u>st</u>a deva. Then he would take away the bandage or piece of cloth from his eyes and ask him to take his seat in the seat Kusâsana. Thus the Guru, after having purified the elements of the body of the disciple and performed the Nyâsa of the Deya Mantra, would make the disciple sit in another ma<u>nd</u>ala. Then he would touch the head of the disciple with the twigs (Pallavas) of the Ku<u>nd</u>a and repeat the Mâtrikâ Mantra and make him have his bath with the water of the jar which is considered as the seat of the Î<u>st</u>a Deva. Then, for the protection of the disciple, he would sprinkle (abhi<u>s</u>eka) him with the water of the Vardhani vessel placed already in the north-east corner. Then the disciple would get up and put on the pair of new clothes and besmear his whole body with ashes and sit close by the Guru. When the merciful Guru would consider that the Siva Sakti has now passed out of his own body and that Divine Force, the Devî, has entered into the body of the disciple, i.e., charged the disciple with the pass. Thinking now the disciple and the Devatâ to be one and the same, the Guru would now worship the disciple with flowers and scents. The Guru would then place his right hand on the head of the disciple and repeat clearly in his right ear the Mahâ Mantra of the Mahâ Devî . The disciple is to repeat also the Mahâ Mantra one hundred and eight times and fall prostrate on the ground before the Guru and thus bow down to the Guru, whom the disciple now thinks as the incarnate of the Deva.</p>

Then he would give Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â to the priests and make charities to the virgins; the Brâhma<u>n</u>as, the poor and the destitute and the orphans. Here he is not to be miserly in any way in the expenditure. O Nârada! Thus the disciple would consider himself blessed and he would daily remain engaged in repeating the Mahâ Mantra. Thus I have described to you above</p>

Thus all the Sâstras say. And this is the Sanâtan Creed. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! I have described all about the ordinary Dîk<u>s</u>â that you questioned me. Now the essence in brief is this that you would remain always merged in worshipping the Parâ Sakti, the Highest Force, the Mahâ Devî. What more shall I say than this that I have got the highest pleasure and the Nirvâna, the peace, that passeth all understanding, from my daily worshipping That Lotus Feet duly. Vedavyâsa said :-- O Mahârâja! O Janamejayan! After having said this Dîk<u>s</u>âtattva, the highest Yogi Bhagavân Nârâya<u>n</u>a, meditated by the Yogis, closed his eyes and remained merged in Samâdhi, in the meditation of the Lotus Feet of the Devî.</p>
