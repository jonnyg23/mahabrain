 <p>SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,—O great king! one day Shree Krishnù Chund, the brother of the world, the root of joy, determined to go and see whether the Pandoos had escaped alive from the conflagration. Huri started from Dwarka with several of the descendants of Judoo, and went to Hustinapoor. On hearing the news of his arrival, Joodisthur, Urjoon, Bheem, Nukool and Suhdeo, five brothers, rose up with the greatest delight; and, having gone outside the city, and met Krishnù with a most cordial reception, escorted him to their house. As they were entering the house, Koontee and Dropudee summoned seven married women: and having filled up a square with pearls, placed a chair of gold upon it, upon which they seated Shree Krishnù. Having caused all kinds of festive rejoicings to be made, they performed the ceremony of "<i>Arta</i>" with their own hands; and washing his feet, they conducted him to the banquetting room, and feasted him with all sorts of delicacies.</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Shree Krishnù Chund had finished his repast, and began to eat betel, Koontee sat next him, and entering into conversation enquired after her father and brother: "Are Soorsen and Basoodeo, my brother, and my nephew, Buldeo, well? in whom my soul is bound up; who,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p>except you, can drive away affliction and grief? You afforded me protection, when great calamity befel me. O Krishnù! you are the dispeller of the sorrows of others: your five brothers fly to you for refuge; as the doe dreads a herd of wolves, so do Doorjodhun's subjects dread him."</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Koontee had thus spoken, Joodisthur joined his hands and said, "You, O Krishnù! are chief and lord of the Judoos. Devotees meditate constantly upon you, and not upon Shivù and Bruhmù. What meritorious act have I performed, that you have visited me in my own house. Gratify me by remaining four months, and return home after the rainy season."</p>  
 <p>Having recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,—O great king! on hearing these words, Shree Beharee, the friend of his worshippers, having inspired them all with hope and confidence, remained there; and added daily to their joy and delight. One day, Shree Krishnù Chund taking a bow and arrows in his hand, went in a chariot to hunt in the forest, accompanied by the five brothers; and on arrival there, dismounting from his chariot, and fastening his belt, prepared to shoot his arrows; and, beating the jungle, began to kill lions, tigers, rhinoceroses, wild buffaloes, and deer and antelopes of different kinds; and brought all his game to the Raja Joodisthur, who distributed some of it, and sent some for the supply of his own table. Whilst Shree Krishnù Chund and Urjoon were engaged in sport, they advanced some distance beyond the rest of the party, and stood under a tree. They then both went to the banks of a river, and drank some water. At this time Shree Krishnù Jee saw on the river-bank a very beautiful young virgin, with a face like the moon, of the colour of the flower chumpa, with eyes like those of a deer, a voice like the kokila, the gait of an elephant and a waist like a lion's; ornamented from head to foot, having imbibed the spirit of Kamù (Cupid,) of a most brilliant appearance, wandering about alone. Huri was amazed and struck with astonishment at beholding her, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>said, "Who is that beautiful creature, with such a charming figure, wandering about without a companion?"</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Krishnù had thus spoken, Urjoon, who saw her also, ran hurriedly to the spot, where the lovely girl was wandering about, exulting on the river-bank, and began to address her, "Say, beauteous damsel, who art thou, and whence hast thou come, and why art thou wandering here alone? Explain this strange mystery to me." On hearing these words, the beautiful girl explained her history, "I am a virgin daughter of the sun, my name is Kalindee; my father appointed me an abode in water. He came and having built for me a house in the river, thus instructed me, 'Continue wandering, O daughter! near the river, where you will meet with a husband. Krishnù will descend upon the earth in the family of Judoo, and will come after you to the place of your wandering, the first male, the immortal Huri, for whom you have been born.' From the time my father, the sun, thus spoke to me, I have longed for the approach of Huri."</p>  
 <p>Urjoon, O great king! was very much pleased to hear these words, and said, "O beauteous creature! the immortal lord, the inhabitant of Dwarka, Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, for whose sake thou art wandering here, has arrived." When Urjoon, O great king! had thus spoken, Shree Beharee, the friend of his worshippers, came up in his chariot. When, on beholding Krishnù, Urjoon explained her history to him, Shree Krishnù Chund Jee smiled, and quickly placing her upon his chariot, returned towards the city. And Bishookurma, consulting privately the taste and wishes of Shree Krishnù Chund, built a most beautiful palace, whilst Krishnù was coming from the forest to the city: and brought Kalindee there, and abode there himself. Sometime after this, on one occasion Shree Krishnù Chund and Urjoon were sitting together at night, when the element fire having conic, said to Huri, joining his hands and bowing his head, "O great king!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> I have wandered about the whole world for a long time in a state of hunger, and have not obtained any thing to eat. My only hope is in you: with your permission, I will go and devour the forests and jungles." Krishnù granted him permission. Fire then said, "O lord of compassion! I cannot go into the jungle alone: if I do, Indrù will come and extinguish me." On hearing this, Shree Krishnù Jee said to Urjoon, "Brother! go and allow Fire to eat some food: he is dying from excessive hunger."</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Shree Krishnù Chund Jee had thus spoken, Urjoon accompanied Fire with his bow and arrows; who having reached the jungle blazed forth, and began to burn up mango, tamarind and every kind of tree, and the grass and bamboos crackled with a loud noise; and the animals in the forest wandered about, losing their road. On all sides fire raged and spread in the forest; and smoke ascended in wreaths to the sky. On perceiving the smoke, Indrù summoned the lord of the clouds and said, "Go and shower down rain most copiously, and put out the fire, and save the lives of the beasts and birds, and animals of the forest." Having received this order, the lord of the clouds, taking masses of clouds with him, came there, and began to thunder: and as he was on the point of pouring down rain, Urjoon discharged such arrows of wind, that the clouds were dispersed, and blown in every direction; like flocks of cotton, driven about by gusts of air. No one saw them come, or depart, they vanished as they came; and fire, burning up the forest and jungle, came to the abode of a demon, named Mye. Beholding Fire approach, full of rage, Mye was terrified: and coming out of his house, with naked feet, and a cloth thrown about his neck, came and stood in Fire's presence with joined hands; and prostrating himself so as to touch the ground with the eight principal parts of his body, said, most beseechingly, "O lord! O lord! save me quickly from this fire, and protect me, O deity of fire! you</p>  
 <p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a></p>  
 <p>have obtained a satiety of food, do not now meditate any crime, listen to my supplications, and save me from Fire."</p>  
 <p>O great king! when the demon Mye had thus spoken, the deity of fire laid hold of his fiery arrows; and even Urjoon started with amazement. At length, they both took Mye with them to Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, and said, "O great king! this demon Mye will be of use, and will build a place of abode for you. Take thought now of Mye; and, having extinguished the fire, banish all his fears." Having thus spoken, Urjoon placed his bow, Gandeeb, and arrows upon the ground; and Krishnù, looking towards the deity of fire, made a sign by winking his eye, and the fire was put out immediately; and the whole forest became cool. Shree Krishnù Chund then went on with Urjoon and Mye. There Mye erected, in a second, a most beautiful, elegant and fascinating house of gold, studded with gems; a description of the beauty of which is impossible; whoever came to see it, stood gazing like a picture with astonishment. Shree Krishnù Jee remained there four months, and came thence to the royal court of Joodisthur; and, on arrival, he solicited the Raja's permission to go to Dwarka; when they heard this request, Raja Joodisthur and his whole court were very sad, and there was great anxiety amongst the women in the female apartments. At length Krishnù having entered into suitable explanations with them all, and inspired them with confidence, took leave of Joodisthur, accompanied by Urjoon. Having left Hustinapoor, he arrived in a few days, after a very pleasant trip, at Dwarka. Joy was spread through the city on the news of his arrival; and the pangs of separation, which they had all endured, were felt no longer. His mother and father, on seeing their son's face were delighted; and forgot all their sorrows. Shree Krishnù Jee went, on a subsequent day, to the Raja Oogursen, and explained the history of Kalindee, "O great king! I have brought Kalindee, the daughter of the sun, marry her to me in the manner prescribed by the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Vedas." On hearing this, Oogursen gave an order to one of his ministers "To go immediately and prepare all things necessary for the marriage." On receipt of the order, the minister immediately procured all that was required. Oogursen and Basoodeo then sent for an astrologer, and having fixed upon a lucky day, united Shree Krishnù Jee in marriage to Kalindee, according to the forms and ceremonies prescribed by the Vedas. Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,—Raja! in this manner Kalindee was married; I will now mention, how Huri brought away and married Mittrabinda; listen with attention. Mittrabinda was the daughter of Rajdhewee, the aunt of Krishnù and Soorsen's daughter. When she was marriageable, she selected a husband for herself. Rajas from all countries were collected together on the occasion, possessed of many eminent mental qualities, very handsome, intelligent, powerful, courageous, brave and resolute, and dressed and decked out, so as each to rival the other. Having received intelligence of this event, Shred Krishnù Chund Jee went, accompanied by Urjoon, and stood amongst the rest of the party, assembled on the occasion. The girl was delighted at seeing Krishnù; throwing a garland on his neck, she remained gazing on his countenance.</p>  
 <p>O great king! all the Rajas were ashamed, and displeased on observing this proceeding; and Doorjodhun went to her brother, Mittrasen, and said "Brother! Huri is your uncle's son, with whom your sister has fallen in love. This is contrary to the custom of the world, and the world will laugh at such behaviour; go and advise your sister not to marry Krishnù, otherwise the whole crowd of Rajas will laugh." Upon this Mittrasen went and advised his sister against the marriage.</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Mittrabinda, listening to the advice of her brother, withdrew and stood apart at some distance from Krishnù, Urjoon leaning forward whispered in his ear, "O great king! what are you hesitating about? the business is a failure; carry into execution immediately, and without delay,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a></p>  
 <p>any plan you may have formed." When Urjoon had thus spoken, Shree Krishnù Jee instantly seized Mittrabinda's hand in the midst of the assembled party; and, carrying her off, placed her on his chariot, and drove off in sight of them all. The Rajas seized their arms, and mounting their horses, and circling round to the front of Krishnù, stood in battle order. And the people in the city laughing, and clapping their hands together, played upon musical instruments; and pouring forth abuse, began to say, "Krishnù has come to marry his father's sister's daughter; a notable act no doubt, which will make him very famous."</p>  
 <p>Shree Shookdeo Jee, having narrated thus much of the history, said,—O great king! when Shree Krishnù Chund saw that he was surrounded on all sides by the army of demons, and could not avoid fighting, he drew forth several arrows from his quiver; and bending his bow, discharged them in such a manner, that the whole army of demons was scattered and dispersed in every direction, and Krishnù arrived safely at Dwarka, and free from all alarm.</p>  
 <p>Shree Shookdeo Jee said,—O great king! in this manner Shree Krishnù Jee took Mittrabinda to Dwarka, and married her there. Listen with attention, and I will now mention, how he brought away Sutya. In the Kuosul country, there was a Raja, named Nugnujjit, who had a daughter, named Sutya. When she was of a marriageable age, the Raja procured seven huge, terrible bulls without strings in their noses: and let them loose in the country, making a vow, "That he would marry his daughter to any person who should fasten strings in the noses of the seven at once."</p>  
 <p>O great king! those seven bulls ranged about the country, bellowing and pawing the ground with their heads down and tails raised, and killed whomsoever they met. Hearing of this circumstance, Shree Krishnù Chund went, accompanied by Urjoon, and stood in the presence of the Raja Nugnujjit. On seeing him, the Raja descended from his throne, and prostrating</p>  
 <p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a></p>  
 <p>himself so as to touch the ground with the eight principal parts of his body, seated Krishnù upon his throne; and placing sandal, unbroken rice and flowers on his head, offering perfumes, lamps and consecrated food, said, in a most supplicating manner, with joined hands and bended head, "My good fortune to-day is very great, that Krishnù, the lord of Shivù and Bruhmù, has come to my house." He went on to say, "O great king! I have made a certain compact, which is difficult of accomplishment; but I am now certain, that, through your favour, it will be speedily accomplished." Krishnù said, "Tell me, what vow you have made so difficult of fulfilment?" The Raja replied, "O lord of compassion! I have let loose seven bulls without strings in their noses: and made this compact, that I will marry my daughter to any person who shall put strings in the noses of the seven at once,"</p>  
 <p>Shree Shookdeo Jee said,—O great king! Huri, having heard this, fastened his girdle; and, having assumed seven different forms, went and stood where the bulls were; no one saw what was done invisibly, and Krishnù put strings in the noses of the seven at once: The bulls stood as quietly as wooden bulls, whilst the strings were being fastened in their noses; and when this was done, Krishnù led them all, with one rope, to the court of the Raja. When the inhabitants of the city beheld this exploit, they were all, both male and female, astonished, and began to pour forth loud exclamations of praise. The Raja Nugnujjit then sent for the family priest, and gave his daughter in marriage according to the prescribed injunctions of the Vedas. Her dowry consisted of ten thousand cows, nine lakhs of elephants, ten lakhs of horses, seventy-three lakhs of chariots, and male and female servants without number. When Shree Krishnù Chund departed thence, taking the dowry with him, the Rajas of the country were greatly enraged; and came and surrounded him on his way back. Urjoon destroyed and put them to flight, with arrows; and Huri returned with them all to Dwarka,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>happy and rejoicing. The inhabitants of the city, coming out to meet him, and spreading silken cloths, brought Krishnù, in musical procession, to the royal palace, and were amazed at seeing the dowry. The people extolled Nugnujjit, and said, This is a great alliance. The Raja of Kuosul has done well in marrying his daughter to Krishnù, and giving such a large dowry."</p>  
 <p>O great king! the inhabitants of the city discoursed thus amongst themselves, when Shree Krishnù Chund and Bulram arrived there; and gave all Raja Nugnujjit's dowry to Urjoon, and acquired a great reputation in the world by the act.</p>  
 <p>I will now mention the circumstances, attending the marriage of Shree Krishnù Jee with Bhudra: listen attentively, and at your ease. Bhudra, the daughter of the Raja of Kykye, chose a husband for herself, and wrote letters to all the neighbouring Rajas, who all came, and were assembled together. Shree Krishnù Chund went also, accompanied by Urjoon, and stood in the court amongst the rest of the party. When the Raja's daughter, looking at and observing the different chiefs with a garland in her hand, came to the sea of beauty, the light of the world, Shree Krishnù Chund, she was fascinated, and threw the garland upon his neck. When her mother and father saw this, they were delighted, and married their daughter to Huri according to the Vedas; bestowing upon her an unbounded marriage portion.</p>  
 <p>Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,—O great king! Shree Krishnù Chund having thus married Bhudra, I will now mention how he married Luchmuna. When Luchmuna, the daughter of the very powerful and renowned Raja of Bhudrades, was marriageable, she chose a husband for herself, and sent letters of invitation to the Rajas of all countries; who came with great pomp and splendour, with their armies arrayed and fully equipped; and sat down in the assembly in well arranged rows. Shree Krishnù Chund Jee went there also, accompanied by Urjoon; and as</p>  
 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a></p>  
 <p>he stood amongst the rest of the party, Luchmuna, having observed all who were present, came and threw a garland on the neck of Krishnù. Her father married Luchmuna to him according to the Vedas. All the Rajas who had come there, were greatly abashed; and said to one another, "Let us see whether Krishnù will take away Luchmuna while we are here."</p>  
 <p>Having thus spoken, they all arranged their forces, and blocking up the road, stood ready for battle. As Shree Krishnù Chund and Urjoon advanced in the chariot with Luchmuna, they came and stopped them, and began to fight. At length, after some time, Urjoon and Shree Krishnù destroyed, and put them all to flight with arrows; and reached the city of Dwarka, happy and rejoicing. On their arrival, there were songs of congratulation and rejoicing in every house throughout the city, according to the injunctions of the Vedas.</p>  
 <p>Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,—O great king! in this manner Shree Krishnù Chund contracted five marriages, and lived happily at Dwarka with his eight queens, who were in constant attendance upon him. The queens' names were Rohnee, Jamwutee, Sutbhama, Kalindee, Mittrabinda, Sutya, Bhudra and Luchmuna.</p>
