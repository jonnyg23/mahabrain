 <p>26. On account of (the Self) making itself.</p>
 <p>Of Brahman which the text had introduced as intent on creation, 'He wished, may I be many' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), a subsequent text says, 'That itself made its Self (II, 7), so that Brahman is represented as the object as well as the agent in the act of creation. It being the Self only which here is made many, we understand that the Self is material cause as well as operative one. The Self with names and forms non-evolved is agent (cause), the same Self with names and forms evolved is object (effect). There is thus nothing contrary to reason in one Self being object as well as agent.</p>
 <p>A new doubt here presents itself.--'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Bliss is Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 28); 'Free from sin, free from old age, free from death and grief, free from hunger and thirst' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VIII, 1,5); 'Without parts, without action, tranquil, without fault, without taint' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. VI, 19); 'This great unborn Self, undecaying, undying' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 25)--from all these texts it appears that Brahman is essentially free from even a shadow of all the imperfections which afflict all sentient and non-sentient beings, and has for its only characteristics absolutely supreme bliss and knowledge. How then is it possible that this Brahman should form the purpose of becoming, and actually become, manifold, by appearing in the form of a world comprising various sentient and non-sentient beings--all of which are the abodes of all kinds of imperfections and afflictions? To this question the next Sûtra replies.</p>
