 <p>WE have reached this earth's place of sacrificing, the place<br> wherein all Deities delighted.<br> Crossing by Rik, by Sâman, and by Yajus, may we rejoice<br> in food and growth of riches.<br> Gracious to me be these Celestial Waters!<br> Protect me, Plant. O Knife, forbear to harm him.<br> 2 The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers<br> of holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us.<br> For, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement. I rise up<br> from them purified and brightened.<br> The form of Consecration and of Fervour art thou. I put<br> thee on, the kind and blissful, maintaining an agreeable<br> appearance.<br> 3 The Great Ones milk art thou. Giver of splendour art<br> thou: bestow on me the gift of splendour.<br> Pupil art thou of Vritra's eye. The giver of eyes art thou.<br> Give me the gift of vision.<br> 4 Purify me the Lord of Thought! Purify me the Lord of<br> Speech! Purify me God Savitar with perfect strainer, with<br> the beams of Sûrya!</p>

 <p>Of thee, Lord of the Strainer! who art by the strainer<br> purified,<br> With what desire I purify myself, may I accomplish it.<br> 5 We come to you for precious wealth, O Gods, as sacrifice<br> proceeds.<br> O Gods, we call on you to give blessings that wait on sacrifice.<br> 6 Svâhâ! from mind the sacrifice. Svâhâ! from spacious<br> firmament.<br> Svâhâ! from Dyaus and Prithivî. Svâhâ! from Wind I<br> seize. Svâhâ!<br> 7 To Resolution, Motive, Agni, Svâhâ! All-hail to Wisdom,<br> and to Mind, and Agni!<br> All-hail to Consecration, Fervour, Agni! Hail to Sarasvatî,<br> Pûshan, and Agni!<br> Ye vast, divine, all-beneficial Waters, ye Heaven and Earth<br> and spacious Air between them,<br> Let us adore Brihaspati with oblation. All-hail!<br> 8 May every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding<br> God.<br> Each one solicits him for wealth: let him seek fame to prosper<br> him.<br> 9 Rik's, Sâman's counterparts are ye. I touch you. Protect<br> me till the sacrifice be ended.<br> Thou art a place of refuge. Give me refuge. Obeisance<br> unto thee! Forbear to harm me.<br> 10 Strength of Angirases art thou. Wool-soft, bestow thou<br> strength on me.<br> Thou art the garment-knot of Soma. Vishnu's refuge art<br> thou, the Sacrificer's refuge.</p>

 <p>Thou art the womb of Indra. Make the crops produce<br> abundant grain.<br> Stand up erect, O Tree. Protect me from harm until this<br> sacrifice be ended.<br> 11 Prepare ye vow-food. Agni is the Brahman, Agni is sacrifice,<br> the tree is holy.<br> For aid we meditate divine Intelligence, most merciful,<br> Free-giver, bringing worship May it guide us gently, as<br> we would.<br> Favour us Gods, mind-horn, endowed with mind and intellectual<br> might! All-hail to them! May they be our protectors.<br> 12 Waters that we have drunk! become refreshing, become<br> auspicious draughts within our belly.<br> Free from all sin and malady and sickness, may they be<br> pleasant to our taste, divine Ones, immortal, strengtheners<br> of eternal Order.<br> 13 This is thy sacrificial form.<br> Not offspring, waters I discharge. Freeing from sin and<br> consecrate by Svâhâ enter ye the earth. Be thou united<br> with the earth.<br> 14 O Agni, watch thou well. May we take joy in most refreshing<br> sleep.<br> Protect us with unceasing care. From slumber waken us<br> again.</p>

 <p>15 Thought hath returned to me, and life; my breath and<br> soul have come again.<br> Our bodies' guard, unscathed, Vaisvânara Agni preserve us<br> from misfortune and dishonour.<br> 16 Thou, Agni, art the guardian God of sacred vows among<br> mankind, thou meet for praise at holy rites.<br> Grant this much, Soma! bring yet more. God Savitar who<br> giveth wealth hath given treasure unto us.<br> 17 This is thy form, O Bright One, this thy lustre. Combine<br> with this thy form and go to splendour.<br> Impetuous art thou, upheld by mind, and Vishnu loveth<br> thee.<br> 18 Moved by thine impulse who hast true impulsion, may I<br> obtain a prop to stay my body.<br> Pure art thou, glistering art thou, immortal, dear to all the<br> Gods.<br> 19 Thought art thou, mind, intelligence, the Guerdon, royal,<br> worshipful, Aditi with a double head. Succeed for us in<br> going forth, succeed for us in thy return. May Mitra<br> bind thee by the foot. May Pûshan guard thy pathways<br> for Indra whose eye is over all.</p>

 <p>20 Thy mother give thee leave to go, thy father, thine own<br> brother, and thy friend of the same herd with thee!<br> Go thou, O Goddess, to the God. To Soma go for Indra's<br> sake.<br> May Rudra turn thee back. Return safely with Soma as<br> thy friend.<br> 21 Thou art a Vasvî, thou art Aditi, thou art an Âdityâ, thou<br> art a Rudrâ, thou art a Chandrâ.<br> Brihaspati vouchsafe thee rest and comfort! Rudra with<br> Vasus looks on thee with favour.<br> 22 On Aditi's head I sprinkle thee, on the earth's place of<br> sacrifice.<br> Footstep of Idâ art thou, filled with fatness. Hail!<br> Rejoice in us. Thy kinship is in us. In thee are riches.<br> Mine be riches! Let us not be deprived of abundant<br> riches. Thine, thine are riches.<br> 23 I with my thought have commerced with divine far-sighted<br> Dakshinâ.<br> Steal not my life. I will not thine. May I, O Goddess, in<br> thy sight find for myself a hero son.<br> 24 Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Gâyatrî.<br> For me say this to Soma: This is thine allotted Trishtup<br> share.<br> Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Jagatî.<br> Tell Soma this for me: Win thou sole lordship of the metres<br> names.<br> Ours art thou: pure thy juice for draught. Let separators<br> pick thee out.</p>

 <p>25 I sing my song of praise to him, Savitar, God between the<br> Bowls, strong with the wisdom of the wise, of true impulsion,<br> wealth-giver, the well-beloved thoughtful Sage.<br> To him at whose impulsion shone aloft in heaven the splendid<br> light.<br> Most wise, the Golden-handed hath measured the sky with<br> skilled design.<br> For living creatures, thee. Let living creatures breathe<br> after thee. Breathe after living creatures.<br> 26 Thee who art pure, with what is pure I purchase, the bright<br> with bright, immortal with immortal.<br> The Sacrificer keep thy cow. Let thy gold pieces be with us.<br> Fervour's form art thou, and Prajâpati's nature. With the<br> most noble animal art thou purchased. May I increase<br> with thousandfold abundance.<br> 27 As friend, the giver of good friends, approach us!<br> Take thou thy seat on the right thigh of Indra, yearning on<br> yearning, pleasing on the pleasing.<br> Anghâri, Svâna, Bhrâja, and Bambhâri, O Hasta, and Suhasta<br> and Krisânu,<br> These are your prices for the Soma purchase. Keep them<br> securely, let them never fail you.<br> 28 Keep me, O Agni, from unrighteous conduct: make me a<br> sharer in the path of goodness.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>I, following Immortals, have arisen with longer life, with a<br> good life before me.<br> 29 Now have we entered on the path that leads to bliss without<br> a foe,<br> The path whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers<br> wealth.<br> 30 The skin of Aditi art thou. Sit on the lap of Aditi.<br> The Bull hath propped the sky and air's mid-region, the<br> compass of the broad earth hath he measured.<br> He, King Supreme, approached all living creatures. Truly<br> all these are Varuna's ordinances.<br> 31 Over the woods the air hath he extended, put milk in kine<br> and vigorous speed in horses,<br> Set intellect in hearts and fire in houses, Sûrya in heaven<br> and Soma on the mountain.<br> 32 Ascend the eye of Sûrya, mount the pupil set in Agni's eye<br> Where, radiant through the Wise One, thou speedest along<br> with dappled steeds.<br> 33 Approach, ye oxen, fit to bear the yoke; be yoked without<br> a tear.<br> Slaying no man, urging the Brahman forward, go happily<br> to the Sacrificer's dwelling.<br> 34 Lord of the World, thou art my gracious helper: move forward<br> on thy way to all the stations.<br> Let not opponents, let not robbers find thee, let not malignant<br> wolves await thy coming.<br> Fly thou away having become a falcon. Go to the dwelling<br> of the Sacrificer. That is the special place for us to rest in.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>35 Do homage unto Varuna's and Mitra's eye: offer this solemn<br> worship to the Mighty God,<br> Who seeth far away, the Ensign born of Gods. Sing praises<br> unto Sûrya, to the Son of Dyaus.<br> 36 Thou art a prop for Varuna to rest on. Ye are the pins that<br> strengthen Varuna's pillar.<br> Thou art the lawful seat where Varuna sitteth. Sit on the<br> lawful seat where Varuna sitteth.<br> 37 Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour,<br> may they all invest our worship.<br> Wealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the<br> brave, come, Soma, to our houses.</p>
