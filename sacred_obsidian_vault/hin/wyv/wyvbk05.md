 <p>BODY of Agni art thou. Thee for Vishnu. Body of Soma art<br> thou. Thee for Vishnu. Thou art the Guest's Reception.<br> Thee for Vishnu. Thee for the Soma-bringing Falcon.<br> Thee for Vishnu. Thee for the giver of abundance, Agni.<br> Thee for Vishnu.<br> 2 Birth-place art thou of Agni. Ye are sprinklers. Thou art<br> Urvasi. Thou art Âyu. Thou art Purûravas.<br> I rub and churn thee with Gâyatrî metre. I rub and churn<br> thee with the Trishtup metre. I rub and churn thee with,<br> the Jagatî metre.<br> 3 Be ye for us one-minded, be one-thoughted, free from spot<br> and stain.<br> Harm not the sacrifice, harm not the sacrifice's lord. Be<br> kind to us this day, Omniscient Ones!<br> 4 Preserver from the curse, Son of the Rishis, Agni is active<br> having entered Agni.<br> Here for us kindly with fair worship offer oblation to the<br> Gods with care unceasing. Svâhâ!<br> 5 For him who flies around and rushes onward I take thee,<br> for Tanûnapât the mighty, the very strong, of all-surpassing<br> vigour.</p>

 <p>Strength of the Gods, inviolate, inviolable still art thou, the<br> strength that turns the curse away, uncursed and never<br> to be cursed.<br> May I go straight to truth. Place me in comfort.<br> 6 O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, in<br> thee<br> Whatever form there is of thine, may that same form be<br> here on me: un thee be every form of mine.<br> O Lord of Vows, let our vows be united. May Dîkshâ's<br> Lord allow my Consecration, may holy Fervour's Lord<br> approve my Fervour.<br> 7 May every stalk of thine wax full and strengthen for Indra<br> Ekadhanavid, God Soma!<br> May Indra grow in strength for thee: for Indra mayest thou<br> grow strong.<br> Increase us friends with strength and mental vigour. May<br> all prosperity be thine, God Soma. May I attain the<br> solemn Soma-pressing.<br> May longed-for wealth come forth for strength and fortune.<br> Let there be truth for those whose speech is truthful. To<br> Heaven and Earth be adoration offered.<br> 8 That noblest body which is thine, O Agni, laid in the lowest<br> deep, encased in iron, hath chased the awful word, the<br> word of terror. Svâhâ!<br> That noblest . . . . . . encased in silver, etc. Svâhâ<br> That noblest . . . . with gold around it, etc. Svâhâ!</p>

 <p>9 For me thou art the home of the afflicted. For me thou art<br> the gathering-place of riches. Protect me from the, woe<br> of destitution.<br> Protect me from the state of perturbation.<br> May Agni know thee, he whose name is Nabhas. Go, Agni,<br> Angiras, with the name of Âyu.<br> Thou whom this earth containeth, down I lay thee with each<br> inviolate holy name thou bearest.<br> Thou whom the second earth, etc. Thou whom the third<br> earth, etc.<br> Thee, further, for the Gods delight.<br> 10 A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be fitted for the Gods.<br> A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be purified for Gods.<br> A foe-subduing lioness art thou: adorn thyself for Gods.<br> 11 Indra's shout guard thee in the front with Vasus. The Wise<br> One guard thee from the rear with Rudras. The Thought-swift<br> guard thee on the right with Fathers. The Omnific<br> guard thee, leftward, with Âdityas.<br> This heated water I eject and banish from the sacrifice.<br> 12 Thou art a lioness. All-hail! Thou art a lioness winning<br> Âdityas.

 <p>13 Firm art thou, steady thou the earth. Firm-seated art thou,<br> steady thou the air.<br> Movelessly set art thou, steady the sky. Agni's completion<br> art thou.<br> 14 The priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns<br> harness their spirits, yea harness their holy thoughts.<br> He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea,<br> lofty is the praise of Savitar the God. All-hail!<br> 15 Forth through This All strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he<br> planted, and the whole was gathered in his footstep's dust.<br> All-hail!<br> 16 Rich in sweet food be ye, and rich in milch-kine, with fertile<br> pastures, fair to do men service.<br> Both these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed asunder, and<br> firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it.<br> 17 Heard by the Gods, ye twain, to Gods proclaim it.<br> Go eastward, O ye twain, proclaiming worship. Swerve ye<br> not: bear the sacrifice straight upward.<br> To your own cow-pen speak, ye godlike dwellings.<br> Speak not away my life, speak not away my children.<br> On the earth's summit here may ye be joyful.</p>

 <p>18 Now will I tell the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who<br> measured out the earthly regions.<br> Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting<br> down his foot and widely striding.<br> For Vishnu thee.<br> 19 Either from heaven or from the earth, O Vishnu, or, Vishnu,<br> from the vast wide air's mid-region,<br> Fill both thy hands full with abundant riches, and from the<br> right and from the left bestow them.<br> For Vishnu thee.<br> 20 For this his mighty deed is Vishnu lauded, like some wild<br> beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming,<br> He within whose three wide-extended paces all living creatures<br> have their habitation,<br> 21 Thou art the frontlet for the brow of Vishnu. Ye are the<br> corners of the mouth of Vishnu. Thou art the needle<br> for the work of Vishnu. Thou art the firmly-fastened knot<br> of Vishnu. To Vishnu thou belongest. Thee for Vishnu.<br> 22 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins<br> and with hands of Pûshan.<br> Thou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Râkshasas away.<br> Mighty art thou, mighty the sound thou makest. Utter thy<br> mighty-sounding voice to Indra:<br> 23 Fiend-killing, charm-destroying voice of Vishnu.<br> Here I cast out that charm of magic power which stranger<br> or housemate for me hath buried.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>Here I cast out the charm of magic power buried for me<br> by equal or unequal.<br> Here I cast out the charm that hath been buried for me by<br> non-relation or relation.<br> I cast the charm of magic out.<br> 24 Self-ruler art thou, conquering foes. Ruler for ever art<br> thou, killing enemies.<br> Men's ruler art thou, slaying fiends. All ruler, killing foes,<br> art thou.<br> 25 I sprinkle you whom Vishnu owns, killers of fiends and evil<br> charms.<br> I buy down you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and<br> wicked charms.<br> I scatter you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and<br> wicked charms.<br> You two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms<br> do I lay down.<br> You two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms<br> I compass round.<br> To Vishnu thou belongest. Ye are Vishnu's.<br> 26 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,<br> with the hands of Peahen.<br> Thou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Râkshasas away.<br> Barley art thou. Bar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.<br> Thee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for air's region.<br> Pure be the worlds, the Fathers dwelling-places. Thou art<br> the habitation of the Fathers.</p>

 <p>Aid-seeker art thou, worshipping. Cleanser art thou, the<br> cleansing-place. Krisânu, Sovran Lord, art thou.<br> Thou art the Pavamâna of the assembly. Thou art the<br> welkin ever moving forward. Swept clean art thou, preparer<br> of oblations. Thou art the seat of Law, heaven's light<br> and lustre.<br> 33 A sea art thou of all-embracing compass. Aja art thou, who<br> hath one foot to bear him. Thou art the Dragon of the<br> Depths of ocean. Speech art thou, thou the Sadas, thou<br> art Indra's.

In this God-reaching<br> path may I be happy.<br> 34 Look ye upon me with the eye of Mitra.<br> O Agnis, ye, receivers of oblations, are by a lauded name<br> lauded together. Protect me, Agnis! with your glittering<br> army. Fill me with riches, Agnis! be my keepers. To<br> you be adoration. Do not harm me.<br> 35 Thou art a light that wears all forms and figures, serving<br> the general host of Gods as Kindler.</p>

 <p>Thou, Soma, wilt withhold thy wide protection from body-wounding<br> hatreds shown by others. All-hail!<br> Let the Swift graciously enjoy the butter.

 <p>42 I have passed others, not approached to others. On the near<br> side of those that were more distant, and farther than<br> the nearer have I found thee.<br> So, for the worship of the Gods, with gladness we welcome<br> thee God, Sovran of the Forest! Let the Gods welcome<br> thee for the Gods service. For Vishnu thee. Plant, guard!!<br> Axe, do not harm it!<br> 43 Graze not the sky. Harm not mid-air. Be in accordance with<br> the earth.<br> For this well-sharpened axe hath led thee forth to great<br> felicity.<br> Hence, with a hundred branches, God, Lord of the Forest,<br> grow thou up.<br> May we grow spreading with a hundred branches.</p>
