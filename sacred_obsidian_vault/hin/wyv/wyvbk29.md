 <p>9 The God-devoted son Tvashtar produces: from Tvashtar<br> springs to life your fleet-foot Courser.<br> Tvashtar gave being to this All about us. Priest, worship<br> here the mighty work's achiever.<br> 10 Let the Steed seek his home, and balmed with butter go of<br> himself unto the Gods in season.<br> To the Gods world Vanaspatî, well-knowing, bear our oblations<br> which the fire has tasted!<br> 11 Thou, waxing by Prajâpati's strong fervour, born quickly,<br> guardest sacrifice, O Agni.<br> With consecrated offering go, preceding, and let the Sâdhyas,<br> Gods, eat our oblation.<br> 12 What time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding<br> from the sea or cloudy vapour,<br> Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed,<br> thy birth is high and must be lauded.<br> 13 This Steed, bestowed by Yama, Trita harnessed, and Indra<br> was the first to mount and ride him.<br> His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the<br> Sun ye fashioned forth the Courser.<br> 14 Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Âditya; Trita art thou<br> by secret operation.<br> From Soma thou art thoroughly divided. They say there<br> are three bonds in heaven that hold thee.<br> 15 Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven to bind thee,<br> three in the waters, three within the ocean.</p>

 <p>To me thou seemest Varuna, O Courser, there where they<br> say is thy sublimest birthplace.<br> 16 Here, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee;<br> here are the traces of thy hooves as winner.<br> Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which<br> those who guard the holy Law keep safely.<br> 17 Thyself from far I recognized in spirit, a Bird that from<br> below flew through the heaven.<br> I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled<br> by dust, pleasant to travel.<br> 18 Here I beheld thy form matchless in beauty, eager to win<br> thee food at the Cow's station.<br> Wheneer a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou<br> swallowest the herbs, most greedy eater.<br> 19 After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine<br> come after, and the charm of maidens.<br> Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern<br> of thy vigour Gods have followed.<br> 20 His horns are golden and his feet are iron. Less fleet than<br> he, though swift as thought, was Indra.<br> The Gods came only to the oblation-banquet of him who<br> mounted first of all the Courser.<br> 21 Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like<br> heroes, the celestial Coursers<br> Put forth their strength like swans in lengthened order when<br> they, the Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.<br> 22 A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the<br> wind in motion is thy spirit.<br> Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions; they move<br> with restless beat in wildernesses.</p>
