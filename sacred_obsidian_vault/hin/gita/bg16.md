   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVI<br> Of the Separateness of the Divine and the Undivine</h1>  
 <p><i>Krishna.</i> Fearlessness, singleness of soul, the wilL<br> Always to strive for wisdom; opened hand<br> And governed appetites; and piety,<br> And love of lonely study; humbleness,<br> Uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives,<br> Truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind<br> That lightly letteth go what others prize;<br> And equanimity, and charity<br> Which spieth no man's faults; and tenderness<br> Towards all that suffer; a contented heart,<br> Fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild,<br> Modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed,<br> With patience, fortitude, and purity;<br> An unrevengeful spirit, never given<br> To rate itself too high;- such be the signs,<br> O Indian Prince! of him whose feet are set<br> On that fair path which leads to heavenly birth!</p>  
 <p>Deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride,<br> Quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech,<br> And ignorance, to its own darkness blind,-<br> These be the signs, My Prince! of him whose birth<br> Is fated for the regions of the vile.</p>  
 <p>The Heavenly Birth brings to deliverance,<br> So should'st thou know! The birth with Asuras<br> Brings into bondage. Be thou joyous, Prince!<br> Whose lot is set apart for heavenly Birth.</p>  
 <p>Two stamps there are marked on all living men,<br> Divine and Undivine; I spake to thee<br> By what marks thou shouldst know the Heavenly Man,<br> Hear from me now of the Unheavenly!</p>  
 <p>They comprehend not, the Unheavenly,<br> How Souls go forth from Me; nor how they come<br> Back unto Me: nor is there Truth in these,<br> Nor purity, nor rule of Life. "This world<br> Hath not a Law, nor Order, nor a Lord,"<br> So say they: "nor hath risen up by Cause<br> Following on Cause, in perfect purposing,<br> But is none other than a House of Lust."<br> And, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones-<br> Of little wit, dark-minded- give themselves<br> To evil deeds, the curses of their kind.<br> Surrendered to desires insatiable,<br> Full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride,<br> In blindness cleaving to their errors, caught<br> Into the sinful course, they trust this lie<br> As it were true- this lie which leads to death-<br> Finding in Pleasure all the good which is,<br> And crying "Here it finisheth!"</p>  
 <p>Ensnared<br> In nooses of a hundred idle hopes,<br> Slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy<br> Wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites;<br> "Thus much, to-day," they say, "we gained! thereby<br> Such and such wish of heart shall have its fill;<br> And this is ours! and th' other shall be ours!<br> To-day we slew a foe, and we will slay<br> Our other enemy to-morrow! Look!<br> Are we not lords? Make we not goodly cheer?<br> Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?<br> Rich are we, proudly born! What other men<br> Live like to us? Kill, then, for sacrifice!<br> Cast largesse, and be merry!" So they speak<br> Darkened by ignorance; and so they fall-<br> Tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound<br> In net of black delusion, lost in lusts-<br> Down to foul Naraka. Conceited, fond,<br> Stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine<br> Of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings<br> Have but a show of reverence, being not made<br> In piety of ancient faith. Thus vowed<br> To self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath,<br> These My blasphemers, in the forms they wear<br> And in the forms they breed, my foemen are,<br> Hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile,<br> Lowest and least of men, whom I cast down<br> Again, and yet again, at end of lives,<br> Into some devilish womb, whence- birth by birth-<br> The devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled;<br> And, till they find and worship Me, sweet Prince!<br> Tread they that Nether Road.</p>  
 <p>The Doors of Hell<br> Are threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,-<br> The door of Lust, the door of Wrath, the door<br> Of Avarice. Let a man shun those three!<br> He who shall turn aside from entering<br> All those three gates of Narak, wendeth straight<br> To find his peace, and comes to Swarga's gate.</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVI OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Daivasarasaupadwibhagayog,"<br> Or "The Book of the Separateness of the<br> Divine and Undivine." </p>
