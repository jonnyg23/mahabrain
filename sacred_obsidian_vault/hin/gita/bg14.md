   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIV<br> Of Religion by Separation from the Qualities</h1>  
 <p><i>Krishna.</i> Yet farther will I open unto thee<br> This wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost,<br> The which possessing, all My saints have passed<br> To perfectness. On such high verities<br> Reliant, rising into fellowship<br> With Me, they are not born again at birth<br> Of Kalpas, nor at Pralyas suffer change!</p>  
 <p>This Universe the womb is where I plant<br> Seed of all lives! Thence, Prince of India, comes<br> Birth to all beings! Whoso, Kunti's Son!<br> Mothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives,<br> And I am He that fathers, sending seed!</p>  
 <p>Sattwan, Raias, and Tamas, so are named<br> The qualities of Nature, "Soothfastness,"<br> "Passion," and "Ignorance." These three bind down<br> The changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh.<br> Whereof sweet "Soothfastness," by purity<br> Living unsullied and enlightened, binds<br> The sinless Soul to happiness and truth;<br> And Passion, being kin to appetite,<br> And breeding impulse and propensity,<br> Binds the embodied Soul, O Kunti's Son!<br> By tie of works. But Ignorance, begot<br> Of Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down<br> Their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.<br> Yea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls<br> In pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds<br> By toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots<br> The beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth.<br> Passion and Ignorance, once overcome,<br> Leave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this<br> With Ignorance are absent, Passion rules;<br> And Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.<br> When at all gateways of the Body shines<br> The Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well<br> Soothfastness settled in that city reigns;<br> Where longing is, and ardour, and unrest,<br> Impulse to strive and gain, and avarice,<br> Those spring from Passion- Prince!- engrained; and where<br> Darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are,<br> 'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!</p>  
 <p>Moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed<br> In Soothfastness, it goeth to the place-<br> Perfect and pure- of those that know all Truth.<br> If it departeth in set habitude<br> Of Impulse, it shall pass into the world<br> Of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies<br> In hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul<br> Is born anew in some unlighted womb.</p>  
 <p>The fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet;<br> The fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit<br> Of Ignorance is deeper darkness. Yea!<br> For Light brings light, and Passion ache to have;<br> And gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance<br> Grow forth from Ignorance. Those of the first<br> Rise ever higher; those of the second mode<br> Take a mid place; the darkened souls sink back<br> To lower deeps, loaded with witlessness!</p>  
 <p>When, watching life, the living man perceives<br> The only actors are the Qualities,<br> And knows what rules beyond the Qualities,<br> Then is he come nigh unto Me!<br> The Soul,<br> Thus passing forth from the Three Qualities-<br> Whereby arise all bodies- overcomes<br> Birth, Death, Sorrow, and Age; and drinketh deep<br> The undying wine of Amrit.<br> Arjuna. Oh, my Lord!<br> Which be the signs to know him that hath gone<br> Past the Three Modes? How liveth he? What way<br> Leadeth him safe beyond the threefold Modes?<br> Krishna. He who with equanimity surveys<br> Lustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth<br> Of ignorance, not angry if they are,<br> Not wishful when they are not: he who sits<br> A sojourner and stranger in their midst<br> Unruffled, standing off, saying- serene-<br> When troubles break, "These be the Qualities!<br> He unto whom- self-centred- grief and joy<br> Sound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes<br> The clod, the marble, and the gold are one;<br> Whose equal heart holds the same gentleness<br> For lovely and unlovely things, firm-set,<br> Well-pleased in praise and dispraise; satisfied<br> With honour or dishonour; unto friends<br> And unto foes alike in tolerance;<br> Detached from undertakings,- he is named<br> Surmounter of the Qualities!</p>  
 <p>And such-<br> With single, fervent faith adoring Me,<br> Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms<br> To Brahma, and attains Me!</p>  
 <p>For I am<br> That whereof Brahma is the likeness! Mine<br> The Amrit is; and Immortality<br> Is mine; and mine perfect Felicity!</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XIV OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Gunatrayavibhagayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by Separation from<br> the Qualities." </p>
