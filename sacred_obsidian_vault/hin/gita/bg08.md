   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER VIII<br> Of Religion by Devotion to the One Supreme God</h1>  
 <p><i>Arjuna.</i> Who is that BRAHMA? What that Soul of Souls,<br> The ADHYATMAN? What, Thou Best of All!<br> Thy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is<br> Thou namest ADHIBHUTA? What again<br> Means ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes<br> Thou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh?<br> Slayer of Madhu! Further, make me know<br> How good men find thee in the hour of death?<br> Krishna. I BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD,<br> And ADHYATMAN is My Being's name,<br> The Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me,<br> Causing all life to live, is KARMA called:<br> And, Manifested in divided forms,<br> I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives;<br> And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,<br> Because I am PURUSHA, who who begets.<br> And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice,<br> I- speaking with thee in this body here-<br> Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines<br> Flame unto Me!) And, at the hour of death,<br> He that hath meditated Me alone,<br> In putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,<br> Enters into My Being- doubt thou not!<br> But, if he meditated otherwise<br> At hour of death, in putting off the flesh,<br> He goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son!<br> Because the Soul is fashioned to its like.</p>  
 <p>Have Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight!<br> Thou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me,<br> Shalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave<br> With never-wavering will of firmest faith,<br> Owning none other Gods: all come to Me,<br> The Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!</p>  
 <p>Whoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer,<br> Ancient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay,<br> Boundless,- but unto every atom Bringer<br> Of that which quickens it: whoso, I say,</p>  
 <p>Hath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing;<br> Seen my effulgence- which no eye hath seen-<br> Than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing,<br> Dispersing darkness,- unto him hath been</p>  
 <p>Right life! And, in the hour when life is ending,<br> With mind set fast and trustful piety,<br> Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,<br> In happy peace that faithful one doth die,-</p>  
 <p>In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven.<br> The place which they who read the Vedas name<br> AKSHARAM, "Ultimate;" whereto have striven<br> Saints and ascetics- their road is the same.</p>  
 <p>That way- the highest way- goes he who shuts<br> The gates of all his senses, locks desire<br> Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs<br> Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set;<br> And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable-<br> Emblem of BRAHM- dies, meditating Me.</p>  
 <p>For who, none other Gods regarding, looks<br> Ever to Me, easily am I gained<br> By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,<br> They fall not- those Mahatmas- back to birth,<br> To life, which is the place of pain, which ends,<br> But take the way of utmost blessedness.</p>  
 <p>The worlds, Arjuna!- even Brahma's world-<br> Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest;<br> But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me,<br> Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day<br> Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know<br> The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night,<br> Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know!<br> When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible<br> Is brought anew into the Visible;<br> When that deep Night doth darken, all which is<br> Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth;<br> Yea! this vast company of living things-<br> Again and yet again produced- expires<br> At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn,<br> Riseth, without its will, to life new-born.<br> But- higher, deeper, innermost- abides<br> Another Life, not like the life of sense,<br> Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures<br> When all created things have passed away;<br> This is that Life named the Unmanifest,<br> The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.<br> Thither arriving none return. That Life<br> Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith<br> Which wanders not, there is a way to come<br> Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread<br> The Universe around me- in Whom dwell<br> All living Things- may so be reached and seen!</p>  
 <p>Richer than holy fruit on Vedas growing,<br> Greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast,<br> Such wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing,<br> Comes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last.</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VIII OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA;<br> Entitled "Aksharaparabrahmayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by Devotion<br> to the One Supreme God." </p>
