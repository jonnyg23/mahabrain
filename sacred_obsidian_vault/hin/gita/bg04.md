   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER IV<br> Of the Religion of Knowledge</h1>  
 <p><i>Krishna.</i> This deathless Yoga, this deep union,<br> I taught Vivaswata, the Lord of Light;<br> Vivaswata to Manu gave it; he<br> To Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line<br> Of all my royal Rishis. Then, with years,<br> The truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!<br> Now once again to thee it is declared-<br> This ancient lore, this mystery supreme-<br> Seeing I find thee votary and friend.<br> Arjuna. Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days<br> And bright Vivaswata's preceded time!<br> How shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,<br> "From the beginning it was I who taught?"<br> Krishna. Manifold the renewals of my birth<br> Have been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!<br> But mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,<br> O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be<br> Unborn, undying, indestructible,<br> The Lord of all things living; not the less-<br> By Maya, by my magic which I stamp<br> On floating Nature-forms, the primal vast-<br> I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness<br> Declines, O Bharata! when Wickedness<br> Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take<br> Visible shape, and move a man with men,<br> Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back,<br> And setting Virtue on her seat again.<br> Who knows the truth touching my births on earth<br> And my divine work, when he quits the flesh<br> Puts on its load no more, falls no more down<br> To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!</p>  
 <p>Many there be who come! from fear set free,<br> From anger, from desire; keeping their hearts<br> Fixed upon me- my Faithful- purified<br> By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these<br> Mix with my being. Whoso worship me,<br> Them I exalt; but all men everywhere<br> Shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls<br> Which seek reward for works, make sacrifice<br> Now, to the lower gods. I say to thee<br> Here have they their reward. But I am He<br> Made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place<br> After their qualities and gifts. Yea, I<br> Created, the Reposeful; I that live<br> Immortally, made all those mortal births:<br> For works soil not my essence, being works<br> Wrought uninvolved. Who knows me acting thus<br> Unchained by action, action binds not him;<br> And, so perceiving, all those saints of old<br> Worked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou<br> As, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.<br> Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before<br> By singers and by sages, "What is act,<br> And what inaction?" I will teach thee this,<br> And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save<br> Needs must one rightly meditate those three-<br> Doing,- not doing,- and undoing. Here<br> Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees<br> How action may be rest, rest action- he<br> Is wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth!<br> He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed<br> In all his works from prickings of desire,<br> Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth,<br> The wise call that man wise; and such an one,<br> Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content.<br> Always self-satisfying, if he works,<br> Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,<br> Which- quit of fear and hope- subduing self-<br> Rejecting outward impulse-yielding up<br> To body's need nothing save body, dwells<br> Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm<br> Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved,<br> Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same<br> In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound<br> By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,<br> Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,<br> Whose heart is set on truth- of such an one<br> What work he does is work of sacrifice,<br> Which passeth purely into ash and smoke<br> Consumed upon the altar! All's then God!<br> The sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain<br> Are Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats<br> Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he<br> Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm.<br> Some votaries there be who serve the gods<br> With flesh and altar-smoke; but other some<br> Who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite<br> With will of worship. Of the which be they<br> Who, in white flame of continence, consume<br> Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,<br> Foregoing tender speech and sound of song:<br> And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,<br> Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss<br> Of youth and love, renouncing happiness:<br> And they who lay for offering there their wealth,<br> Their penance, meditation, piety,<br> Their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore<br> Painfully gained with long austerities:<br> And they who, making silent sacrifice,<br> Draw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,<br> And breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,<br> Governing the ventage of each entering air<br> Lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:<br> And they who, day by day denying needs,<br> Lay life itself upon the altar-flame,<br> Burning the body wan. Lo! all these keep<br> The rite of offering, as if they slew<br> Victims; and all thereby efface much sin.<br> Yea! and who feed on the immortal food<br> Left of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,<br> To The Unending. But for him that makes<br> No sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot<br> Even in the present world. How should he share<br> Another, O thou Glory of thy Line?</p>  
 <p>In sight of Brahma all these offerings<br> Are spread and are accepted! Comprehend<br> That all proceed by act; for knowing this,<br> Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice<br> Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts<br> Offered by wealth, since gifts' worth- O my Prince!<br> Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:<br> And these are gained by reverence, by strong search,<br> By humble heed of those who see the Truth<br> And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more<br> Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show<br> All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.<br> Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst<br> Of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth<br> Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea<br> Of thy transgressions. As the kindled flame<br> Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,<br> So unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought<br> The flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away!<br> There is no purifier like thereto<br> In all this world, and he who seeketh it<br> Shall find it- being grown perfect- in himself.<br> Believing, he receives it when the soul<br> Masters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes-<br> Possessing knowledge- to the higher peace,<br> The uttermost repose. But those untaught,<br> And those without full faith, and those who fear<br> Are shent; no peace is here or other where,<br> No hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.<br> He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,<br> Disparting self from service, soul from works,<br> Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince!<br> Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain<br> With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!<br> This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond<br> Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!<br> Give thyself to the field with me! Arise!</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Jnana Yog,"<br> Or "The Book of the Religion of Knowledge." </p>
