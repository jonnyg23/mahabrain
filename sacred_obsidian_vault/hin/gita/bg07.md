   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER VII<br> Of Religion by Discernment</h1>  
 <p><i>Krishna.</i> Learn now, dear Prince! how, if thy soul be set<br> Ever on Me- still exercising Yog,<br> Still making Me thy Refuge- thou shalt come<br> Most surely unto perfect hold of Me.<br> I will declare to thee that utmost lore,<br> Whole and particular, which, when thou knowest,<br> Leaveth no more to know here in this world.</p>  
 <p>Of many thousand mortals, one, perchance,<br> Striveth for Truth; and of those few that strive-<br> Nay, and rise high- one only- here and there-<br> Knoweth Me, as I am, the very Truth.</p>  
 <p>Earth, water, flame, air, ether, life, and mind,<br> And individuality- those eight<br> Make up the showing of Me, Manifest.</p>  
 <p>These be my lower Nature; learn the higher,<br> Whereby, thou Valiant One! this Universe<br> Is, by its principle of life, produced;<br> Whereby the worlds of visible things are born<br> As from a Yoni. Know! I am that womb:<br> I make and I unmake this Universe:<br> Than me there is no other Master, Prince!<br> No other Maker! All these hang on me<br> As hangs a row of pearls upon its string.<br> I am the fresh taste of the water; I<br> The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun,<br> The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill<br> That passeth in the ether, and the strength<br> Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell<br> Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light,<br> The vital air moving in all which moves,<br> The holiness of hallowed souls, the root<br> Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is;<br> The wisdom of the wise, the intellect<br> Of the informed, the greatness of the great.<br> The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son!<br> These am I, free from passion and desire;<br> Yet am I right desire in all who yearn,<br> Chief of the Bharatas! for all those moods,<br> Soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant,<br> Which Nature frames, deduce from me; but all<br> Are merged in me- not I in them! The world-<br> Deceived by those three qualities of being-<br> Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all,<br> Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is<br> To pierce that veil divine of various shows<br> Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me<br> Pierce it and pass beyond.</p>  
 <p>I am not known<br> To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones,<br> Nor to the base and churlish; nor to those<br> Whose mind is cheated by the show of things,<br> Nor those that take the way of Asuras.</p>  
 <p>Four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,<br> Arjuna! and the man who yearns to know;<br> And he who toils to help; and he who sits<br> Certain of me, enlightened.</p>  
 <p>Of these four,<br> O Prince of India! highest, nearest, best<br> That last is, the devout soul, wise, intent<br> Upon "The One." Dear, above all, am I<br> To him; and he is dearest unto me!<br> All four are good, and seek me; but mine own,<br> The true of heart, the faithful- stayed on me,<br> Taking me as their utmost, blessedness,<br> They are not "mine," but I- even I myself!<br> At end of many births to Me they come!<br> Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,<br> That man who sayeth, "All is Vasudev!"</p>  
 <p>There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside<br> By this desire or that, gives them to serve<br> Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained<br> By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such-<br> Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith-<br> 'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!<br> The heart thus asking favour from its God,<br> Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves,<br> The lesser blessing- but 'tis I who give!<br> Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap:<br> Those men of little minds, who worship so,<br> Go where they worship, passing with their gods.<br> But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes<br> Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest,<br> Not comprehending Me in my true Self!<br> Imperishable, viewless, undeclared,<br> Hidden behind my magic veil of shows,<br> I am not seen by all; I am not known-<br> Unborn and changeless- to the idle world.<br> But I, Arjuna! know all things which were,<br> And all which are, and all which are to be,<br> Albeit not one among them knoweth Me!</p>  
 <p>By passion for the "pairs of opposites,"<br> By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!<br> All creatures live bewildered, save some few<br> Who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed,<br> Freed from the "opposites," and fixed in faith,<br> Cleave unto Me.</p>  
 <p>Who cleave, who seek in Me<br> Refuge from birth and death, those have the Truth!<br> Those know Me BRAHMA: know Me Soul of Souls,<br> The ADHYATMAN: know KARMA, my work;<br> Know I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life,<br> And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,<br> And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice;<br> Worship Me well, with hearts of love and faith,<br> And find and hold me in the hour of death.</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VII OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Vijnanayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by Discernment." </p>
