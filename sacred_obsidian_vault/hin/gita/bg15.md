   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XV<br> Of Religion by Attaining the Supreme</h1>  
 <p><i>Krishna.</i> Men call the Aswattha,- the Banyan-tree,-<br> Which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,-<br> The ever-holy tree. Yea! for its leaves<br> Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth!<br> Who knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all.</p>  
 <p>Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth,<br> Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth<br> From qualities: its silver sprays and blooms,<br> And all the eager verdure of its girth,<br> Leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air,<br> As men's lives quicken to the temptings fair<br> Of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek<br> The soil beneath, helping to hold it there,</p>  
 <p>As actions wrought amid this world of men<br> Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again.<br> If ye knew well the teaching of the Tree,<br> What its shape saith; and whence it springs; and, then</p>  
 <p>How it must end, and all the ills of it,<br> The axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet,<br> And cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay<br> This Aswattha of sense-life low,- to set</p>  
 <p>New growths upspringing to that happier sky,-<br> Which they who reach shall have no day to die,<br> Nor fade away, nor fall- to Him, I mean,<br> FATHER and FIRST, Who made the mystery</p>  
 <p>Of old Creation; for to Him come they<br> From passion and from dreams who break away;<br> Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh,<br> And,- Him, the Highest, worshipping alway-</p>  
 <p>No longer grow at mercy of what breeze<br> Of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees,<br> What blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem:<br> To the eternal world pass such as these!</p>  
 <p>Another Sun gleams there! another Moon!<br> Another Light,- not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon-<br> Which they who once behold return no more;<br> They have attained My rest, life's Utmost boon!</p>  
 <p>When, in this world of manifested life,<br> The undying Spirit, setting forth from Me,<br> Taketh on form, it draweth to itself<br> From Being's storehouse,- which containeth all,-<br> Senses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul<br> Thus entering the flesh, or quitting it,<br> Gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents,<br> Blowing above the flower.-beds. Ear and Eye,<br> And Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,-<br> Yea, and a sentient mind;- linking itself<br> To sense-things so.<br> The unenlightened ones<br> Mark not that Spirit when he goes or comes,<br> Nor when he takes his pleasure in the form,<br> Conjoined with qualities; but those see plain<br> Who have the eyes to see. Holy souls see<br> Which strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive<br> That Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones,<br> Even though they strive, discern not, having hearts<br> Unkindled, ill-informed!<br> Know, too, from Me<br> Shineth the gathered glory of the suns<br> Which lighten all the world: from Me the moons<br> Draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness.<br> I penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes<br> Their living force; I glide into the plant-<br> Root, leaf, and bloom- to make the woodlands green<br> With springing sap. Becoming vital warmth,<br> I glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass,<br> With outward and with inward breath, to feed<br> The body by all meats.<br> For in this world<br> Being is twofold: the Divided, one;<br> The Undivided, one. All things that live<br> Are "the Divided." That which sits apart,<br> "The Undivided."<br> Higher still is He,<br> The Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD,<br> The Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds,<br> Sustaining them. And- dwelling thus beyond<br> Divided Being and Undivided- I<br> Am called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme,<br> The PURUSHOTTAMA.<br> Who knows Me thus,<br> With mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince!<br> And with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me.</p>  
 <p>Now is the sacred, secret Mystery<br> Declared to thee! Who comprehendeth this<br> Hath wisdom! He is quit of works in bliss!</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XV OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Purushottamapraptiyog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by Attaining the Supreme." </p>
