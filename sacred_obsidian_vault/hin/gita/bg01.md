   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER I<br> Of the Distress of Arjuna</h1>  
 <p><i>Dhritirashtra.</i> Ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain-<br> On Kurukshetra- say, Sanjaya! say<br> What wrought my people, and the Pandavas?<br> Sanjaya. When he beheld the host of Pandavas,<br> Raja Duryodhana to Drona drew,<br> And spake these words: "Ah, Guru! see this line,<br> How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,<br> Embattled by the son of Drupada,<br> Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked<br> Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,<br> Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,<br> Drupada, eminent upon his car,<br> Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord,<br> Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,<br> With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj<br> Subhadra's child; and Drupadi's;- all famed!<br> All mounted on their shining chariots!<br> On our side, too,- thou best of Brahmans! see<br> Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line,<br> Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,<br> Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,<br> Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these<br> Strong Saumadatti, with full many more<br> Valiant and tried, ready this day to die<br> For me their king, each with his weapon grasped,<br> Each skilful in the field. Weakest- meseems-<br> Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,<br> And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!<br> Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks<br> Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!"</p>  
 <p>Then, at the signal of the aged king,<br> With blare to wake the blood, rolling around<br> Like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter<br> Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,<br> Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns<br> Burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts<br> Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!<br> Then might be seen, upon their car of gold<br> Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,<br> Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:<br> Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch<br> Carved of the "Giant's bone;" Arjuna blew<br> Indra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible-<br> Wolf-bellied Bhima- blew a long reed-conch;<br> And Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son,<br> Winded a mighty shell, "Victory's Voice;"<br> And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch<br> Named the "Sweet-sounding," Sahadev on his<br> Called "Gem-bedecked," and Kasi's Prince on his.<br> Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,<br> Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,<br> Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)<br> Long-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud,<br> So that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts,<br> With quaking earth and thundering heav'n.<br> Then 'twas-<br> Beholding Dhritirashtra's battle set,<br> Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war<br> Instant to break- Arjun, whose ensign-badge<br> Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing<br> To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:<br> "Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground<br> Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh<br> These who will fight with us, those we must slay<br> To-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure,<br> On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,<br> Obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son."</p>  
 <p>Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)<br> Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer<br> Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds<br> Where Bhishma led, and Drona, and their Lords.<br> "See!" spake he to Arjuna, "where they stand,<br> Thy kindred of the Kurus:" and the Prince<br> Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,<br> Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,<br> Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed<br> With friends and honoured elders; some this side,<br> Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,<br> Such kith grown enemies- Arjuna's heart<br> Melted with pity, while he uttered this:<br> Arjuna. Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed<br> Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin,<br> My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,<br> A shudder thrills my body, and my hair<br> Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips<br> Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns<br> My skin to parching; hardly may I stand;<br> The life within me seems to swim and faint;<br> Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!<br> It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good<br> Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate<br> Triumph and domination, wealth and ease,<br> Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory<br> Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils<br> Could profit; what rule recompense; what span<br> Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?<br> Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,<br> For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,<br> And power grew precious:- grandsires, sires, and sons,<br> Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,<br> Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these<br> Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,<br> O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain<br> The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less<br> To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these<br> Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be<br> Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;<br> Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay<br> Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;<br> What peace could come of that, O Madhava?<br> For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,<br> These cannot see, or will not see, the sin<br> Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,<br> How should not we, who see, shun such a crime-<br> We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame-<br> O thou Delight of Men, Janardana?<br> By overthrow of houses perisheth<br> Their sweet continuous household piety,<br> And- rites neglected, piety extinct-<br> Enters impiety upon that home;<br> Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring<br> Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,<br> Sending a Hell-ward road that family,<br> And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.<br> Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors<br> Fall from their place of peace, being bereft<br> Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.<br> So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay<br> Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,<br> Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!<br> Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,<br> To face them weaponless, and bare my breast<br> To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.</p>  
 <p>So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,<br> Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,<br> And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER I OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Arjun-Vishad,"<br> Or "The Book of the Distress of Arjuna." </p>
