 <p>"Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth thee, O grandsire, to tell me what are the highest, the most beneficial, and the most certain fruit of all hinds of fasts k this world.'</p>  
 <p>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to what was sung by the Self-born himself and by accomplishing which a person, without doubt, attains to the highest happiness. That man who fasts on the twelfth day of the moon in the month called Margasirsha and worships Krishna as Kesava for the whole day and night, attains to the merit of the Horse-sacrifice and becomes cleansed of all his sins. He who; after the same manner, fasts on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Pausha and worships Krishna as Narayana, for the whole day and night, attains to the merits of the Vajapeya sacrifice and the highest success. He who fasts on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Magha and worships Krishna as Madhava, for the whole day and night, attains to the merits of the Rajasuya sacrifice, and rescues his own race (from misery). <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a> He who fasts on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Phalguna and worships Krishna as Govinda, for the whole day and night, attains to the merit of the Atiratra sacrifice and goes to the region of Soma. He who fasts on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Chaitra and worship Krishna as Vishnu, for the whole day and night, attains to the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice and proceeds to the region of the deities.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> By observing a similar fast on the twelfth day of the month of Vaisakha and worshipping Krishna as the slayer of Madhu for the whole day and night, one attains to the merits of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and proceeds to the region of Soma. By observing a fast on the twelfth lunar day in the month of Jyaishtha and worshipping Krishna as him who had (in Vali's sacrifice) covered the universe with three steps of his, one attains to the merits of the Gomedha sacrifice and sports with the Apsaras in great happiness. By observing a fast on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Ashadha and worshipping Krishna as the dwarf (who beguiled the Asura king Vali), one attains to the merits of the Naramedha <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">1</font></a> sacrifice and sports in happiness with the Apsaras. By observing a fast for the twelfth lunar day of the month Sravana and worshipping Krishna for day and night as Sridhara, one attains to the merits of the sacrifice called Panchayajna and acquires a beautiful car in Heaven whereon he sports in joy. By observing a fast on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Bhadrapada and worshipping Krishna as Hrishikesa for the whole day and night, one attains to the merits of the Sautramani sacrifice and becomes cleansed of all sins. By observing a fast for the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Aswin and worship-ping Krishna as Padmanabha, one attains without doubt, to the merits of the sacrifice in which a thousand kine are given away. By observing a fast for the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Kartika and worshipping Krishna as Damodara, one attains, without doubt, to the combined merits of all the sacrifices. He who, in this way, adores Krishna for a whole year as Pundarikaksha, acquires the power of recollecting the incidents of his past births and wins much wealth in gold. Similarly, he who worships Krishna every day as Upendra attains to identity with him. After Krishna has been worshipped in this way, one should, at the conclusion of one's vow, feed a number of Brahmanas or make gifts unto them of ghee. The illustrious Vishnu, that ancient Being, has himself said that there is no fast that possesses merits superior to what attach to fast of this kind.'"</p>
