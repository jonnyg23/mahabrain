 <p>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard all the duties in their entirety and all those sacred acts and objects that cleanse human beings of their sins. Yudhishthira once more addressed the son of Santanu in the following words.'</p>  
 <p>"Yudhishthira said, "Who may be said to be the one god in the world? Who may be said to be the one object which is our sole refuge? Who is he by worshipping whom or hymning whose praises human being would get what is beneficial? What religion is that which, according to thy judgment, is the foremost of all religions? What are those Mantras by reciting which a living creature becomes freed from the bonds of birth and life?'</p>  
 <p>"Bhishma said, 'One should always, with alacrity and throwing away all languor, hymn the praises of that Lord of the universe, that god of gods (<i>viz</i>., Vasudeva), who is Infinite and the foremost of all Beings, by uttering His thousand names. By always worshipping with reverence and devotion that immutable Being, by meditating on him, by hymning His praises and bowing the head unto Him, and by performing sacrifices unto Him, indeed by always praising Vishnu, who is without beginning and without end or destruction, who is the Supreme Lord of all the worlds, and who is the Master and Controller of the universe, one can succeed in transcending all sorrow. Verily, He is devoted to the Brahmanas, conversant with all duties and practices, the enhancer of the fame and achievement of all persons, the master of all the worlds, exceedingly wonderful, and the prime cause of the origin of all creatures. Even this, in my judgment, is the foremost religion of all religions, <i>viz</i>., one should always worship and hymn the praises of the lotus-eyed Vasudeva with devotion. He is the highest Energy. He is the highest Penance. He is the highest Brahma. He is the highest <a href="errata.htm#206">refuge</a>. He is the most holy of all holies, the most auspicious of all auspicious objects. He is the god of all the gods and He is the immutable father of all creatures. On the advent of the primal Yuga, all creatures spring from Him. On the expiration, again of a Yuga, all things disappear in Him. <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">1</font></a> Hear, O king, the thousand names, possessed of great efficacy in destroying sins, of that foremost one in all the worlds that Master of the universe, <i>viz</i>., Vishnu. All those names derived from His attributes, secret and well-known, of the high-souled Vasudeva which were sung by Rishis, I shall recite to thee for the good of all. They are, Om! He that enters all things, besides Himself, He that covers all things, He unto whom sacrificial libations are</p>

He that is armed with a car-wheel; He that is incapable of being agitated; He that is armed with all kinds of weapons (CMXCIII--M). Om, salutations to Him!</p>  
 <p>'Even thus have I recited to thee, without any exception, the thousand excellent names of the high-souled Kesava whose glory should always be sung That man who hears the names every day or who recites them every day, never meets with any evil either here or hereafter. If a Brahmana does this he succeeds in mastering the Vedanta; if a Kshatriya does it, he becomes always successful in battle. A Vaisya, by doing it, becomes possessed of affluence, while a Sudra earns great happiness. If one becomes desirous of earning the merit of righteousness, one succeeds in earning it (by hearing or reciting these names). If it is wealth that one desires, one succeeds in earning wealth (by acting in this way). So also the man who wishes for enjoyments of the senses succeeds in enjoying all kinds of pleasures, and the man desirous of offspring acquires offspring (by pursuing this course of conduct). That man who with devotion and perseverance and heart wholly turned towards him, recites these thousand names of Vasudeva every day, after having purified himself, succeeds in acquiring great fame, a position of eminence among his kinsmen, enduring prosperity, and lastly, that which is of the highest benefit to him (<i>viz</i>., emancipation itself). Such a man never meets with fear at any time, and acquires great prowess and energy. Disease never afflicts him; splendour of complexion, strength, beauty, and accomplishments become his. The sick become hale, the afflicted become freed from their afflictions; the affrighted become freed from fear, and he that is plunged in calamity becomes freed from calamity. The man who hymns the praises of that foremost of Beings by reciting His thousand names with devotion succeeds in quickly crossing all difficulties. That mortal who takes refuge in Vasudeva and who becomes devoted to Him, becomes freed of all sins and attains to eternal Brahma. They who are devoted to Vasudeva have never to encounter any evil. They become freed from the fear of birth, death, decrepitude, and disease. That man who with devotion and faith recites this hymn (consisting of the thousand names of Vasudeva) succeeds in acquiring felicity of soul, forgiveness of disposition, Prosperity, intelligence, memory, and fame. Neither wrath, nor jealousy, nor cupidity, nor evil understanding ever appears in those men of righteousness who are devoted to that foremost of beings. The firmament with the sun, moon and stars, the welkin, the points of the compass, the earth and the ocean, are all held and supported by the prowess of the high-souled Vasudeva. The whole mobile and immobile universe with the deities, Asuras, and Gandharvas, Yakshas, Uragas and Rakshasas, is under the sway of Krishna. The senses, mind, understanding, life, energy,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a></p>  
 <p>strength and memory, it has been said, have Vasudeva for their soul. Indeed, this body that is called Kshetra, and the intelligent soul within, that is called the knower of Kshetra, also have Vasudeva for their soul. Conduct (consisting of practices) is said to be the foremost of all topics treated of in the scriptures. Righteousness has conduct for its basis. The unfading Vasudeva is said to be the lord of righteousness. The Rishis, the Pitris, the deities, the great (primal) elements, the metals, indeed, the entire mobile and immobile universe, has sprung from Narayana. Yoga, the Sankhya Philosophy, knowledge, all mechanical arts, the Vedas, the diverse scriptures, and all learning, have sprung from Janardana. Vishnu is the one great element or substance which has spread itself out into multifarious forms. Covering the three worlds, He the soul of all things, enjoys them all. His glory knows no diminution, and He it is that is the Enjoyer of the universe (as its Supreme Lord). This hymn in praise of the illustrious Vishnu composed by Vyasa, should be recited by that person who wishes to acquire happiness and that which is the highest benefit (<i>viz</i>., emancipation). Those persons that worship and adore the Lord of the universe, that deity who is inborn and possessed of blazing effulgence, who is the origin or cause of the universe, who knows on deterioration, and who is endued with eyes that are as large and beautiful as the petals of the lotus, have never to meet with any discomfiture.'"</p>

 <p><a name="fn_325"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_326">327:1</a> The Hindu sages never attempt to speculate on the original creation of the universe. Their speculations, however, are concerned with what is called <i>Avantara srishti</i> or that creation which springs forth with the awakening of Brahman. Creation and Destruction have occurred ceaselessly and will occur ceaselessly. The original creation is impossible to conceive as Eternity cannot have a beginning.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_326"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_327">328:1</a> <i>Putatman</i> means, of cleansed Soul. This implies that though He is the Lord or ruler of all existent objects, yet He is dissociated from them The Refuge of the Emancipated--Comp. <i>Gita</i>, '<i>Mamupetya tu Kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate</i>,' etc., Purusha is He that lies in a <i>pura</i> or the nine-doored mansion, <i>i.e.</i>, the body. <i>Sakshi</i> or Witness implies that He sees all things directly, without any medium obstructing His vision. <i>Kshetrajna</i> implies the <i>Chit</i> lying within the body and who knows the body; however, being inert, is not cognisant of the <i>Chit</i> it holds.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_327"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_328">328:2</a> He is called <i>Yoga</i> because of the mind resting upon Him while it is in <i>Yoga</i> abstraction. <i>Pradhana</i>, in <i>Sankhya</i> philosophy, is another name of <i>Prakriti</i> or original Nature. All things have sprung from the union of <i>Prakriti</i> and <i>Purusha</i>. Vasudeva, however, transcends <i>Prakriti</i> and <i>Purusha</i> and is their Lord. <i>Narasinghavapu</i>--He assumed the human form with a lion's head for slaying the Asura Hiranyakasipu, the father of Prahlada.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_328"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_329">328:3</a> <i>Sarva</i> implies the source of all existent and non-existent things and that in which all existent and non-existent things become merged at the universal dissolution. <i>Sambhava</i> signifies Him who takes birth at His own will. Acts cannot touch him. The birth of all other beings is determined by their acts in previous lives. Com. <i>Gita</i>, <i>Paritranaya sadhunam</i> etc. <i>sambhavami yuge yuge</i>. <i>Bhuvana</i> means one who attaches to acts their respective fruits <i>i.e.</i>, he in consequence of whom the weal and woe of all creatures flow as due to acts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_329"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_330">328:4</a> <i>Sambhu</i> implies one whose birth has not been determined by extraneous circumstances, or other influences than his own wish, the birth of all other creatures being determined by forces extraneous to themselves. <i>Aditya</i> may also mean the foremost one among the deities especially called the <i>Adityas</i>. They are twelve in number. <i>Dhatri</i> <a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a> may also imply one who upholds everything in the universe by multiplying Himself infinitely. Dhaturuttama may, besides, signify one who as Chit is superior to all elements like Earth, Water, etc., which constitute all that is not-Chit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_330"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_331">329:1</a> <i>Aprameya</i> is, literally, immeasurable. Sankara thus explains it: He has no such attributes as sound, etc; in consequence of this He is not an object of direct perception by the sense; nor can He be an object of inference, in consequence of there being nothing to which belong the same attributes as His, etc. His inconceivability is the foundation of His immeasurableness. <i>Hrishikesa</i> is regarded by European scholars as a doubtful word. The Hindu commentators do not regard it so. It implies the lord of the senses <i>i.e.</i>, One who has his sense under complete control. Or, it may mean One who sways the sense of others, <i>i.e.</i>, causes them to exercise their functions. Sankara proposes another meaning, <i>viz</i>. He that is the form of the Sun or the Moon and as such, the rays of light emanating from those luminaries and gladdening all creatures, are the hairs on His head. <i>Manu</i> is another name for <i>Mantra</i> or sacred words having great efficacy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_331"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_332">329:2</a> <i>Krishna</i> is one of the foremost names of the supreme God-head. It means One who is always in transports of joy. It is derived from <i>krish</i> which implies to be, and <i>na</i> meaning final Emancipation or cessation of existence; the compound probably means One in whom every attribute has been extinguished; hence, absence of change, of sorrow, of gift, etc., or, eternal and highest joy. <i>Lohitaksha</i> is Red-eyed, from His eyes being of the hue of polished copper. <i>Pratardana</i>, according to Sankara, means the killer of all creatures. Others take it as implying one who destroys the cheerlessness of his worshippers. <i>Prabhuta</i> is One who is Great or Vast in consequence of Knowledge, Puissance, Energy, and Renunciation, etc.; <i>Pavitram</i>, <i>Mangalam</i>, <i>Param</i> should be taken as one name, although each of them has a separate meaning.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_332"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_333">329:3</a> <i>Pranada</i> is interpreted variously. It may mean He that causes the life-breaths to operate; He that, as Time suspends the life-breaths (<i>i.e.</i>, kills all creatures); He that connects the life-breaths (<i>i.e.</i>, set them a-going when threatened with extinction; hence, healer of diseases). <i>Prana</i> implies He who is the cause of the life of every living creature being Himself, as it were, the life-breath that inspires them. <i>Hiranyagarbha</i> signifies He that is identical with the Grandsire. <i>Bhugarbha</i> is one who has the Earth for his abdomen, implying that all things on Earth are in His abdomen.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_333"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_334">330:1</a> <i>Atmavan</i>, other Beings are said to be <i>Sariravan</i>, <i>Indriyavan</i>, etc., in consequence of the possession of such attributes as <i>Sarira</i>, <i>Indriya</i>, etc. But the Supreme God-head is nothing but soul. He rests on his own true nature or essence without requiring anything extraneous like the deities or human beings whereon to live or exist,</p>
 <p><a name="fn_334"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_335">330:2</a> <i>Aha</i> is the day; He is so called because of <i>Jiva</i> being, as it were, awakened when he goes to Him. As long as <i>Jiva</i> is at a distance from Him, he is steeped in the sleep of <i>Avidya</i> or Nescience (a happy word which Professor Max Muller has coined) <i>Samvatsara</i> or the year He is so called because Time is His essence. <i>Vyala</i>--He is a huge and fierce snake that inspires dread.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_335"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_336">330:3</a> <i>Vrishakapi</i> is otherwise explained by <i>Valadeva Vidyabhushan</i>, as He that showers blessings upon His worshippers and causes all His foes to tremble with fear.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_336"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_337">338:1</a> Vishnu is supposed to be within the constellation called Sisumara or the Northern Bear. The stars, without changing their places <i>per se</i>, seem to revolve round this point within the constellation named.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_337"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_338">338:2</a> In India, no man should worship the deities, with a full stomach. Indeed, one must abstain from every kind of food and drink if one has to worship the deities formally.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_338"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_339">340:1</a> Rama of Bhrigu's race went to Mahadeva for acquiring the science of arms. While dwelling in Siva's retreat, he had a quarrel with Karttikeya or Kumara, the son of Siva's loins. Rama worsted his preceptor's son in battle, at which his preceptor, gratified with him, made him a present of his own battle-axe, wherewith the regenerate here exterminated the Kshatriyas for full one and twenty times.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_339"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_340">342:1</a> Many of these words beginning with <i>Mahat</i> represent Krishna's own words as spoken to Arjuna in the Gita. 'I am the foremost of sacrifices; I am the foremost of sacrificers,' etc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_340"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_341">343:1</a> Referring to Hanumat and others among the apes that Rama led against Ravana.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_341"></a><a href="m13b114.htm#fr_342">343:2</a> The universe consists of Soul and Not-soul. Jiva, when cased in matter or Not-soul takes Not-soul for himself, in his ignorance. In fact until true knowledge is attained, the body is taken for self.</p>
