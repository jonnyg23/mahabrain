AN EXCEPTIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY

A Paleolithical Embellished Cave found in France (Ardeche)

An exceptional archeological discovery has been made public on
January 17, 1995, by the Minister of Culture and French-Speaking
language <francophonie>, Mr. Jacques TOUBON.

Discovered during December 1994 at Vallon-Pont-d'Arc (Ardeche,
France), the cave, composed of several spacious galleries and
dens, is adorned with some 300 paleolithical paintings and
engravings (dating 18,000 - 20,000 years before present time),
which focus on a wide variety of animals including bears, owls,
mammooths, rhinos and felines.

The cave has also retained several vestiges of human activities:
fireplaces <hearths>, entailed flints and other clues which denote an
evolution in tools and habits. Totally left intact and untouched by any
human intrusion throughout the ages, the cave represents and
exceptional source of studies for archeologists.

In the wake of the artistical and archeological interest spawned by
this thrilling discovery of national and international importance, the
Director of Cultural Heritage has signed on January 13th the
proceedings to classify the site. <i don know if the translation makes sense: a site is which due to its cultural importance becomes an official patrimony of nation> This
urgency measure, taking effect immediately, confers the cave for
one year the same statute and privileges which the historical
monuments benefit.

In order to ensure the preservation and the security of the cave, the
Prefect of Ardeche has also signed on January 13 a by-law
prohibiting the access to the cavity.
