 <h1 align="CENTER">Book of Apollo, Son of Jehovih</h1>
 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">BEING THE HEAVENLY ADMINISTRATION OF APOLLO, AN ETHEREAN GOD</p></font>.
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter I</h3>
 <p>1. APOLLO, Son of Jehovih, resident of Pti'mus, in etherea, and God of Suf'ad and Don'ga and Tah, in the South Province of Buru, Orian Chief, controller of vortices, said:</p>
 <p>2. I, Apollo, once a mortal, proclaim: First, wisdom, peace and patience unto all men, and comprehensive judgment whereof I speak; second, to perceive the reason of things, as to what seemeth to have been, and of what cometh after.</p>
 <p>3. For the Great Spirit is all Harmony and Perfection, abounding in time and in worlds to accomplish all possible imaginings; wherefore, be ye magnified in conception, not judging by the little understanding of mortals.</p>
 <p>4. So that he that asserteth harmony being more to the order of Jehovih than that which is ill-formed or out of time, hath little reason to prove his assertion before a wise man. As one may assert that ripe fruit is nearer perfection than that which is green, which assertion is self-evident without proof, so, in the understanding of Gods in the management of worlds, are things past and present, not things past and present in fact, but more like the immature and the mature.</p>
 <p>5. Since, then, man perceiveth that words, at best, are but slow and coarse representations of the soul's conception of things, how much farther distant lieth a God's wisdom beyond the reach of mortal understanding! Remember, O man, that couldst thou in <a name="page_111a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111a</font></a> a moment of time recollect all thou hadst ever learned thou wouldst be wise indeed. Wert thou in tune with thyself, such would be thy wisdom. To advance in such direction, whereby man becometh attuned, first with himself, then with his immediate surroundings, then with the magnitude of worlds, and then with Jehovih, so that he moveth, acteth, and comprehendeth harmoniously, is to become one with the Father.</p>
 <p>6. Which condition awaiteth all men, and is called in high heaven, Nirvana, because, to him that hath attained it, things past and things to come are as an open book. He can look back to his own beginning in the world, and even beyond, and whithersoever he directeth his eye, he can see and hear even as if the matter now were.</p>
 <p>7. Marvel not, O man, that the Gods reveal the words and signs of things long since perished corporeally; the proofs he could give, thou couldst not understand, for the basis of spiritual entity lieth not within the measure of the corporeal senses. Nevertheless, Jehovih hath given thee comparisons; as a portrait of a man showeth his looks even after his corporeal body hath perished; and yet, the picture is but a representative. To the spirit, a corporeal body is but a representative, being a manifested production of a spirit.</p>
 <p>8. As out of corporeal things a new thing is produced and born into the world, so out of Jehovih is born the spirit of man; neither leadeth the corporeal the spirit, nor the spirit the corporeal; but Jehovih doeth all. Think not, then, that when the corporeal body is dead and moldereth back to original elements, that in like manner the spirit of man will resolve itself back into Jehovih, for spirit is not bound by similar rules. As the corporeal body groweth by aggregating to itself, so not so groweth the spirit of man, but by the opposite, which is giving away.</p>
 <p>9. Remember, O man, the more thou puttest forth thy soul to give light and wisdom to others, the more thou receivest; wherein thou shalt comprehend in the reason of things everlasting life to the spirit of man. So also, to him that desireth to comprehend Jehovih, let him describe the All Highest constantly. To him that desireth to comprehend the etherean worlds, the homes of spirits long risen in Nirvana, let him describe them. Fear not, O man, that thou shalt err; all the imagery thou canst devise is surpassed millions of times in the magnitude of the Father's kingdoms. <a name="page_112a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112a</font></a> Till thou canst shoot an arrow without striking the air, fear not for thy weak thoughts shooting amiss in Jehovih's worlds.</p>
