 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter IX</h3>
 <p>1. WHEN Apollo, Jehovih's Son, had finished his labor, the dawn of dan, God foresaw that his own resurrection, and his people with him, had come. So he sent his proper officers to the libraries of atmospherea, to learn who of all the etherean hosts should be selected to remain as God, and who as Lords, for the next four hundred years.</p>
 <p>2. In twenty days the examiners returned and came before the throne of God, and the Council of Gau. Za'dukawaski, chief speaker, said: By the grace of Jehovih, Creator, we stand before thee, God of heaven and earth. We find, by the ancient precepts, adjudged wise in the foundation of atmospherea, one Gur, highest and most proficient of all the hosts of heaven, to be anointed God for the next four hundred years.</p>
 <p>3. God said: I remember Gur, from Magel, in Sooftus, in etherea, God of Ra'yatuf and a'ji, seventy-two. Let the marshals go to him and acquaint him with Jehovih's decrees, in the name of God. And they shall provide suitable conveyance for Gur to come to Gau, according to his rate.</p>
 <p>4. So the marshals, ten thousand in number, besides ten thousand musicians, went and brought Gur before the throne of God, coming in an otevan, prepared for the purpose, and adorned with one thousand pillars of light.</p>
 <p>5. God said: I salute thee, O Gur, in the name of Jehovih, Creator. Behold Apollo!</p>
 <p>6. Apollo stretched forth his hand, and Gur came and shook hands with him, standing by the throne. Gur said: That I have lived to see this day, O Jehovih, I am blessed indeed! Thy will, O God, and Jehovih's, be done!</p>
 <p>7. God said: Behold, the dawn of dan is within thirty days to end, and all who choose, and are prepared for the third resurrection, shall be taken up to etherea. Besides thyself, O Gur, there are two hundred thousand ethereans who have volunteered to remain another four hundred years in these atmospherean heavens, and on the earth. From them thou shalt select one thousand Lords, and bestow them with kingdoms, over mortals. Two thousand millions of angels will raise up with me to etherea.</p>
 <p>8. To thee, O Gur, I bequeath two thousand millions of atmosphereans who have been initiated in the second resurrection. And of the first resurrection, two hundred and fifty millions; and of fetals, three hundred millions; and besides these, the inhabitants of the earth (men, women and children) seven hundred millions.</p>
 <p>9. God ceased speaking, and Gur said: Thy will be done, O Jehovih! Thereupon the es'enaurs sang, and the trumpeters played the MARCH OF APOLLO, JEHOVIH'S SON. Presently, the marshals and messengers filed before the throne; and a light of golden fire came down from etherea, cast out by the Gods of Helmatia, Orian arc of Tanaya, and it fell about the throne of God, so that many could not look thereon, because of the brilliancy.</p>
 <p>10. God raised up, and Apollo by his side. God said: I stretch forth my hand unto Thee, O Jehovih! Behold Thy Son, Gur, God of Ra'yatuf, in etherea, an earth-born, forty thousand years inhabitant of Thy emancipated realms. By Thy power, and in Thy name, O Jehovih, I proclaim him God of heaven and earth, to bestow Thee and Thy kingdoms on angels and men! Be with him, O Father, Creator, that he may add unto Thy glory, forever! Amen!</p>
 <p>11. God took off the triangle, and hung it on Gur's (God's) neck, saying: I now bestow thee with the heirloom of the Gods of the red star, the triangle of the ancients. And that thou mayest be still further honored, behold, one higher than I, even Apollo, shall weave a crown for thy head.</p>
 <p>12. Apollo walked to the left hand, and raised his hand upward, and there came from unseen space a flame of yellow light, and lodged on his hand, and he turned it but half around, and lo, a crown with sparkling gems stood upon his fingers' ends. Apollo said:</p>
 <p>13. Incomprehensible All Light! Weave me a crown for Thy Son, God of heaven and earth! And even whilst <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> he spake, it was done, and he placed it on God's (Gur's) head. And God went and sat in the midst of the throne, saying: Throne of Thy throne, O Jehovih! All things are Thine! For my resting-place, to do Thy will, this shall be.</p>
 <p>14. During the ceremonies, the music was timed accordingly; and when the new God was crowned, the multitude of a thousand millions applauded with great joy.</p>
 <p>15. When all was quiet, God rose up from the throne, saying to Apollo and to him who had been God: In Jehovih's name, come and honor my throne! Accordingly, they both sat down on the right hand of God.</p>
 <p>16. God said: In thirty days the dawn of dan will end. Let the marshals, through the messengers, proclaim the resurrection of two thousand millions to the etherean heavens on that day. Proclaim it in all the heavens of the earth; inviting all to come who can; for it shall be a day of the feast of glory. But say not to any one that there hath been a change of Gods, nor that great Apollo will rise also, lest sorrow come upon the people. The marshals then selected messengers, a great number, and sent them throughout the heavens of the earth, proclaiming the commandments of God.</p>
 <p>17. God spake further, saying: For thirty days shall the Council deliberate on my ten thousand Lords, selecting and allotting them; and I will crown them in the name of the Father.</p>
 <p>18. Apollo then said: Now will I clothe myself in strange colors, that none shall know me, and during the thirty days I yet tarry, I will go around about the earth, that I may again look upon the star of my birth.</p>
 <p>19. And he who had given up the throne said: Thy joy shall be my joy also. I, too, will again visit the star of my birth.</p>
 <p>20. Accordingly, God said: Joy be unto ye twain, in Jehovih's name! Behold, I will throw a thick blanket over the throne, and ye shall change your attire, and when I withdraw it, ye shall walk forth unknown.</p>
 <p>21. And this was done.</p>
