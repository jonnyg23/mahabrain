 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter XV</h3>
 <p>1. AFTER Lika had numbered all the mortals on the earth, and all the angels in the heavens of the earth, and beheld the great darkness thereof, he visited Hao-yusta, and found it a good plateau, capable of all grades up to sixty. And Lika possessed the place and consecrated it to Jehovih; and he left thereon three hundred thousand Gods and Goddesses, who were of his etherean host. And after this he returned to Gessica, chief God, for the deliverance of the hells of De'yus, and Te-in, and Sudga, and Lika instructed him.</p>
 <p>2. Gessica had the vessels constructed with walls of fire around the margins, to prevent the drujas escaping. And there were built in all four hundred vessels, each capable of carrying <a name="page_490a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 490a</font></a> one hundred million drujas.</p>

 <font size="2"><p>Jehovih said: In Horub I delivered My first Holy Book to mortals, through My Son, Zarathustra. After that I carried the earth in darkness, that it might be perfected for the generations of men to come afterward. Thus provided I the nations which I delivered through Capilya, Moses and Chine</p></font>.
 <p> </p>
 <p>3. The manner of driving the drujas into them was by leaving part of the fire-wall open, and by fire-brands in the ethereans' hands cutting off sections of drujas from the hells. In this way the ethereans drove the drujas into the vessels, whereupon the doorway in the wall of the ship was closed. And then the workers of the ship put it under way and carried them up to Hao-yusta, where the Gods and Goddesses received them, placing the drujas in pens, walled with fire, where they could be treated and restored to reason, after which they were to be liberated in installments, according to their safety.</p>
 <p>4. In the first year Gessica delivered from the hells of hada five thousand <a name="page_491a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 491a</font></a> million drujas; but in the second year he delivered thirty-five thousand millions; and in the third year, sixteen thousand millions. After this the work went slowly on, for the balance of the hells were mostly in knots, some of them hundreds of millions. And these had to be delivered individually, requiring great labor, and power, and wisdom, and dexterity.</p>

 <font size="2"><p>Showing the es'ean position of the earth in the time of Capilya, Moses and Chine. Jehovih said: The time of My Arc of Bon shall be fourh hundred years. And it was so. And at the termination of that period, behold, the earth went into a dark region, and the Isrealites, Brahmins and Zarathustrians forsook the higher light, Jehovih, and established kings and rulers, like other nations</p></font>.
 <p> </p>
 <p>5. In the fifth month of the fourth year, Anuhasaj, alias the false Lord God, was delivered out of the great knot of hell, in which there had been eight hundred millions bound for more than four hundred years. After the manner in which Fragapatti delivered knots, even so did Gessica and his hosts, with brands of fire.</p>
 <p><a name="page_492a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 492a</font></a></p>
 <p>6. When it was known in which place De'yus (Anuhasaj) was tied, and when it was half delivered, Gessica sent for Ahura to come and have the honor of releasing Anuhasaj. And to this end Ahura labored on the knot fifty-five days, and then it was accomplished.</p>
 <p>7. But lo and behold, Anuhasaj was bereft of all judgment, crying out, unceasingly: I am not God! I am not the Lord! I am not De'yus! He was wild, crazed with fear and torments, frenzied, and in agony.</p>
 <p>8. The which Ahura, his friend, beheld; and Ahura caught him in his arms. Ahura called unto him: Anuhasaj! O my beloved! Knowest thou not me? Behold me! I am Ahura!</p>
 <p>9. But, alas, Anuhasaj knew him not; pulled away, tried to escape in fear; his protruding eyes seeing not; his ears hearing not. And he kept forever uttering: Let me go, I am not the Lord God nor De'yus! I am Anuhasaj! Then broke the good heart of Ahura, and he wept.</p>
 <p>10. Then they held Anuhasaj and carried him away into the ship, and Ahura helped to carry him.</p>
 <p>11. Then the ship rose up and sailed along higher and higher, farther and farther, till at last it came to Hao-yusta. And they took Anuhasaj to a hospital prepared for maniacs, and stretched him on his back and held him. Then called Ahura to the Gods and Goddesses to come and help him; and they came and seated themselves around about, making the sacred circle.</p>
 <p>12. And Ahura said: Light of Thy Light, Jehovih! Thou who first quickened him into being, O deliver Thou him!</p>
 <p>13. A light, like a small star, gathered before Anuhasaj's face, and this was the first thing his fixed eyes had yet seen. Then Ahura and the Gods and Goddesses sang sweetly: Behold me! I am the light! And the life! I quicken into life every living thing. Behold me! I am with thee! I am never away from thee! Thou art mine now, and forever shall be! Look upon me! I am in all things! Nothing is, nor was, nor ever shall be without me! Hear my Love! I am thy Creator! Only for love, and for love only, created I thee, my beloved.</p>
 <p>14. Anuhasaj gave a long gasp and relaxed his mighty will, then fell into a swoon, all limp and helpless. Still the Gods stood by him, waiting, watching whilst he slept awhile. And then, by signals to the es'enaurs, Ahura caused other music to steal upon the scene, to be answered by distant <a name="page_493a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 493a</font></a> trumpeters. For the space of seven days Anuhasaj slept; and all the while the Great Gods and Goddesses relaxed not their wills nor steadfast positions. And at the end of the seventh day Anuhasaj began to sing in his swoon, like one weak and out of breath, but half awake.</p>
 <p>15. How could I deny Thee, O Jehovih! Was not the evidence of mine own life before me? I raised up my voice against my Creator! I plucked Him out of my soul; from all people in heaven and earth I dispersed Him. But they that applauded me turned against me! Even as I had turned against Thee, Thou All Person!</p>
 <p>16. In my vanity I owned not that I was in Thee nor of Thee; with mine own hand I cut myself asunder from Thee, O Jehovih! O that I had perceived I was going farther and farther away; that I had known the road of life and death!</p>
 <p>17. I see Thy judgment upon me, O Jehovih! I hear Thy just decree: Whilst the name of God or Lord or Savior is worshipped on the earth I shall labor with the drujas of heaven and the druks of earth!</p>
 <p>18. A most righteous judgment, O Jehovih! Whilst I am in hell or in heaven, in hada or on the earth, will I pursue all peoples, mortals and angels, till I cast out the worship of a God and of a Lord and of a Savior. And Thou alone, Thou Great Spirit, Ever Present Person, Everlasting and Almighty, Thou shalt be All in All.</p>
 <p>19. Again Anuhasaj went off in a swoon for the space of three days, and yet the Gods and Goddesses ceased not their fixed places. And again was the music resumed till Anuhasaj awoke and again chanted in Jehovih's praise. And again he relapsed and again awoke, for many days; but at last awoke and beheld first of all Ahura. Steadily and wildly he gazed thereon, until his eyes were clouded and as if dead. And he dropped again into a swoon.</p>
 <p>20. Another day the Gods watched him, and sang for him; moved not from the sacred CIRCLE OF JEHOVIH.</p>
 <p>21. Then Anuhasaj awoke, singing: Who was it taught me to love? Ahura! Who first proclaimed Jehovih unto mine ear? Ahura! Who was the last to plead Jehovih? Ahura! Who most of all that live labored for me? Ahura!</p>
 <p>22. I broke thy heart, O Ahura! I was mad, O I was mad, Ahura! Because of thy love, Ahura, thou praisedst me; I was vain-glorious and unworthy of thee, O my beloved.</p>
 <p><a name="page_494a"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 494a</font></a></p>
 <p>23. Thy vision hath raised up before me, Ahura. Second to Jehovih, O my love? O that thou knewest I am here, penitent and heart-broken! I know thou wouldst fly to me, Ahura. Thou alone do I know, who would never desert me, sweet Ahura.</p>
 <p>24. Then again Anuhasaj relapsed into a swoon, wilted, breathless, like one that is dead. Ahura sang:</p>
 <p>25. Behold me! I am Ahura. I am come to thee from afar, O Anuhasaj. Awake and behold my love, my love. My heart is broken for thee, Anuhasaj. A thousand years I have wept for thee. O that thou couldst awake to know me!</p>
 <p>26. Anuhasaj looked up and beheld Ahura. The latter kept on singing: It is not a dream, Anuhasaj. Thy Ahura is here. Behold me! I am he. Break the spell, O Anuhasaj. By Jehovih's power put forth thy soul! Ahura is here!</p>
 <p>27. Again Anuhasaj relapsed, but not to swoon; merely closed his eyes and sang: Blessed art Thou, O Jehovih! Thou hast given me a sweet vision! Thou hast shown me the face of my love, Ahura! His sweet voice fell upon mine ear! I am blessed, O Jehovih!</p>
 <p>28. Even these hells hast thou blessed, O Jehovih! The darkness of endless death is made light by Thine Almighty touch. Thou alone shalt be my song forever. Thou alone my theme of delight. Jehovih forever! Jehovih forever and forever!</p>
 <p>29. Then Ahura, seeing the spell was broken, said: Arise, O Anuhasaj. I will sing with thee. Behold Ahura, thy love is before thee. This is no vision. Come thou to the arms of thy love.</p>
 <p>30. And he raised Anuhasaj up, and he awoke fully, but trembling and weak, and knew understandingly.</p>
