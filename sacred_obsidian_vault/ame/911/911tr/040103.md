 			<p>MR. KEAN:  As we start I want to do
 
          two things.  One is to make part of the 
  
          permanent record    we have a statement here 
  
          from Senator Lieberman, who sent in a statement
 
          to make part of our record, and a statement 
  
          from Chris Chez from Connecticut.  We will make
 
          both those statements part of the permanent 
  
          record.
 
 			</p><p>I also want to recognize people who
 
          should have been recognized yesterday, I think, 
  
          because they are absolutely vital to our work.
 
          Phil Zelikow, our Executive Director who is 
  
          behind me with Chris Kojm, Deputy Director and 
  
          Dan Marcus, who is General Counsel.  They are
 
          absolutely essential, and will be, to our work.
 
 			</p><p>I want to recognize, as well,
 
          Stephanie Kaplan and Tracey Shycoff, who did 
  
          all the work really to put these hearings 
  
          together these two days.
 
 			</p><p>Our first panel this morning is on 
  
          borders, money and transportation security.
 
 			</p><p>Let me see, we are missing one person 
  
          I thought was going to be here.  Alright, so 
  
          going in order    no, I'm alright, I am looking
 
          at the wrong one.
 
 			</p><p>We start out with Glenn Fine, unless
 
          you have some sort of order you all would like 
  
          to go in?
 
 			</p><p>(Pause.)
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Okay, from the U.S. 
  
          Department of Justice.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice 
  
          Chairman, and Members of the National 
  
          Commission, I appreciate the opportunity to
 
          testify before the Commission about the work of 
  
          the Department of Justice Office of the
 
          Inspector General on border security issues. 
  
          Both before and after the September 11 
  
          terrorist attacks, we have focused much of our 
  
          resources on these and other national security 
  
          issues in the Department of Justice.
 
 			</p><p>Today, I will describe findings from 
  
          several of these reviews that examined programs 
  
          in the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
 
          That agency had responsibility for immigration 
  
          and border security issues until March 1, 2003,
 
          when it was transferred into the new Department 
  
          of Homeland Security.
 
 			</p><p>At the outset of my remarks, I want to
 
          stress that while we have noted serious 
  
          deficiencies over the years in various INS
 
          operations, this should in no way diminish the 
  
          important work of thousands of INS employees, 
  
          now DHS employees.  Most of them perform
 
          diligently, under very difficult circumstances, 
  
          and their mission is critical to the security
 
          of our country.  Yet, our reviews have revealed 
  
          significant problems that left gaps in the 
  
          INS's attempts to secure the nation's borders.
 
 			</p><p>In one important review, we examined 
  
          the INS's contacts with two September 11
 
          terrorists   Mohamed Atta and Marwan Alshehhi. 
  
          We investigated how these two were admitted in 
  
          the United States.  We also examined how, six
 
          months after the terrorist attacks, a Florida 
  
          flight school received notification that Atta
 
          and Alshehhi's applications to change their 
  
          immigration status from "visitors" to 
  
          "students" had been approved.  The mailing of
 
          these forms raised serious concerns about the 
  
          INS's tracking of foreign students in the
 
          United States.
 
 			</p><p>With regard to Atta and Alshehhi's 
  
          entries into the U.S., the evidence did not
 
          show that the inspectors who admitted them 
  
          violated INS policies and practices.
 
 			</p><p>However, our review found that the 
  
          adjudication of their change of status 
  
          applications was untimely and significantly 
  
          flawed.  The INS took more that 10 months to 
  
          adjudicate the applications, well after Atta
 
          and Alshehhi had finished their training course 
  
          at the Florida flight school.  In addition, the 
  
          INS adjudicator who approved their applications
 
          did so without adequate information, including 
  
          the fact that they had left the country twice
 
          after filing their applications, which meant 
  
          they had abandoned their request for a change 
  
          of status.
 
 			</p><p>We also found that historically the 
  
          INS has devoted little attention to monitoring
 
          foreign students, and its paper based tracking 
  
          system was inefficient, inaccurate, and 
  
          unreliable.  The new internet based foreign
 
          student tracking system, called SEVIS,  has the 
  
          potential to dramatically improve the foreign
 
          student program.
 
 			</p><p>Last month, the OIG completed a 
  
          follow up review to assess the INS's progress 
  
          in implementing the SEVIS system.  We found 
  
          that while the INS has made progress, the
 
          system is not fully implemented.  Significant 
  
          deficiencies remain, such as a lack of adequate 
  
          oversight and training of contractors hired to
 
          conduct site visits of schools, and a lack of 
  
          procedures to identify and refer potential
 
          fraud for enforcement action.
 
 			</p><p>In my written statement, I describe in 
  
          greater detail a series of other reviews that
 
          the OIG has conducted on border security 
  
          issues.  One review examined the INS's efforts
 
          to prevent illegal immigration along the 
  
          northern border.  Until recently, the INS 
  
          devoted significant resources to deterring
 
          illegal immigration along the southwest border, 
  
          but did not focus such attention on the
 
          northern border.  For example, as late as 1999, 
  
          only 311 of the national total of approximately 
  
          8,000 Border Patrol agents were assigned to the 
           northern border.  We concluded that the level 
  
          of illegal activity on the northern border
 
          clearly exceeded the Border Patrol's capacity 
  
          to respond.
 
 			</p><p>After September 11, we issued a
 
          follow up review that found the INS had made 
  
          some improvements to enhance the security of
 
          the northern border.  However, we concluded 
  
          that increased staffing and resources for the 
  
          northern border continued to be a critical
 
          need.
 
 			</p><p>We also have conducted other reviews
 
          related to border security.  For example: We 
  
          reviewed the INS's record in deporting aliens 
  
          who have been issued final orders of removal.
 
          We found that the INS removed 92 percent of 
  
          detained aliens with final removal orders, but
 
          only 13 percent of non detained aliens.
 
 			</p><p>In addition, we reviewed the Visa 
  
          Waiver Program which allows visitors from 28 
           countries to enter the U.S. without first 
  
          obtaining a visa.  We found that INS inspectors
 
          did not check passports of all of these 
  
          visitors against the INS's computerized lookout 
  
          system, and that the use of stolen passports
 
          from some of these visa waiver countries 
  
          presented a serious problem.
 
 			</p><p>A theme we found repeated in many of 
  
          our reviews was that the INS's information 
  
          technology systems needed significant
 
          improvement.  Many OIG reviews have questioned 
  
          the reliability of the INS's information
 
          systems and the accuracy of the data produced 
  
          by them.
 
 			</p><p>In addition, INS information systems
 
          are not always integrated with other agencies' 
  
          systems.  For example, the INS and the FBI
 
          developed their agency's automated fingerprint 
  
          identification systems separately, and full 
  
          integration of the systems remains years away. 
 			</p><p> I also want to mention, briefly, one 
  
          other review that, while not addressing border
 
          security issues, does relate squarely to the 
  
          Commission's work.
 
 			</p><p>At the request of FBI Director Mueller
 
          in June 2002, we initiated a review to examine 
  
          aspects of the FBI's handling of intelligence
 
          information prior to the September 11 attacks. 
  
          Our review focuses on how the FBI handled an 
  
          electronic communication written by an agent in
 
          its Phoenix office regarding extremists 
  
          attending flight schools in Arizona.  Our
 
          review also is examining aspects of the FBI's 
  
          handling of the Moussaoui investigation and its 
  
          handling of other intelligence before September
 
          11.  I believe the final results of this review 
  
          will be useful to the Commission, and we intend
 
          to cooperate fully with your review of these 
  
          subjects.
 
 			</p><p>Based on the significant body of work 
           by the OIG during the last several years, I 
  
          believe there are several broad themes that the
 
          Commission may want to examine relating to 
  
          border security.
 
 			</p><p>First, information and intelligence
 
          sharing among all levels of government remains 
  
          a critical component of the effort to prevent
 
          terrorist attacks in the United States. 
  
          Without adequate intelligence, the ability of 
  
          front line employees to screen effectively
 
          those who seek to enter the country is limited.
 
 			</p><p>Second, our reviews have found that
 
          the current systems for identifying when aliens 
  
          enter and leave the country are clearly 
  
          inadequate.  Implementing an effective
 
          entry exit tracking system is a daunting 
  
          challenge that will require substantial efforts
 
          and a large investment of resources.
 
 			</p><p>Third, we encourage the Commission to 
  
          focus on the often overlooked issue of human 
           capital.  To fulfill its mission, the 
  
          Department of Homeland Security must have
 
          sufficiently trained immigration staff and 
  
          supervisors.  Historically, this has been a 
  
          challenge for the INS.
 
 			</p><p>Fourth, I think it is also important to 
  
          note that timely and consistent processing of
 
          the millions of benefit applications has been a 
  
          longstanding problem for the INS, and now for 
  
          the DHS.  An enhanced focus on border security
 
          should not override this important 
  
          service related responsibility.
 
 			</p><p>And finally, the transfer of the INS 
  
          to the Department of Homeland Security presents 
  
          enormous management challenges.  The transfer
 
          will not, in itself, resolve the issues I have 
  
          identified today.  Solutions to border security
 
          issues will require innovation and aggressive 
  
          management oversight.
 
 			</p><p>In sum, I believe that these border 
           security issues present many potential areas 
  
          for the Commission to examine in the months
 
          head.  We will be pleased to provide any 
  
          information or assistance to the Commission as 
  
          it performs this critically important task.
 
 			</p><p>That concludes my statement.  I would 
  
          be pleased to answer any questions.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I think we will do the 
  
          panel and come back, probably with questions.
 
 			</p><p>Lee Wolosky from Boies, Schiller &amp;
 
          Flexner, come in.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Thank you for inviting
 
          me to testify before you on the subject of 
  
          terrorist financing.  It is an honor and a 
  
          privilege to be able to appear before you
 
          today.
 
 			</p><p>Unlike other terrorist leaders, Osama
 
          bin Laden is neither a military hero, a 
  
          religious authority, or an obvious 
  
          representative of the downtrodden and 
           disillusioned.  Rather he is a rich financier. 
  
          He built al Qaeda's financial network from the
 
          foundation of a system originally designed to 
  
          channel resources to the mujahadeen fighting 
  
          the Soviets in Afghanistan the 1980s.
 
 			</p><p>Thanks to the leadership of the Bush 
  
          administration that network has been disrupted,
 
          but it has certainly not been destroyed.  And 
  
          as long as al Qaeda retains access to a viable 
  
          financial network, it will remain a lethal threat
 
          to the United States.
 
 			</p><p>Like al Qaeda itself, its financial
 
          network is deliberately compartmentalized, and 
  
          is characterized by layers and redundancies. 
  
          Al Qaeda raises money from a variety of sources
 
          and moves money in a variety of manners.  It 
  
          runs businesses operating under the cloak of
 
          legitimacy and criminal conspiracies ranging 
  
          from the petty to the grand.  The most 
  
          important source of al Qaeda's money, however, 
           is its continuous fund raising efforts.
 
 			</p><p>Al Qaeda's global fund raising network
 
          is built upon a foundation of charities, 
  
          nongovernment organizations, mosques, Muslim 
  
          community centers, web sites, intermediaries,
 
          facilitators and banks and other financial 
  
          institutions.  Some whose money goes to
 
          al Qaeda know full well the illicit and violent 
  
          purposes that it will further.  Other donors 
  
          believe their money will fund legitimate
 
          humanitarian efforts, but the money is 
  
          nonetheless diverted to al Qaeda.  For years,
 
          individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia 
  
          have been the most important source of funds 
  
          for al Qaeda.
 
 			</p><p>Al Qaeda moves its funds through the 
  
          global financial system, the Islamic banking
 
          system, and the underground hawala system, 
  
          among other money transfer mechanisms.  It uses 
  
          its global network of businesses and charities 
           as a cover for moving funds.  And it uses such 
  
          time honored methods as bulk cash smuggling and
 
          the global trade in gold and other commodities 
  
          to both move and store value.
 
 			</p><p>Following September 11, 2001, the Bush
 
          administration, building on the policies of the 
  
          previous administration, undertook tactical
 
          actions to disrupt particular individual nodes 
  
          in the terrorist financial network and 
  
          strategic initiatives to change the environment
 
          within which terrorists raise and move funds.
 
 			</p><p>Tactical initiatives include law
 
          enforcement and intelligence activities, along 
  
          with public designations under the 
  
          International Emergency Economic Powers Act
 
          (IEEPA) of persons, businesses, and financial 
  
          institutions associated with the financial
 
          network of al Qaeda and other terrorist 
  
          organizations.
 
 			</p><p>Since much of the subject matter is 
           highly classified, the effectiveness of 
  
          tactical measures is difficult to determine.
 
          Clearly, there have been successes, such as the 
  
          recent action targeting the al-Farooq mosque 
  
          just across the East River from here.
 
          Successes have been made possible due to 
  
          markedly improved law enforcement and tactical
 
          intelligence cooperation from foreign states 
  
          since September 11.
 
 			</p><p>By contract, progress in the strategic
 
          arena, in my judgement, has simply not been 
  
          made a high enough priority.  Far too many key
 
          countries, including virtually all in the 
  
          Middle East and South Asia, still have in place 
  
          ineffective or rudimentary bank supervisory and
 
          anti money laundering regimes.  In no country, 
  
          including the United States, are either Islamic
 
          charities or the underground hawala system 
  
          effectively regulated.
 
 			</p><p>Fundamentally, U.S. efforts to curtail 
           the financing of terrorism are impeded not only 
  
          by a lack of institutional capacity abroad, but
 
          by a lack of political will among key foreign 
  
          partners.  Some have a history of ignoring the 
  
          problem.  Some perceive, correctly or
 
          incorrectly, that the U.S.'s attention on the 
  
          subject has waned.  Some simply disagree with
 
          the U.S. view of the nature and severity of the 
  
          problem.
 
 			</p><p>Confronted with this lack of political
 
          will, the current administration, in my view, 
  
          has not made full use of all relevant and legal
 
          policy tools at its disposal.  For example, 
  
          punitive provisions of Title III of the USA 
  
          PATRIOT ACT enable the Executive Branch to
 
          restrict or prohibit access to the U.S. 
  
          financial system for foreign states or foreign
 
          financial institutions that lack adequate 
  
          anti money laundering regimes.  This powerful 
  
          tool remains unused in a terrorist financing 
           context.
 
 			</p><p>Finally, I would like to say a few
 
          words about the war in Iraq, which I support, 
  
          but which I fear may retard progress on these 
  
          critical issues.
 
 			</p><p>Even supporters of the war must 
  
          concede that the United States has not
 
          effectively justified the war to many members 
  
          of the international community.
 
 			</p><p>This state of affairs may set back
 
          ongoing U.S. efforts to fight terrorism. 
  
          Terrorist financing is a transnational problem
 
          requiring transnational solutions.  In almost 
  
          all cases, the money trail leads or originates 
  
          overseas.  Curtailing terrorist financing
 
          therefore requires comprehensive law 
  
          enforcement and intelligence cooperation with
 
          foreign states.
 
 			</p><p>Political commitment defines the 
  
          nature and scope of that cooperation.  An 
           internationally unpopular war may make the 
  
          necessary commitment more difficult.
 
 			</p><p>At the same time, the diplomatic 
  
          imperatives of fighting a war in Iraq may have 
  
          bumped terrorist financing down the bilateral
 
          agenda with critical front line states.  By all 
  
          external indications, the Saudis and other
 
          front line states have not taken sufficient 
  
          steps to change the strategic environment that 
  
          funds extremism.  Appropriate regulation of
 
          charities, hawala and the formal banking 
  
          system, along with the reining in of the
 
          madrassa educational system, among other 
  
          things, requires a fundamental commitment to 
  
          long term structural reform.  While laws,
 
          regulations and decrees are difficult to come 
  
          by, there is no credible evidence that
 
          comprehensive structural reform is taking 
  
          place.
 
 			</p><p>And yet we do not appear to be holding 
           the Saudis' feet to the fire.  Rather than 
  
          speaking out loudly and forcefully about their
 
          and other states' failure to take steps 
  
          necessary to assure U.S. security, the United 
  
          States remains publicly silent on these issues,
 
          no doubt captive to the near term diplomatic 
  
          imperatives of waging war, and assuring the
 
          basing and overflight rights, along with the 
  
          petroleum production commitments, that are 
  
          necessary or desirable in connection with that
 
          undertaking.
 
 			</p><p>Thank you very much.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Dillingham is from 
  
          Civil Aviation and General Accounting Office.
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Hamilton, 
  
          Members of the Commission, thank you for
 
          inviting GAO to participate in this very 
  
          important national forum.
 
 			</p><p>As many of you know, GAO is the 
           investigative arm of the United States 
  
          Congress.  Over the years our reports have been
 
          a key source of information about the security 
  
          of the nations transportation system.
 
 			</p><p>In June of 2000 we reported that the
 
          terrorist threat of attacks using aircraft was 
  
          a persistent and growing concern for the United
 
          States.  The report also said that the trend in 
  
          terrorism against targets was towards large 
  
          scale incidents designed for maximum
 
          destruction, terror and media impact.  Fifteen 
  
          months later 9/11 happened.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I have submitted a 
  
          formal statement, for the record.  This morning 
  
          I would like to summarize that statement around
 
          two questions.  First, how has transportation 
  
          security changed since 9/11?  And second, where
 
          do we go from here?
 
 			</p><p>Regarding the first question about 
  
          changes since September 11.  Overall I think 
           the nation has come a long way.  Before 9/11 
  
          security was never treated as a national
 
          priority and it had never gotten the kind of 
  
          attention or resources that it receives today. 
  
          We now have a federal agency whose primary
 
          mission is ensuring security for all modes of 
  
          transportation.  That agency is the
 
          Transportation Security Administration.  TSA is 
  
          the largest agency within the new Department of 
  
          Homeland Security.
 
 			</p><p>During the first 18 months of its 
  
          existence the primary focus of TSA has been in aviation 
  
          security.  Before 9/11 the airlines, the 
  
          airports and the federal aviation
 
          administration were all in charge of some 
  
          aspect of aviation security.  Unfortunately, as
 
          is often the case, when everybody is in charge, 
  
          no one is really in charge and things can and 
  
          did fall through the cracks. 
 			</p><p> Prior to 9/11 the very critical task 
  
          of passenger and baggage screening, what was
 
          referred to as the last line of defense, was 
  
          being handled by persons who were not properly 
  
          trained, who were not properly supervised,
 
          whose salaries were not even competitive with 
  
          the salaries of nearby fast food restaurants,
 
          and who had probably got the job less than six 
  
          months.
 
 			</p><p>Now most of the security screeners have been
 
          federalized.  The question is whether screening 
  
          is better because the staff are now federal
 
          employees.  I submit to you that screening 
  
          probably is better, but not because workers are 
  
          federal employees.  Screening is better because
 
          the workers are more skilled, because they are 
  
          receiving a decent wage and because they are
 
          getting better training and supervision.
 
 			</p><p>However, I want to point out that the 
  
          TSA reports that since it took over screening 
           they have confiscated literally millions of 
  
          prohibited items.  I know that you have seen in
 
          the media, earlier on, about knitting needles 
  
          and scissors and things of that nature.  We are 
  
          not talking about those kind of things.  We are
 
          talking about over a million knives and box 
  
          cutters.  We are talking about more than a
 
          thousand firearms.
 
 			</p><p>Since 9/11 there is a long list of 
  
          security initiatives that have been undertaken.
 
          Some of which are classified and some of which 
  
          are widely publicized, such as all baggage
 
          being screened before it goes on the aircraft, 
  
          the installation of reinforced cockpit doors, 
  
          and the presence of thousands of Federal Air
 
          Marshals.
 
 			</p><p>In spite of all that has been
 
          accomplished, there are still vulnerabilities 
  
          and occasional lapses in the aviation security 
  
          system.  The system is far from perfect and a 
           hundred percent secure.  I submit to you that 
  
          occasional lapse will probably continue to
 
          occur.  The goal should be perfection, but 
  
          there should also be a recognition that 
  
          perfection is not attainable.  The question is,
 
          are we doing as much as practicable to move 
  
          towards that goal?
 
 			</p><p>I think for the most part the answer 
  
          is yes.  With most of the goals that Congress 
  
          set for TSA regarding aviation security now
 
          behind them, TSA is in the very early stages of 
  
          working with the other transportation modes to
 
          enhance security in those modes.
 
 			</p><p>Unlike the direct and pervasive role 
  
          it played with regard to aviation, TSA
 
          envisions serving more as a transportation 
  
          system security manager for the other modes.
 
          TSA will establish security standards and 
  
          facilitate coordination and collaboration 
  
          across the six transportation modes.  TSA has 
           also provided some relatively small amounts of 
  
          money to the other modes for security projects.
 
 			</p><p>For the most part, state and local 
  
          authorities and the private sector, in 
  
          collaboration with a variety of federal
 
          agencies, such as the Coast Guard, Customs and 
  
          federal law enforcement agencies, have been
 
          responsible for as much of what has been done 
  
          to improve security in the other modes.  These 
  
          improvements have largely been a few new
 
          security initiatives or increased frequency of 
  
          existing activities.
 
 			</p><p>The new initiatives are activities 
  
          such as conducting vulnerability assessments, in 
  
          establishing first response teams.  The
 
          increased frequency type activities includes 
  
          things like additional training for emergency
 
          preparedness and revising emergency plans and 
  
          conducting emergency drills.
 
 			</p><p>The bottom line is that actions are 
           being taken and some progress is being made 
  
          towards securing the nation's transportation
 
          system.  But what could be considered as 
  
          constituting an effective overall multi modal 
  
          transportation security environment, may very
 
          well be years away.
 
 			</p><p>Turning to our last question.  Where
 
          do we go from here and how do we get there?
 
 			</p><p>The nation faces a very difficult and 
  
          resource intensive task to secure the
 
          transportation system.  I would like to offer 
  
          some thoughts and observations of where we need
 
          to go to move closer to the goal.
 
 			</p><p>First, we must recognize that it is 
  
          not possible to anticipate and counter every
 
          risk.  Priorities must be assigned with time 
  
          and money devoted to those threats and hazards
 
          that are best established and most likely to 
  
          cause the most harm.  In short, we need to plan 
  
          and act strategically. 
 			</p><p> Second, effective coordination must be 
  
          established among the many public and private
 
          entities responsible for transportation 
  
          security.
 
 			</p><p>Third, terrorists are creative.  We
 
          need to address a significant proportion of our 
  
          energies to identifying possible new terrorist
 
          risks and threats rather than simply preparing 
  
          for the last type of attack that occurred.  And 
  
          in the final analysis, transportation security,
 
          which is crucial to our nation, it must be 
  
          considered in the larger context of other
 
          national priorities and weighed and supported 
  
          accordingly.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman and Members of the
 
          Commission, this is very much a 
  
          work in progress and much needs to be done.
 
          The GAO stands ready to help.
 
 			</p><p>Thank you very much.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Dillingham. Commissioner Gorelick.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you, Mr.
 
          Chairman.  I would like address my first couple 
  
          of questions to Inspector General Fine.
 
 			</p><p>First of all, I would like to say we
 
          have a very able and talented public servant in 
  
          Glenn Fine.  We are very happy to have you here
 
          today, and very pleased that you are doing your 
  
          job in the Justice Department.
 
 			</p><p>First question, I understand that the
 
          CIA launched an internal review immediately 
  
          after 9/11 of its conduct before 9/11.  Did the
 
          Justice Department do the same thing?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  No.  The Justice Department 
  
          did not do a broad after action report similar
 
          to what you describe with the CIA.  Initially 
  
          the Justice Department deferred to the Joint
 
          Intelligence Committee which was doing a broad 
  
          review that looked at the actions of various 
  
          Federal Government agencies, including the 
           Justice Department and others.  After that, it 
  
          has deferred to this Commission to do that broad
 
          review.
 
 			</p><p>However, also the Inspector General, 
  
          Department of Justice, my office, has done a
 
          series of reviews on national security issues, 
  
          some of which I describe in my report in my
 
          written testimony, others on the FBI.
 
 			</p><p>In addition when we have been 
  
          confronted with particular issues such as the
 
          Atta and Alshehhi visa issue or change of 
  
          application issue, we have done reviews on
 
          that.  In June, as I mentioned, of last year at 
  
          the request of Director Mueller we launched a 
  
          review on how the FBI handled the intelligence
 
          information related to the September 11 attacks. 
  
          So we are doing that kind of review.  But the
 
          broad after action review similar to the CIA has 
  
          not been undertaken by the Justice Department 
  
          itself. 
 			</p><p> MS. GORELICK:  Thank you.  My second 
  
          question is this.  As I read your report, I see
 
          very different reviews occurring for a 
  
          foreigner who wants to come into this country 
  
          as a student, depending on what route he takes.
 
 			</p><p>So could you contrast, for example, a 
  
          foreigner who wants to come into this country
 
          as a student, but who applies for a visa in a 
  
          visa waiver country, comes in as a visitor and 
  
          then tries to change his status to a student
 
          status, which would allow him to stay longer, 
  
          versus, someone who applies to be a student
 
          from a non waiver country and goes through the 
  
          consular process for a student waiver.  Could 
  
          you describe the two?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Sure.  It is a different 
  
          review process.
 
 			</p><p>For the student who applies abroad in 
  
          his or her own country, they have to show ties 
  
          to the country, their own country, and show an 
           indication that they will return to the country 
  
          afterwards.  They have to show financial means,
 
          they have to show that they have been accepted 
  
          at an accredited school in the United States, 
  
          and normally, although not always, they
 
          normally go through an interview process with 
  
          consular officer.  As a result they get a
 
          student visa.  They come to the United States. 
  
          They present the visa to the immigration 
  
          inspector at the port of entry, and they enter
 
          into the United States and take up studies.
 
 			</p><p>That is a different process than a
 
          foreign student who did not get visa abroad but 
  
          who comes to the United States on a visitor 
  
          visa or who may come to the United States
 
          without a visa because they are from one of the 
  
          28 visa waiver countries.  So they enter the
 
          United States either with a visitor visa or 
  
          without a visa from a visa waiver country, and 
  
          in the United States they then apply to change 
           their status to student.
 
 			</p><p>In the United States it is largely a
 
          paper process.  They fill out the I 589 form. 
  
          They show they have been accepted by a school. 
  
          They show financial means, and then the INS
 
          adjudicates their status on paper without an 
  
          interview.  Also, prior to September 11, as we
 
          found in the Atta and Alshehhi case, without 
  
          even checks of the database that would show 
  
          what their status was when they applied to the
 
          United States.  So it is a different process 
  
          depending on which route they take.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  So if you are clever, 
  
          you can figure out a way to come into this 
  
          country and stay for a substantial period of
 
          time without anyone ever interviewing you as to 
  
          the appropriateness of that occurring?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  It is possible to do that.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Has that changed since 
  
          September 11? 
 			</p><p> MR. FINE:  It has not markedly changed 
  
          since September 11, particularly from the visa
 
          waiver countries.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Mr. Dillingham, did you 
  
          want to add something?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, I did.  To the 
  
          best of our knowledge, the State Department is
 
          denying student visas to people who want to come in to 
  
          study flying in the United States.  That, in 
  
          fact, has changed.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  I'm glad to hear that.
 
 			</p><p>One other general question for you,
 
          Mr. Fine.  What is the state of connectivity 
  
          between the intelligence community and INS 
  
          today, INS either at the Justice Department or
 
          at the Department of Homeland Security?  How 
  
          much information flows between the Intelligence
 
          Community and those who are guarding our 
  
          borders and vice versa?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Connectivity is better than 
           it was in the past.  Now immigration inspectors 
  
          and INS officials do connect through their own
 
          databases, through the interagency or board 
  
          information system to State Department
  
          databases, the class database, tip off systems,
 
          and in those databases is intelligence 
  
          information provided by intelligence agencies.
 
 			</p><p>In addition, the INS has more direct 
  
          contacts with the intelligence agencies through 
  
          their Office of Intelligence.  However, the
 
          information is often unclassified, often 
  
          sometimes vague and not in a particular usable
 
          form, we have been told by some immigration 
  
          inspectors.  I think that is a critical issue, 
  
          that this Commission and the government needs
 
          to look at.  The connectivity of information. 
  
          The integration of the systems and the ability
 
          to get usable information, usable intelligence 
  
          information to the front line employees who 
  
          need to use that information to screen people 
           who come to the United States.  Without that it 
  
          is an enormously difficult job that they do.
 
 			MS. GORELICK:  Thank you very much.
 
 			MR. KEAN: Mr. Gorton.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Mr. Fine, assuming that 
  
          in 2001 the INS have been substantially better 
  
          funded, maybe twice as much money, and equally
 
          more efficient in carrying on its duties.  How 
  
          many of the 19 hijackers could have been in the
 
          United States or would have perfectly valid 
  
          first entry into the United States, in any 
  
          event?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  That actually, I think, is 
  
          speculative and I can't really answer that
 
          question.
 
 			</p><p>What we do know is that many of them, 
  
          most of them, entered into the United States
 
          with valid visas and the immigration inspectors 
  
          did not have any information or intelligence
 
          that would change the outcome of their 
  
          inspection of them.
 
 			</p><p>So for that it is hard to say what the 
           difference would have been had the INS been 
  
          better funded or had more information, but I do
 
          think it is an important issue that needs to be 
  
          addressed going forward.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  I take it then that most,
 
          if not all of them, could at least have had a 
  
          first entry into the United States as visitors
 
          even if the INS had been much more efficient?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  That's correct, and really 
  
          the issue there is the State Department.  The
 
          State Department's interviews of them, giving 
  
          visas to them, and my understanding is   
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  But they wouldn't have 
  
          required interviews at all if they were just 
  
          coming here first as tourists, would they?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Pardon me?
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Would they not have
 
          required interviews at all if they were just 
  
          coming here first as tourists?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  From some countries they 
           would have, yes.  From the visa waiver 
  
          countries they wouldn't have required
 
          interviews.  But many of them came from non 
  
          visa waiver countries such as Saudi Arabia and 
  
          elsewhere, where they did require interviews.
 
 			</p><p>The Inspector General of the 
  
          Department of State has looked at that and from
 
          my understanding of it, has indicated that 
  
          there were some gaps in the processing of those 
  
          19 terrorists for their visas, but that's an
 
          issue for the State Department's Inspector 
  
          General.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  The question is basically 
  
          leading to this.  I think you have pointed out 
  
          very eloquently, particularly in your written
 
          statement, the INS or any similar agency 
  
          doesn't exist simply to keep people out.  It
 
          exists in order to let the right people in, 
  
          whether they are tourists, full time 
  
          immigrants, doing business here, or anything 
           else.  One of your statistics is 500 million 
  
          particular contacts at one time or another.
 
 			</p><p>So I guess my question is, how much 
  
          can we realistically expect to increase safety 
  
          and the exclusion of dangerous aliens simply by
 
          a more efficient bureaucracy or homeland 
  
          security agency, and how uch for providing for the safety
 
          of the people of the United States, is on the 
  
          laps of Congress perhaps to make different 
  
          policies and to make the system less complex
 
          and easier to administer than it is.
 
 			</p><p>Does the Department of Justice have
 
          views on that subject?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Well, I am not sure I can 
  
          speak for the Department of Justice per se, but
 
          I do believe the issues need to be addressed at 
  
          all levels.  It can't simply be looking at the
 
          INS and the end product of the process, saying all 
  
          the onus or burden goes upon them.  There does 
  
          have to be a look at how to allow the flow of 
           travellers and commerce across our borders, but 
  
          in a way that attempts to screen out ones who
 
          shouldn't be here.
 
 			</p><p>Perhaps through trusted traveller 
  
          lanes, or ways to increase the ability of cargo
 
          to be inspected in advance.  So that is an 
  
          important issue.  There are policy issues that
 
          the United States Congress has to look at as 
  
          well.
 
 			</p><p>What we have looked at is the INS's
 
          aspect of it and we have found deficiencies.  I 
  
          am not saying that is the sole problem in
 
          protecting our country.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  One more question of that 
  
          nature, you spoke of the 28 visa waiver
 
          countries in your written testimony, at least. 
  
          You speak to the fact that there is a great
 
          deal of theft of passports from those 
  
          countries.  Of course they are, in a sense, 
  
          valid passports.  Is there any practical 
           solution to that problem?  Obviously from very 
  
          friendly countries a visa waiver is probably a
 
          good policy decision, but how do we prevent the 
  
          misuse of visa waiver passports?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  I think there are several
 
          ways to do that.  One is to ensure that those 
  
          countries have better accountability of their
 
          passports, and if their passports are being 
  
          stolen we might want to look to see whether 
  
          those countries should remain in the visa
 
          waiver program.
 
 			</p><p>Secondly, once those passports were
 
          stolen they have to be reported so that the 
  
          numbers of those passports can be entered into 
  
          lookout systems, and when someone travelling
 
          with that passport shows up at a port of entry, 
  
          an INS inspector can check the database, see
 
          that it's a stolen passport, see that it is 
  
          illegitimate and stop that person.
 
 			</p><p>What we found in our reviews is that 
           foreign countries sometimes   
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  How are we going to
 
          determine whether the passport was stolen?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  By the foreign country 
  
          having clear internal controls about passports.
 
          They know they are missing, they know they are 
  
          stolen.  They report it to the United States.
 
          It is entered into a look out system, and then 
  
          we can stop people trying to use those 
  
          passports.  That's what happens, but we found
 
          that is not happening on a consistent basis and 
  
          in come cases the INS inspectors didn't even
 
          check the look out systems to determine whether 
  
          the passport had been reported as stolen.  That 
  
          is one thing that we can do.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Let me follow up on 
  
          that and then move to more questions of Mr.
 
          Wolosky and Mr. Dillingham.
 
 			</p><p>The INS, as I understand from your 
  
          report and my own experience, has utilized 
           biometric measures for the identification of 
  
          individuals trying to come into this country
 
          which, obviously, are harder to forge than a 
  
          passport, and certainly harder to steal.
 
 			</p><p>Do you see a future in the utilization
 
          more broadly of biometric measures as a form of 
  
          identity checks at our borders?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Yes, I do.  I think it is 
  
          critical.  Names can be changed.  Names can be 
  
          misspelled.  Names are not a full enough
 
          identifier.  There does need to be some use of 
  
          biometrics to ensure that the person showing up
 
          at the border is the person that received the 
  
          visa, and also that the person is who he or she 
  
          says he is.
 
 			</p><p>So, yes, biometrics are clearly needed 
  
          to be incorporated into our identification
 
          systems.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Finally, you have 
  
          raised serious questions about the visa waiver 
           program.  In your professional opinion, should 
  
          that program be continued?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  I think the visa waiver 
  
          program does have significant benefits.  It is 
  
          a policy question whether those benefits
 
          outweigh the costs, and I am not in a position 
  
          to say that the program should be discontinued.
 
          But I do think the countries that are in it 
  
          should be carefully screened and held 
  
          accountable to ensure that the appropriate
 
          measures, that its passports are not being 
  
          fraudulently used.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Have we ever picked up a 
  
          suspected terrorist who came here on a stolen 
  
          passport from a visa waiver country?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Yes, we have.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  I would like to ask Mr.
 
          Dillingham a couple of questions, not just 
  
          about aviation security, but as I understand 
  
          it, you previously were director of physical 
           infrastructure issues, generally, at the GAO.
 
 			</p><p>There have been published reports that
 
          the Transportation Security Administration has 
  
          poured, in fact, more resources into aviation 
  
          security than perhaps we are needing at the
 
          moment.  Yet we hear that there is not the same 
  
          degree of attention being paid to our ports, to
 
          container shipments, to bridges, to tunnels. 
  
          And as you have said, if everyone is in charge, 
  
          no one is in charge.
 
 			</p><p>You have contrasted the way in which 
  
          TSA is approaching its role in aviation
 
          security with what, I think you have described 
  
          as, a more management role setting standards, 
  
          creating a collaborative role with all of the
 
          many parties who have responsibilities for all 
  
          of these other transportation modes.
 
 			</p><p>Could you comment on whether the 
  
          resources are adequate to maintain and increase 
  
          our security in these other areas of 
           transportation, and whether the management 
  
          structure that you have described is adequate?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes.  I think, 
  
          without a doubt, there has been 
  
          disproportionate resources applied to aviation.
 
          Aviation is different from the rest of the 
  
          modes in that there was a Federal, a large
 
          Federal presence associated with aviation prior 
  
          to 9/11.  It was, of course, the FAA.
 
 			</p><p>The other modes are also different in
 
          their characteristics. Mass transit, for 
  
          example, is very hard to secure because of the
 
          nature of it.  It's large, it has to be open. 
  
          There are lots of ways to get into it.
 
 			</p><p>Ports, a huge undertaking needs to be
 
          done, but there is also this sort of mix of 
  
          stakeholders, local, state and federal players
 
          with regard to some of these other modes of 
  
          transportation.  Clearly, there is a gap 
  
          between what has been done for aviation and 
           what needs to be done for the rest of the 
  
          modes.  Money is a big issue.
 
 			</p><p>Just by example, we came up from 
  
          Washington on the Amtrack.  We came through a 
  
          very heavily populated northeast corridor, and
 
          to my knowledge there was no metal detector 
  
          check.  There was no screening to speak of, and
 
          we pulled in under Penn Station.
 
 			</p><p>That could have been a very bad 
  
          situation.  A situation that occurred in
 
          Baltimore a year or so ago with a chemical fire 
  
          on a freight train.  All of this points to the
 
          notion that there are definite gaps, whether 
  
          there are going to be enough resources to 
  
          address that is a real question.
 
 			</p><p>What the TSA is doing now is, trying 
  
          to establish what are vulnerabilities
 
          associated with these various modes, and to 
  
          move from there.
 
 			</p><p>The management structure you ask 
           about, I think there is no way that it can be 
  
          the same as with aviation.  Aviation was
 
          mandated by legislation, so I think the 
  
          coordination and the collaboration and the 
  
          structure that TSA is trying to put in place
 
          is, in fact, a good first step and it is 
  
          probably a logical step to take in terms of
 
          managing.
 
 			</p><p>It will still be a case where    well 
  
          it wouldn't be a case where no one is in
 
          charge.  TSA will be in charge by statute. 
  
          They are in charge of all transportation
 
          security.  They will, therefore, have a 
  
          statutory basis to coordinate and for 
  
          cooperation and setting standards across the
 
          system.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Well, Mr. Dillingham,
 
          if I might make an observation.  Before 
  
          September 11, 2001, the GAO and other agencies 
  
          made numerous reports about the vulnerability 
           of our aviation security system.  And the 
  
          response was often, you need to understand how
 
          disperse power is.  There are various entities 
  
          with various responsibilities.  There are local 
  
          transportation authorities.  There is the
 
          aviation industry, et cetera, and of course, 
  
          this is very costly, and trying to figure out
 
          who bears the burden is very complicated.
 
 			</p><p>That sounds actually quite similar to 
  
          what we are hearing now about transportation
 
          outside the aviation security arena.  I am 
  
          prepared to concede that there is a lot of
 
          complexity, but I wonder whether we have the 
  
          same urgency being brought to bear around our 
  
          ports, in particular, around container
 
          shipments in particular, around the security of 
  
          our bridges and tunnels, and whether you, having
 
          broad experience and lengthy experience in this 
  
          area, feel that we have the right level of 
  
          effort and the right structure being brought to 
           bear.
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think the process
 
          that is in place is the necessary process. 
  
          That is, to determine what's important.  This 
  
          is all being done on a risk assessment basis,
 
          meaning that the TSA is looking across all 
  
          modes trying to see what the vulnerabilities
 
          and the threats are, and then to prioritize 
  
          that across all threats and across all modes. 
  
          Because, as I said in my statement, there is no
 
          way that we, as a country, can secure against 
  
          all risk.  So we have to prioritize and we have
 
          to prioritize according to what the threat is 
  
          and the likely harm that would come if that 
  
          threat is in fact realized.
 
 			</p><p>I think ports are high on the agenda. 
  
          Right now, only two percent of the thousands of
 
          containers that come into the country are 
  
          physically inspected, but neither the 
  
          technology nor the manpower is available to 
           inspect 100 percent of them.  But we are moving 
  
          in the direction of getting better technology
 
          and finding ways, both internationally and 
  
          domestically to address the issue.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Mr. Dillingham, you were
 
          very optimistic about the degree of progress we 
  
          have made since 9/11 with respect to air
 
          transportation.  First, I just wanted to make 
  
          sure, you talked about six modes, have I got 
  
          the other five right, car, train, mass transit,
 
          bus and maritime?  Would those be the other 
  
          five?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, sir.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Which of those five is 
  
          the highest priority and the greatest threat,
 
          as far as you are concerned, from the point of 
  
          view of moving in the direction of the degree
 
          of progress we have made with airlines.
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think ports.  I 
  
          think maritime because maritime cannot only be 
           a place of substantial infrastructural damage, 
  
          but it can have cascading effects on the
 
          economy.  We can see when our ports were closed 
  
          for a very short time a few months ago, how 
  
          that effected the economy and international
 
          commerce.  So I think ports are probably the 
  
          next highest priority, and probably highest in
 
          terms of vulnerability as well.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  One other question, if I 
  
          may, both for you and for Mr. Fine.
 
 			</p><p>How would you characterize the 
  
          cooperation of the commercial airlines
 
          themselves in connection with air 
  
          transportation safety?  That question is for 
  
          you.  And the question for you, Mr. Fine, with
 
          respect to tracking emigrants and immigrants 
  
          from the United States?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  When you say their 
  
          cooperation with regard to safety could you say 
  
          more.  What do you mean? 
 			</p><p> MR. GORTON:  The whole TSA attempt, 
  
          which you characterized as being pretty
 
          successful so far, would you characterize all 
  
          or most of the airlines as being highly cooperative 
  
          with the safety measures or reluctant from time
 
          to time?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think the airlines
 
          are    it is probably both.  The airlines, of 
  
          course, are in some economic distress.  So the 
  
          airlines will often sort of push back with
 
          regard to at least paying for some of the 
  
          security measures that are being put in place
 
          and they see them as unfunded mandates.
 
 			</p><p>However, the airlines on the other 
  
          hand recognize that if the flying public do not
 
          believe that security is much improved, the 
  
          flying public will not come back and the
 
          airline industry will suffer even greater 
  
          economic woes, which in turn has a cascading 
  
          effect on the rest of the economy. 
 			</p><p> MR. GORTON:  How about with tracking 
  
          people?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  I think it is mixed.  I 
  
          don't think that they have been uncooperative. 
  
          I do think that there are issues regarding the
 
          collection of departure cards, I 94, and 
  
          whether they are universally collected and
 
          provided to the INS.  They are clearly not.
 
 			</p><p>There are also issues with regard to 
  
          airport facilities, inspection facilities,
 
          ensuring that they are safe and secure.
 
 			</p><p>In the end, though, it is a Government
 
          function to ensure that it is handled 
  
          appropriately.  I think the onus is on the 
  
          federal government to ensure that whatever
 
          needs to be done is done.  And I think that's 
  
          where the answer lies.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Mr. Wolosky, we had a 
  
          witness here yesterday who basically said that 
  
          there is so much money, as he put it I think, 
           "sloshing around" in the Islamic charitable 
  
          community, and so relatively little of it is
 
          needed, if you will, to successfully fund 
  
          terrorism, that the ability to squeeze out the 
  
          part that has been siphoned off to support
 
          terrorism activities is extremely challenging, 
  
          let's say.  Could you give us your assessment
 
          of that?  After all, you said we need to do 
  
          that.  We need to identify those sources of 
  
          funds and eliminate them.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  First, I 
  
          absolutely think it is true that there is a
 
          very large amount of money as you said, or as 
  
          the witness said "sloshing around"  through 
  
          that system.  In part because it is actually
 
          one of the five pillars of Islam, Zacat, to 
  
          give at least 2.5 percent of your income to
 
          charitable endeavors.  That is collected both 
  
          through retail charities, at mosques and Muslim 
  
          community centers, and through larger 
           donations, typically by Gulf Arabs.
 
 			</p><p>But particularly when it is given at
 
          mosques and Muslim community centers, again, 
  
          like the mosque across the river, it is 
  
          frequently collected by a community leader.  It
 
          is co mingled.  It is dispersed at the 
  
          discretion of the community leader, most
 
          frequently without any record keeping or any 
  
          accountability.
 
 			</p><p>But I don't agree with the premise that
 
          just because a large amount of money moves 
  
          through that system that the United States
 
          should not take steps to regulate that activity 
  
          within its own borders.  Nor do I agree with 
  
          the premise the United States should forego
 
          instruments of foreign policy to compel other 
  
          states in which this activity occurs to engage
 
          in similar regulatory efforts.
 
 			</p><p>I think that there are really two 
  
          reasons to take such action, notwithstanding 
           the fact that a relatively small amount of 
  
          money can contribute to devastating terrorist
 
          attacks.
 
 			</p><p>The first is that where particular 
  
          nodes are identified, you actually can take
 
          steps to prevent attacks from occurring by 
  
          choking off the financing.
 
 			</p><p>Secondly, to the extent that you force 
  
          systemic changes, you make it harder for 
  
          terrorists to raise and move money.  To the
 
          extent that you achieve that objective, you are 
  
          forcing them to spend more time worrying about
 
          how they are going to raise and move money, 
  
          than spending time and effort on planning and 
  
          executing deadly attacks.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you for that 
  
          response.  I think it will help us as we
 
          consider the kind of factual inquiry we need to 
  
          be making here.
 
 			</p><p>You raised, I think, two fairly 
           dispiriting points.  One is that the issue of 
  
          attacking the sources of terrorism funding has
 
          moved lower on the bilateral foreign policy 
  
          agenda.  And also, that the necessity for some 
  
          international rubric for attacking terrorist
 
          financing has been undermined by the lack of 
  
          international consensus for this effort.
 
 			</p><p>I was struck by the fact that in 
  
          November of '02, when you did your report, you 
  
          actually observed that while immediately in the
 
          aftermath of 9/11 there was a lot of 
  
          international cooperation, you said, "that
 
          coalition may be fraying" and you noted a 
  
          "widening gap between the U.S. and Europe" on 
  
          the basic salience and perimeters of global
 
          terrorism.
 
 			</p><p>My question to you is this, here we
 
          are six months later, how are our requests for 
  
          international cooperation in the area of 
  
          financing of terrorism being met?  How are 
           other key participants in the international 
  
          community currently responding to our request
 
          for help?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  I think with respect to 
  
          both questions, unfortunately they are better
 
          posed to someone who is currently working on 
  
          these issues on behalf of the United States
 
          Government, but I do think that, as a general 
  
          matter, there is substantial evidence to 
  
          suggest that our foreign partners    you have
 
          to remember, the way this process has worked 
  
          insofar as IEEPA designations is concerned, is
 
          that the United States, through executive 
  
          order, has named individuals and organizations 
  
          that are part of the terrorist financial
 
          network,  the assets of which are frozen, 
  
          assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.
 
          U.S. persons are prohibited by law from 
  
          transacting business with those persons or 
  
          organizations. 
 			</p><p> That process has been 
  
          multi lateralized through U.N. Security Council
 
          Resolution 1390 whereby the same names of 
  
          individuals or organizations has gone to the 
  
          United Nations and gone out to the member
 
          states of United Nations for similar action, as 
  
          the member states may wish to engage in.
 
 			</p><p>There have been, in my experience, two 
  
          problems with the multi lateralization of that 
  
          process.  The first is that many states lack
 
          the technical capacity to actually freeze 
  
          funds.  That was illustrated for me personally
 
          when I visited, in recent months, a 
  
          strategically significant African country and I 
  
          asked them the question:  What happened to this
 
          piece of paper with all these names that came 
  
          from the United Nations?  Where did it go?
 
          Answer: It went to the Foreign Ministry.
 
 			</p><p>I go to the Foreign Ministry and say, 
  
          what did you do with this piece of paper with 
           all the names on it?  Well, we sent it to the 
  
          Central Bank.
 
 			</p><p>Go to the Central Bank, as I did and 
  
          say, what happened to this list?  Well, we sent 
  
          it to our banks.
 
 			</p><p>Go to the banks, as I did:  What 
  
          happened to this piece of paper with all the
 
          names?  Well, we put it over there because we 
  
          don't have any ability to go through our 
  
          accounts and identify the beneficial holders of
 
          the accounts.
 
 			</p><p>So that is a point on technical
 
          capacity which needs to be addressed in this 
  
          context.
 
 			</p><p>The second point has to do with
 
          differing standards of who and what constitutes 
  
          a terrorist, and also the evidentiary standards
 
          with respect to the type of information that 
  
          foreign states have asked for in connection 
  
          with supporting the U.S. designations. 
 			</p><p> With respect to the first subpoint, as 
  
          the report of the Council on Foreign Relations
 
          notes, the European Union still to this day 
  
          permits Hamas and Hizbollah to legally raise 
  
          funds on its territory.
 
 			</p><p>Secondly, with respect to evidentiary 
  
          standards, what we have found post 9/11 was
 
          that while there was initial willingness of 
  
          other states to freeze funds over designated 
  
          individuals and organizations originated by the
 
          U.S.  Government, that willingness faded as the 
  
          months went on and foreign states asked for
 
          increasingly sensitive intelligence information 
  
          that supported the original U.S. designations, 
  
          which when it wasn't provided caused them to
 
          fail to take steps to freeze the accounts of 
  
          designated individuals and organizations.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Mr Wolosky, would you 
  
          give us a brief description of how the Hawala 
  
          system works.  What kind of financial system is 
           it?
 
 			</p><p>And secondly, what the United States
 
          has done with respect to its illegitimate use 
  
          for the support of terrorism when the deposits 
  
          originate here in the United States.
 
 			</p><p>And third, whether there is really 
  
          anything we can do with respect to such an
 
          informal system when the transactions take
  
          place entirely overseas.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  The way it works
 
          is essentially as follows.
 
 			</p><p>Let's assume that I am a Pakistani
 
          immigrant living in Brooklyn and wish to 
  
          transfer $500 to my parents living in 
  
          Islamabad.  The way I can use the Hawala system
 
          to accomplish that money transfer is by going 
  
          to a local individual, a hawaladar in Brooklyn,
 
          giving him my $500.  He uses his network, which 
  
          is most frequently a clan or family based 
  
          network and contacts his counterpart in 
           Islamabad, and he says, when someone comes in 
  
          with a particular identifying code, give him
 
          the $500.
 
 			</p><p>That system enables money to be moved 
  
          without the physical movement of money   
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Is not that individual in 
  
          Brooklyn engaged in banking activities under
 
          the laws of New York?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Well, until recently the 
  
          problem has been that there has been no Federal
 
          regulation of that activity.  Post 9/11, using 
  
          preexisting legal authorities, the Department
 
          of the Treasury has begun to require that 
  
          activity, individuals who engage in that 
  
          activity to register.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  I see.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Because the activity
 
          fundamentally is intended to be anonymous, 
  
          without record keeping, without paper trails. 
  
          The likelihood that the individuals will 
           register is quite remote.
 
 			</p><p>But notwithstanding that fact, it
 
          provides a basis for prosecution in Federal 
  
          court if they fail to register.  Prior to 9/11 
  
          frequently there was no basis for prosecution
 
          in Federal court.  Now if they fail to 
  
          register, they can be prosecuted.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Is that effectively our 
  
          method of stopping some portion of that $500 
  
          from going, not to the parent in Islamabad, but
 
          to terrorism?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Yes.  I think a basic
 
          point which you alluded to is that this system 
  
          of moving money is used for mainly legitimate 
  
          purposes.  It is unique to several different
 
          cultures in south Asia and east Asia.  It has 
  
          been used for centuries. It is used by
 
          terrorists and other criminals, but it is also 
  
          used by a lot of people who just want to move 
  
          money and avoid formal banking.  They have 
           access to formal financial systems, but they 
  
          want to avoid it, for whatever reasons.
 
 			</p><p>But you asked whether that was the 
  
          primary method of regulating this activity in 
  
          the United States.  I believe that it is,
 
          through a registration system.
 
 			</p><p>And you also asked whether it    what
 
          steps or whether the United States should take 
  
          action to prevent other countries from being 
  
          part of abuses of this system.
 
 			</p><p>I think the answer is yes.  Again, if 
  
          you look under Title 3 of the U.S.A. Patriot
 
          Act, it authorizes the Executive Branch to 
  
          restrict or prohibit access to the U.S. financial 
  
          system on the part of states or foreign
 
          financial institutions that lack adequate 
  
          anti money laundering regimes.
 
 			</p><p>This is ultimately the most powerful 
  
          tool in the arsenal of the U.S.  Government. 
  
          It has not    and it provides leverage over 
           states that, for instance, refuse to regulate 
  
          in any manner the Hawala system.
 
 			</p><p>It hasn't really been used to this 
  
          point in this context and the findings of the 
  
          distinguished Bipartisan Commission and the
 
          Council on Foreign Relations was that it 
  
          should.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  One follow up question. 
  
          You may have left out the middle of this 
  
          transaction.  Your Pakistani has gone and given
 
          $500 to the Hawala person in Brooklyn who has then 
  
          called Islamabad or communicated with
 
          Islamabad, which gives $500 to the parent 
  
          there, but somehow or other the $500 has still 
  
          got to get from Brooklyn to Islamabad, does it
 
          not?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  No.  It doesn't.  That's
 
          how the system works.
 
 			</p><p>In other words, it is credited through 
  
          family relationship, let's say, or a clan based 
           relationship.  The money itself physically does 
  
          not move.
 
 			</p><p>If you, for instance, if your uncle 
  
          called you and asked you to loan some $500 to 
  
          someone who he wanted you to loan the money to,
 
          you probably would do it, even if he didn't 
  
          advance you the $500.  You would rely on the
 
          fact of your family relationship for settlement 
  
          to occur in the manner of your choosing, at 
  
          some future day.  That is exactly how the
 
          Hawala system works.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  There would be an
 
          off setting transaction at some point in the 
  
          future?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  At some point in the
 
          future.  Again, at a time of convenience, 
  
          whatever the circumstances may require.  It
 
          doesn't have to be in cash.  It could be in 
  
          gold or it could be through some co mingled 
  
          account in an Islamic bank.  It can occur in a 
           variety of different ways.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  One of the challenges
 
          for this Commission is to look at 
  
          organizational issues and to make sure, A, our 
  
          Government is arrayed correctly and organized
 
          correctly and, B, that it is using all of its 
  
          authorities.
 
 			</p><p>The Council on Foreign Relations 
  
          report and your testimony note, a lack of 
  
          organizational accountability for the money
 
          laundering issue.  You made a number of 
  
          recommendations with regard to who should have
 
          the leadership and who should have the ultimate 
  
          responsibility.
 
 			</p><p>Since that report was issued, can you
 
          describe what, if anything, has been done to 
  
          address the organizational problems that you
 
          identified, and could you describe briefly 
  
          those organizational deficiencies?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  The report 
           suggested that notwithstanding the significance 
  
          of this issue, the fundamental significance of
 
          this issue, there was no single U.S. official 
  
          with the correct mandate and authority to 
  
          coordinate U.S. policy on terrorist financing
 
          issues.  Policy is currently coordinated 
  
          through a policy coordination committee that is
 
          headed by the General Council of the Treasury 
  
          Department.
 
 			</p><p>The Bipartisan Commission of the
 
          Council on Foreign Relations concluded that 
  
          that, for a variety of reasons, was not the
 
          most effective way to coordinate various 
  
          diplomatic, intelligence and law enforcement 
  
          and regulatory ingredients that contribute to
 
          effective and sustained U.S. policy response.
 
 			</p><p>For one thing, the report of the
 
          Council on Foreign Relations concluded that the 
  
          Treasury Department was not the appropriate 
  
          agency to coordinate diplomatic or intelligence 
           activities.
 
 			</p><p>There is also the question as to
 
          whether or not even the most capable General 
  
          Counsel of the Treasury    and I don't know the 
  
          General Counsel of the Treasury, but I am told
 
          that he is extraordinarily competent    given 
  
          his other statutory and institution responsibilities,
 
          has other things to worry about than the 
  
          suppression of terrorist financing.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  I take it from your
 
          report, though, that the Congress has vested 
  
          this responsibility in the Treasury Department
 
          and other agencies of Government have resisted 
  
          implementing that; is that correct?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  I think that the
 
          Executive Bank has vested this responsibility 
  
          in the Treasury Department.  There is no
 
          statutory authority whatsoever with respect to 
  
          terrorist financing.
 
 			</p><p>Our report concluded that because of 
           the very different and difficult ingredients 
  
          that contribute to an effective response,
 
          ranging from diplomatic activities to 
  
          intelligence activities to regulatory 
  
          activities, that that was best coordinated out
 
          of the White House.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  An organizational
 
          question for you, Mr. Fine.
 
 			</p><p>You have noted that a very substantial 
  
          portion of the immigration and naturalization
 
          service responsibilities that are the subject 
  
          of your reports, have now been transferred to
 
          the Department of Homeland Security.
 
 			</p><p>Your office has evidently built up a 
  
          tremendous amount of expertise in the review
 
          and oversight of those functions.  Has all of 
  
          that capacity in your office been transferred
 
          to the Department of Homeland Security so that 
  
          that oversight can continue uninterrupted in 
  
          that new department? 
 			</p><p> MR. FINE:  All of our capacity has not 
  
          been transferred, but we have transferred a
 
          portion of our capacity.
 
 			</p><p>There is a Department of Homeland 
  
          Security, Office of the Inspector General that
 
          has been created.  It has been created with 
  
          resources from various entities.  We have
 
          provided resources to it.  The Department of 
  
          Treasury Inspector General's Office has 
  
          provided resources to it.  The Department of
 
          Transportation Inspector General's Office has 
  
          provided resources, FEMA and others.  So there
 
          is a newly developed Department of Homeland Security, 
  
          OIG.  We have provided investigators and some 
  
          managers to that entity.
 
 			</p><p>A lot of our capacity is involved with 
  
          the INS, but it is also involved with the FBI,
 
          the DEA, the Marshal Service.  So there is not a 
  
          distinct unit that we could transfer over 
  
          there. 
 			</p><p> I do think it is a critical issue that 
  
          you raised, though, because I do think that is
 
          it is critically important that there be 
  
          adequate, aggressive and strong oversight over 
  
          this new entity, ranging from the INS to the
 
          Customs Service, to the Secret Service to the 
  
          TSA.  It is going to be a daunting challenge
 
          for that new agency, the Department of Homeland 
  
          Security OIG, to get up and running, and to 
  
          ensure that there is continuity of oversight.
 
 			</p><p>We believe strongly in it and we think 
  
          that that new OIG ought to be adequately funded
 
          to perform its mission in an aggressive way.
 
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON:  Mr. Wolosky,    well, 
  
          first of all let me say, this has been a
 
          marvelous panel.  Each of the three of you 
  
          have been very helpful to the Commission and we
 
          appreciate it.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Wolosky, I was focused on your 
  
          final paragraph.  "We don't hold the Saudis 
           feet to the fire."
 
 			</p><p>I gather from your testimony that we,
 
          the United States, and the countries that are 
  
          most responsible here, if we had the political 
  
          will to crack down on financing, we could do
 
          it.  But, because of policy considerations that 
  
          are very important, we don't do it.
 
 			</p><p>We have to have the oil.  We have to 
  
          have the overflight rights.  We have to have 
  
          the basing rights.  And because we have to have
 
          those things, we do not hold their feet to the 
  
          fire.  Is that your view?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  That is my view. 
  
          Unfortunately, I wasn't called before you to 
  
          testify on policy with regard to Saudi Arabia
 
          in the current context of   
 
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON:  I know, I appreciate
 
          that.  I am not being critical of you in any 
  
          way.  It is just a very good illustration of 
  
          how policy gets in the way of, in this case, 
           enforcement.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Yes.  That's the point
 
          of my testimony.  In other words, I am not here 
  
          to make judgments of whether or not particular 
  
          issues should be prioritized over other issues,
 
          but what I can tell you is that the United 
  
          States, at the highest levels, has not spoken
 
          out loudly and forcefully on the terrorist 
  
          financing issue as it relates to Saudi Arabia.
 
 			</p><p>That is not to say that things aren't being
 
          done.  I have every reason to believe that a 
  
          lot is being done, but it is being done in the
 
          shadows.  The conclusion of the Council of 
  
          Foreign Relations' report was that it was time 
  
          to bring it out of the shadows.  For the
 
          President of the United States or for other 
  
          senior officials to state clearly,
 
          unequivocally and unambiguously what was 
  
          required of the Saudi Government on the 
  
          terrorist financing issue. 
 			</p><p> That is not being done, and in the 
  
          judgment of this task force it needed to be
 
          done in order to set benchmarks for the Saudis 
  
          and to enable the Saudi Government to 
  
          communicate to its own citizens what kind of
 
          conduct was and was not acceptable.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. Dillingham, I don't
 
          want to sound like a cranky business traveller, 
  
          but I would like to get into an area of focus 
  
          on the part of TSA in terms of air travel
 
          security, because funding follows focus, as we 
  
          know, and your testimony and that of Mr. Fine
 
          this morning, have pointed out some rather 
  
          large funding gaps, particularly with regard to 
  
          port security which you testified to, and the
 
          issue of water security that Mr. Fine testified 
  
          to.
 
 			</p><p>I acknowledge that TSA employees, the 
  
          new ones especially, are finding and retrieving 
  
          large amounts of weapons.  But if news stories 
           are to be credited, some weapons still get 
  
          through.  I understand it is a system which
 
          depends not just on technology, but on human 
  
          instinct and humans paying attention as well. 
  
          But it seems to me that a fault of government
 
          is it fights yesterday's battles.
 
 			</p><p>As I go through airline security
 
          screening processes, I see this sort of almost 
  
          obsessive focus on belts, and shoes.  And at 
  
          the same time you are telling me that
 
          containers are coming into the United States 
  
          inspected only at the level of 2 percent, if
 
          that.  And Mr. Fine is telling me that the 
  
          northern border is, in many respects, an 
  
          unprotected area, particularly with regard to
 
          24/7 coverage.  While everybody is down in the 
  
          Southwest trying to prevent undocumented
 
          workers from crossing the border to work in the 
  
          United States and take jobs that Americans 
  
          won't do. 
 			</p><p> Is our focus on airline security 
  
          wrong?  Who makes these policies?  Who reviews
 
          these policies?  How are they kept up to date? 
  
          Are we anticipating ways in which terrorists 
  
          can use airline vulnerability, or are we saying
 
          that because Richard Reid got on an airplane 
  
          and tried to light his shoes, that we are going
 
          to focus on shoes of millions and millions of 
  
          American business travellers.  And for the life 
  
          of me, maybe you can explain it, but I don't
 
          see the relevance of showing your belt buckle 
  
          open as opposed to your belt buckle closed, and
 
          yet we have these jam ups at the security 
  
          system screening depots with people milling 
  
          around.  We have all seen this process.
 
 			</p><p>Is this the right balance?  Is there 
  
          somebody sitting in Washington to say, well,
 
          let's look at what we are doing about airline 
  
          security and try and anticipate future attacks?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, Governor, if I 
           could.
 
 			</p><p>I think it is part of, if you have
 
          only got a hammer, all of the answers you use 
  
          that hammer for.  That's sort of how aviation 
  
          security has evolved.  That was the first thing
 
          that came out of the box and we have applied 
  
          all of our resources to it.
 
 			</p><p>It may seem    if I can give you just 
  
          sort of a story behind the belt buckle.  What 
  
          has been determined is that before 9/11 people
 
          would    the belt buckle would send off an 
  
          alarm and the screener would pass by and say,
 
          okay, belt buckle, no problem.
 
 			</p><p>But the process of testing the system, 
  
          if you have a belt buckle and you can hide a
 
          weapon inside or behind that belt buckle, and 
  
          it is only passed as, it is only a buckle, it
 
          is not a weapon.  That's the kind of situation 
  
          that they were focusing on.
 
 			</p><p>It is the same thing with people at 
           airports.  They see grandmothers and children 
  
          being examined and it seems embarrassing, in
 
          fact it can be, but they also have intelligence 
  
          to say that the terrorists have used these kind 
  
          of ways to get things through.
 
 			</p><p>We are now seeing a ratcheting back of 
  
          the things that don't make sense.  We are
 
          seeing a rationalization of security.  You are 
  
          no longer asked did you pack your bag, has it 
  
          been with you the whole time.  There is no
 
          longer the prohibition of driving up to the 
  
          airport.
 
 			</p><p>We are seeing ratcheting back.  We are 
  
          seeing a rationalization of it.  So there is 
  
          someone who is looking at this.  After 9/11 it
 
          was, let's do everything that we can to change 
  
          the situation for aviation security, and now
 
          there are changes.
 
 			</p><p>You are right, that has been the 
  
          reputation of security in this country, 
           fighting the last battle and not looking for 
  
          what's coming.  I can tell you that our office
 
          is looking at that issue and trying to 
  
          understand, you know, to what extent are we 
  
          looking for the next generation of technology.
 
          To what extent are we moving beyond where we 
  
          were being prepared for the threats that we
 
          haven't seen yet, but we know were out there.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. Fine, going back to 
  
          the students for the moment.  Do we have a
 
          rough idea how many students are in the United 
  
          States at any one particular time?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  About half a million.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  Have a million?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Yes.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  I noticed all the way 
  
          through you written testimony, and a little bit
 
          in your oral testimony as well, that almost 
  
          every system that we have developed or 
  
          identified to deal with some of the issues 
           about student entry or student remainder or 
  
          student registration, don't yet seem to be
 
          working or up to snuff.  I mean, is the shear 
  
          number of foreign students in the United States 
  
          at any one time going to overwhelm any system?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  It clearly overwhelmed the 
  
          paper based system which was antiquated and
 
          inefficient.  A computer based system I am not 
  
          sure will overwhelm the ability of the system 
  
          to track who is in the country, who is not in
 
          the country, who has shown up at school, who 
  
          had has gotten a student visa, came to the
 
          United States and then never showed up in the 
  
          school, as actually one of the September 11 
  
          hijackers did.  He got a visa to show up at a
 
          language school, never showed up.  The school 
  
          didn't do anything about it and none of the
 
          authorities knew this.
 
 			</p><p>So we need a system that tracks that 
  
          and can provide that information.  What is 
           going to be very difficult is what to do with 
  
          that information and how to decide what is the
 
          important ones to follow through with and how 
  
          to prioritize what happens with an enormous 
  
          amount of information.  For that, I think,
 
          there needs to be intelligence and adequate 
  
          intelligence to determine where the threats are.
 
 			</p><p>But in the first step there does have 
  
          to be a system, a computerized system that does 
  
          track the status of the students.  I believe
 
          that the SEVIS system that is being implemented 
  
          is a good system and has the potential to do
 
          it, it is just simply not fully implemented and 
  
          needs more steps to go.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  Assuming the systems
 
          work, can we ever hire enough people to 
  
          follow up on the information in the system and
 
          go track the people down who disappear from the 
  
          system?  To me that is a really devilish 
  
          problem. 
 			</p><p> MR. FINE:  I don't think you can hire 
  
          enough people to track all of them, but I think
 
          you can do some efforts with some issues where 
  
          there is intelligence that indicates you need to.
 
 			</p><p>It is also important to be able to
 
          provide information from that system to other 
  
          law enforcement agencies, so that when other
 
          law enforcement agencies come in contact with 
  
          somebody, they will know that this is a person 
  
          out of status, this is a student who never
 
          showed up at school.  So they have that 
  
          information and can act upon it.  Prior to this
 
          computerized system, there was no possibility 
  
          of that.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  Could you or Mr.
 
          Dillingham comment on the status of the 
  
          technology or efforts, pilot programs, or
 
          anything else that is out there to prescreen 
  
          business travellers on airlines, or prescreen 
  
          workers who come into the United States during 
           the course of day and go back to their host 
  
          country in the evening.
 
 			</p><p>It seems to me we haven't made much 
  
          progress there and the result is, I presume, 
  
          that we are still using a lot of human
 
          resources to screen the same people 
  
          day in day out that present what you presume to
 
          be a low security risk.  Are there enough 
  
          people to guard our northern border?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Those are important
 
          projects.  There are some projects that provide 
  
          trusted travellers access across the border.
 
          They are not universally available.  I believe 
  
          that is an issue that needs to be addressed and 
  
          needs to be more widely used.
 
 			</p><p>Part of the issue is the money. 
  
          Sometimes the fees are higher than people want
 
          to pay.  But it is a program that I think 
  
          provides some relief from the crushing workload 
  
          that inspectors have along the border, an 
           ability to speed some people up and allow 
  
          greater scrutiny of others.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  The technology is there, 
  
          I presume?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Yes.
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes.  Following what 
  
          Mr. Fine said, the TSA is in fact looking at
 
          programs such as trusted travellers, starting 
  
          with identifying, using identification with 
  
          biometrics for all transportation workers.  So
 
          that is in process.
 
 			</p><p>And at an international level, I think
 
          it is one of the unresolved issues.  There is 
  
          some cooperation between other countries and 
  
          the United States in terms of supplying
 
          passenger lists for international travellers 
  
          ahead of time.  That is one of the issues that
 
          needs to be further explored.  Bilateral, 
  
          multilateral agreements with regard to security 
  
          and security operations between the United 
           States and other countries.  It is clearly an 
  
          open area.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I have one question and 
  
          then Commissioner Ben Veniste and Commissioner 
  
          Lehman.
 
 			</p><p>I think I read about a year ago for the first time that 
  
          the greatest danger out there was probably
 
          containers, and containers in container ports. 
  
          You said practically the same thing again today 
  
          and I read it a number of times in between.
 
          You said, well the technology has got to be 
  
          developed.
 
 			</p><p>Can you give us any kind of 
  
          approximate timetable when that kind of danger 
  
          is going to be lessened or are we just going to
 
          live with it?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  We are certainly
 
          going to live with it for a while.  There are 
  
          some technologies out there that can be used. 
  
          What's missing right now is better technology 
           and also the balance between screening and 
  
          moving cargo.  There are ways in which you can
 
          x ray these containers, you can physically 
  
          inspect these containers, but what you are 
  
          talking about is slowing the commercial
 
          process.  That is where the balance has to be 
  
          struck.
 
 			</p><p>Technologies are, in fact, being 
  
          developed.  In some cases the technology is so 
  
          expensive at this point that it is also not
 
          being readily accepted by the maritime 
  
          community.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Is there any kind of a 
  
          timetable, six months a year, two years?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I would go with
 
          multiple years.  Not six months, not a year, 
  
          but a few years.
 
 			</p><p>MR. THOMPSON:  What do other countries 
  
          do?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  They are petty much 
           in the same way.  Those are the containers that 
  
          are coming here.  What we have now is we are
 
          trying to work with other countries to do some 
  
          screening, some random screening of containers 
  
          at their point of origin so there is less to be
 
          concerned about as they arrive on U.S.  shores, 
  
          but it is an international issue.  It is an
 
          international issue, so they aren't doing any more 
  
          than we are doing.
 
 			</p><p>You will find, for example, in an
 
          aviation context, El Al does a lot more with 
  
          containers that are going on board and cargo
 
          that is going on board than the U.S. does.  But 
  
          the thing about that is, it is such a small 
  
          operation compared to what we do in the States
 
          that it is not even comparable almost.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Commissioner Ben Veniste.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Thank you.  Mr. 
  
          Fine, I want to express our appreciation for 
  
          your offer of complete cooperation with this 
           Commission.  We will definitely take you up on 
  
          it.
 
 			</p><p>In the limited time we have available, 
  
          it is imperative that we take advantage of the 
  
          pre existing work that has been done in order
 
          to identify what needs to be done further and 
  
          to make recommendations to the Congress and the
 
          President.
 
 			</p><p>I want to mention, yesterday Mr. 
  
          Wolosky, we had a panel that included Professor
 
          Ranstorp and Brian Jenkins who spoke about the 
  
          galvanizing effect of 9/11 on the cooperation
 
          of international intelligence agencies with our 
  
          own in connection with the anti terrorism 
  
          efforts.
 
 			</p><p>You have made a very provocative 
  
          statement with respect to the potential for
 
          degrading that cooperative effort as the result 
  
          of political differences relating to the war in 
  
          Iraq.  Do you have any concrete evidence or 
           information to suggest that the multilateral 
  
          intelligence services have in any way slacked
 
          off from their cooperation with our 
  
          intelligence community in that respect?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  No, I don't.  But I can
 
          tell you that having worked these issues 
  
          day in day out, they are very difficult under
 
          the best of circumstances.  What I fear is that 
  
          we may be entering into the worst of 
  
          circumstances with respect to our efforts to
 
          cooperate with states that disagree with U.S. 
  
          policies in Iraq, which I happen to support.
 
 			</p><p>But my point is that it may be 
  
          increasingly difficult for moderate Arab 
  
          regimes, and even our traditional allies, to
 
          continue to engage in the type of cooperation 
  
          that, I agree, was unprecedented following
 
          September 11.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  So your observation 
  
          is one based on informed speculation rather 
           than actual evidence?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Correct.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Let me ask just one 
  
          other question of Mr. Fine and Mr. Dillingham. 
  
          We have heard about the potential for the
 
          trusted traveller card, perhaps utilizing 
  
          biometric information.
 
 			</p><p>Is this the precursor, is this the 
  
          camel's nose under the tent for a national 
  
          identity card utilizing such information?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  I don't believe it is the 
  
          camel under the tent.  It is an option for
 
          people to undertake if they want to go quickly 
  
          across the border.  It is a voluntary thing 
  
          that people can participate in or not
 
          participate in if they want to.
 
 			</p><p>I think there are clear benefits to
 
          it, to them and to the system to allow certain 
  
          people who have been prescreened to go across 
  
          the border quickly. 
 			</p><p> MR. DILLINGHAM:  I would agree.  I 
  
          wouldn't say that it is the nose under the
 
          tent, but I would want to point out that as far 
  
          an as transportation is concerned, this does 
  
          not mean that passengers or persons would not
 
          be subject to screening.  They would still go 
  
          through a screening process.  It means that
 
          they would not necessarily have that second 
  
          screening at the gate.  Again, I agree that it 
  
          is a voluntary process.
 
 			</p><p>Right now transportation is developing 
  
          what's called a Computer Assisted Passenger
 
          Profiling System, CAPS, which is based on 
  
          information about the passenger that allows 
  
          them to be sort of placed in the various
 
          categories of screening.  Almost like our 
  
          national terrorist alert sort of thing, red,
 
          green, yellow in terms of degree of screening. 
  
          At the end of that flight, that information is 
  
          purged and not kept.  There is clearly civil 
           liberties and privacy issues and organizations 
  
          looking at that.
 
 			</p><p>We think that it is a way to make our 
  
          system more efficient and focus our resources 
  
          on those places where they need to be focused,
 
          finite resources for security.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Okay we have to move on
 
          with Commissioner Lehman, Commissioner Fielding 
  
          and Commissioner Roemer who have suggested that 
  
          they would like to ask brief questions, I hope.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  I have two brief 
  
          questions for Mr. Dillingham.
 
 			</p><p>First, while little old ladies are 
  
          being frisked at La Guardia, it is possible for 
  
          an Arab businessman to pick up the phone and
 
          make a call an go up to Whiteplains and charter 
  
          a Gulfstream or 737 Boeing executive jet which
 
          have no reinforced doors, no armed pilots and 
  
          no screening for him and his party to go 
  
          through. 
 			</p><p> Are there any plans to do anything 
  
          about this rather huge lacuna in our civil
 
          aviation security?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, Mr. Secretary. 
  
          We have pointed out that charter flights,
 
          general aviation, cargo, these are still 
  
          significant gaps in security and they, in fact,
 
          have to be addressed.  It is a matter of 
  
          priorities and funding.
 
 			</p><p>Almost any aircraft can be a weapon.
 
          I mean, we saw in the Florida case where just a 
  
          general aviation aircraft was stolen and flown
 
          into a building.  That could have very well 
  
          been an aircraft that had some chemical 
  
          biological agents on it as well.
 
 			</p><p>The point is, the threats and the 
  
          vulnerabilities are everywhere.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  Yes, but this one is so 
  
          obvious, what is taking so long?  Here we are a 
  
          long time after 9/11 and nothing has been done, 
  
          I can assure you, because I use these planes 
  
          fairly frequently and I have never seen a touch
 
          of security.
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  It is recognized.  We 
  
          keep pointing it out, but we can't make them do
 
          it.  Hopefully the Commission will point this 
  
          out, as well, as one of the gaps and that is a
 
          gap that needs to be addressed.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  I would say it is a 
  
          fairly urgent and glaring one considering the
 
          urgency that has been applied to some other 
  
          sectors.  Anyway, enough said.
 
 			</p><p>The other question I have, as a 
  
          veteran of the Reagan Administration, I 
  
          participated in a major crisis effort to
 
          increase airline security after several 
  
          hijackings in the early days of the Reagan
 
          Administration.  I recall that a U.S. marshal 
  
          program was put into effect at that time with 
  
          great urgency.  I also recall that there was an 
  
          edict put out, to put reinforced doors and to 
  
          see that the pilots    that the door were kept
 
          closed throughout the flight and that only the 
  
          pilot had the key.
 
 			</p><p>What ever happened to those programs?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Unfortunately, the 
  
          history has been when the particular event
 
          leaves the headlines, the follow through has 
  
          not always been what we would want it to be, 
  
          and that's the case with many of the
 
          recommendations that took place after Pan Am 103, 
  
          after the TWA 800.  We have 9/11 and we have a
 
          situation where the Federal Air Marshal Service 
  
          went from less than thirty or less than a hundred, to several thousand within a 
  
          short period of time.  We have a situation
 
          where the recommendation that you made early on 
  
          about cockpit doors being locked and so forth,
 
          that now some 10, 15 years later we now have, 
  
          as a result of 9/11, we have 80 percent of the 
  
          fleet with doors installed and the deadline 
  
          being at the end of the week for all of the 
  
          fleet.
 
 			</p><p>It's the nature of where we have been, 
  
          as long as there is oversight and constant 
  
          reinforcement that these things must be done,
 
          the more likely that they will, in fact, be 
  
          done.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Commissioner Fielding.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Thank you.  I have two 
  
          quick questions to you, Mr. Dillingham.
 
 			</p><p>First of all, I guess as a cranky 
  
          flyer I ought to tell you that I think the TSA
 
          people are a vast improvement and are obviously 
  
          trained in attitude as well, and I applaud you 
  
          for that.
 
 			</p><p>You gave us the list of priorities, of 
  
          vulnerability priorities, and I understand air
 
          and then maritime, but for our planning 
  
          purposes could you go a little further down the 
  
          list? 
  
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think the next one 
  
          on the list would be mass transit, freight rail
 
          would follow that.  The reason I say mass 
  
          transit is because so many persons use mass 
  
          transit and an incident on mass transit would
 
          have not only disastrous human effect, but the 
  
          psychology of that would also be tremendous.
 
 			</p><p>Rail, it's hard to prioritize too much 
  
          because a chemical biological accident 
  
          associated with rail has both the human
 
          dimension as well as the psychological 
  
          dimension.  So it is in that order I would go,
 
          aviation, maritime mass transit, rail.
 
 			</p><p>Now, having said that, more people 
  
          ride the bus than many of these modes combined,
 
          but it is the incident.  I mean, the likelihood 
  
          of you going to do damage to enough buses at
 
          one point in time as opposed to what would 
  
          happen in mass transit, as we saw in the Japan 
  
          incident, it is different.  So it's the 
  
          greatest harm to the greatest number of people 
  
          is part of the decision about where things
 
          rank.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Thank you, the other 
  
          thing is just to follow up on what Secretary
 
          Lehman asked you.
 
 			</p><p>Your answer to light aircraft issue,
 
          which has boggled everybody's mind who has ever 
  
          been around those, is "you can't make them do 
  
          it."  Who is "them"?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Well, you can make 
  
          recommendations and usually our recommendations
 
          will go to the U.S.  Congress.  We make 
  
          recommendations to the agencies who in turn are 
  
          responsive to the U.S. Congress.  So it has to
 
          be a congressional priority that is followed 
  
          through, and often times    I think someone
 
          mentioned today, that action goes 
  
          where the money goes.
 
 			</p><p>It is not for us to sort of make 
  
          policies.  It is for us to present the 
  
          information to the policy makers, and from
 
          there, they can make them do it.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  How about the Executive 
  
          Branch?
 
 			</p><p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Those are the people 
  
          that we generally are saying need to do
 
          something.  We are a congressional agency and 
  
          our mission is oversight, generally, of the 
  
          executive agencies.
 
 			</p><p>I don't want to sound like they don't 
  
          do anything, but generally the implementation
 
          is not the way we want it to be.  Some of the 
  
          recommendations that have been made about 
  
          aviation have been around for years.  They were
 
          either not implemented or partially 
  
          implemented.
 
 			</p><p>After 9/11 there was a new urgency to 
  
          it.  We have been talking about screeners not 
  
          doing what they are supposed to do for 15 
  
          years.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr.
 
          Chairman.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Last question for 
  
          Commissioner Roemer.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
  
          I too want to join in applauding the help that
 
          this particular panel has been to the 
  
          Commission.
 
 			</p><p>I want to ask Mr. Fine, having been on
 
          the Education Committee for 12 years in 
  
          Congress and having sat through many oversight
 
          hearings of SEVIS and heard time and time and 
  
          time again that we couldn't implement the 
  
          program, it would be another year, it would be
 
          another year.  We are experiencing this program 
  
          problem and that problem.
 
 			</p><p>When is this finally going to be ready 
  
          to be fully implemented and working in our 
  
          country? 
  
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  Well, it has been 
  
          implemented.  There is the SEVIS system
 
          available.  It applies to new students now. 
  
          There are clearly bugs in it, there are clearly 
  
          problems with it, but I believe the INS has
 
          made significant progress in implementing the 
  
          system.
 
 			</p><p>We have pointed out where deficiencies 
  
          are.  They need to address those deficiencies. 
  
          Come August, they say that it will apply to
 
          every student, not solely the new students but 
  
          also the continuing students.  So according to
 
          their schedule, by August of this year the 
  
          SEVIS system will be up, running, available and 
  
          we hope will be adequately followed through
 
          with all the things that need to be done to 
  
          ensure that is fully implemented as well.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  You have confidence that 
  
          that deadline is going to be reached?
 
 			</p><p>MR. FINE:  I wouldn't say with 
  
          confidence that it is going to be reached, 
  
          because I have seen similar things that you have
 
          seen.  What I will say is, they have made 
  
          progress and they need to make more progress.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Mr. Wolosky, one quick
 
          question for you.
 
 			</p><p>With respect to Saudi Arabia and the
 
          efforts they are making internally and 
  
          bilaterally with the United States to do more 
  
          about cracking down on the financing of
 
          contributions to terrorist operations, how 
  
          would you measure the lack of progress since
 
          9/11 internally?  What have they done 
  
          internally to crack down? And secondly, externally and
 
          bilaterally with the United States?  In 
  
          addition to elevating this to the highest
 
          levels of concern for us, what other steps need 
  
          to be taken to make this communication more of 
  
          a priority in terms of benchmarks and 
  
          implementing programs?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  Well, in
 
          assessing what has been done I think it is 
  
          helpful to distinguish, again, between tactical 
  
          measures and strategic measures.
 
 			</p><p>The tactical measures are, again, ones 
  
          that target particular nodes of the terrorist
 
          financing infrastructure, particular 
  
          individuals, particular charities, et cetera.
 
 			</p><p>Much of that activity is conducted by
 
          law enforcement intelligence agencies.  Much of 
  
          it is not transparent and should remain not
 
          transparent.
 
 			</p><p>There has been a substantial amount of 
  
          activity, as I understand it, between the
 
          United States Government and the Saudi 
  
          Government at the tactical law enforcement and
 
          intelligence level.
 
 			</p><p>At the same time, there have been 
  
          indications that there are problems, chiefly, 
  
          with respect to the two public designations 
  
          that were made of organizations or individuals
 
          that support terror.  Jointly, I mean joint 
  
          designations under the IEEPA statute with the 
  
          Saudi Government, there were two last year.
 
          One targeted the Al Aman charity and the 
  
          other was targeting an individual who was
 
          identified by the Treasury Department as a 
  
          significant contributor-one of the cofounders 
  
          of al Qaeda is what I believe the Treasury
 
          press release said.
 
 			</p><p>Now, with respect to Al Aman the
 
          problems are published reports that it is still 
  
          in business with respect to the individual who 
  
          is identified in September and designated by
 
          U.S.  Government.  The problem is that in the 
  
          days after his designation by the U.S.
 
          Government, the designation was questioned by 
  
          senior Saudi officials.
 
 			</p><p>So that indicates to me, at least, 
  
          that notwithstanding substantial efforts, there 
  
          are still problems at the tactical level in
 
          identifying particular nodes within terrorist 
  
          financial system with Saudi Arabia.
 
 			</p><p>Now, at the strategic level, there you
 
          get into questions of regulation of charities, 
  
          steps that are taken or avoided with respect to
 
          putting in place, know your customer rules and 
  
          suspicious activity reporting requirements 
  
          within Saudi financial institutions.
 
          Regulations of charities, like hawala, things 
  
          of that sort.
 
 			</p><p>Again, that information should be 
  
          publicly available.  It should be available to 
  
          this Commission.  It should be available to the
 
          United States Government.  It should be 
  
          available to me as a concerned private citizen
 
          when I log onto the web.  At least with respect 
  
          to my efforts, I haven't been able to find it.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Thank you. 
  
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much.  This 
  
          has been a very, very helpful panel.  I hope we
 
          can come back to some of you again.  Thank you very 
  
          much for your help.
 
 			</p><p>(Recess.)
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  The next panel consists of 
  
          Michael Wermuth of RAND Corporation, Steven
 
          Brill, author of a book many of us have read, 
  
          "After: How America Confronted the September 12 
  
          Era."  Zoe Baird of the Markle Foundation, and
 
          Randy Larsen of ANSER Institute for Homeland 
  
          Security.
 
 			</p><p>And I know, Mr. Brill, you have a hard 
  
          and fast deadline, so maybe if with start off 
  
          with you, sir.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  Thank you very much, 
  
          Governor.  I appreciate your accommodating me.
 
 			</p><p>I am delighted to be here this morning 
  
          and honored to be asked to share some of my 
  
          views with you.  I think the primary benefit 
  
          that I might be able to offer the Committee, 
  
          which is something less than the expertise of
 
          the witnesses you have just heard, is that for 
  
          the last year and a half I travelled this 
  
          country, trying to get a grip on all of the
 
          questions you have been dealing with and, in 
  
          particular, the questions you were dealing with
 
          this morning.
 
 			</p><p>I spoke at great length not only to 
  
          the people at the top of the issues, Attorney
 
          General Ashcroft, Secretary Ridge, Bob Bonnard, 
  
          Jim Loy and people like that, and their staffs,
 
          but also to the people who are actually out in 
  
          the field trying to implement and make sense of 
  
          what was going on in Washington during some
 
          very difficult times.
 
 			</p><p>My goal was to make a connection
 
          between policy, between discussions like the 
  
          ones we are having today and what was actually 
  
          happening in the airports, at the docks, at the 
  
          borders.
 
 			</p><p>What I found, I think I can keep my
 
          remarks fairly brief and I hope quite simple, 
  
          really falls much more under the category of 
  
          what we can go do going forward as opposed to
 
          mistakes we might have made in the past.  But I 
  
          did come across some of those mistakes that we
 
          made in the past.
 
 			</p><p>First, one general observation that I 
  
          suspect everyone in this room shares and I
 
          really got to see firsthand in, I think, a very 
  
          special way, we are    the people out there
 
          doing this job, are, I think, the worthy 
  
          successors to the greatest generation that Tom 
  
          Broker wrote about.  They are people in
 
          Customs, in INS, in the Coast Guards, of 
  
          course, men and women overseas who have really
 
          risen to the challenges of, what I call, the 
  
          September 12 Era.
 
 			</p><p>The issue is what kind of support 
  
          those people are going to get.  Their 
  
          dedication is constant.  Their attention spans
 
          are long.  I sat in on meetings of people who 
  
          have been dealing with the container, the cargo 
  
          container security issue, who have been dealing
 
          with this issue for 10, 11, 12 years or 20 
  
          years.  I have sat in on meetings where the
 
          Office of Homeland Security brought people 
  
          together for the first time from the Department 
  
          of Transportation, from Customs, the Coast
 
          Guard, from Treasury, the Department of State, 
  
          to deal with the problem like container
 
          security, or deal with the problem like 
  
          borders, and they were delighted to meet each 
  
          other.  They had all been working off in their
 
          corners in different places dedicated to those 
  
          issues.
 
 			</p><p>Their attention span is long.  I can't 
  
          say the same, with all respect, to many of you 
  
          on this panel from members of Congress, from 
  
          members of Executive Branch and certainly from 
  
          members of the press. Their attention spans are
 
          quite something else.
 
 			</p><p>First, let me just recount a couple of 
  
          the obvious pre 9/11 mistakes that I
 
          encountered.  One was that on the evening of 
  
          September 11, airline executives started to get
 
          a fax from the FAA.  The FAA's fax was, guess 
  
          what, a watch list, a no fly list.  Don't let 
  
          these 300 people fly.  This is the evening of
 
          September 11.
 
 			</p><p>Airline executives had the same
 
          reaction that I suspect you had: 'it is too bad 
  
          we didn't get this the morning of September 11.' 
  
          There are 300 names on that list.  That list
 
          had been sitting around.  It had been provided 
  
          both by the CIA and the FBI to the head of
 
          Civil Security at the FAA, and they hadn't yet 
  
          developed over a period of months a protocol 
  
          for how to add names or subtract names from the 
  
          list, and under whose letterhead it was going 
  
          to be issued, so they hadn't issued it.  The
 
          evening of September 11, they decided to issue 
  
          it.
 
 			</p><p>The second story that I think
 
          illustrates the lack of urgency.  On the 
  
          northern border, this is something that
 
          Inspector General Fine has reported on more 
  
          times than you are ever going to have hearings. 
  
          On the northern border they were two border
 
          patrol agents who in 1999 testified before 
  
          Congress about something called the "catch and
 
          release program."  Here is what the "catch and 
  
          release program" is.
 
 			</p><p>They would catch people sneaking over
 
          the border in Detroit, walking through the 
  
          train tunnel or coming in on little boats on
 
          the shore.  They would catch them and then what 
  
          they would do is, they would give them a 
  
          self addressed postcard.  And they would hand 
  
          them the card after they caught them and 
  
          arrested them.  They would hand them this card
 
          and say, 'listen, when you get an address in the 
  
          United States, the country you are sneaking 
  
          into, that you are not supposed to be in, when
 
          you establish an address, send us back this 
  
          postcard.  Then we will know your address, and
 
          then we can mail you a notice of your 
  
          deportation hearing.  Then you can come for a 
  
          hearing, and then we can deport you.'  A lot of
 
          these people didn't really show up for 
  
          deportation hearing or send the postcards back.
 
 			</p><p>They testified about it in 1999.  What 
  
          happens in October of 2001    I am sorry, not 
  
          October, the week after September 11, 2001?
 
          They tell a reporter for the Detroit Free Press 
  
          something less than what I have just told you.
 
          Much less in detail, that the northern border 
  
          isn't secure.  That we don't have the 
  
          resources.  We can't hold people in detention 
  
          when we catch them.  Guess what happens to them.
  
          They get a notice that they are going to be
 
          fired.
 
 			</p><p>Luckily, the Inspector General stepped 
  
          in.  The office of, I think it is the Special
 
          Counsel Office that protects whistle blowers, 
  
          stepped in.  They did not get fired, but that
 
          was the INS border patrol reaction.
 
 			</p><p>That policy after there was yet 
  
          another hearing in November of 2001, that
 
          policy has now been changed somewhat.  But this 
  
          took September 11.  It took an Inspector
 
          General.  It took some reports in the Detroit 
  
          Free Press before that policy    talk about 
  
          obvious gaps such as the general aviation gap,
 
          this is a fairly obvious gap.
 
 			</p><p>One more example, just before the
 
          millennium there was a very well publicized 
  
          arrest of someone who was attempting to sneak 
  
          in over the northern border in Washington 
  
          State, who had plans to blow up Los Angles 
  
          Airport.
 
 			</p><p>Ray Kelly, who was then the Customs 
  
          Director, thought that as a result of that, 
  
          this was a good time to reinforce the northern
 
          border with as many customs agents as he could 
  
          possibly send there.  His attitude, as I
 
          recount in the book was, I will send them there 
  
          and surely Congress will pay for it now that we 
  
          have made the arrest.  Surely the issue of the
 
          budget to protect the northern border going to 
  
          be solved by this obvious manifestation of the
 
          crisis, and those extra agents lasted for a few 
  
          months.  Congress lost interest, it went back 
  
          to being just the way it was.
 
 			</p><p>The air marshals    just one more 
  
          point.  On the September 11, the air marshals,
 
          there was 31 U.S. air marshals in the United 
  
          States of America, none of them were on a 
  
          single airplane on the morning of September 11. 
  
          There are now, their target is something 
  
          upwards of 3,000, I think, now, and we are
 
          doing it urgently, and, I guess that's good.
 
 			</p><p>But today as we speak the attention 
  
          span is still mixed.  It still takes the INS,
 
          they say, five to seven months to render an 
  
          environmental impact statement before they can
 
          put a pole up that will hold a camera at a 
  
          strategic point on the northern border, or to 
  
          put motion detectors.  They have to do
 
          environmental impact statements, five to seven 
  
          months in an administration that is not
 
          otherwise really quite that well known for its 
  
          sensitivity to the environment.
 
 			</p><p>The dilemma of all this is    I could sit
 
          here for two or three hours as could the other 
  
          members of this panel and talk about the gaps.
 
          The really serious issue is that we can never 
  
          really be doing enough.  We can all trade 
  
          anecdotes and we can all decide that we are not 
  
          doing enough, and we really cannot do enough in 
  
          a country that has 7500 miles of border, that
 
          has thousands of miles of natural gas 
  
          pipelines, tens of thousands of facilities 
  
          storing or shipping dangerous chemical,
 
          infinite entrances to subways, to trains and to 
  
          office buildings, and just as many
 
          vulnerabilities relating to food or water 
  
          supply, and even to office building ventilation 
  
          systems.
 
 			</p><p>So the critics that say we are not 
  
          doing enough are always going to be right.  The
 
          issue is, how can we make the debate and the 
  
          way we go forward a little more constructive 
  
          than that.  There is never going to be enough
 
          money to solve everything.  I think the 
  
          opportunity that this Commission has, that some
 
          independent nonpartisan body can have, whether 
  
          it is the GAO or a commission like this that 
  
          goes forward, that goes on, is that it can set 
  
          specific tangible standards for improvement in 
  
          homeland security.  It can set up, to give you
 
          an example, it can declare that if we have our 
  
          undercover people who work for a commission 
  
          like this, trying to sneak something into the
 
          port, it should be detected by Customs, by 
  
          Homeland Security 99.6 percent of the time and
 
          let's give the American people a report every 
  
          quarter or every half year of how we are doing. 
  
          Let's set goals.  We can target these things
 
          and we can set goals.  We can't do everything.
 
 			</p><p>The debate we have today is really one
 
          where it is easy to be partisan.  It is really 
  
          easy because you can always say, if there is a 
  
          terror attack, and there is going to be another
 
          terror attack, and when there is whether it is 
  
          in the subways, or general aviation or ports,
 
          there will always be a way to point and say 
  
          that somebody screwed up.
 
 			</p><p>For example, Customs has initiated a 
  
          very intelligent program in risk management 
  
          called The Customs Partnership.  What they do
 
          is, they prescreen the truck drivers who drive 
  
          the most over the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. 
  
          They are screened in advance and because they
 
          are screened they get something which gets them 
  
          on a fast line.  That is really intelligent.
 
          We can all sit here and say that is 
  
          intelligent.
 
 			</p><p>The test for this country, the test
 
          for the dialogue we are all going to have is 
  
          that if, God forbid, one of the people who has
 
          gone through that screening does something 
  
          terrible, are we going to have all kinds of 
  
          recriminations and say, "we should stop every
 
          truck.  That was a stupid plan, how could we 
  
          have done it."  Or are we going say, "well, we
 
          started a system, the system still makes sense. 
  
          It didn't work in this case, that doesn't mean 
  
          we scrap the system and go back to what we were 
  
          doing at the airports on September 12, which 
  
          was checking everybody, no matter who they were
 
          or what they were."
 
 			</p><p>The point I am really trying to make 
  
          is that we have to think about intelligent risk
 
          management.  The most important place we have 
  
          to think about it is in the private sector, or
 
          certainly not the Federal sector.  There are 
  
          1750 check points at all the airports in the 
  
          United States of America combined, 1750.  There
 
          are approximately 1760 entrances to the New York 
  
          City subway system.  We all agree that TSA is
 
          doing a great job.
 
 			</p><p>So for only $6 billion and 45,000 new 
  
          employees, we could protect the New York City
 
          subway system the way we are protecting the 
  
          airports.
 
 			</p><p>For those of us who ride the subway, 
  
          that sounds like a pretty good idea, but we 
  
          can't do that.  And by the way, when we decide 
  
          to do that we have to deal with the 17,000 
  
          entrances to office buildings in Manhattan.
 
          When we get through there, we probably want to 
  
          start thinking about Chicago, San Francisco, 
  
          Los Angles and everywhere else.
 
 			</p><p>We can't simply throw that kind money 
  
          at the problem.  We have to get the private
 
          sector involved.  I think we have to have 
  
          something on the order of a voluntary identity 
  
          card that companies in the private sector can
 
          issue to people that screens them, voluntarily, 
  
          so that when we have lines, as we are going to
 
          have in office systems, subway stations and 
  
          train terminals, we are going to have those 
  
          lines after the next attack.  And when we do
 
          that we are managing the risk a little more 
  
          rationally.
 
 			</p><p>The one thought I really want to leave 
  
          you with is, I think the best thing a 
  
          commission like this can do is either suggest 
  
          or else go and do it itself, setting specific 
  
          goals in all the areas you are talking about.
 
          And then instead of the Democrats criticizing 
  
          the Republicans for not spending enough money 
  
          here, and the Republicans saying yes, but we
 
          have reorganized the Government and we now have 
  
          this department so obviously we are doing
 
          enough.  We hold a press conference to say we 
  
          are spending this much money here, that is not 
  
          a constructive debate.
 
 			</p><p>You can quantify this.  You can manage 
  
          this the way people in the private sector
 
          manage lots of problems by settling specific 
  
          goals, specific timetables, and having a 
  
          nonpartisan body report on how we are doing.
 
 			</p><p>I thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  If it is acceptable to the
 
          other members of the panel, knowing Mr. Brill 
  
          has to leave, is it all right if he takes five 
  
          minutes of questioning now? 
  
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  Thank you for you 
  
          courtesy.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I understand that.  In that 
  
          case Commissioner Ben Veniste and Commissioner 
  
          Fielding will ask five minutes worth of
 
          questions.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Mr. Brill, I am
 
          quite interested in the fact that you have, in 
  
          the course of the past year or so, spoken to 
  
          people who are on the front line of protecting
 
          the United States in the post 9/11 environment, 
  
          and have not limited yourself to those who are
 
          in supervisory positions, who are at the very 
  
          top of the agencies.
 
 			</p><p>You state that it is necessary to
 
          demonstrate our support for these individuals 
  
          whose views in the long term, rather than in
 
          less optimal kinds of supervision, that 
  
          Congress and others are able to maintain.
 
 			</p><p>How would you coordinate that kind of, 
  
          or conform that kind of appreciation for to 
  
          those who are dedicated to protecting this
 
          country, with the kind of accountability and 
  
          review that is also necessary for us to conduct 
  
          so that we may inform our recommendations, at
 
          the end of the day, with a body of information 
  
          that not only provides an historical record,
 
          but provides a baseline for our 
  
          recommendations?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  I think that's the
 
          challenge.  I don't want to minimize that 
  
          challenge.  Indeed, if I just sat here and
 
          said, well, you know you need to have as many 
  
          whistle blowers as possible come and sit at 
  
          this table and tell you what's wrong with each
 
          and every Federal agency, that would be much 
  
          too simple.  A lot of whistle blowers just have
 
          gripes that relate to labor problems, or their 
  
          own personal problems, they haven't been 
  
          promoted or they are just unhappy.  All 
  
          organizations have that.
 
 			</p><p>So it is not simply, "let the whistle
 
          blowers speak."  It is much more trying to set 
  
             just to give you an example, if Washington 
  
          says that the ports are safer and, by the way,
 
          the ports are safer.  The 2 percent number is a 
  
          fiction.  They are inspecting a much higher
 
          ratio of the truly dangerous cargo and they deserve 
  
          a lot of credit for that, but the people who 
  
          deserve the credit for that are not only Bob
 
          Bonner and his team in Washington, but the 
  
          customs inspectors on the port that I sat with
 
          here in New Jersey, and in other places, who 
  
          devised their own factoring system so that they 
  
          could take a container and have notice of a
 
          container and decide which ones were the high 
  
          risk containers.
 
 			</p><p>What happened was, Washington, they 
  
          consulted with those people and said, you tell 
  
          us, tell us what should be in this list of a 
  
          hundred or two hundred factors that we should 
  
          look at.  You guys have the experience.  There
 
          are some agencies that do that, there are other 
  
          agencies don't.  If you want a sweeping 
  
          generalization I will give you one; Customs  
 
          good, INS   bad.
 
 			</p><p>There is no deadline the INS has ever
 
          had in anyone's memory in this room that they 
  
          have ever met.  There is nothing they have ever 
  
          said they are going to do that they ever did.
 
          I keep kidding my friend, Tom Ridge, that is 
  
          now your problem and I can't wait to see how
 
          you solve it.  Because a lot of people, 
  
          including some of the people at this table, 
  
          such as the former Deputy Attorney General,
 
          have been in charge of solving that problem and 
  
          haven't solved it.
 
 			</p><p>But the way to do it is, again, to try 
  
          to take the politics out of it.  It is easy for 
  
          a senator to say you are not spending enough 
  
          money on this because you can never spend 
  
          enough, and it is easy for people in power to
 
          hold a press conference saying we are do doing 
  
          this, we are doing this, we are doing this. 
  
          They are right, they are, and they are well
 
          motivated sincere people.
 
 			</p><p>The issue is, we don't care what you
 
          say, what we want to know is, is the port 
  
          x percent safer today than it was last month? 
  
          Is general aviation any safer?
 
 			</p><p>The way Washington has solved general 
  
          aviation issue is, you can't fly into National
 
          Airport.  That is the one thing they have done, 
  
          that the gentleman here didn't talk about. 
  
          That is the only safety measure, so far, for
 
          general aviation.  There have got to be other 
  
          standards you can set for that.  There ought to
 
          be productivity standards.  This management 
  
          goal, this management goal, did you meet it, 
  
          did you not meet it?  And that takes a 
  
          nonpartisan group, like the group assembled 
  
          here, who can issue reports to the country the
 
          way we get economic reports every quarter.  We 
  
          are this much safer here, we are not safer 
  
          there.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE: Just to follow up    
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I just want to get
 
          Commissioner Fielding in.  We only have two 
  
          minutes of questions.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  I just want you to
 
          thank you for sugarcoating your comments about 
  
          the INS.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  Actually, they were 
  
          sugarcoated.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  I am sure they were.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  No profanities or 
  
          anything.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Just to follow up, 
  
          since we are short on time.  One of our tasks 
  
          is to try to figure out what's the best way to 
  
          proceed every day as we go forward, because we 
  
          get a little bit of information and then we get
 
          a little bit more and we try to put it all 
  
          together in some sort of a mosaic.
 
 			</p><p>We have hearings like this, where
 
          people come in and are limited by their time, 
  
          by their statements and that sort of thing.  So
 
          we are very free and easy to ask of people, 
  
          such as yourself, if you would stay with us and 
  
          cooperate with us as we move forward?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  I would love to.  This is 
  
          a particularly bad day for me, today   
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  I understand that.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  I will spend all day any 
  
          day to help you with this.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  You obviously have a 
  
          list of people or categories of people that we
 
          could learn from as we move forward.  We don't 
  
          intend to only speak with people in charge.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  I certainly didn't mean to 
  
          imply that either.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  I understand that.  So
 
          if you could do that.
 
 			</p><p>The other thing which I think we could 
  
          call upon you, is obviously goals and standards
 
          could be the same management issues as anything 
  
          else.  We have to figure out and prioritize
 
          goals and standards so that we may have goals 
  
          for bus traffic, but we might not have goals 
  
          for taxis.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  Exactly.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  There, again, I would
 
          hope that we could call on you as we work our 
  
          way through this.  Thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  Thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
  
          Brill.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BRILL:  You're welcome.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I call on Mr. Wermuth.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WERMUTH:  Thank you Mr. Chairman, 
  
          Mr. Vice Chairman, distinguished members of the 
  
          panel.  Thank you for the opportunity to be
 
          here today.
 
 			</p><p>As many of you know from other 
  
          positions that you have held, RAND has been
 
          doing terrorism research and analysis for more 
  
          than 35 years.  We have some of the leading
 
          experts in the country who have been involved 
  
          in that process for a long time.  In fact, at 
  
          least one and perhaps more will appear before
 
          this panel in the coming days.
 
 			</p><p>I am going talk primarily about the
 
          work that we have been honored to do for the 
  
          last four years now, in providing the research 
  
          and analytical support to the advisory panel to
 
          assess domestic response capabilities for 
  
          terrorism involving weapons of mass
 
          destruction, also euphemistically known as the 
  
          Gilmore Commission.
 
 			</p><p>From the written testimony that I 
  
          submitted, you will see the Congressional 
  
          authority for the creation of that panel, and
 
          its specific Congressional mandate, a lot of 
  
          information on the composition of that panel 
  
          and why many people think that panel is unique
 
          primarily because it is made of men and women 
  
          who represent the first response or community,
 
          people in law enforcement, fire services, 
  
          emergency medical services, public health as 
  
          well as people who have Washington experience
 
          and intelligence, and military affairs and 
  
          other matters.
 
 			</p><p>This panel lost one of its most 
  
          distinguished members in the attacks of 
  
          September 11, Ray Downey, Deputy Department
 
          Chief of Special Operations of the Fire 
  
          Department of the City of New York.  Of course,
 
          the incident commander on the day of those 
  
          attacks died in the collapse of the North Tower that 
  
          morning. 
  
 			</p><p>You will see from the written 
  
          testimony, in considerable detail, that this
 
          panel has been very consistent from its 
  
          inception, and long before September 11, 2001, 
  
          it submitted its first report to the President
 
          and the Congress in December of 1999.  It has 
  
          now submitted four and will submit a fifth in
 
          December of this year, before it goes out of
  
          business.
 
 			</p><p>But throughout its deliberations and
 
          policy pronouncements to President and Congress, 
  
          it has consistently adhered to the view that
 
          intelligence is key to this entire effort.  And 
  
          that the proper organizational structure, the 
  
          proper coordination of intelligence collection,
 
          analysis and dissemination, not only within a 
  
          few select federal agencies, but even with
 
          state and local response entities, and now what 
  
          is becoming increasingly obvious is that 
  
          perhaps key elements of the private sector have 
  
          to be included in that process.  That getting 
  
          the intelligence piece right is paramount to
 
          everything that we do.
 
 			</p><p>Prior panelists, I am sure others on 
  
          this panel will continue to note that we are
 
          infinitely vulnerable.  We cannot defend 
  
          against everything.  We cannot secure and
 
          protect against everything.  The importance of 
  
          intelligence and getting that intelligence into 
  
          the hands of people who need it is critical to
 
          all of our efforts. The nexus between 
  
          intelligence and law enforcement is also
 
          critical.
 
 			</p><p>Having people both in the 
  
          intelligence world and all law enforcement
 
          world, understand and appreciate what the other 
  
          parts of all of that effort really means.
 
 			</p><p>This panel started in 1999 and 
  
          throughout its reports have made significant 
  
          substantive recommendations about both 
  
          structure and process for improving our 
  
          intelligence collection analysis and
 
          dissemination efforts.
 
 			</p><p>In December of 2000, in its second 
  
          report, it recommended the creation of an
 
          entity in the Executive Office of the 
  
          President.  Similar, though not exactly, to
 
          what eventually became the Office of Homeland 
  
          Security under Tom Ridge.  As part of that 
  
          recommendation this panel said we need a better
 
          structure.  We need a coordinated intelligence 
  
          effort that brings together all of the
 
          agencies, as well as state and local response 
  
          entities.  To have a more complete, a more 
  
          comprehensive, a more effective way of
 
          gathering and disseminating intelligence 
  
          information.
 
 			</p><p>In subsequent reports the panel has 
  
          continued with those themes in ways to improve 
  
          some of the specific pieces of intelligence 
  
          operations in its most recent report, and that 
  
          is also detailed for you in the written
 
          testimony.  We have also provided copies of 
  
          that report to the Commission staff for each 
  
          of you to have.
 
 			</p><p>The panel recommended the creation of 
  
          something that it called the "National Counterterrorism Center" an all source intelligence 
  
          fusion analysis and dissemination center that 
  
          would be comprised of pieces of the various
 
          agencies directly involved.  The Central 
  
          Intelligence Agency, the Department of Justice,
 
          other components of the intelligence community, 
  
          to bring together all of the raw intelligence 
  
          data, if you will, and to try to make some
 
          sense out of that in a comprehensive fashion. 
  
          To include in that process, representatives of
 
          states and localities that would also help to 
  
          inform through their resources, all the way 
  
          down to the local beat cop on the street, and 
  
          to develop the best possible intelligence 
  
          products for dissemination to people who have
 
          need to know that information.
 
 			</p><p>The President announced in his State 
  
          to the Union address, something called the
 
          Terrorism Threat Integration Center.  Something 
  
          similar to what this panel had recommended two
 
          months before, not exactly the same and I would 
  
          be happy to address the differences between 
  
          what this panel recommended and what the
 
          President has called for.  But needless to say, 
  
          this panel was focused on this and a number of
 
          other issues that you can see in our reports, 
  
          long before September 11.  It has been open and 
  
          unabashed about its policy recommendations.
 
 			</p><p>One of the things that it has said 
  
          consistently with all due deference to the
 
          former United States senators and the two 
  
          former members of Congress on this panel, but 
  
          Congress still doesn't have its act together.  
  
          It is getting better, but for a long time was 
  
          not willing to organize itself in a way that
 
          would address these issues more effectively. 
  
          At least the House of Representatives have now 
  
          started doing do that.
 
 			</p><p>With that, I will complete my oral 
  
          remarks by thanking you again for the
 
          opportunity to be here and to offer this 
  
          Commission any assistance that this advisory 
  
          panel can provide to you and, of course,
 
          anything that the RAND Corporation and any of 
  
          it components can do, to help you with your
 
          very challenging tasks in the months ahead.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Wermuth.  I 
  
          have a feeling we will be taking you up on that
 
          offer.
 
 			</p><p>Zoe Baird.
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  Thank you very much.  I 
  
          appreciate the opportunity to be here.  We all, 
  
          in our small way, hope that we can honor the 
  
          memories of victims of 9/11 and we thank you 
  
          for giving us this opportunity to contribute
 
          to your effort to do that.
 
 			</p><p>I have a few comments I would like to 
  
          make, but I must say that my contribution to
 
          this Commission is already so large that 
  
          anything else I say will be purely redundant
 
          and additive because you have the privilege of 
  
          having the Executive Director of the Markle 
  
          Task Force now as your executive director, and
 
          that will be the most important decision you 
  
          have made.  So I commend you.  And if I can
 
          help in other ways too, I am happy to.
 
 			</p><p>Our task force was focused on the use 
  
          of information in order to prevent terrorism
 
          and protect the national security.  September 11 
  
          exposed for world view what was already well
 
          known in Washington, that we needed to reform 
  
          our intelligence and information systems in 
  
          order to deal with new threats. 
  
 			</p><p>I had the privilege of serving in 1995 
  
          on a congressionally created commission on the
 
          future roles and missions of the intelligence 
  
          community, and at that point in time there was 
  
          no mandate from Congress to look at terrorism
 
          or weapons of mass destruction.  We added it to 
  
          our agenda, but it wasn't in the public debate
 
          as an important future role for the 
  
          intelligence community.
 
 			</p><p>That is of great significance because
 
          we had several years which would have been 
  
          terribly important to develop the capabilities
 
          we need to protect the country in which we 
  
          didn't do that.  Where we had few people who 
  
          spoke the languages we needed to understand.
 
          Where we didn't begin to think about the 
  
          revamping of the very essence of how we do
 
          business and intelligence and information 
  
          sharing.  But instead we tried to patch a 
  
          system that was designed against a singular 
  
          state enemy instead of trying to understand the 
  
          new enemies and emerging threats.
 
 			</p><p>I think that you can't fail to look at 
  
          that as you do your work, because you need to 
  
          know what we have to do differently now.
 
 			</p><p>There is a great deal of discussion in 
  
          Washington about the need for every agency to
 
          invest in filling these stove pipes with more 
  
          information, or in connecting the dots and 
  
          connecting information between agencies.  But
 
          that is the same debate that we had about 
  
          revamping the intelligence community in 1995
 
          and 1996.  It is using the same model of how we 
  
          have always done business, to say that we 
  
          should be able to do more of it.
 
 			</p><p>The current need is radically 
  
          different.  You have heard from a number of
 
          people about the need for information down at 
  
          the ends of the system, if you will, with state 
  
          and local responders, with police, with 
  
          firefighters.  You know the numbers, you know 
  
          there are 11,000 plus FBI agents and there are
 
          50 times that in terms of state and local law 
  
          enforcers.  What do we want these people to be 
  
          doing?  What is their role in the system?
 
 			</p><p>We don't, in this country, want a 
  
          system which will make all of those people and
 
          the UPS truck drivers intelligence agents.  Our 
  
          country isn't worth protecting if it becomes a 
  
          police state where everyone is collecting
 
          information and putting it into massive 
  
          databases that we can then run programs against
 
          in order to find out who is doing what.
 
 			</p><p>But we do need to develop a system 
  
          which moves the information to the people in
 
          local communities who need it when they need, 
  
  and what they need, not everything, but
 
          what they need.  We need to have a system that 
  
          pulls that information into central places in 
  
          Federal Government when it is needed for the 
  
          purposes that it is needed.
 
 			</p><p>That system    our task force which
 
          was composed of one of the imminent members of 
  
          your panel, Senator Gorton, as well as the 
  
          whole range of people with experience both in
 
          Washington and in intelligence and on the Hill, 
  
          as well as people from the state and local
 
          governments, and quite a number of people from 
  
          the information technology community.
 
 			</p><p>We looked at this problem and we said
 
          the system can be built in a way that both 
  
          enhances security and protects the privacy and
 
          liberty interests.  As long as those two 
  
          interests are the key design elements for the 
  
          system, and it is built together, that the
 
          system can be built with existing technology. 
  
          This is not a matter of creating substantial
 
          new technologies over a long period of time 
  
          that are more sophisticated and do more.  In 
  
          fact, a great deal of what we want to be able 
  
          to do, is already done in the private sector.
 
 			</p><p>So the question then becomes, how do
 
          you construct the system in a way that is 
  
          comprehensive in the reach of who can 
  
          participate in it, but not undermining of the
 
          civil liberties of people about whom you 
  
          collect information.
 
 			</p><p>Our conclusion is that the essence of 
  
          doing that, is that the President has to 
  
          develop guidelines for creating the balance
 
          between privacy and security, and that there 
  
          needs to be a public debate about what the
 
          criteria should be for those guidelines.
 
 			</p><p>We made a number of recommendations in 
  
          our report, but your forum may be a very good
 
          one in which to inspire the public debate. 
  
          Because as Steve Brill was saying and others,
 
          unfortunately we still swing wildly and polemically from the 
  
          "protect security," to the "protect privacy" sides 
  
          of the spectrum, and it doesn't do us any good 
  
          to have a unanimous resolution passed to shut 
  
          down a program on privacy grounds, and then to
 
          have actions taken by the Attorney General 
  
          without consultation on security grounds.
 
 			</p><p>We are swinging back and forth in a
 
          way which won't enhance security and we are 
  
          doing it in a political environment, which is
 
          just going to leave people sitting here a year 
  
          from now when you report, feeling no more 
  
          secure than they do today.
 
 			</p><p>We couldn't possibly harden all the 
  
          targets.  I mean, this is a refrain you will
 
          hear from everyone.  Even if you pursue the 
  
          kind of management tool that Steve was talking 
  
          about, which seems very, very sensible, you
 
          will still not be able to harden all the 
  
          targets.
 
 			</p><p>So what do you need to do?  You need 
  
          to have an information system that enables you 
  
          to know who it is that is in the country who is 
  
          hostile and might be inclined to undertake 
  
          these actions.  And when does that hostility
 
          merge with the capability to actually carry out 
  
          an action, so that you have a real threat to 
  
          the country.  That is an information challenge.
 
          People who are hostile do us no harm unless 
  
          they also have the capability to act.
 
 			</p><p>You need information on both sides of 
  
          that, and you need to understand when those 
  
          come together to actually create a threat.
 
 			</p><p>We know that if we had used the 
  
          information we already had on 9/11, that there
 
          is a great deal we would have learned, that 
  
          two of these terrorists were on the INS 
  
          terrorist watch list, that they had common
 
          addresses and common frequent flyer numbers 
  
          with other terrorists.
 
 			</p><p>Now, out of the vast amount of 
  
          information, even if we had the kind of systems 
  
          that we talk about, could we have prevented 
  
          that attack?  I can't tell you that we could 
  
          have.  But we could have felt much, much better
 
          about the role our government plays in 
  
          protecting our citizens, which is one of its 
  
          highest callings.
 
 			</p><p>Therefore, it seems to me that as we 
  
          are looking at what we need to do in the
 
          immediate term, we need to have the public 
  
          debate that talks about the balance between 
  
          privacy and security.  The President needs to
 
          develop guidelines which will govern the 
  
          Federal Government and inform the states and
 
          localities, and we need to, in addition, invest 
  
          in state and local governments being part of 
  
          this system, because the funding isn't there
 
          for them to participate.
 
 			</p><p>There are some very good people doing
 
          good work in their local areas, but they don't 
  
          have the guidelines that empower them and 
  
         constrain them, and they don't have the funds to 
  
          undertake what they need to pursue.
 
 			</p><p>So with that I will close my comments
 
          and be happy to answer questions.  Thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much.  Mr. 
  
          Larsen.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
  
          distinguished members.  At the Institute for
 
          Homeland Security we have been working on this 
  
          specific topic for about three years.  We are 
  
          just about ready to finish and submit a report
 
          which we will provide copies to this Committee. 
  
          It will not be released to the general public,
 
          due to the sensitive nature.
 
 			</p><p>We have focussed on intelligence and 
  
          law enforcement from a somewhat nontraditional
 
          perspective.  We got together 15 senior people 
  
          from each of four communities; law enforcement,
 
          intelligence, public health and agriculture, to 
  
          look at how they could better share 
  
          information.  Food supply is a great concern in 
  
          this country about how it could be attacked.
 
 			</p><p>We have discovered there are great
 
          cultural barriers to that.  It took us about 
  
          six hours to figure out what "business casual" 
  
          meant with that community in our first outset.
 
          When the word "prevention" came up we found out 
  
          that people in the intelligence community have
 
          a completely different definition than people 
  
          from public health or agriculture.
 
 			</p><p>In the Department of Defense where I
 
          spent 32 years, we have a DOD dictionary of 
  
          military and associated terms.  So we all know
 
          what the term "general war" means.  We may not 
  
          agree with it, but that's what the Secretary of 
  
          Defence signed.  That does not happen in interagency
 
          community, but we will be happy to 
  
          provide a copy of that, and I think you will
 
          find it interesting.
 
 			</p><p>I submitted my comments last week so I 
  
          will not repeat them, but I will highlight 
  
          three issues from there.  I see from the letter 
  
          that I was sent from this Commission it says
 
          you are chartered to prepare full and complete 
  
          account of the circumstances surrounding the 
  
          events of September 11, 2001.  As a tax payer,
 
          I would prefer that you focus on the future, 
  
          not the past.  If this Commission were
 
          beginning one month after 9/11, that might be 
  
          available.  I have seen so many changes, I am 
  
          not sure of the value looking at the old
 
          system.
 
 			</p><p>When I say you should focus on the
 
          future, I am not talking about next year, 
  
          because you are not going to fix it for the 
  
          next year, about what we need in the 21st century.
 
          I think your focus should be out around the 
  
          five year point, about which this country is
 
          going to need.
 
 			</p><p>I think there are two alternative 
  
          futures for the day you release your report.  I 
  
          believe May of next year.  One of them will be, 
  
          there will be in new attacks on the American
 
          Homeland and the American people, and Congress 
  
          will expect a certain sort of recommendation 
  
          from a Commission that is operating in that
 
          environment.
 
 			</p><p>The other alternative is, I think is,
 
          we could have had several attacks, perhaps major 
  
          attacks, perhaps even an attack with a weapon 
  
          of mass destruction.  And I think the American
 
          people and Congress would expect a completely 
  
          different recommendation from this committee.
 
 			</p><p>I think we all understand that 9/11 
  
          was not what changed everything.  It is the 
  
          technological revolution that has changed
 
          the threat to hour homeland.  Because of the 
  
          technological resolution small nations and
 
          small well financed terrorist organizations can 
  
          threaten our survival in this country.  That is 
  
          the scenario you must work with because that is 
  
          going to happen whether it is next month, next 
  
          year or five years, we know there has been a
 
          fundamental change in the international 
  
          security equation.  That is what you must deal 
  
          with.
 
 			</p><p>We did an exercise last November, John 
  
          Hamre from CSIS and myself led Silent Vector.
 
          It was the follow on to the Dark Winter 
  
          exercise that we did 18 months ago.  I have 
  
          given you a handout from Silent Vector, and
 
          once again I apologize, because we cannot 
  
          release this to the public.  It is not
 
          classified or anything, but we think it is 
  
          sensitive and we don't like to provide 
  
          terrorists information that would end up in the
 
          newspapers or something.
 
 			</p><p>But what we discovered when we were
 
          working on this exercise was, it was an 
  
          unusual.  Senior leaders, Sam Nunn played the 
  
          President; Jim Woolsey played Bill Sessions 
  
          former FBI Governor, Governor Gilmore played 
  
          Governor of Virginia.  The attack never
 
          occurred in the exercise.  It was about 
  
          specific incredible intelligence information 
  
          coming in, and John Hamre and I wanted to see
 
          where we could force them to make decisions 
  
          that would have an enormous economic impact,
 
          perhaps even more than the attack itself, what 
  
          they would do.
 
 			</p><p>What we discovered in the six months
 
          that we were preparing for the exercise was, 
  
          there is no system in the Federal Government
 
          today, no organization that looks at 
  
          intelligence information that flows in, law 
  
          enforcement information and a vulnerability
 
          assessment and puts them into a fusion center, 
  
          or as some people like to say, an integration
 
          center to look at all this.  And then combine 
  
          that with the sort of data binding capabilities 
  
          other panel members were talking about, that 
  
          could then provide real time information to 
  
          senior elected and appointed officials about
 
          how to use their limited resources.  If you are 
  
          the president, governor, mayor or county 
  
          executive.  How do you do that?
 
 			</p><p>I spent a lot of time talking to 
  
          mayors and chiefs of police.  Two weeks ago I
 
          was talking to the Sheriffs' Association of 
  
          Illinois and I said, how would you know what's 
  
          protecting your county, if I told you there is
 
          a specific threat?  Where is your big 
  
          vulnerability?
 
 			</p><p>With a chart like this, and this is 
  
          rather simple, that just eight people put 
  
          together over a few months.  There is no
 
          organization doing this.
 
 			</p><p>Now the NAPSI that I know, Commission,
 
          you worked on for a while, was somewhat focused 
  
          on the cyber aspects of it, and it was a good 
  
          model because they did look at all sources of 
  
          intelligence information, law enforcement, but 
  
          I don't think the vulnerability assessment
 
          covered enough of the physical.
 
 			</p><p>But when you look at this, we came up 
  
          with some very specific information, if you
 
          only have limited resources to use your 
  
          national guard or state troopers or whatever,
 
          it gives you an idea where you have got to go. 
  
          This integration center we are talking about, 
  
          is not only valuable for prevention, it is also
 
          valuable for how we are going to spend the 
  
          money for mitigation and response.
 
 			</p><p>This sort of center could provide that 
  
          information on as a vulnerability assessment, 
  
          what the threats are, what the capabilities
 
          are, what the intentions are, so we know where 
  
          to spend our money.
 
 			</p><p>Because my bottom line and the whole 
  
          thing about homeland security, and I began 
  
          studying this in 1994, biological warfare is 
  
          what brought me into the homeland security 
  
          business.  My greatest threat, even though I am
 
          very worried about the future of genetically 
  
          engineered biological weapons, which I think is 
  
          a very serious threat, Nuclear weapons, cyber
 
          weapons, you name it.  The one that I fear the 
  
          most is uncontrolled spending.  If we do not
 
          establish the right priorities, we will spend 
  
          ourselves into bankruptcy like the Soviet Union 
  
          did in the Cold War.
 
 			</p><p>7500 miles of border, are we going to 
  
          spend billions on building imaginal lines along
 
          our border, when Ramsey Josef in 1993 attacked 
  
          the World Trade Center with a bomb built across 
  
          the river.  Timothy McVeigh built his bomb in
 
          Kansas.  When Aum Shinrikyo made their sarin, 
  
          they made it in Tokyo a few miles from where
 
          they attacked.
 
 			</p><p>The only weapon you need to bring 
  
          across our border is a nuclear weapon.  You 
  
          don't even need to bring a radiological 
  
          disposal device across our border.  I saw a
 
          picture in a newspaper the other day, one of 
  
          these scanners that looks at the shipping 
  
          containers.  The x ray uses cesium 137.  That
 
          is one of the best things to use for 
  
          radiological disposal device.  You just put the
 
          bomb in the container, you don't even need the 
  
          radiological material, it is in the x ray 
  
          machine right there at the port.
 
 			</p><p>My point is, we cannot build a Maginot
  
          line.  I am concerned about setting priorities
 
          and I think that's the most valuable thing this 
  
          Commission can provide American people.  A 
  
          sense of priorities on this information
 
          integration center that will help not only for 
  
          prevention, but mitigation and response.
 
 			</p><p>That information will be most important.  It 
  
          will be the best investment this country can 
  
          make in security. 
  
 			</p><p>Thank you, sir.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Larsen.
 
          Commissioner Ben Veniste and Commission 
  
          Fielding.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Can I first turn to
 
          Mr. Wermuth and Ms. Baird.  First of all, we 
  
          are very grateful for your contribution.  You
 
          have submitted very important materials that go 
  
          far beyond your oral presentations today, and 
  
          we thank you for those and for your pledge of
 
          cooperation, which we will take you up on.
 
 			</p><p>To comment very briefly on Mr.
 
          Larsen's observation as a tax payer; we are 
  
          charged by our statute to investigate the 
  
          circumstances of 9/11, but we are not starting
 
          from September 12.  We are building upon the 
  
          very good work done by the Joint Inquiry and
 
          other entities which have investigated that, 
  
          and our mandate is to use that material as a 
  
          jumping off point to conclude the 
  
          investigation, hopefully, to provide a 
  
          definitive review of what went wrong on
 
          September 11 that will withstand historical 
  
          scrutiny.  But we are not going to reinvent the 
  
          wheel, and please be assured of that.
 
 			</p><p>Both of you have talked about the 
  
          balance between technological improvements for
 
          our security and the imperative of protecting 
  
          our civil liberties.  There is obviously a 
  
          great deal of tension between those two.
 
 			</p><p>I am interested that, Ms. Baird, you 
  
          have suggested that this Commission may be an
 
          appropriate forum for the national debate with 
  
          respect to those perhaps competing objectives. 
  
          Protecting our security and yet protecting our
 
          civil rights, for it is quite clear that if we 
  
          spend days hiding under the table or afraid
 
          because of increased scrutiny on us, that our 
  
          civil liberties are gone.  Then our opponents 
  
          will have won a victory just as easily as Mr. 
  
          Larsen has said, we spend ourselves into 
  
          bankruptcy as the Soviet Union did.
 
 			</p><p>So I would like to ask you to 
  
          elaborate on what you view as the principal 
  
          points between enhanced security and protection
 
          of our civil liberties.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WERMUTH:  The advisory panel has,
 
          on more than one occasion, used a quotation, I 
  
          think, to describe how it feels about that 
  
          issue and the quote goes, "They that would give
 
          up essential liberty for a little temporary 
  
          safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety." 
          That's Benjamin Franklin in 1759.
 
 			</p><p>This panel has been focused on civil 
  
          liberties.  It has said consistently the civil
 
          liberties of the citizens of the United States 
  
          are really what make us unique in the all the
 
          world.  Nobody else has the kind of system and 
  
          protections for civil rights and privacy 
  
          considerations that we do in the United States. 
  
 			</p><p>Having said that, the panel has 
  
          articulated ways that we can use existing laws.
 
          We don't need significantly expanded laws, more 
  
          intrusive capability.  A lot of this is 
  
          structure and process.  It is simply taking
 
          things that we can already acquire under our 
  
          laws, whether it is through the Foreign
 
          Intelligence Surveillance Act or other court 
  
          supervised activities, or simply information 
  
          that can be gathered legally in any number of
 
          other contexts.
 
 			</p><p>The idea is to bring all that
 
          information together and to fuse it, to use 
  
          that term of the vernacular, to analyze it, to 
  
          create some products out of it that makes sense
 
          and then get it into the hands of people who 
  
          need to have it.
 
 			</p><p>This panel has been concerned,  Randy 
  
          mentioned, with subsequent terrorist attacks.  This 
  
          panel has been concerned that we have an 
  
          opportunity now to get this right, structurally 
  
          and process wise.  If we don't, the hue and cry
 
          from the American public, if it is still wrong 
  
          when the next attack occurs, may cause that 
  
          pendulum to swing too far, and we will feel
 
          compelled or there will be public pressure to 
  
          compel the Government, perhaps, to be more
 
          intrusive, to chip away at civil liberties. 
  
          The men and women, at least of this 
  
          organization and certainly RAND's research has
 
          been articulating that over the years, we 
  
          don't want to do that.  We want to find things
 
          that are consistent with the Constitution, 
  
          consistent with the statutes that are on the 
  
          books and protections that we have, where we
 
          don't find ourselves under the kind of pressure 
  
          of another attack or pending attacks where we
 
          do something.  That is not consistent with 
  
          those values that we have held for so long and 
  
          make us then very much like a lot of other 
  
          countries who don't have the kinds of 
  
          protection that we do.
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  I would suggest that there 
  
          are two ways that you might look at this 
  
          question.  First of all, the development of
 
          guidelines are really the essence of striking 
  
          that balance.  And what I mean by "guidelines"
 
          are directives that make very clear for people 
  
          in the system, from Washington out into the 
  
          local communities.  What it is that they can do
 
          and what it is that they can't do.  What they 
  
          are empowered to do and what the limits are on
 
          their actions.
 
 			</p><p>Right now we have a drive for unfocused 
  
          collection of information everywhere, and then
 
          even less focused or less targeted oversight 
  
          of the collection of that information.  We have
 
          privacy czars, we have Congressional oversight 
  
          bodies, and everyone is trying to grab at what 
  
          they think is the area where they need to limit 
  
          what's going on.
 
 			</p><p>The dynamic then that gets set up is
 
          those who have these weighty responsibilities, 
  
          who don't want to be sitting here in front of 
  
          you having failed when another terrorist attack
 
          occurs, are doing everything they can to use 
  
          information to provide security.  But they
 
          don't have guidance and accountability being 
  
          assumed by policy makers for what it is they 
  
          should be doing, and what the limits are of
 
          what they should be doing.
 
 			</p><p>So you have a system that really does
 
          not provide either security or privacy.  So 
  
          these guidelines, we believe, are really the 
  
          essence of making the clear determinations
 
          about what kind of information we need, who 
  
          needs to have it, who should be providing it,
 
          and how that information moves in and out of 
  
          those who need it, both in the public sector 
  
          and the private sector. 
  
 			</p><p>The other part of this guideline 
  
          point that I would make is, that a great deal
 
          of the information that we need to enhance 
  
          security is in the private sector.  It is our 
  
          belief that it ought to stay in the private
 
          sector and be drawn on the when the Government 
  
          needs it.  This is not necessarily popular in
 
          the private sector because it creates an 
  
          obligation and a relationship with the government 
  
          which doesn't exist in every part of the
 
          private sector, but where it does exist in the 
  
          financial services community, for example, it
 
          has been very successful and not unduly 
  
          burdensome for the private sector.  Again, with 
  
          very clear guidelines about what kind of
 
          information people in the private sector are
  
          required to retain, for how long, how it is
 
          accessed and what their liability is for that.
 
 			</p><p>Just again to be brief, the second 
  
          point that I would make, that I would encourage 
  
          you to look at, is the responsibility of the 
  
          FBI in relationship to other agencies of the
 
          Government.
 
 			</p><p>It is our belief that the FBI should 
  
          do collection, if you will,
 
          the kind of law enforcement collection of 
  
          information that the FBI undertakes now; but
 
          that the FBI should not be the agency that is 
  
          our equivalent of a domestic intelligence 
  
          agency.  We won't probably ever say we have a
 
          domestic intelligence agency, but in fact, the 
  
          collection of information to inform policy
 
          makers, which is what intelligence is, as 
  
          opposed to information that is collected for 
  
          law enforcement. It is our belief should be driven
 
          out of the Department of Homeland Security.
 
 			</p><p>That is for important civil liberty
 
          reasons as well as capabilities of different 
  
          agencies, because if the people who collect the 
  
          information are those who can take away your 
  
          liberty by arresting you, then there is a 
  
          greater threat to civil liberties from the
 
          collection of information by the government, 
  
          and it is unnecessary given that we have to 
  
          build this capability for the first time
 
          somewhere.  So we concluded that building it at 
  
          the FBI was not the right place, again, as part
 
          of that balance.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  We are going to 
  
          drill down a little further on who gets the
 
          authority for the collection and dissemination, 
  
          because I think each of you have a different
 
          views about that.  But just to follow up on 
  
          this point, what I hear from both of you is 
  
          that the means that we have available,
 
          presently existing, are sufficient.  That there 
  
          is no great need for some other silver bullet
 
          kind of intrusive collection mechanism, but 
  
          rather the dissemination, the coordination was 
  
          the failure. 
  
 			</p><p>As we go forward and recognizing the 
  
          imperative of individuals who are charged with
 
          guarding our homeland security, and their 
  
          natural response to the obligations they have, 
  
          where do you see the point of where the rubber
 
          meets the road on the civil liberties issue? 
  
          Where do you see it coming down?
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  One way to look at that is 
  
          the question of whether you need to collect 
  
          information on individuals, or at what point do
 
          you need to collect information on individuals, 
  
          and what kind of information.  For example, if
 
          a police officer stops Mohamed Atta and needs 
  
          to go to a database to find out about this 
  
          person, he doesn't know need to know everything
 
          about Mohamed Atta.  He just needs to know not 
  
          no to let him go.  He needs to know to bring
 
          him in so that whoever has information about 
  
          him is informed, this person where the red 
  
          lights go off, has been stopped. 
  
 			</p><p>I think a very key part of the design 
  
          of the system is to decide who needs to know
 
          what about individuals, and who needs to know 
  
          what about events or activities that they need 
  
          to report to others.  There are a lot of ways
 
          to    you probably get news alerts on your 
  
          e mail all the time.  There are a lot of ways
 
          to move information around, to alert people to 
  
          things that are developing, or to have people 
  
          understand that they have come across something
 
          that others need to know about, without having 
  
          to actually inform everyone in the system about
 
          everything.
 
 			</p><p>I think that is a very important part 
  
          of the design of the role of all the actors in
 
          the system.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  I don't know that there
 
          is a hard and fast rule that you can apply to 
  
          say something is or is not an encroachment on 
  
          civil liberties that will apply in every 
  
          context.
 
 			</p><p>Fortunately, the American people are
 
          not reticent about speaking up on things that 
  
          they think are problems with their own privacy 
  
          and liberty, as well as security interest.
 
 			</p><p>We all know, those of us, and half of 
  
          this panels that are lawyers by profession, and
 
          some of the rest of us who are here testifying, 
  
          with every civil liberty, with every civil 
  
          right there is a corresponding obligation.
 
 			</p><p>We are willing in a reasonable context 
  
          to do things like going through searches of our
 
          person and our baggage when we go on airplanes 
  
          because we know security risk.  So there are 
  
          things that have to be applied in different
 
          situations, but I suggest it is a commonsense 
  
          rule.  We simply need to be cognizant of not
 
          going too far in any context so that we 
  
          encroach on civil liberties, but we are always 
  
          going to be in that balancing act between 
  
          security and civil liberties, and we just need 
  
          to make sure that we try to address as many of
 
          those as we can in the calm between the storms, 
  
          if you will, so that we are not forced into a 
  
          situation of going overboard, as I said before,
 
          when the next attack occurs.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Larsen, you want speak.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  Yes, sir.  In December I 
  
          met with some folks here in New York City 
  
          Police Department, their intelligence
 
          organization, and they talked to me about a 
  
          program we need to look at called Advance
 
          Tip offs.  It is technology that already 
  
          exists, they were asking if they could only 
  
          have the funding to make it work.
 
 			</p><p>If they would have existed on July 5, 
  
          2001, when the Florida State Trooper pulled
 
          over Mohamed Atta for speeding, and punched it 
  
          into the National Crime Information Center, it 
  
          would have tied it to 17 different watch lists, 
  
          everybody from Customs, INS, DEA, CIA and 
  
          others.  As Zoe said, It would not say we want
 
          him for this or whatever, it would just say, 
  
          don't let him go.
 
 			</p><p>I think the American people would have
 
          no problem with that.  The technology can 
  
          protect some of the privacy.  But I think
 
          privacy is going to be one of the most 
  
          important issues you ate going to address.  It should 
  
          be addressed when you have a year to sit down
 
          and do this.  Not the two weeks that it took to 
  
          pass the Patriot Act, 362 pages that changed 17
 
          laws.  I haven't had time to read that.  I 
  
          wonder how many members of Congress read it, 
  
          and how difficult it is when it says change
 
          subparagraph c from "and" to "or."  That would 
  
          take a tremendous amount of work.  I doubt if
 
          any member of Congress read the entire Patriot 
  
          Act.  That's what this Commission can do.
 
 			</p><p>I think you also need to look at, what 
  
          are the real standards of privacy in this 
  
          country today.  We hosted a seminar at George
 
          Washington University, cohosted with the 
  
          Institute in the Elliot School a couple of 
  
          weeks ago, where we looked at law enforcement
 
          intelligence and one thing, what's the new 
  
          standard?
 
 			</p><p>One of the professors at George 
  
          Washington recently made a trip to a conference 
  
          in California and as he got to the airport he
 
          realized he forgot his running shoes, he is a 
  
          big runner.  He said, no problem, I will buy
 
          some new ones, he had got a lot of miles on 
  
          them.  He checks into the hotel, he goes to the 
  
          store and finds the running shoes that he
 
          likes, he buys those.  He sees a great pair of 
  
          mens dress shoes on sale, a pretty good price,
 
          so he buys them.
 
 			</p><p>Did you ever have it when your credit 
  
          card comes back saying, you're little it bit 
  
          out of the profile, what's your mother's maiden 
  
          name or whatever that is.
 
 			</p><p>This guy is a computer information 
  
          specialist at George Washington University, so 
  
          he asked the person on the phone, what made it
 
          pop out of your computer.  He said, three 
  
          things.  First of all, you never bought shoes
 
          in California, you never bought two pair of 
  
          shoes in one day, and you have never bought 
  
          black dress shoes.
 
 			</p><p>Now, I am not going to tell you which 
  
          credit card this was, but one of those big
 
          credit cards knows that about you too.
 
 			</p><p>Now, that sort of information would 
  
          not be available to the FBI, but it would be to
 
          your bank card.  What are the standards?  We 
  
          allow the banks to get away with that.  I think
 
          you need to spend some time with folks in here, 
  
          very seriously talking about new standards of 
  
          privacy. 
  
 			</p><p>We all lived in a small farming 
  
          community where I grew up.  We knew what
 
          everybody was going because it was a small 
  
          community and we knew everyone.  It is a 
  
          different society we live in now and I think you
 
          really need to spend some time looking at what 
  
          those standards are.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Obviously, that is an 
  
          issue that we could go on all afternoon, but 
  
          unfortunately we are short of time.
 
 			</p><p>I would also like to thank you all for 
  
          your cooperation and for coming here today, and
 
          the tremendous paperwork that you have provided 
  
          for us, which is going to be first read by 
  
          those people and then by us.  We do appreciate
 
          it.
 
 			</p><p>I am afraid we have to get onto really
 
          some organizational issues which are apparent 
  
          from this topic, but it has been suggested to 
  
          us in various ways that there is no real need 
  
          for additional organization structure, 
  
          especially within the Federal Government.  That
 
          the authorities that are needed for that exist, 
  
          they are just not fulfilled.  I would 
  
          appreciate each of your comments on that, as an
 
          initial subject on the organizational side of 
  
          this.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WERMUTH:  I think we would agree 
  
          in terms of the authority to conduct certain 
  
          activities, as you see will from the written
 
          testimony in connection with this national 
  
          counter terrorism center which, to a certain
 
          extent, has some of the characteristics that 
  
          the President's initiative for the terrorist 
  
          threat integration center terms of fusion.
 
 			</p><p>The research that we did, the 
  
          recommendation that Gilmore Commission made for
 
          the creation of that center was not to create 
  
          something new in addition to existing 
  
          structures, but to bring pieces of other 
  
          agencies together and put them in the same 
  
          room, if you will, and require them to work
 
          together collectively, comprehensively, rather 
  
          than working from some distance apart with all 
  
          the culture problems and other barriers that
 
          exist between and among Federal entities.
 
 			</p><p>The panel said, take people that are
 
          already doing this and put them together. 
  
          Don't create something brand new and in 
  
          addition to everything else.  We have got
 
          statutory authority.  We have got existing 
  
          capability.  We have got expertise in these in
 
          compartments, but they are simply not together. 
  
          Bring them together.  We happen to say a little 
  
          differently than what the Markle Foundation
 
          recommendation was.  Don't it put it in 
  
          either Department of Homeland Security or the
 
          Central Intelligence Agency or any other 
  
          department.  Put it where it is truly 
  
          independent and objective, an honest broker 
  
          because they are a lot of customers.  The 
  
          Department of Homeland Security is not the only
 
          customer.  The Central Intelligence Agency is 
  
          not the only customer.  The Department of 
  
          Justice is not the only customer.
 
 			</p><p>Put it in a place where there really 
  
          aren't the inherent pressures, if you will, and
 
          the competition for resources within an 
  
          existing agency.  Make it free standing, 
  
          objective, independent, but bring all the
 
          pieces together into that single location. 
  
          That's what we said in a structure standpoint.
 
 			</p><p>And by the way, we don't need 
  
          additional statutory authority other than 
  
          authority maybe to move the responsibilities
 
          for those from the agencies where they are into 
  
          this other structure.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Ms. Baird.
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  Yes, I would just say that 
  
          I think that there is so much to be done to 
  
          build on the existing capabilities and to 
  
          create the activities that need to be
 
          undertaken, that I would put your focus there 
  
          rather than putting your focus on thinking 
  
          about new laws or new authorities, because
 
          there is a great deal of capability, legal 
  
          authority, and talent and agency commitment that
 
          needs to be developed.  That should really be 
  
          the priority.
 
 			</p><p>I do think that the Department of
 
          Homeland Security has an important domestic 
  
          role to play, that you can encourage, be played
 
          out by that department.  It has quite a number 
  
          of agencies in it that have a great deal of 
  
          information that needs to be part of this
 
          system and that needs to be drawn on by the 
  
          rest of the Government and the locales.
 
 			</p><p>It also had the potential of being a 
  
          single point of contact for much of the private 
  
          sector information, which is not going to 
  
          comfortably be shared with CIA or foreign 
  
          intelligence community.  So as the Department
 
          of Homelands Security is ramping up and much of 
  
          the activity that was hoped for by those who 
  
          passed the legislation on Capitol Hill, is
 
          being pulled into other agencies other than 
  
          Department of Homeland Security or umbrella
 
          agencies.
 
 			</p><p>You might look hard at what you would 
  
          encourage the Department of Homeland Security
 
          to be able to do, and particularly on the 
  
          domestic front, what is important to have
 
          happened in an agency that is not under the 
  
          direction of the Director of Central 
  
          Intelligence.  What will the American people be
 
          more comfortable having undertaken and be 
  
          guided by a domestic agency as opposed to a
 
          foreign intelligence agency.  And I think you 
  
          have seen some of the debates on Capitol Hill, 
  
          much more skittishness about the potential for 
  
          privacy intrusions from the Defense Department 
  
          or the foreign intelligence community, than
 
          people feel about domestic agencies, and I 
  
          would look hard at that.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  But, of course, the DCI
 
          exists as a concept.  Is it your feeling that 
  
          that's just not a popular vehicle for doing
 
          this?
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  I don't think you will 
  
          ever persuade the American people that the
 
          Director of Central Intelligence is a benign 
  
          entity, because we have operated outside this
 
          country with rules we will not be comfortable 
  
          applying inside the country, and he has been 
  
          responsible for those operations.
 
 			</p><p>Perhaps five or ten years from now, 
  
          after the system sorts itself out and people
 
          understand comfortably how we can use 
  
          information domestically to protect security, 
  
          people with come to that.  But I think that 
  
          will not be a comfortable place to have the 
  
          leadership for domestic intelligence or
 
          information collection, particularly from the 
  
          private sector.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  I don't think this new
 
          organization, that I would like to see, fits 
  
          under the Department of Justice or DCI.  At one
 
          time I thought it might fit under the new 
  
          Department of Homeland Security, but I am no 
  
          longer sure now.
 
 			</p><p>Unfortunately, I think what John 
  
          Gannon was trying to do over there got
 
          derailed.  I think there was some potential 
  
          there.  Clearly the terrorism threat 
  
          intelligence center does not give us what we
 
          need, and clearly, we cannot have it under law 
  
          enforcement, that is the part I think the
 
          American people will insist, that we must 
  
          protect the rights of the accused.  So I think 
  
          there are other models we can look at in other 
  
          countries that could perhaps give you some 
  
          vision here.  My final recommendation here was,
 
          I think you need to start with a blank piece of 
  
          paper.
 
 			</p><p>The first time I went to visit the
 
          NAPSI, and I say NAPSI was a wonderful model 
  
          that came out of PDD 39, the previous
 
          administration, where they fused those things 
  
          together.  But when you first walked in the 
  
          door, the first day I visited there, they
 
          reached in, they pulled out their badges, they 
  
          were cops.  And they admitted that only 14
 
          percent of computer crime was reported, because 
  
          businesses didn't want to go to Justice, 
  
          because if you said there has been a computer
 
          crime and they came out and investigate, 
  
          anything they found out could be used against
 
          you in a court of law.
 
 			</p><p>So we are going to have to remove it 
  
          from Justice and, I think, the intelligence 
  
          community.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  That raises a question,
 
          I guess, I really would like all three of your 
  
          comments too.
 
 			</p><p>We have obviously had an historic role
 
          for the FBI, an historic role for the CIA.  One 
  
          was overseas and one was domestic.  And the FBI
 
          is an adjunct to the Department of Justice.  It 
  
          provides information for the Department of 
  
          Justice, their indictments come down.  Suddenly
 
          all the information goes into the black hole. 
  
          It can't be shared, it is grand jury
 
          information, it is law enforcement information, 
  
          but it is being used in the adjudication of 
  
          criminal cases and, therefore, doesn't get
 
          disseminated.
 
 			</p><p>How are we going to solve that problem
 
          in any of these schemes?
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  I think there is a model. 
  
          The national infrastructure protection center 
  
          is being moved to the new department.  They 
  
          looked at all source intelligence information,
 
          law enforcement sensitive information which 
  
          even included grand jury testimony, and with as 
  
          the vulnerability.  But like I say, once again,
 
          primarily focussed on cyber aspects of it.
 
 			</p><p>That model is there. It works.  There
 
          are certain things that take place in the 
  
          counter terrorism task force that also works. 
  
          I agree, I don't think we need new legislation,
 
          I think we new need new organization.  I think 
  
          General Eisenhower got it right when he said
 
          "the right organization will not guarantee 
  
          success, but the wrong organization will 
  
          guarantee failure."
 
 			</p><p>Now we have the wrong organization. 
  
          We need a new one.
 
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING:  Zoe.
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  Well, you have probably 
  
          the leading expert on your own Commission in 
  
          Jamie, on that question.  So I won't even try 
  
          to venture into how information gets shared,
 
          because she will make sure you are straight there.
 
 			</p><p>But I would say something that is 
  
          perhaps not responsive, but I think important,
 
          which is that if much of this information is 
  
          not collected by law enforcement, if
 
          intelligence information which is intended for 
  
          policy makers is collected through other means, 
  
          or under the direction of the Department of
 
          Homeland Security, then you don't put the FBI 
  
          in the challenging position of deciding not to
 
          pursue its own rules.  You then have a policy 
  
          maker who says, okay, this is what we know 
  
          about this group of people.  What policy action
 
          should be taken?  Do we want to prosecute them 
  
          to get them off the street?  Do we want to
 
          deport them?  Do we want to continue to follow 
  
          them to see who they are working with outside 
  
          the country, or at other levels or in other 
  
          cells?  Do we want to engage in diplomacy with 
  
          the country from which they came to try and
 
          learn more about what's going on in that 
  
          country that could lead to a more substantial 
  
          terrorist threat by virtue of the fact that we
 
          have this information on their citizens, 
  
          perhaps information about relationships between
 
          their citizens and others.
 
 			</p><p>So, if you have in the first instance 
  
          the information going to policy makers, then
 
          the policy makers can decide that this is 
  
          something that should go into that law
 
          enforcement box.  And how black the box is 
  
          today is a little grayer than it used to be. 
  
          But be as I say, Jamie is the best person to
 
          inform you about that.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Wermuth.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WERMUTH:  Intelligence collection 
  
          for law enforcement purposes investigation, 
  
          arrest and prosecution is, in our view, very 
  
          different than intelligence collection analysis 
  
          and dissemination for deterrents, prevention
 
          and detection.
 
 			</p><p>We have said that in our reports, that 
  
          the FBI is the best law enforcement agency in
 
          the world.  They don't understand intelligence 
  
          collection analysis at the strategic level.
 
          They do it for law enforcement and it is 
  
          different.  They protect it, as you have 
  
          suggested, in the grand jury testimony and
 
          investigations.  That is one of the reasons 
  
          this panel said take the FISA collection
 
          responsibilities out of the FBI and put it into 
  
          this reconstructed, this new design of 
  
          capability in a stand alone center.
 
 			</p><p>Let me offer an anecdote that I think 
  
          is an analogous.  In a prior    I had something
 
          to do with counter drug policy making and 
  
          operations.
 
 			</p><p>In 1990, about this time of year in 
  
          1990, if memory serves, the counter narcotic 
  
          center at the Center Intelligence Agency came
 
          to the FBI and DEA and said, could we see all 
  
          of your files on Columbian drug 
  
          operations.  Of course, the answer that you
 
          might expect was, we can't turn over all our 
  
          files to you, there are open investigations,
 
          there is grand jury testimony in there, we might 
  
          taint evidence that would be presented in a 
  
          court.
 
 			</p><p>So the CNC went away and scratched 
  
          their heads for a few months and came back and
 
          said, okay, can we see all of your closed 
  
          files.
 
 			</p><p>After some agonizing with people in
 
          the Office of Legal Policies and the Department 
  
          of Justice, and elsewhere within the
 
          structures, the Bureau and the DEA turned over 
  
          their closed files to the Counter Narcotics 
  
          Center.  Ninety days later the CNC had mapped the 
  
          Cally Cartel to about 95 percent level of 
  
          assurance.
 
 			</p><p>That is the kind of things we are 
  
          talking about when we talk about strategic 
  
          intelligence versus intelligence for law
 
          enforcements.  It is different situation, and 
  
          this panel has said that they are not sure that
 
          the FBI would ever be able to change their 
  
          culture to understand the difference in the 
  
          two.  And even if they could, it would take new
 
          generation of FBI agents and leadership, 
  
          despite all the great things that Director
 
          Muller and some of the senior people in the FBI 
  
          are trying to do.
 
 			</p><p>It is an inherent culture in that
 
          organization that they do things for law 
  
          enforcement purposes.  They don't do it for
 
          strategic purposes, for deterrents, prevention 
  
          and protection.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  We will take five more 
  
          minutes.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  With respect to
 
          comment that Ms. Baird made in her written 
  
          materials relating to agencies rushing out to 
  
          collect information and technology on their
 
          own, resulting in stove piping of systems.  We 
  
          have seen the unfortunately named Total
 
          Information Assessment Office recently 
  
          defunded.  Undoubtedly, throughout the 
  
          Government, since there is this great infusion
 
          of funds thrown at counter terrorism, what have 
  
          you observed in terms of duplication of
 
          efforts, duplication of funding, which perhaps 
  
          we, in being on the scene and in realtime, 
  
          observers of situation can perhaps influence in
 
          some way.  And if we could, what would you have 
  
          us do?
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  A great deal of funding is 
  
          being put into the information collection 
  
          capability for the government, but it is being 
  
          put into filling up the stove pipes, by and 
  
          large.  It is not being put into developing a
 
          system of sharing information and at the 
  
          federal, state and local level.  So very little 
  
          money is going into the intersection between
 
          agencies or between the federal and local, and 
  
          having the state and local governments fail to
 
          be able to be part of the system.
 
 			</p><p>I would encourage you to look at, and 
  
          to ask people to provide you with information
 
          about the dollars that are going to developing 
  
          the systems of sharing and integration of a
 
          national system as opposed to filling the stove 
  
          pipes of particular federal agencies.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WERMUTH:  I am trying to find the
 
          exact cite that the National Strategy for 
  
          Homeland Security talked about the creation of
 
          something that it call it a Collaborative 
  
          Classified Enterprise, and that was supposed to 
  
          be exactly the kind of stuff that Zoe was 
  
          talking about, to link all of this together for 
  
          both intelligence and information sharing so
 
          that you could get information to the people 
  
          who needed to have it, at the right time, at 
  
          the right place.  You could bring information
 
          that was gathered in appropriate ways, into 
  
          this collaborative classified enterprise, was
 
          what the national strategy called it.
 
 			</p><p>We suggested that be in this new 
  
          national counter terrorism center that the
 
          panel called for.  It wouldn't have to be 
  
          there, but it certainly needs to be, as Zoe
 
          said, a comprehensive focused prioritized 
  
          mechanism for doing exactly what she was 
  
          suggesting.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  I approach this with 
  
          no preconception, but one of the things that we
 
          have heard a lot about and will continue to 
  
          study, is the question of whether this domestic 
  
          intelligence collection enterprise is moved out 
  
          of the FBI, where it basically now resides, and 
  
          put somewhere else.
 
 			</p><p>Two things:  One, you have this great 
  
          aircraft carrier of the FBI turning.  We are in 
  
          the process of turning.  They have devoted
 
          assets, they have re-trained.  They are trying 
  
          to do what we are asking them to do.
 
 			</p><p>At the same time there are discussion 
  
          that we should go to something like a British 
  
          MI5 or the Canadian bifurcation or the French,
 
      God forbid, or something 
  
          else.
 
 			</p><p>Is there a suggestion from your 
  
          collective experience as to one country which 
  
          would be a model, in a democratic country,
 
          which operates in an efficient way that should 
  
          be a model, at least in part, for us.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  We looked at MI5 very 
  
          closely, for example.  But we deliberately 
  
          stayed away from trying to draw a comparison 
  
          with what this panel was recommending with the 
  
          national counter terrorism center, including
 
          the domestic collection piece and MI5.
 
 			</p><p>The simple fact is, the laws are 
  
          different.  The concerns about civil liberties
 
          are different.  The concerns about privacy are 
  
          different.  You might compare some structure
 
          just in terms of where it is located, who it 
  
          reports to it, and who can task it and what 
  
          some of the limitations are.
 
 			</p><p>We finally came to the conclusion that 
  
          there wouldn't be anything advantageous from
 
          making those comparatives because so many 
  
          things are different.  This panel said this is 
  
          a U.S. problem, we need a U.S. solution, and
 
          that's why it recommended what it did, without 
  
          any artifical or arbitrary comparisons to the
 
          structures in other countries.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  We have a couple of 
  
          minutes.  We have three commissioners who have 
  
          been waiting to ask questions; Senator Gorton, 
  
          Commissioner Gorelick and Senator Cleland.
 
          Fast questions and answers, if we can.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  Mine would take far too 
  
          long, so I will defer    I couldn't even ask
 
          the question in the time.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  We all want to hear
 
          that question at some point.
 
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON:  You will.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  First let me say to Zoe
 
          Baird and to the Markle Foundation, thank you 
  
          for directing our attention to, A, the low
 
          hanging fruit of engaging state and local 
  
          government agencies and corporate America, and 
  
          for teeing up the very important question of
 
          the balance between privacy and the efficacy of 
  
          law enforcement and counter terrorism.
 
 			</p><p>My questions are primarily directed to 
  
          Mr. Wermuth and Mr. Larsen.  They go to the 
  
          question of efficacy of commissions. 
  
 			</p><p>Mr. Wermuth, I would have thought that 
  
          if you read your commission recommendations,
 
          together with the conclusions of the joint 
  
          inquiry which just, after all, looked at 
  
          intelligence failures, but nevertheless, that
 
          it would have been sickening to you because you 
  
          recommended, well before September 11, 2001,
 
          that we have a fusion of intelligence, law 
  
          enforcement, immigration information, and that 
  
          we engage fully state and local law
 
          enforcement.  And when you put that together 
  
          with what the joint inquiry said would have
 
          occurred in terms of the apprehension of 
  
          leadership of those who perpetrated 9/11, that 
  
          if you had gotten that information together you
 
          could have apprehended those people, or 
  
          possibly you could have.
 
 			</p><p>It is a very disturbing picture.  And 
  
          here we are, ten commissioners, a very able 
  
          staff, very able people willing to help us, and 
  
          my question to you as we are in this first 
  
          public hearing, looking to the end of our
 
          process is, do you have any second thoughts 
  
          about what you did with your recommendation? 
  
          Are there things that we can learn about how to
 
          be more effective and have greater impact, so 
  
          that the scenario I just described wouldn't be
 
          repeated in the future?
 
 			</p><p>MR. WOLOSKY:  It certainly is 
  
          frustrating when you look at this from an
 
          historical context now, to realize how many, 
  
          what now appeared to be pressing
 
          recommendations this panel made before 
  
          September of 2001.  But you have served in  a 
  
          major department of government and the highest
 
          levels.  Others of you have, others have served 
  
          in Congress and as chief executives of states.
 
          You know the tensions that exist.  You know the 
  
          parochial nature of certain issues that exist. 
  
          You know the politics, both with a little P and 
  
          a big P that often enter into deliberations of 
  
          legislative bodies and Executive Branch
 
          agencies.
 
 			</p><p>That is not to say that any of that 
  
          was not well intentioned at the time.  Our
 
          agencies do compete with each other.  Our 
  
          political parties compete with each other.
 
          Heavens, the two Houses of Congress compete 
  
          with each other.
 
 			</p><p>I think there is significant value in
 
          commissions just like the one on which you now 
  
          sit because you bring a wealth of information
 
          to the discussion without the constraints, 
  
          maybe, that you once had when you served within 
  
          a specific branch of government or represented
 
          a party in a particular house of Congress.
 
 			</p><p>You will be able, from what we have
 
          learned, you will be able to be more open and 
  
          honest and comprehensive, and nonpartisan in a 
  
          capacity like this, than perhaps you were in 
  
          positions in which you served in the past.
 
 			</p><p>To us that's beneficial.  That is not
 
          to say that you need to establish a national 
  
          commission for every single problem and expect 
  
          it to solve the problems, but you can have some
 
          impact.  Of the 79 recommendations that our 
  
          advisory panel made in its first three reports,
 
          66 of them have been adopted in whole or in 
  
          major part.  So you can have an impact.  That 
  
          doesn't mean that you will get all of the
 
          things right, but if you are a panel that is 
  
          composed of the kind of people that are clearly
 
          on this panel, with your expertise and national 
  
          recognition.  Suffice it to say that, your 
  
          recommendations and I dare say they will be
 
          reasonable and logical and sound and supported 
  
          by the evidence and everything else, you will
 
          have an impact.  You shouldn't be concerned 
  
          about that.
 
 			</p><p>The only concern would be, can you do 
  
          it fast enough to get them into play before the 
  
          next events happen.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you.  I would 
  
          like to hear any comments from Mr. Larsen and 
  
          Ms. Baird.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  I don't often disagree 
  
          with Michael.  I disagree a little bit.  We had
 
          a close mutual friend, Philip Coleman, when he 
  
          sat down to be the director on the Presidential 
  
          Commission on Critical Infrastructure and
 
          Protection.  He went back and looked at a whole 
  
          bunch of commissions and what effect did they
 
          really have.  It is pretty discouraging when 
  
          you really look at the data out there.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Well, he also, his
 
          commission, the Presidential Commission on 
  
          Critical Infrastructure catalogued all of the
 
          vulnerabilities of each of the sectors in this 
  
          report, and one questions what has happened to all 
  
          that information, and is it being used. 
  
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  A very good question.  I 
  
          know NAPSI was very focussed in cyber owning
 
          and the physical dropped off the scope.
 
 			</p><p>But I tell you in January    a 
  
          recommendation I have for you how to get better
 
          action out of your report.  You don't want it 
  
          to become shelfware, like so many do, okay,
 
          another report, let's stick it over there.
 
 			</p><p>In January of 2001, Dr. Tara O'Toole 
  
          from Johns Hopkins and I, were terribly
 
          concerned about this country being vulnerable 
  
          to an attack of smallpox.  Something we know
 
          that Iraq has, that could threaten the survival 
  
          of the nation.
 
 			</p><p>Now, we could have gotten a small
 
          study funded by the Markle Foundation or 
  
          someone, and gone out and written a report and
 
          put it up there and what would it have done? 
  
          What we did together was put together that 
  
          exercise, Dark Winter, and then not so much the 
  
          exercise, but how we took that 35 minute 
  
          presentation in a dramatic format, and sat down
 
          with Senator Warner in his office with Senator 
  
          Roberts, with Vice President Cheney.  We 
  
          briefed Vice President Cheney nine days after
 
          9/11 and said this is what it means to this 
  
          country only having 15 million doses of smallpox
 
          vaccine.  I accept that is very focused, one 
  
          small issue.  We got a $500 million program out 
  
          of that and the country is far more secure.
 
 			</p><p>There is another commission going on 
  
          right now looking at another threat and has
 
          come to us and said, could you do a Dark Winter 
  
          style thing for us to help us when we finish 
  
          our study and our scientific work, to put it
 
          together so we can take it around town and sit 
  
          down either in Congressional hearings or
 
          one on one with senior leaders and say, let us 
  
          show you what it would be like if we have 
  
          another serious threat coming to our country 
  
          with the system we have now.  Let us show you 
  
          what it would be like if we had this new system
 
          we recommend.
 
 			</p><p>A dramatic 30 minute presentation like 
  
          that, is something that might help you market
 
          your recommendations.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Zoe, do you want to have the
 
          last word on that question?
 
 			</p><p>MS. BAIRD:  No.  I think enough has 
  
          been said. Thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Last question from Senator 
  
          Cleland.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
  
          Chairman.  Just one quick one.  We may be 
  
          getting lost in the weeds here, for the second
 
          day in a row here, I have heard distinguished 
  
          panelists say there is going to be another
 
          attack.  Mr. Larsen, you said that, the 
  
          gentleman here and Ms. Baird.  We heard that 
  
          yesterday from an expert on terrorism, who has 
  
          been studying that since 1974, I think.
 
 			</p><p>That's very scary.  Given the fact
 
          that what little we know about Osama bin Laden, 
  
          and we haven't found him yet apparently, is 
  
          that he generates his energy from the
 
          allegation that particularly America is overstepping 
  
          its bounds and has a footprint on
 
          Islamic lands in Egypt, in Saudi Arabia and now 
  
          we have a war in Iraq.  I mean, are these aid 
  
          to Egypt, aid to and a base in Saudi Arabia,
 
          the war in Iraq.  Are these actions by the 
  
          United States more likely to produce the
 
          counterattack or this next attack, Mr. Larsen?
 
 			</p><p>What elements are there that make you 
  
          think we are going to get hit again, and what
 
          would lessen those elements?
 
 			</p><p>MR. LARSEN:  The fact that we are at
 
          war in Iraq today, in my mind, there is no 
  
          question that it increases the threat of 
  
          attacks on our homeland in the short term. 
  
 			</p><p>However, if we are we were not at war 
  
          in Iraq today and Saddam refused to disarm, I
 
          think the long term, the threat would be even 
  
          be more significant.  We're not at war today in 
  
          Iraq to make it safer this week or this month.
 
          I think it is trying to make a safer 
  
          internationally security environment for my
 
          children and your children and grandchildren. 
  
          That is what it is.
 
 			</p><p>The international security equation
 
          has changed, as I said in the beginning, with 
  
          technology, small actors can seriously threaten
 
          us.  It is not just Osama bin Ladin, it is 
  
          others, but you mentioned Osama bin Ladin.  He 
  
          doesn't hate us for what we do in our foreign
 
          policy, I think, as much as and what we are 
  
          and what we believe in in this country.  That's
 
          not going to change.  So I think we have to 
  
          understand it.  I hate saying that.  I hate 
  
          saying that to my kids and grandkids down in 
  
          Texas that there are going to be more attacks, 
  
          but it is a fact that we have to adjust to.
 
          It is going to happen.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Anyone else, Mr. 
  
          Wermuth.
 
 			</p><p>MR. WERMUTH:  I happen to think that 
  
          whether we were in Iraq or not    we said this
 
          clearly, even before the current conflict 
  
          started that the likelihood, for the for all 
  
          the reasons that Randy has mentioned, there are
 
          people out there and not just Osama bin Laden, 
  
          there are just people out there who don't like
 
          us.  And are likely now because the mold has 
  
          been broken, and we have had significant 
  
          terrorist attacks inside the United States,
 
          that others will be emboldened to do it.
 
 			</p><p>But I  mean, let's face it, we had
 
          what could have been a disastrous attack right 
  
          down the street in 1993 and a lot of people 
  
          said you better be paying attention to that.  
  
          You need to understand what implications that 
  
          has for the future, and some people listened
 
          but not enough people listened.
 
 			</p><p>The operations in Iraq may do as 
  
          someone said yesterday, create another hundred
 
          Osama bin Ladens, but I would suggest that any 
  
          number of policies of this country, just
 
          because we do what we do, we are who we are, 
  
          might just as well push some of those people 
  
          over the edge into attacking us at some point
 
          in time.
 
 			</p><p>So I don't think that this country can
 
          stop taking decisive action when it is in the 
  
          U.S. national interest to do that, as long as 
  
          we have good grounds to do it.  Whatever it
 
          is, whether it is economic policy or military 
  
          engagement or types of diplomacy or sanctions
 
          or whatever else it happens to be, just because 
  
          we are scared of the next terrorist attack.
 
 			</p><p>And I know Senator, that is not what 
  
          you were suggesting.  I think we, 
  
          obviously, have to take into consideration what
 
          reactions our actions may cause in other parts 
  
          of the world and within other cultures, but we 
  
          still need to continue to try to do the right
 
          thing wherever we interest in the world.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very, very much. 
  
          It has been a wonderful panel.  Thank you so 
  
          much for your help and for your past work, and
 
          hopefully we can call on you as we go along in 
  
          the future.
 
 			</p><p>Thank you all very much.  We will try 
  
          to get back, if we can, a 35 minute recess, if 
  
          we can do that.
 
 			</p><p>(Recess.)
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  The Commissioner of Police
 
          and the Commissioner of Fire.  They were here 
  
          yesterday and have promised future cooperation 
  
          with the Commission. 
  
 			</p><p>We have also got a statement to be 
  
          read into the record by Senator Corzine.
 
          Senator Corzine has been very interested in the 
  
          Commission and very helpful to the Commission 
  
          at this point, and he had a statement which we
 
          will read into the record.
 
 			</p><p>Today's panel starts now and will end
 
          at 3:00.  We have Shawn Kelley, who is in the 
  
          Arlington County Fire Department.  I appreciate 
  
          your being here.  William Baker, of the American
 
          Society of Civil Engineers, and Ken Holden from 
  
          New York Department of Design and Construction.
 
          I thank you all for being here.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Kelley, would you like to start.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  Good afternoon.  My name
 
          is Shawn Kelly and I am Assistant Chief with 
  
          Arlington County Fire Department and was one of
 
          the incident commanders throughout the rescue 
  
          and recovery efforts at the Pentagon.
 
 			</p><p>On behalf of the Arlington County 
  
          Government and the men and women of the fire 
  
          services in Northern Virginia and the Washington
 
          D.C. area, thank you for allowing me to address 
  
          you today.
 
 			</p><p>Like most fire departments in the
 
          region, the Arlington County Fire Department 
  
          participated in regional disaster drills
 
          consisting of hospital or college dorm fires, 
  
          mass transportation accidents and even 
  
          structural collapses. But never did we think of
 
          training for an incident that combined an 
  
          airliner crash into a large building,
 
          structural collapse, along with large building 
  
          fire that was fuelled by jet fuel.
 
 			</p><p>Following the March 1995 sarin nerve
 
          agent attack in a Tokyo subway that killed 
  
          twelve commuters and injured hundreds more, the
 
          Arlington County Fire Department recognized 
  
          that America's first responders were not 
  
          trained or equipped to handle such emergency.  
  
          Our training changed its focus towards large 
  
          scale incident management.
 
 			</p><p>From the moment American Airlines 
  
          flight 77 crashed into the west side of the 
  
          Pentagon at 0938 a.m. and for the subsequent
 
          ten days, this was a major fire and rescue 
  
          incident, the responsibility of the Arlington
 
          County Fire Department.
 
 			</p><p>The destruction caused by the attack 
  
          was immediate and catastrophic.  The 270,000
 
          pounds of metal and jet fuel hurling into the 
  
          solid mass of Pentagon is the equivalent in
 
          weight to a diesel train locomotive, except it 
  
          is travelling at more than 400 miles per hour. 
  
          More than 600,000 airframe bolts and rivets,
 
          and 60 miles of wire were instantly transformed 
  
          into white hot shrapnel.
 
 			</p><p>The resulting impact, penetration and 
  
          burning fuel had catastrophic effects on five 
  
          floors and three rings on the Pentagon 
  
          corridors numbers 4 and 5.
 
 			</p><p>This act of evil cost the lives of 198
 
          persons in the Pentagon attack; 194 were innocent 
  
          victims and 5 terrorist perpetrators of this 
  
          criminal act.
 
 			</p><p>Though the Arlington County Fire 
  
          Department did not feel its response to
 
          terrorist attack on the Pentagon was 
  
          extraordinary, it did not happen by chance. 
  
          The Arlington County Fire Department's
 
          preparedness was a result of years or hard 
  
          work, reorganization, intensive contemporary
 
          training and updating command staff education.
 
 			</p><p>The successful response to the 
  
          terrorist attack on the Pentagon can be
 
          attributed to effects of ordinary men and women 
  
          performing in extraordinary fashion.  These
 
          efforts are described through an after action 
  
          report that was prepared for the Arlington 
  
          County by Titan Systems Corporation. 
  
 			</p><p>It was accomplished through a grant 
  
          from and support of the Department of Justice,
 
          Office of Justice Programs, Office of Domestic 
  
          Preparedness.
 
 			</p><p>The After Action Report describes the
 
          activities of Arlington County and the 
  
          supporting jurisdictions, government agencies
 
          and other organizations in response to the 
  
          September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the 
  
          Pentagon.
 
 			</p><p>It is organized into four principal 
  
          annexes and four supporting annexes.  Annex A
 
          is fire department operations and emergency 
  
          medical service activities, and it is the bulk 
  
          of the report.
 
 			</p><p>Annex B is about the response of the 
  
          local area hospitals and clinics and their
 
          ability to handle communications and the number 
  
          of patients that could have been brought to 
  
          them. 
  
 			</p><p>Annex C covers local, federal and 
  
          private law enforcement agencies.
 
 			</p><p>And Annex D is the emergency 
  
          management and emergency operation center that 
  
          supported the first responders and citizens or
 
          Arlington County.
 
 			</p><p>You will see on September 12,
 
          Arlington County public schools were open and 
  
          trash was picked up and services continued in 
  
          that jurisdiction.
 
 			</p><p>Although the response to the September 
  
          11, 2001, terrorist attack is commendable, the
 
          After Action Report contains 235 recommendation 
  
          and lessons learned.  Each which must be 
  
          understood within the context and setting of
 
          the Pentagon response.
 
 			</p><p>The first segment describes
 
          capabilities others should emulate and speaks 
  
          to incident command system and the unified 
  
          command that was established at this event.  
  
          Mutual aid with surrounding and supporting 
  
          jurisdictions and outside support, and the
 
          Arlington County emergency management plan that 
  
          was put into place, the Employee Assistance 
  
          Program, the training that we had undergone,
 
          exercises that we had performed and shared 
  
          experiences.
 
 			</p><p>The final segment describes challenges 
  
          that must be met and speaks to self 
  
          dispatching, fixed and mobile command and
 
          control facilities, communications, logistics 
  
          and hospital coordination.
 
 			</p><p>The Arlington County Fire Department 
  
          is addressing these challenges by updating its 
  
          communications system, the purchase of a
 
          dedicated command vehicle, establishment of 
  
          a logistic segment within the department, and
 
          ongoing coordination with local and regional 
  
          hospitals.
 
 			</p><p>In summary, the response to 2001 
  
          terrorist attack on the Pentagon was successful 
  
          by any measure.  Although the tragic loss of
 
          life from this horrific event could not be 
  
          avoided, it was minimized.  Had it not been for 
  
          the heroic actions from the response force and
 
          the military and civilian occupants of the 
  
          Pentagon, clearly the number of casualties could
 
          have been much higher.
 
 			</p><p>Damage, although severe, was contained 
  
          in area and the fire was brought quickly under
 
          control.  The fact that the response force did 
  
          not suffer a single fatality or serious injury,
 
          is testimony to the training, professionalism 
  
          and leadership of the Arlington County and the 
  
          response community.
 
 			</p><p>Terrorism, in any manifestation, is an 
  
          insidious phenomenon.  It strikes without
 
          warning, often targeting innocent people.  It 
  
          is not intended to defeat an enemy by 
  
          overwhelming military force, but to undermine 
  
          and weaken its resolve.  If the terrorist 
  
          intended to weaken our resolve by attacking the
 
          Pentagon, they failed.
 
 			</p><p>In the words of our County Manager, 
  
          Ron Carlee, "The cowardly and evil effort to
 
          terrorize our community and our country served 
  
          only to unite us more strongly than ever
 
          before."
 
 			</p><p>Thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Baker.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  Yes, my name is Bill Baker
 
          and I am the partner in charge of structural 
  
          engineering in Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.  I 
  
          am here today representing the American Society
 
          of Civil Engineers.
 
 			</p><p>I wish to express my sincere
 
          appreciation for being asked to address the 
  
          Commission on behalf of the ASCE/FEMA World 
  
          Trade Center Building Performance Assessment 
  
          Team.
 
 			</p><p>My comments relate to my role on the
 
          ASCE/FEMA team as well as my experiences as a 
  
          structural engineer assisting the fire fighters 
  
          and contractors in the early days after the
 
          attack on the World Trade Center.
 
 			</p><p>In addition, I will offer my
 
          recommendations as to what may be valuable to New 
  
          York and other urban areas in dealing with the 
  
          aftermath of future terrorist attacks.  These
 
          recommendations include: immediate coordination 
  
          of on site contractors and structural
 
          engineers; an archived depository for 
  
          construction drawings of all city wide 
  
          buildings and infrastructure; and federal
 
          "good Samaritan" legislation for those 
  
          assisting.
 
 			</p><p>When I arrived at the World Trade 
  
          Center site after the attack, I was awestruck 
  
          at the extent of the devastation.  While the 
  
          media focused on the destruction of the twin 
  
          towers, the damage went far beyond anything
 
          that was conveyed to the general public.  The 
  
          damage included the total collapse of four 
  
          major buildings, the partial collapse and
 
          burnout of three major buildings and extensive 
  
          damage to seven additional buildings.  Many
 
          other buildings suffered minor damage.  The 
  
          district's infrastructure, including utilities 
  
          and the subway system in the area, was
 
          extensively damaged and parts of it were 
  
          destroyed.
 
 			</p><p>The New York City Department of Design 
  
          and Construction performed a brilliant job in 
  
          organizing the efforts of the engineering and
 
          construction industries to support the search 
  
          and rescue and, later, clean up of the site.  The
 
          DDC divided the district into four sectors. 
  
          Each sector was assigned to a team of 
  
          contractors.  This was a very successful 
  
          approach.
 
 			</p><p>Because the contractors were top notch
 
          and adept at managing very large private and 
  
          public sector projects, they knew how to 
  
          organize the teams, deal with heavy equipment
 
          and marshal resources.  However, the 
  
          contractors needed the professional assistance
 
          of structural engineers.
 
 			</p><p>The Structural Engineering Association 
  
          of New York stepped forward to organize the
 
          services of structural engineers from across 
  
          the city, state and country.  SEAoNY, as it is
 
          called, assembled teams of structural engineers 
  
          to assist each of the four contractor teams.  I 
  
          urge the Commission to use this approach
 
          developed by the DDC and SEAoNY as a model for 
  
          dealing with possible large urban disasters.
 
          In many ways, New York City was a fortunate to 
  
          have the DDC and major players from the 
  
          engineering and construction industries 
  
          available to assist at the site.
 
 			</p><p>In the first critical hours and days
 
          following the attack, what was not readily 
  
          available or well organized were drawings 
  
          of the buildings, plazas, subway tunnels,
 
          freight tunnels, et cetera.  As engineers and 
  
          contractors were investigating the extent and
 
          severity of damage, drawings of the original 
  
          structure were sorely needed.  When it was 
  
          necessary to bring in large cranes across
 
          subway tunnels, vaults and plazas, drawings 
  
          were an absolute necessity.  I strongly urge
 
          all major cities to develop an archive 
  
          depository for construction drawings and other 
  
          critical information to be available to the
 
          authorities on short notice.  A duplicate copy 
  
          should be housed in a redundant location.
 
 			</p><p>The structural engineers who assisted 
  
          at the World Trade Center site were often in 
  
          uncharted territory with respect to 
  
          professional liability.  There should be 
  
          appropriate national "Good Samaritan"
 
          legislation to promote the assistance of 
  
          engineers in such situations.  While such 
  
          legislation exists in high seismic states such
 
          as California and some of the West Coast 
  
          states, all states are vulnerable to terrorist
 
          attacks and there should be appropriate 
  
          legislation.
 
 			</p><p>At this point, I would like to focus
 
          my comments on the efforts of the ASCE/FEMA 
  
          Building Assessment.  The Structural
 
          Engineering Institute, a division of the 
  
          American Society of Civil Engineers, was 
  
          responsible for organizing this effort and
 
          bringing together the relevant professional 
  
          societies with support of FEMA, for an
 
          assessment of the World Trade Center site. 
  
          Under the leadership of ASCE, a team of 
  
          structural engineers and fire engineering 
  
          experts from around the country were brought 
  
          together.  Because of my expertise in designing tall
 
          buildings, I was asked to join the effort and 
  
          be on the five member core group that directed 
  
          the assessment.
 
 			</p><p>This type of effort is important 
  
          because the advancement of construction of
 
          buildings has often come from the analysis of 
  
          failures.  These tragic events of 9/11 provided 
  
          an opportunity to see how building emergency
 
          systems and structural systems behave in 
  
          extraordinary events.  Although the media has
 
          focused on the twin towers, there is more to be 
  
          learned from the ordinary buildings that were 
  
          damaged by the events.  We saw and documented
 
          the performance of structures that resisted 
  
          extraordinary forces and maintained their
 
          overall integrity.  But we also saw and documented 
  
          collapses that, based on previous experiences, 
  
          should not have happened.  It is through the 
  
          study of these behaviors that the art of 
  
          building design is advanced.
 
 			</p><p>Unfortunately, the ASCE/FEMA team 
  
          faced many obstacles while studying the World 
  
          Trade Center.  The team was not able to
 
          assemble on the site until October 6th.  We 
  
          could only request and cajole to get drawings
 
          and other information.  In fact, we did not 
  
          receive access to the twin tower drawings until 
  
          January.  Nonetheless, the team was able to
 
          perform an invaluable service in our initial, 
  
          overall evaluation of the buildings in order to
 
          focus and prioritize future investigations and 
  
          research.
 
 			</p><p>In response to this, fortunately, the
 
          National Construction Safety Act that was 
  
          signed into law on October 1, 2002 addresses
 
          many of the difficulties faced by the ASCE/FEMA team at 
  
          the World Trade Center site.  This act 
  
          authorizes the National Institute of Standards 
  
          and Technology to investigate building 
  
          failures.  This is similar to the National
 
          Transportation Safety Board investigations of 
  
          airlines and other transportation accidents.
 
 			</p><p>This allows NIST teams access to
 
          building failure sites; provides the power to 
  
          subpoena evidence; provides access to drawings,
 
          records and other documents; and allows for the 
  
          removal and storage of evidence.  None of this 
  
          was available to the ASCE team.
 
 			</p><p>This legislation is a significant step 
  
          forward in creating a vehicle by which the
 
          design and construction industry can learn from 
  
          failures.  This will help to advance building 
  
          technology and improve the safety and
 
          reliability of future construction.
 
 			</p><p>As a structural engineer, the World
 
          Trade Center collapse represents the largest 
  
          structural failure in the history of mankind. 
  
          From this tragedy, I am confident that we can 
  
          learn now to approach catastrophic building 
  
          failures in the future and through the National
 
          Construction Safety Act we will continue to 
  
          learn how to improve building construction.
 
 			</p><p>Thank you for your attention.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you.  Mr. Holden.
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  Good afternoon Chairman
 
          Kean, Vice Chair Hamilton and members of the 
  
          Commission.  My name is Kenneth Holden and I am 
  
          the Commissioner of the New York City
 
          Department of Design and Construction.  Thank 
  
          you for allowing me to appear in front of you
 
          today.
 
 			</p><p>The City's Department of Design and 
  
          Construction, DDC, was created by the Mayor in
 
          1996 to consolidate most of the City's capital 
  
          construction programs.  Its mission is to
 
          streamline the design and construction of the 
  
          City's infrastructure and facilities by 
  
          ensuring that the City's projects are delivered 
  
          in a safe, timely, and cost effective manner.
 
 			</p><p>DDC's clients include OEM, the Police,
 
          Fire, Environmental Protection, Transportation, 
  
          Aging, Juvenile Justice, Correction, Health and 
  
          Cultural Affairs Departments; the
 
          Administration for Children's Services; the 
  
          Human Resources Administration; the Public
 
          Library System and the Board of Education.
 
 			</p><p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, 
  
          I was preparing to leave my office in Long
 
          Island City for a meeting at City Hall when I 
  
          first learned that a plane had hit the World
 
          Trade Center.  I immediately went into downtown 
  
          Manhattan, and was on the steps of City Hall 
  
          when the first tower collapsed.  I, along with
 
          many others that day, ran north.  Eventually, 
  
          around 11:00 that morning I ended up at One
 
          Police Plaza, which was being set up as a 
  
          command center.  It was there that DDC's role 
  
          began. 
  
 			</p><p>We realized that the entire 
  
          infrastructure of the Port Authority, which was
 
          headquartered in the North Tower and is the 
  
          owner of the site, had been decimated, and 
  
          therefore a response from them was likely
 
          impossible.  FEMA and the Army Corps of 
  
          Engineers had not arrived yet.  I thus began
 
          trying to get contractors and structural 
  
          engineers to the site to conduct a 
  
          walk through, in order to assess the stability
 
          of the site and the scope of the response that 
  
          was required.  DDC was uniquely qualified to
 
          jump into action in this emergency: We had many 
  
          construction project mangers and engineers on 
  
          staff with significant and varied experience
 
          and we had established numerous contacts with 
  
          experienced firms that could immediately
 
          mobilize the equipment and personnel necessary 
  
          to help with the search and rescue operation. 
  
          Our ability to draw on our own internal 
  
          expertise and these widespread outside contacts 
  
          allowed for the quick and efficient
 
          decision making this situation required.
 
 			</p><p>At approximately 5:00 that evening, I 
  
          conducted a walk through with several engineers
 
          and construction managers.  The immediate need 
  
          was for lighting, since all electricity was
 
          out.  I spent Tuesday night and Wednesday in a 
  
          mad scramble to locate light towers to 
  
          illuminate the site, and also to bring in heavy
 
          equipment to lift debris, so that fire fighters 
  
          could fight fires, and the search and rescue
 
          operations could go on.  We worked closely with 
  
          the Police Department to set up police escorts 
  
          to get the contractors over the bridges.
 
 			</p><p>DDC staff was pulled from their 
  
          regular duties to organize and manage
 
          demolition, excavation and debris removal 
  
          operations.  Many worked 18 hour days, seven 
  
          days a week, to respond to the emergency. 
  
 			</p><p>In the first days, I recall being 
  
          stunned by rescue efforts to lift and demolish
 
          the north pedestrian bridge with many fire 
  
          trucks underneath, and wondering if there were 
  
          any survivors.  I watched a priest praying over
 
          the smoldering remains of Building 7, and ran 
  
          into a contractor and cried on his shoulder.
 
          However, I could not allow myself much time to 
  
          feel, because we assumed there were survivors 
  
          in the piles of debris and we had to come up
 
          with a plan to get them out.
 
 			</p><p>Using emergency procurement
 
          procedures, four construction companies were 
  
          hired on a "time and material"  basis.  Those 
  
          firms hired numerous subcontractors for
 
          scaffolding and netting, demolition, health and 
  
          safety planning and monitoring, hazardous
 
          materials removal, shoring, structural 
  
          engineering, hauling and barging.
 
 			</p><p>In cooperation with the Port 
  
          Authority, the Fire Department, Police 
  
          Department and numerous other agencies, DDC
 
          handled hundreds of details and questions every 
  
          hour.  The site was immediately and immensely 
  
          hazardous for rescue and clean up workers.  We
 
          divided the site into quadrants and placed 
  
          netting on surrounding buildings, to secure the
 
          site for the rescue effort.  We came up with a 
  
          Site Safety Plan to address hazards throughout 
  
          the site, from cranes dangling ironworkers in
 
          baskets facing precariously leaning pieces of 
  
          the towers, to voids in the debris that could
 
          swallow a grappler.
 
 			</p><p>Just walking on the site was hazardous 
  
          because the debris could shift at any moment.
 
          Yet hundreds of fire fighters, police officers, 
  
          rescue workers, laborers, crane operators, iron
 
          workers, construction management personnel and 
  
          DDC staffers worked around the clock in close 
  
          proximity to literally hundreds of potentially 
  
          dangerous objects and situations.  Throughout 
  
          this time, the war like atmosphere was surreal,
 
          with Army, National Guard and NYPD providing 
  
          armed security.
 
 			</p><p>Quick, but safe decisions regarding
 
          where to put the cranes had to be made, 
  
          inspection of the slurry wall and water in the
 
          basement were conducted, while numerous fires 
  
          were still burning and smoldering.  Underground, 
  
          it was still so hot that molten metal dripped
 
          down the sides of the wall from Building 6. 
  
          Cars both burned and pristine, were suspended
 
          in the air balanced on cracked parking garage 
  
          slabs.
 
 			</p><p>Along with the Building Department and
 
          Structural Engineers Association of New York, 
  
          DDC assessed 400 buildings in the surrounding
 
          area for structural integrity.  Over 200 
  
          engineers worked, above and below ground, to 
  
          monitor the structural integrity of the 
  
          buildings that surrounded the World Trade 
  
          Center complex, to ensure that the debris pile
 
          remained stable during debris removal and to 
  
          monitor the stability of the slurry wall.
 
 			</p><p>There was constant inter agency
 
          coordination, and daily meetings were held, 
  
          which included many Federal, State and City
 
          agencies.
 
 			</p><p>Government agencies brushed aside 
  
          their normal bureaucratic tendencies and
 
          effectively said to one another, "What can we 
  
          do to help?"  Although FEMA and the Army Corps
 
          of Engineers usually take over disaster sites, 
  
          to their credit, they recognized that DDC had 
  
          pulled together an effective team of the best
 
          and brightest, so instead they worked with us. 
  
          They told the City to continue its work and
 
          they guided us to make sure we were doing the 
  
          work in a manner that would allow FEMA to 
  
          reimburse us.  They allowed us to use "time and 
  
          materials"  contracts, which they do not 
  
          normally allow.
 
 			</p><p>Police officers, fire fighters and 
  
          Port Authority Police officers spent countless 
  
          hours searching for survivors and remains.  DOT
 
          re routed traffic, the Mayor's Community 
  
          Affairs unit set up a family assistance center
 
          and consoled families of victims, the Fire 
  
          Department put out the fires, the National Guard 
  
          and Police Department provided security.  The
 
          Department of Sanitation cleaned the site and 
  
          watered down the streets, and OEM mobilized
 
          command centers at the Police Academy and Pier 
  
          92 from which it supplied the coordination and 
  
          organizational focus necessary to complete a
 
          job of this magnitude and complexity.
 
 			</p><p>Throughout the operation, finding
 
          survivors, and then later human remains, was 
  
          always a priority.  But to do that we had to be 
  
          able to remove the debris and steel.  
  
          Cooperation between Federal, State and City 
  
          agencies was especially crucial in setting up
 
          bargaining operations at Piers 25 and 6, to 
  
          handle the staggering amount of steel and other 
  
          debris that had to be removed from the site.
 
          The Fresh Kills Landfill, which was closed, was 
  
          re opened and mobilized to accept the steel and
 
          debris from the site.  Steel and debris from 
  
          the site was sent to Fresh Kills where it was 
  
          examined and sifted.  As the Department of
 
          Sanitation could no longer handle the steel 
  
          with their existing equipment, and our
 
          engineers thought the steel would destabilize 
  
          the landfill, DDC received verbal permission to 
  
          ship the steel to New Jersey.  By the end of
 
          June 2002, an astounding total of over 1.6 
  
          million tons of steel and other debris were
 
          removed from the site.
 
 			</p><p>As the site became more a 
  
          reconstruction area, infrastructure 
  
          coordination was required to handle numerous 
  
          concerns, including massive amounts of conduit
 
          in the streets; sewer, water main and street 
  
          repair; reducing the perimeter to allow 
  
          businesses and residents to return;
 
          establishing roads in the World Trade Center 
  
          complex; fewer cranes, more grapplers;
 
          continued focus on site safety; and equipment 
  
          maintenance, especially in view of the strain 
  
          of keeping machines operating 24/7 in the
 
          extreme conditions of heat and dust; all the 
  
          while trying to remain sensitive to the
 
          emotions of victims' families and uniformed 
  
          rescuers, proceeding with dignity and 
  
          solemnity, and trying to get the job done
 
          safely.
 
 			</p><p>What's happening now and what are our
 
          plans for the future?  DDC is working together 
  
          with OEM to address future preparedness 
  
          concerns and to make sure efforts are 
  
          coordinated, and in fact, is currently 
  
          re building OEM's new emergency command center.
 
          DDC and OEM have received a grant to create a 
  
          protocol for emergency responses for 
  
          contractors, and specifications for procuring
 
          contractors in the event of an emergency.
 
 			</p><p>Please urge Congress to enact
 
          legislation providing for federal indemnity, 
  
          making it clear that contractors can go in and 
  
          do the work in the event of another disaster,
 
          and not incur liability.  The four construction 
  
          companies that DDC contacted put aside all
 
          other business and standard operating 
  
          procedures and responded with a sense of 
  
          patriotism, working without contracts.  The
 
          indemnity issues remain unresolved, and these 
  
          companies have been incredibly patient.
 
          However, the costs of defending themselves 
  
          against lawsuits may be economically 
  
          devastating, and such considerations could 
  
          prove prohibitive, in the event that they are 
  
          called upon again.
 
 			</p><p>The largest and most emotional rescue 
  
          and recovery job in American history was also 
  
          an exceptionally safe project, due to a
 
          combination of our safety plan and its 
  
          enforcement, and luck.  There were no deaths
 
          and minimal injuries; which is absolutely 
  
          incredible, in light of the magnitude of this 
  
          job and its hazards.
 
 			</p><p>The work that the City and its 
  
          employees accomplished reflects the
 
          extraordinary talent, dedication and heart that 
  
          makes New York such a special place.  From the 
  
          first days at emergency headquarters at P.S.
 
          89, a few blocks from Ground Zero, where we all 
  
          struggled to make sense of what needed to be
 
          done and to find ways to do what was necessary, 
  
          to the final emotional days of the cleanup, DDC 
  
          staff and other City employees exhibited a 
  
          strength of character, determination, and a 
  
          sense of duty that is inspiring.
 
 			</p><p>New York City can do extraordinary 
  
          things.  Everyone involved, engineers and 
  
          architects, surveyors, uniformed personnel,
 
          numerous diverse groups of City workers, 
  
          Salvation Army and Red Cross volunteers,
 
          private contractors and construction project 
  
          managers, operating engineers, ironworkers and 
  
          laborers, can all be proud of what we all
 
          achieved together, possible only because we 
  
          were united in a spirit of cooperation and
 
          resolve to get the job done.
 
 			</p><p>Thank you.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Senator Max Cleland will
 
          lead the questions.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  I'd like to say that Mr.
 
          Kelley and Mr. Baker and Mr. Holden, I don't 
  
          think any local responders have ever been 
  
          called upon to do what you have been able to 
  
          do.  From Arlington to New York City, all of us 
  
          in America are proud of all of you.  Mr. Baker,
 
          you said this was the greatest structural 
  
          collapse in the history of the world and, Mr. 
  
          Holden, that makes your clean up the biggest
 
          clean up that has ever been done based on this 
  
          structural collapse.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Baker, I understand there were 
  
          some conclusions to the Civil Engineers' 
  
          report.  Could you talk a little about that,
 
          about some of the weakness you found in the 
  
          structure of the World Trade Center.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  This initial report was 
  
          really more of question of our report than it 
  
          was trying to find findings.  It was a very,
 
          very complicated site with a lot happening.  We 
  
          are trying to get this document released, the
 
          Word Trade Center Performance Study, which is a 
  
          FEMA document is available to you.  What we 
  
          were trying to do was, we are trying to pull 
  
          the information together that was available, 
  
          and somewhat package it so that it would be
 
          available for future researchers and try to 
  
          prioritize.  That was mainly the emphasis.
 
 			</p><p>We put together a few likely scenarios
 
          for some of the collapses, but we gained no 
  
          conclusions as to what they were.  A lot of our
 
          questions, certainly there were a lot of 
  
          discussions about the nature of the collapses 
  
          of the twin towers.
 
 			</p><p>As a structural engineer, I have to 
  
          say that most structural engineers were
 
          surprised at the collapse after it had survived 
  
          the airplane impact, but in retrospect, maybe 
  
          we should have known better.
 
 			</p><p>One of the things that surprised us 
  
          quite a bit was the collapse of Building 7.  It
 
          didn't get a lot of press, but it was a 
  
          47 story building, 2 million square feet, a big 
  
          building.  And it was the first building that 
  
          had ever collapsed, ever, that had been a 
  
          fireproof steel building that collapsed in an
 
          uncontrolled fire.  So it was the first time. 
  
          That building was not hit by an airplane, so 
  
          the collapse of that building is a very
 
          important one, and that is one that the study 
  
          is ongoing on.
 
 			</p><p>There were two likely scenarios 
  
          presented.  One is, diesel fuel, and a lot of 
  
          emergency generation in that building.  Some
 
          people give that credibility.  We don't know. 
  
          The other was perhaps just a simple paper
 
          storage fire.  Turns out one of the best 
  
          sources of fuel there is, is paper, okay.  It 
  
          could have been something as simple as a file
 
          room that burned for seven hours.
 
 			</p><p>Those are things    it really wasn't a
 
          question of nailing the thing.  I think it will 
  
          probably take a couple of years before we 
  
          really know why some of these buildings 
  
          actually collapsed.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  From the audience I
 
          heard a phrase there "what about fire 
  
          proofing?" I guess it was based on code; right?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  Yes.  There are questions
 
          about fire proofing in the buildings.  Building 
  
          7, I am not aware of any issues, and that's
 
          certainly part of the new study.  There were 
  
          some questions about the fireproofing in the 
  
          towers.  There had been efforts to increase the
 
          thickness of some of the fireproofing in the 
  
          towers, and whether or not that was done.  It
 
          was not complete at the time of the impact.
 
 			</p><p>Tower 2, which is the second one hit, 
  
          the first one collapsed, was hit in a zone
 
          where the fire proofing had not been upgraded. 
  
          It is an unknown thing if that was significant
 
          or not.  It is quite likely that that 
  
          particular structure would not have survived 
  
          regardless, because there is a theory that is 
  
          kind of post this report is that, even though 
  
          the fires, that were burning there weren't in
 
          the sense of building fires that large, there 
  
          was a lot of fireproofing that was knocked off.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Lot of what?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  A lot of fireproofing that 
  
          was knocked off by the impact of the airplane.
 
          These airplanes were going extremely fast. 
  
          They are going cruising speeds down that low. 
  
          It was, I think, close around 560, 600 miles
 
          per hour, if I remember correctly.  So they are 
  
          going very, very quickly.  There is a lot of
 
          debris, ripping off a lot of fireproofing, and then the ensuing fire.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Kelley, what was 
  
          your biggest challenges at the Pentagon?
 
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  Our challenges were 
  
          actually manifold.  First was perimeter scene
 
          security.  Here you have the nation's defense. 
  
          You have a hole in the building.  You have 
  
          rescuers and responders responding to assist 
  
          and aid.  Both civilian, fire, police and 
  
          gaining control of those folks and making sure
 
          that we had accountability for those people.
 
 			</p><p>Getting logistics to the scene and 
  
          getting the materials that we needed to the
 
          scene.  Though it wasn't a huge problem, it was 
  
          at first because the Federal Government had let
 
          out because there was a terrorist attack, so 
  
          now this log jammed all the highways and byways 
  
          that we needed in order to get materials in,
 
          until we got control and got all those people 
  
          gone, and then we could start getting in the
 
          resources that we needed.  Those were 
  
          probably the two biggest things in a large 
  
          scope.
 
 			</p><p>Insofar as the Fire Service is 
  
          concerned, the attack inside the Pentagon    it
 
          is a very big building.  You have 982 foot 
  
          corridors.  We wear 45 minute, 30 minute air 
  
          packs and we had to do some very creative air 
  
          management with our air packs where we would 
  
          actually stay off air, crawl down hallways as
 
          long as we could, go on air, try and fight some 
  
          fire, and remember how long it took us to get 
  
          in so that we had air to get back out, so we
 
          wouldn't lose anybody.
 
 			</p><p>Another challenge was each of the
 
          evacuations on the first day while we were 
  
          actively engaged in firefighting.  The first 
  
          evacuation was the structural collapse on the
 
          heliport side of the building.  Dropping 
  
          the hose lines, losing ground that we had
 
          gained in fighting the fire to evacuate out. 
  
          Those hose lines being burned up, equipment we 
  
          had left behind, having to re amass that
 
          equipment and go at it again.  Those were all 
  
          challenges to us on that first day in order to
 
          get the fire under control.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  That's amazing.  Hearing 
  
          your testimony, all of you, it reminds me of a 
  
          line from Admiral Nimitz after the battle of 
  
          Iwo Jima that "uncommon valor was a common
 
          virtue" and it sounds like it to me.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Holden, I would like for you to 
  
          shift a little gear here and talk to me about
 
          the psychological impact of you and your 
  
          wonderful people and crew working for so long
 
          on such a massive project, dealing with such 
  
          tragedy.  Has the City put together any kind of 
  
          program to help the psychological readjustment
 
          of those workers who worked so hard at Ground 
  
          Zero. What do you see about that?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  Actually, I believe FEMA 
  
          has put together a program that is open to all 
  
          New Yorkers, as well as the people who    both
 
          the construction workers and engineers who were 
  
          down at Ground Zero.  I believe it is Project
 
          Cope and the Liberty Project which are these 
  
          broad based counseling services.
 
 			</p><p>I have talked to all my people and 
  
          still meet with them quite regularly, and a lot 
  
          of people have taken advantage of these FEMA-
 
          sponsored programs.  They have told me that the 
  
          people are really quite competent and quite 
  
          helpful, and it has been a big help actually.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  It seems like to me that 
  
          that's part of the terror of terrorism.  It is
 
          not just the people who die in the incident, 
  
          but the impact, the washover, the 
  
          psychological impact on the entire country and
 
          on those people who were nearest the flames, so 
  
          to speak.  In many ways just like combat, they
 
          live with that experience forever.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Kelley, do you want to talk to us 
  
          a little bit about some of your workers and the
 
          psychological impact on you?
 
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  Yes.  In our Department
 
          and in Arlington County Government they embrace 
  
          a very strong Employee Assistance Program.
 
 			</p><p>At Ground Zero, at the Pentagon, from 
  
          the very moment after the attack, we actually 
  
          had EAP workers with the collapse rescue teams
 
          and the firefighters right there on the scene, 
  
          24 hours a day, for all ten days that we were 
  
          there.  Even if it was just to go get somebody
 
          an apple or to bring a cell phone to them to 
  
          speak to their spouse or their family while they
 
          still working, to take some of the stress and 
  
          pressure away.  It was very important.
 
 			</p><p>As far as wellness for the community
 
          and to make Arlington whole again and the 
  
          region whole, once again we got a grant and
 
          they started a program called Community 
  
          Resilience, where they went physically door to 
  
          door    they learned this from Oklahoma City,
 
          where they had clinicians that went door to 
  
          door throughout the resident and the business
 
          community, first in the Pentagon region and 
  
          Crystal City area, but then expanded out 
  
          through Arlington and into the schools, to help 
  
          the community deal with stress and to deal 
  
          with the things that they find after an attack
 
          like this.
 
 			</p><p>There is a website that folks can go 
  
          to, to get pointers and to get tips and it's
 
          www.communityresilience.com, and it has very 
  
          good information for any community.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  As a firefighter, and 
  
          you and your firefighters, when you go in to 
  
          talk to kids and children, they have been
 
          powerfully impacted.  They don't have a lot of 
  
          defenses that adults have, maybe sometimes that
 
          good.  Can you tell us a little bit about the 
  
          impact on some of the kids in the schools, and 
  
          what you are telling the kids?
 
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  Well, the impact is 
  
          twofold.  The impact is to our own children who
 
          are scared when their parents, the police 
  
          officers and the firefighters, go to work now. 
  
          Daddy or mommy, are you sure you are going to 
  
          come home?  And so to reassure them and get 
  
          them well.
 
 			</p><p>In the schools, the best way that we 
  
          deal with kids    we got wonderful drawings and 
  
          wonderful sentiments from the kids and you
 
          could really see their feelings, in what you were 
  
          talking about, in their art work and in what
 
          they were saying, which we used as inspiration. 
  
          We have these things in all our fire stations, 
  
          hung all over the place.  We brought them down
 
          to the scene and put them right up on the side 
  
          of the Pentagon as folks would send these
 
          things to us, to keep the rescue workers going.
 
 			</p><p>We say to the kids, yes, we are still 
  
          here.  Yes, some horrible things have happened
 
          and this is a tragic event, but we are still 
  
          here.  We are going to be safe.  We were there
 
          and we are standing here now talking to you. 
  
          We need to move on.
 
 			</p><p>That's kind of how we are handling it, 
  
          but at a more elementary level.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Holden, you have a
 
          whole city, a whole big community to deal with. 
  
          For you and some of your workers, I am sure you 
  
          get called upon by the schools to go out and
 
          talk about the experience.  What are you 
  
          telling the kids, can you share that with us?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  Actually, I haven't given 
  
          a lot of talks to kids.  I have given talks to 
  
          university students and engineering students
 
          primarily about the engineering projects.  But 
  
          insofar as disaster response, I have not given
 
          a whole lot of talks, if any, to elementary or 
  
          junior high school kids.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Baker, you have
 
          looked at this report.  What is the one 
  
          conclusion that you would draw and would give
 
          to this Commission or to your fellow structural 
  
          engineers around America about what you have 
  
          learned? 
  
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  It sounds trivial, but you 
  
          cannot allow large airplanes to fly into
 
          buildings.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  I am sorry?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  You cannot allow large
 
          airplanes to fly into buildings.  You cannot 
  
          design against it.  Smaller planes, like that
 
          tragedy down in Tampa where the kid flew the 
  
          little airplane, that is not gong hurt a 
  
          building.
 
 			</p><p>But if you have a large commercial 
  
          aircraft, passenger or cargo, I don't care why
 
          it is there, those large airplanes, you cannot design 
  
          against it.  If you look at the 767, it is a 
  
          big airplane.  There are bigger airplanes out
 
          there, quite a bit bigger.  There are the 747s, 
  
          there is A380 Airbus which is on the boards in Europe, much
 
          larger planes.  Both cargo and passenger 
  
          airplanes have to have foolproof safety systems.
 
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Chairman, some of 
  
          the other Commissioners might have some 
  
          questions.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Yes, they do.  Commissioner 
  
          Roemer.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 			</p><p>First of all, I remember 9/11 as if it 
  
          was yesterday, as a member of Congress, and a
 
          member of the Intelligence Committee and as 
  
          somebody who was right across the river from 
  
          the Pentagon, Mr. Kelley.
 
 			</p><p>After a full day of scrambling around 
  
          trying access to intelligence and figure out
 
          what was happening to the country and how we 
  
          should react in making sure the legislative 
  
          branch was moving forward in getting the right
 
          briefings, I felt like many Americans and 
  
          wanted to contribute somehow.
 
 			</p><p>Everybody had seen what had happened 
  
          in New York all day.  So at about 11:00 or 
  
          12:00 at night, I drove across the river and 
  
          was able to get through the barricades and 
  
          right to the front, about 500 yards from the
 
          Pentagon.  I sloshed through ankle deep water 
  
          to get over there to see if there was anything 
  
          I could do, or at least to see it, so that I
 
          could see what these terrorists had done to our 
  
          country.  I was mesmerized, looking at this
 
          huge fortress, this structure that looked like 
  
          a steel boot had come down on the top of it and 
  
          just made a paper accordion out of it.
 
 			</p><p>You were there.  You had fire trucks' 
  
          ladders going up both sides of the building
 
          that was still on fire at that time of night. 
  
          Your folks were scrambling everywhere to see 
  
          what they could do to help others.  And I will
 
          never forget, and I tell my four kids about 
  
          this, turning around from that site of horror
 
          and terror and seeing all of you as an army of 
  
          America, lined up to heal America and take them 
  
          forward.  And you guys did it, and accomplished 
  
          so much, and I think it's the story of courage 
  
          and bravery that so many of us are proud of,
 
          and inspire us to work hard and try to get to 
  
          the bottom of what happened and try to make the 
  
          country a better place in the future, as well.
 
 			</p><p>I want to personally thank you and 
  
          everybody in the Fire Department of Arlington
 
          and Alexandria, and rescue crews, and if you 
  
          can take that back to them, this Commission 
  
          very much appreciates what you help us with.
 
 			</p><p>And New York, Mr. Holden, I can't say 
  
          I was fortunate enough to come up to New York
 
          City.  I can say that I will never forget it, 
  
          coming up a couple of days afterwards as a 
  
          member of Intelligence Committee, and going to
 
          Ground Zero.  And I went on a boat up the 
  
          Hudson River because it was too difficult to
 
          get through the town.  A sergeant of the Police 
  
          Department was taking us up, driving the boat.
 
 			</p><p>I asked Tony what he was doing on the 
  
          day and how he felt New York was reacting to 
  
          it.  After telling me about all the people that
 
          were literally jumping off into the water to 
  
          try to get away from the collapsing buildings, 
  
          and he would ferry them over to New Jersey for
 
          triage.
 
 			</p><p>I asked him again, how does New York
 
          feel they are doing now.  This grizzled veteran 
  
          of probably all kinds of things that he had 
  
          seen and heard in New York, looked at me.  He
 
          was 55 or 60, he had huge tears falling down 
  
          his cheeks.  He said, "we feel like we could
 
          never do enough to help each other."
 
 			</p><p>Well you did, and you came forward and 
  
          did extraordinary work in record time to clean
 
          things up and to move people forward to try to 
  
          heal the process.
 
 			</p><p>I wish Commissioners Scoppetta and 
  
          Kelly were here so that we could thank them.  I 
  
          hope you will pass that on, on our or behalf 
  
          and I hope you will make sure that we get an 
  
          opportunity to talk to them at a later date.
 
 			</p><p>Along those lines, Mr. Baker, I want 
  
          to ask you, based upon your expertise and your 
  
          insight on this, it is quite a compliment to
 
          pick somebody of your skill for this kind of 
  
          endeavour, to look at the twin towers, in
 
          particular, and see what happened.  So I want 
  
          to ask you, specifically, given this counsel 
  
          that you bring, this insight that you bring to
 
          this report.
 
 			</p><p>You said you were pleasantly surprised
 
          by the integrity and the structure of some of 
  
          the other buildings.  Were you concerned or 
  
          disturbed at all by any of the features, the
 
          design and the structural engineering of the 
  
          twin towers when you studied them?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  It took a long time to 
  
          come to grips with the collapse.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  When you did come to 
  
          grips with it, what did you conclude?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  I am not sure that    I
 
          think the building performed remarkably well, 
  
          actually.  You never want it to collapse, but 
  
          one of the things you might say about it, it
 
          was a very strong building.  It took a huge 
  
          amount of damage.  So many columns were knocked
 
          out.  We counted the ones on the perimeter and 
  
          a large number of columns were knocked out 
  
          initially.
 
 			</p><p>Later studies, ongoing studies have indicated 
  
          that a large number of core columns were
 
          knocked out and the building still did not come 
  
          down immediately.  So the nature of the 
  
          structure was enough that it could hold itself
 
          together long enough for people to get out.
 
 			</p><p>A lot of people did get out and
 
          approximately, I believe, 99 percent of the 
  
          people who were below the impact zones were 
  
          able to get out, according to articles in New 
  
          York Times and U.S.A.  Today.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  I just have a couple of
 
          questions and then I want to make sure the 
  
          other Commissioners have an opportunity to ask 
  
          questions as well.
 
 			</p><p>Apart from the plane hitting these 
  
          buildings and bringing them down, let me ask
 
          you specifically about the structure of the 
  
          buildings, or the uniqueness of them apart from 
  
          the plane hitting them.
 
 			</p><p>Do you know of any other high rise or 
  
          super high rise buildings that have floors
 
          composed of open web trusses spanning up to 60 
  
          feet?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  No, I do not.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Is that something that 
  
          would concern you?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  It is something to be 
  
          looked at very closely.  We were not able to 
  
          look at that closely in this situation. 
  
 			</p><p>What you are referring to is these are 
  
          commonly called bar joists.  You see them in
 
          the roofs and ceilings of big box retail like a 
  
          Wal Mart.  It is a very lightweight truss. 
  
          There are things the industry needs to do to
 
          study these things further.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  So that could be of
 
          concern and that disturbed you?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  It is something that we 
  
          don't have the answer on and I personally would
 
          not ever use them in this type of building.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  So you will recommend
 
          other high rise buildings not use them.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  Until we know more about 
  
          it.  If fact, there is draft out for the New
 
          York City Code which has recommended a 
  
          temporary moratorium on the use of these types
 
          of trusses in high rise buildings until it is 
  
          better understood how they can be fireproofed 
  
          and the integrity of the fireproofing. 
  
 			</p><p>The issue comes down that they are 
  
          very small bars, about one inch diameter and
 
          whether or not you can adequately fireproof 
  
          those.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Specifically, I know
 
          Senator Cleland asked a general question about 
  
          fireproofing.  Let me ask you a more specific
 
          one.
 
 			</p><p>Was half an inch thickness of 
  
          fireproofing on the floor trusses sufficient to
 
          give a three hour fire rating, in your view?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  I doubt that a three hour
 
          fire rating was required for the floor trusses, 
  
          just an as a point of reference.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  I didn't ask that.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  No.  I would be very 
  
          surprised if a half inch would give three
 
          hours.  We did not study that specifically, but 
  
          I would be very surprised.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Finally, did you see or 
  
          hear of any evidence in the course of your 
  
          inquiry, that the fireproofing of the twin
 
          towers was inadequate?  Obviously, you just 
  
          said you had a concern, but any others?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  We do know there was an
 
          ongoing program to replace fireproofing in the 
  
          towers, that the Port Authority, as the floors
 
          are re-tenantized and made available, that they were 
  
          going back in there and putting additional 
  
          fireproofing onto the floor trusses.
 
 			</p><p>There had been some issues of some of 
  
          the fireproofing falling off of some of the
 
          core columns in the elevator shafts, and there 
  
          had been some earlier lawsuits.  We were not 
  
          able to get access to that information to know
 
          the details.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  You tried get access to
 
          it?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  Yes, we had no authority.  It 
  
          was all locked up in legal    there were 
  
          nondisclosure agreements on lawsuits and the 
  
          like.  We couldn't get the information.
 
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. Baker.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  First, I would like to 
  
          associate myself with the earlier comments of
 
          great admiration.  I think that you and you 
  
          colleagues made the whole country very proud,
 
          and impressed it the world with the way the 
  
          response was immediate.  It engaged every asset 
  
          available in the cities and the districts
 
          available, and everyone on the sites showed 
  
          courageous disregard for their own personal
 
          safety, not to mention the trial lawyers 
  
          association, which the Mayor alluded to earlier 
  
          on.
 
 			</p><p>So please take the questions that I am 
  
          going to ask, in the spirit that they are
 
          intended, which is to get onto the record as 
  
          much of the lessons learned as possible so that 
  
          we can make appropriate recommendations for the 
  
          future.  This is not intended to try and point 
  
          fingers at anyone or so forth.
 
 			</p><p>There have been a lot of questions 
  
          raised since then about why, after it was 
  
          clear, this was perhaps a measure of weeks
 
          rather than days, that there could be no more 
  
          survivors from the wreckage, why was the site not
 
          made a crime zone and given the proper 
  
          protection so that evidence and forensic 
  
          investigations could be taking place?  Why
 
          wasn't that done?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  I believe that security
 
          around the site, and the Police Department, in 
  
          fact, did call it a crime zone, and it was very 
  
          difficult to get access to the site as the
 
          Police Department and the National Guard and 
  
          Army were called in to provide security to
 
          prevent people who need not be at the site, you 
  
          know, were kept away from the site.
 
 			</p><p>As you mentioned, we believed that 
  
          there were, in fact, survivors for many weeks 
  
          early on.  So our main goal was basically to
 
          remove, particularly the heavy steel beams to 
  
          allow the Fire Department and Police Department 
  
          to continue with their searching operations,
 
          with their rescue operations.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  You mentioned the steel.
 
          There have been other questions raised about 
  
          why the steel was removed to a site and then 
  
          ordered destroyed without being made available
 
          to the overall investigation of the structural 
  
          clues that would have helped in really
 
          evaluating where failures took place and 
  
          whether these codes were met.  Why and how was 
  
          the decision made to destroy that steel?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  Again, you have to go 
  
          back 19 months and put yourself in the position
 
          of trying to find survivors.
 
 			</p><p>Our priority at that time, in 
  
          September and October, was still looking for 
  
          survivors.  The steel was precluding that from 
  
          happening because much of the debris early on
 
          was being sent to the Fresh Kills Landfill.  It 
  
          became clear after three or four days that the 
  
          equipment that the Department of Sanitation had
 
          to handle the City's garbage was not equipped 
  
          to be able to pick up those large pieces of
 
          steel.  And those large pieces of steel were 
  
          preventing the rescue workers from crawling 
  
          into crevices and voids underground.
 
 			</p><p>We really had no place to put it. 
  
          There is no place to put 170,000 or 180,000
 
          tons of structural steel.  We were pressed by 
  
          the urgency of trying to find survivors.  We 
  
          looked at a number of operations.  We knew that
 
          some of the steel might have asbestos- 
  
          containing materials on it.  We knew that we
 
          couldn't just dispose of it, but it was not an 
  
          option to continue sending it to the Fresh 
  
          Kills Landfill where all the debris was being taken.  
  
          The only options, based on discussions both 
  
          internally with our engineers, as well with New
 
          York State with the State of New Jersey and with 
  
          the Environmental Protection Agency was to 
  
          basically ship it off to New Jersey and recycle
 
          it.  No one was volunteering to just store that 
  
          huge volume of steel.  They would only take it
 
          if they could melt it and recycle it.
 
 			</p><p>We really couldn't figure out any 
  
          other option at the time.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  This was a sort of crisis 
  
          management group decision, it wasn't any one
 
          person that dictated it?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  This was my decision.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  Okay.  I have read that
 
          the twin towers, because they were owned by the 
  
          Port Authority were actually exempt or outside
 
          of the enforcement codes for the City of New 
  
          York.  Is that true?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  I'm not a Port Authority 
  
          employee, but the buildings are in fact Port 
  
          Authority and I am almost certain that they are
 
          exempt from following New York City Building 
  
          Code requirements.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  Isn't that something that
 
          we ought to address or that should be remedied? 
  
          Why should a building like that in the middle
 
          of the City of New York be exempt from State 
  
          and City codes?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  I think that warrants
 
          looking into.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  Mr. Baker, I would like
 
          to ask you, did the buildings conform, at the 
  
          time of their construction, to prevailing 
  
          standards of survivability and structural
 
          integrity that were prevailing at the time of 
  
          their construction?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  In the short period of 
  
          time that we produced this report, that was not 
  
          studied in detail.  My understanding is that 
  
          NIST, at this point, has actually, is trying to 
  
          commission a study to do a detailed review of
 
          the prevailing codes, particularly the New York 
  
          City Building Codes vis-a-vis the construction 
  
          documents.  So that was not done as part of the
 
          study.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  We look forward to
 
          receiving that when that is done, or if we can 
  
          be of any assistance to see that it is 
  
          completed before the end of our report, that
 
          would be very helpful.
 
 			</p><p>Mr. Baker, how was the decision made,
 
          or what were obstacles made to keep you from 
  
          the site for so long while so much of the 
  
          evidence was being removed?  I don't mean
 
          evidence in terms of liability and so forth, 
  
          but evidence in terms of learning the lessons.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  I am not sure I know all 
  
          the details, but basically we were told that 
  
          the folks on site did not necessarily want 
  
          other extraneous people walking around.  They 
  
          had their hands full at the moment.
 
 			</p><p>I personally was on the site much 
  
          earlier than that because as part of the other 
  
          activities, as part of assisting the search and
 
          rescue.  But the rest of the team was not able 
  
          to get access because of the nature of
 
          activities before October 6, when we actually 
  
          did get access.  I believe we were deemed to be 
  
          superfluous at that point.
 
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  Perhaps, Mr. Holden, you 
  
          might shed a little light on it.  Was it
 
          because they were deemed to superfluous or was 
  
          it, by this time had the fear of litigation, as 
  
          the Mayor spoke to yesterday, begun to enter
 
          the calculations of City officials.
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  It took a lot of months
 
          to go by before I started thinking about 
  
          litigation, quite frankly.
 
 			</p><p>I am not sure exactly about when the 
  
          American Society of Civil Engineers came on 
  
          site.  I know we worked with SEAoNY, which Mr.
 
          Baker alluded to earlier, which was a State 
  
          organization of structural engineers who worked 
  
          with numerous city structural engineers, as
 
          well as structural engineers we had hired to 
  
          both examine buildings and look at the site.
 
 			</p><p>The problem, again, going back 18, 19 
  
          months ago, was that you had a very difficult 
  
          site to control.  As you alluded to earlier, it
 
          was a crime scene so access was limited.  We 
  
          also, especially that first week or two, had
 
          thousands of volunteers coming down to the 
  
          site, which a was a wonderful and much 
  
          appreciated outpouring of spirit.  However, it
 
          was an extremely unsafe site and we were very 
  
          concerned that having hundreds and thousands of
 
          people walking around the site, could cause 
  
          further fatalities.  And if the Mayor gave us 
  
          one clear marching order, it was that no one 
  
          else was to die at that site.
 
 			</p><p>I am not exactly certain when the
 
          American Society of Civil Engineers were 
  
          looking to gain access, but early on some of 
  
          the constraints were, in fact, the fact that it
 
          was a crime scene and there were just safety 
  
          concerns.  We were trying to grapple with what
 
          was there, and how many people we could allow 
  
          on site, how stable the various piles were, how 
  
          unstable.
 
 			</p><p>I am sure you remember the facades of 
  
          towers 1 and 2, we were not certain about
 
          stable those facades were.  We were very 
  
          concerned about having so many people walk 
  
          around the site.
 
 			</p><p>However, I would never use word that 
  
          Mr. Baker used, calling the engineers
 
          "superfluous," they were extremely helpful.
 
 			</p><p>Those are just some of the general 
  
          difficulties in allowing people on the site. 
  
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN:  Thank you for your 
  
          responses.  They are very helpful.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner 
  
          Ben Veniste.
 
 			</p><p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  I have a question
 
          for Mr. Holden.  Following up on my friend and 
  
          colleague, Max Cleland, who was quite
 
          interested in the effects of terrorism and the 
  
          lingering trauma of those who have experienced 
  
          it firsthand, My alma mater, Stuyvesant High
 
          School is located four blocks north of World 
  
          Trade Center.  On September 11, 2001, they were
 
          evacuated from the school.  The evacuation 
  
          notice was "run for your lives."
 
 			</p><p>Hundreds and hundreds of teenagers,
 
          from all parts of the City, made their way on 
  
          their own out of the toxic plume, watching as
 
          people jumped to their deaths from these 
  
          buildings, an extraordinary traumatic 
  
          experience. 
  
 			</p><p>Can you comment on what the City has 
  
          done with respect to trying to provide guidance
 
          counselling follow up for the children who were 
  
          directly exposed to this tragedy?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  I wish I could, but I am
 
          really not qualified.  Those questions are 
  
          really much better addressed either to the
 
          Commission of Department of Mental Health, or what is now 
  
          the Department of Education.  But really the 
  
          Department of Design and Construction was
 
          really limited in its focus to demolition of 
  
          the existing structures and debris removal.
 
 			</p><p>I am just not qualified to speak to 
  
          your question.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Commissioner Gorelick.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  This is for Shawn 
  
          Kelley.  A number of us on this panel have
 
          served at various times at the Pentagon and we 
  
          are aware that the cafe in the middle of the 
  
          Pentagon is called Ground Zero. 
  
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  Not anymore.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  It was.  So we knew
 
          that we were working in a place that was a 
  
          possible target.
 
 			</p><p>We heard testimony yesterday that the
 
          evacuation procedures at the Pentagon were not 
  
          understood, at least, and not well practiced
 
          and could not be followed by the people in the 
  
          building.
 
 			</p><p>So my question for you is, did you
 
          conclude or did your After Action Report 
  
          conclude that there were any failures in the
 
          evacuation process at the Pentagon after the 
  
          plane slammed into it?
 
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  We have emergency
 
          incidents at the Pentagon every day.  We run an 
  
          average of two responses a day at the Pentagon.
 
          I personally investigated a fire there two 
  
          weeks prior.  So it is 11 percent of our call 
  
          volume is to federal facilities within 
  
          Arlington.
 
 			</p><p>We have never experienced in the past
 
          a problem in evacuating the occupants from 
  
          different sections or parts of that building, 
  
          out and away from where the danger is, along
 
          with the assistance of the Defense Protective 
  
          Services, the police officers, that work in and
 
          out everyday around the building.
 
 			</p><p>In this particular event or in this 
  
          particular incident, to have this plane and
 
          almost the entire plane made it into the first 
  
          floor of this building, and to penetrate in
 
          three rings, and I am not going to go into the 
  
          floorplan of the Pentagon, but to penetrate in 
  
          three rings and then pop out into what they
 
          call A&amp;E Drive.
 
 			</p><p>I will say that most all the fire
 
          doors did work, in the outer corridors.  That 
  
          is good and bad.  The fire doors closed like they 
  
          should, and then it was dark and held smoke and 
  
          could have possibly caused further injury or 
  
          death to some of the folks.
 
 			</p><p>They had also just done construction 
  
          and updated the Pentagon and installed some new 
  
          windows which were not openable.  That also had
 
          some impact on the building not being able to 
  
          breathe or let out its products.
 
 			</p><p>With regard to where the Pentagon is 
  
          now, I can share with you that they have 
  
          installed some enhancements to assist in easier
 
          evacuation.  In fact, in my opinion, it is 
  
          state of the art now.  It is an example for the
 
          rest of nation to follow.  Some of those things 
  
          can't be shared.  It is truly, truly an example 
  
          now.  The employees do practice evacuation
 
          drills.
 
 			</p><p>The Pentagon has even approached my
 
          office, the Fire Marshal's office, to have two 
  
          deputy marshals assigned down there, a third party to 
  
          ensure that proper code enforcement is 
  
          conducted.  Not that it isn't now, but just to 
  
          have a third party assessment to assist in
 
          things like evacuation plans and drills, and 
  
          things like that.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you very much.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KELLEY:  You're welcome.  If I 
  
          may, the After Action Report, if you don't
 
          mind, you did mention it.  It is available for 
  
          free for everyone, I am not trying to make an 
  
          ad, but it is real important in the Fire
 
          Service that we study ourselves and learn from 
  
          action and have other persons learn, good or
 
          bad.  If there is criticisms, then folks need 
  
          to fix them so that if things didn't go so 
  
          well, that they are prepared or do better.
 
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK:  That is an excellent 
  
          great note on which to end the hearing.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I would like ask a question 
  
          before we end.  Mr. Holden, first, when you got 
  
          to the site, who was in charge? 
  
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  I would say the Fire 
  
          Department and the Police Department.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Jointly in charge?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  Yes, the Fire Department 
  
          was clearly putting out fires and the Police
 
          Department was handling security.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Three or four hours later,
 
          who was in charge?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  The same people.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Did that change later?
 
 			</p><p>MR. HOLDEN:  I don't think that really 
  
          changed until, again, now I am just giving you
 
          my impressions.  I don't think that really 
  
          changed until several days later when the 
  
          National Guard, Governor Pataki brought in the
 
          National Guard, and I believe some Army units 
  
          were down helping with security.  Although
 
          certainly, the Fire Department was playing a 
  
          major focus on the interior.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Baker, when you got on 
  
          site, who was in charge then?
 
 			</p><p>MR. BAKER:  My impression when I was
 
          there was that the people in overall charge of 
  
          it was the Fire Department of the sectors, but the 
  
          operational control were the contractors.
 
          These contractors were very, very good.  They 
  
          are used to managing very large projects and
 
          have command structures within their groups, 
  
          who know how to bring in heavy equipment.  They 
  
          know how to deal with subcontractors, and all
 
          that kind of stuff.
 
 			</p><p>So a lot of the operational, who goes
 
          there, we want to see if that building is going 
  
          collapse, let's go into this thing and look 
  
          around.  Really our interface was with
 
          the general contractors, they did an excellent 
  
          job.
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  I want to thank you all 
  
          very, very much.  This has been a very good 
  
          panel and a very instructive panel.  Thank you 
  
          for your answers.  Thank you for your presence, 
  
          we appreciate it very much.
 
 			</p><p>That ends our hearing.
 
 			</p><p>(Whereupon, the proceedings were 
  
          adjourned.)
