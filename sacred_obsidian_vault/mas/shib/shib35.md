 <p align="center">_________________</p>  <h4 align="center">INSTALLATION OF THEIR OFFICERS.</h4>  
 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Grand Commander will appoint a Grand Marshal, under whose direction the Officers elect will retire to an adjoining room. The Jewels will be placed on a table, which is in front of the Installing Officer. The Altar is beside this table.</small></p>  
 <p>Twelve chairs will be placed just west of the Altar, as seats for the Officers elect when they enter. The chairs will extend from North to South, the seat of the Grand Commander on the right, and of the Grand Warder on the left.</p>  
 <p>GC.Let the Grand Officers elect enter.</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Grand Marshal, who is notified by the Captain of the Guard, conducts the Officers elect, in single file, to the East, and halts them in front of the chairs, facing the East</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC. (<i>As Officers enter</i>)<a name="img_note3"></a>

 <p><small><i>If there is an instrument, a March will be played</i>.</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">G. Mar.</span> (<i>When the Officers are halted, facing East</i>)Right Eminent Commander, these are the Officers chosen by the Grand Commandery, and they are now ready for installation.</p>  
 <p>GC.Excellent Grand Prelate, lead us in an Invocation to the Throne of Grace. Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Attention</span>! <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Uncover</span>!</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Grand Prelate offers the following, or some other</i></small></p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>PRAYER.</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Almighty</span> God, our Heavenly Father, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, we humbly approach Thy presence, and beseech Thee, for the sake of Thine only begotten Son, to look upon us in infinite mercy, and bless this our Commander, and those associated with him in office, with a rich outpouring of Thy grace. Pardon our sins, and blot out our transgressions from before Thee! Incline the hearts of these Officers to follow after Thee! Endow them with wisdom, and give unto each patience, perseverance, courage, constancy, faith, and humility.</p>  
 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord's Prayer</span> (<i>in which all unite</i>).</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Re-cover</span>!</p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, before investing you with the Jewels of your official positions, it becomes my duty to receive from you the Vow of office. Are you willing to take such a Vow?</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Grand Commander and all the Officers elect bow in assent</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Let the Grand Commander elect approach the East.</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Grand Marshal conducts him to the East</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC. (<i>GC. draws his Sword and holds it vertically</i>)You will grasp the blade of this Sword with your left hand, and then place your right hand upon your heart. (<i>Done</i>.) Now repeat after me:</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>VOW OF OFFICE.</small></p>  
 <p>I, , do solemnly promise and vow, that I will maintain and support the Constitution of the Grand Encampment</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Knights Templar of the United States of America, the Statutes and Regulations of the Grand Commandery of the State of  and that I will, to the best of my ability, faithfully discharge the duties of the office to which I have been elected.</p>  
 <p><small><i>Installing Officer returns his Sword to scabbard</i>.</small></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE.</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Right Eminent Sir, having been called by the members of this Grand Body to fill the highest office in their gift, I congratulate you upon having received such distinction at their hands, and I now invest you with the Jewel of your office.</p>  
 <p>Your authority will at all times be respected and your orders will be cheerfully obeyed. It is expected that you will not only have a watchful care over the interests of the Order in your jurisdiction, and enforce a prompt obedience to its Rules and Regulations, but that you will yourself exemplify, in your daily walk and conversation, the excellent tenets of your profession; that your ears will never be closed to the cry of the widow and the orphan; and that you will not turn aside from injured innocence, or from a frater in distress. Maintain with unfaltering zeal the Statutes and Regulations of this Grand Body, and by your own respect for law prompt others to a cheerful obedience of all lawful requirements. You will now assume your station.</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Grand Commander is escorted by the Grand Marshal to his station, where he stands</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, <i>Present</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Swords</span>! Behold your Grand Commander! Grand Commander, behold the Grand Commandery!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>Remarks by the new Grand Commander will now be in order. He will install the remaining Officers, or may request the Installing Officer to continue.</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, <i>Carry</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Swords</span>! <i>Return</i> Swords <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be seated</span>!</p>  
 <p>GC.Remaining Officers elect (<i>they arise</i>): Before proceeding to invest you with the honors and responsibilities of your several offices, it becomes my duty to administer to you the Obligation of office. As you have severally consented to take upon yourselves that Obligation, place yourselves in position to take that Vow.</p>  
 <p><small>The Grand Marshal will then cause each Sir Knight in the line of Officers elect occupying the odd number from the right of the line, to draw his Sword, and drop it to the left to a horizontal position. The Sir Knight on his left will lay his left hand upon the Sword, then each places his right hand upon his left breast, and repeats after the Grand Commander the following Vow:</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Repeat after me:</p>  
 <p>I, , do solemnly promise and vow, that I will maintain and support the Constitution, Laws, and Statutes of the Grand Encampment of the United States, the Constitution, Statutes, and Regulations of this Grand Commandery, and that I will, to the best of my ability, discharge the duties of the office to which I have been chosen.</p>  
 <p>GC.Escort the Deputy Grand Commander to the East, and the remainder of the Officers elect will resume their seats.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">G. Mar.</span>Right Eminent Grand Commander, I present unto you Very Eminent Sir , who has been elected Deputy Grand Commander of this Grand Commandery, and who is now ready for installation.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>GC.In the exalted station to which you have been chosen, Very Eminent Sir, you are the immediate representative of the Grand Commander, and in case of unforeseen casualty to himwhich God forbidyou are to enter upon his functions and assume his responsibilities. The elevated position you are thus called to occupy demands a corresponding zeal and devotion on your part, which, I doubt not, you will ever be found ready to exercise. I now invest you with the Jewel of your office, and will only remind you that you are henceforward on duty, and that the faithful soldier and valiant Knight sleeps not at his post.</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Grand Marshal will present the remaining Officers in the same manner, when the Installing Officer will deliver to them the following Charges:</i></small></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND GENERALISSIMO.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, having been elected to the important station of Grand Generalissimo, I take great pleasure in investing you with the appropriate Jewel of your office. Your station is on the right of the Grand Commander, and the exercise of all your talents and zeal will be necessary in the discharge of your various duties. In the absence of your superior officers, the command will devolve upon you. I charge you, therefore, to be faithful to your associates; put them often in remembrance of those things which tend to their everlasting peace; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine, ever remembering the promise, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND CAPTAIN GENERAL.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, the office of Grand Captain General, to which you have been elected, is one of the most important in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>gift of the Grand Commandery, and I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. Your station is on the left of the Grand Commander, and you are to assist him and your associate officers in council, and in their absence to govern the Grand Commandery. You are to have in charge the Grand Asylum, and see that it is in suitable array for the dispatch of business. Improve your opportunities in extending knightly courtesy and hospitality to all true and faithful Sir Knights, and in the preservation of harmony within the bounds of our jurisdiction; and whatsoever ye do, do <i>it</i> heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; ever bearing in mind the promise, "Be not weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND PRELATE.</small></p>  
 <p>Revered Sir, to you has been assigned the sacred duties of the office of Grand Prelate, and I invest you with the appropriate Jewel of your office. Your station will be on the right of the Grand Generalissimo. The duties of your office are sacred and important, and will require your attendance at every Conclave. And may He who is able, abundantly furnish you for every good work, preserve you from falling into error, improve, strengthen, establish and perfect you; and finally greet you with, "Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND SENIOR WARDEN.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, you have been elected Grand Senior Warden in this Grand Commandery, and I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. Your station is at the Southwest angle of the Triangle. Let it be your constant care that the Warrior be not deterred from duty, nor the Penitent molested on his journey.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND JUNIOR WARDEN.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, having been elected Grand Junior Warden, I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. Your station is at the Northwest angle of the Triangle. Your duty will be to attend on all visiting Knights, and, if found worthy, to introduce them, on the order of the Grand Commander, into the Asylum. Be ye therefore perfect, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND TREASURER.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, you have been elected Treasurer of the Grand Commandery, and I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. Your station is on the right, in front of the Grand Generalissimo. The qualities that should especially distinguish the incumbent of your station are accuracy and fidelityaccuracy, in keeping a fair and minute account of all receipts and disbursements; fidelity, in carefully preserving all the property and funds of the Grand Commandery that may lawfully come into your hands, and rendering a just account of the same whenever called upon. Your respect for and attachment to this Grand Commandery and the great Order of the Temple, will stimulate you to a zealous, faithful, and prompt discharge of the trust confided to you.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND RECORDER.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, by the suffrages of the Grand Commandery you have been chosen Grand Recorder, and I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. In selecting you to discharge the duties of this most important trust, the Sir Knights have been guided by a belief that you possess in a large degree the qualities that should distinguish a Grand Recorder. I can not doubt your resolve to discharge these important duties with benefit to this Grand Commandery, and with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>honor to yourself. Your station, to which you will now repair, is on the left, and in front, of the Grand Captain General.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND STANDARD BEARER.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, to you has been awarded the distinction of Grand Standard Bearer, and I now invest you with the Jewel appropriate to that office. Your station is in the West. Your duty is to display, support, and protect the Banner of our Order, which I now place in your official custody. Let your conduct be such that the virtuous will delight to imitate it.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND SWORD BEARER.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, having been elected Grand Sword Bearer, I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. Your station is on the right of the Grand Standard Bearer. You are to assist in the protection of the Banner of our Order with that mystic Sword which is endowed with justice and tempered by mercy.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND WARDER.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, the Grand Commandery has selected you to fill the office of Grand Warder, and I now invest you with the Jewel of your office. Your station is on the left of the Grand Standard Bearer. Your duty is to announce the approach of the Grand Commander, and to announce all visiting Sir Knights who may be admitted to the privileges of our Conclaves. You will therefore be punctual, and by a strict performance of duty merit not only the honor now conferred upon you, but the commendation of all Sir Knights who may experience your official courtesy.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>CHARGE TO THE GRAND CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD.</small></p>  
 <p>Eminent Sir, you have been elected to the responsible station of Grand Captain of the Guard, and I now invest you</p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the Jewel appropriate to your office. Holding the post of danger and of honor, your vigilance should be sleepless, your courage undaunted, and your courtesy beyond question. See to it that the avenues of approach are strictly guarded. Your courage should keep the unworthy at bay, but the valiant and the true should receive from you the knightly welcome due to a Soldier of the Cross.</p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knight Grand Marshal, make Proclamation in the East.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">G. Mar.</span>Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Attention</span>! In the name and by authority of the Grand Commandery of Knights Templar of the State of , I proclaim the Officers thereof duly elected and installed.</p>  
 <p>GC.Grand Commandery, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be seated</span>!</p>
