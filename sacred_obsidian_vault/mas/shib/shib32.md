 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Triangle has twelve Tapers properly displayed upon it. No other equipments thereon.</small></p>  
 <p>The Commandery is opened, and the Grand Commander and Staff received according to the Tactics of the Jurisdiction.</p>  
 <p>EC.Right Eminent Grand Commander, the members of  Commandery, No. , animated by zeal for the Order and veneration for the ceremonies thereof, have prepared and furnished this Asylum, and now crave that you dedicate and consecrate the same to the solemn rites of the Order of the Temple.</p>  
 <p>GC.Eminent Sir, I congratulate  Commandery on the appearance of the Asylum which their liberality and good taste have prepared for the observance of the ceremonies of the Order. It receives our entire approbation, and at your request we will proceed to Consecrate the same to the solemn uses for which it is intended.</p>  
 <p>GCG.Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Attention! Uncover!</span></p>  
 <p>GC.Excellent Grand Prelate, lead us in the Prayer of Dedication.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>PRAYER.</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Almighty</span> and Most Merciful Father, look upon us, Thy children, bowed in Thy presence, and graciously accept the service in which we are engaged. May the meetings to be held in this Asylum be under Thy protection and guidance, and may all its members be of one mind to honor and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>obey Thee, and love and protect one another. And may the work done in this Asylum receive Thy approval and benediction.</p>  
 <p>And to thy great and holy Name shall be all the praise and glory, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amen</span>.</p>  
 <p>GCG.Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Re-cover</span>!</p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be seated</span>! Give reverent heed to the ceremony of Consecration, to the end that all may be endued with a proper appreciation of the uses to which this Asylum is about to be set apart.</p>  
 <p>Excellent Grand Prelate, place upon the Triangle the Holy Bible, opened at the third chapter of the Gospel by John.</p>  
 <p><small><i>Prelate places open Bible in center of Triangle</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC. (Rising and uncovering)To God the Father, who so loved the world as to give His Son to be the Captain of our Salvation, I dedicate this Asylum. May Peace be within its walls. (<i>Re-covers</i>.)</p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knight Grand Generalissimo, place upon the Holy Bible an emblem of Mortality.</p>  
 <p><small><i>Grand Generalissimo places a skull upon the Bible</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC. (<i>Uncovering</i>)To Him who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel, I Dedicate this Asylum. May the unity of that Faith be maintained in this place. (<i>Re-covers</i>.)</p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knight Grand Captain General, light the Tapers.</p>

 <p>GC.To the memory of Hugh de Payen, the founder of the Order of the Temple, I set this Asylum apart to the solemn uses of that Order. Sir Knights, may brotherly love prevail, and every moral and social virtue cement you.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>MUSIC.</small></p>  
 <p><small>"Nearer, My God, to Thee," or some other appropriate Hymn, will be sung.</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, this Asylum thus solemnly set apart to the ceremonies of our Order must not be profaned by improper assemblies, nor desecrated by observances not in accord with the spirit of Christian Knighthood. Guard well its doors from improper invasions, and allow none to enter but such as are duly qualified when the trumpet of the Sentinel has sounded the Assembly.</p>  
 <p>Here meet in the fear of God, and with the spirit of true and chivalrous Knights. Be true to each other and to yourselves. Pray for the prosperity of the Order, and diligently labor for the peace of the Commandery of which you are members. You will arise and uncover.</p>  
 <p>We will now unite with our Excellent Grand Prelate in</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>PRAYER.</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merciful</span> Father, we again thank Thee for the pleasures of this sacred hour. Consecrate with Thy Benediction this Asylum which Thy servant has so solemnly dedicated to Thee, so that all things done herein may be prospered by Thy goodness and approved by Thy wisdom.</p>  
 <p>Bless our beloved Order, wherever dispersed, and when the end shall come, as come it will, may we all be received into that Rest which remaineth to the people of God. Through Jesus Christ our Redeemer, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amen</span>.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>BENEDICTION.</small></p>  
 <p>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>  
 <p>GC.Sir Knights, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Re-cover</span>! <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be seated</span>!</p>
