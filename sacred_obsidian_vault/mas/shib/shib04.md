 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">It</span> is the earnest desire of the author of this Monitor to discover that all the Commanderies invest the beautiful, instructive and entertaining Order of the Red Cross with the interest its importance demands. The Ritual provides ample opportunity for the display of true dramatic taste, both in robing and in reading. It also presents the great central thought of the Order,<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Truth</span>,as it has never been presented previous to the adoption at Denver.</p>  
 <p>The feeling had become almost universal that the Order of the Red Cross was of slight importance, and was at best little more than a social observance. Hence the ceremonials were hurried over, the candidate was practically told that it was mere matter of form, and he went away profoundly impressed that the Commandery was indeed a jovial institution. Never was a graver mistake, and the impression so made was more injurious than beneficial. The Ritual now adopted can not fail to correct that erroneous view of the value of the Order.</p>  
 <p>The Order of the Red Cross should, if possible, be conferred upon classes, and be made the occasion of social intercourse among the members; the healing of wounds, the forming of new bonds of fraternity. The lessons of the ceremonies tend to these noble ends, and by conferring them with the dignity and pathos they merit those ends will be assuredly attained. See with what fervor of gratitude the newly created Companions will hereafter refer to the name they assumed, and the character they represented. There can be no nobler, and if the work is done with the devotion to dramatic effects which the Ritual demands, that name and character will never be forgotten.</p>

 <p>Commanders will advance the interests of the bodies they govern by securing full paraphernalia and equipments. The robes need not be expensive, but should be appropriate. It is of the greatest importance that the Grand Council, Companion Conductor, Warder and Guards be in Jewish robes and turbans. It is equally important that the Persian Guards should wear a uniform different from that of the <a name="img_00800"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/00800.jpg" alt="BANNER OF THE ORDER"></td></tr></table>Order of the Red Cross, an Order not then founded, technically speaking.  
 <p>The Princes of Persia and the Rulers of Media should wear oriental robes, and the Master of Cavalry should also be in Persian dress. The Sovereign Master, Prince Chancellor and Prince Master of the Palace wear the regulation robes.</p>  
 <p>The seating of the Princes and Rulers, fully robed, should be in such form as to produce the best effects upon the Jewish Prince. No fixed floor plan can be laid down, because of the variations in the different Audience Chambers. Here Commanders will use their discretion.</p>  
 <p>In reading the lines of the Addresses be natural above all things. Affect no so-called dramatic or oratorical tones. Invest each scene with earnestness and pathos, as demanded. Allow no frivolous allusions, or undignified liberties to be taken with Z. Play the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">King</span> according to your best conception of royalty. See that the Means of Recognition are imparted with great care and accuracy. Let the dignified Order of the Red Cross be indeed a preparation for the solemn Order of the Temple.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE BANNER OF THE ORDER.</h4>  
 <p>It is of green color. In its center is a star of seven points, painted on gold, within which is painted the blood-red Cross of the</p>

 <p>It is of blood-red color, of equal arms and angles, with the letters on the extremities of the arms, D T J L.<a name="img_00901"></a>

 <p>The four arms, thus indicating Deity, Truth, Justice and Liberty, commemorate our faith in God, and in the grand characteristics of the Order.</p>  
 <p>This Cross is the Jewel of the Order, and may be properly worn by the members thereof, suspended by a green and red ribbon.</p>
