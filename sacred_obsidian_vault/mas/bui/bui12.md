 <p><i>The great effects which they have produced are established by the most incontestable facts of history.

 <p><i>On the field of battle, in the solitude of the uncultivated forests, or in the busy haunts of the crowded city, they have made men of the most hostile feelings, and most distant religions, and the most diversified conditions, rush to the aid of each other, and feel a social joy and satisfaction that they have been able to afford relief to a brother Mason</i>.—BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</p>

 <p>HENCEFORTH the Masons of England were no longer a society of handicraftsmen, but an association of men of all orders and every vocation, as also of almost every creed, who met together on the broad basis of humanity, and recognized no standard of human worth other than morality, kindliness, and love of truth. They retained the symbolism of the old Operative Masonry, <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">1</font></a> its language, its legends, its ritual, and its oral tradition. No longer did they build churches, but the spiritual</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>temple of humanity; using the Square not to measure right angles of blocks of stone, but for evening the inequalities of human character, nor the Compass any more to describe circles on a tracing-board, but to draw a Circle of goodwill around all mankind.</p>  
 <p>Howbeit, one generation of men, as Hume re-marks, does not go off the stage at once, and another succeed, like silkworms and butterflies. No more did this metamorphosis of Masonry, so to name it, take place suddenly or radically, as it has become the fashion to think. It was a slow process, and like every such period the Epoch of Transition was attended by many problems, uncertainties, and difficulties. Some of the Lodges, as we have noted, would never agree to admit Accepted Masons, so jealous were they of the ancient landmarks of the Craft. Even the Grand Lodge, albeit a revival of the old Assembly, was looked upon with suspicion by not a few, as tending toward undue centralization; and not without cause. From the first the Grand Master was given more power than was ever granted to the President of an ancient Assembly; of necessity so, perhaps, but it led to misunderstanding. Other influences added to the confusion, and at the same time emphasized the need of welding the order into a more coherent unity for its wider service to humanity.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>There are hints to the effect that the new Masonry, if so it may be called, made very slow progress in the public favor at first, owing to the conditions just stated; and this despite the remark of Anderson in June, 1719: "Now several old Brothers that had neglected the Craft, visited the Lodges; some Noblemen were also made Brothers, and more new Lodges were constituted." Stuckely, the antiquarian, tells us in his <i>Diary</i> under date of January, 1721—at which time he was initiated—that he was the first person made a Mason in London for years, and that it was not easy to find men enough to perform the ceremony. Incidentally, he confides to us that he entered the order in search of the long hidden secrets of "the Ancient Mysteries." No doubt he exaggerated in the matter of numbers, though it is possible that initiations were comparatively few at the time, the Lodges being recruited, for the most part, by the adhesion of old Masons, both Operative and Speculative; and among his friends he may have had some difficulty in finding men with an adequate knowledge of the ritual. But that there was any real difficulty in gathering together seven Masons in London is, on the face of it, absurd. Immediately thereafter, Stuckely records, Masonry "took a run, and ran itself out of breath through the folly of its members," but he does not tell us what the folly was. The "run" referred to was almost</p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>certainly due to the acceptance by the Duke of Montagu of the Grand Mastership, which gave the order a prestige it had never had before; and it was also in the same year, 1721, that the old Constitutions of the Craft were revised.</p>  
 <p>Twelve Lodges attended the June quarterly communication of the Grand Lodge in 1721, sixteen in September, twenty in December, and by April, 1723, the number had grown to thirty. All these Lodges, be it noted, were in London, a fact amply justifying the optimism of Anderson in the last paragraph of the <i>Book of Constitutions</i>, issued in that year. So far the Grand Lodge had not extended its jurisdiction beyond London and Westminster, but the very next year, 1724, there were already nine Lodges in the provinces acknowledging its obedience, the first being the Lodge at the Queen's Head, City of Bath. Within a few years Masonry extended its labors abroad, both on British and on foreign soil. The first Lodge on foreign soil was founded by the Duke of Wharton at Madrid, in 1728, and regularized the following year, by which time a Lodge had been established at the East India Arms, Bengal, and also at Gibraltar. It was not long before Lodges arose in many lands, founded by English Masons or by men who had received initiation in England; these Lodges, when sufficiently numerous, uniting under Grand Lodges—the old Lodge at York, that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>ancient Mecca of Masonry, had called itself a Grand Lodge as early as 1725. The Grand Lodge of Ireland was created in 1729, those of Scotland <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">1</font></a> and France in 1736; a Lodge at Hamburg in 1737, <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">2</font></a> though it was not patented until 1740; the Unity Lodge at Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1742, another at Vienna the same year; the Grand Lodge of the Three World-spheres at Berlin in 1744; and so on, until the order made its advent in Sweden, Switzer-land, Russia, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p>  
 <p>Following the footsteps of Masonry from land to land is almost as difficult as tracing its early history, owing to the secrecy in which it enwrapped</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>its movements. For example, in 1680 there came to South Carolina one John Moore, a native of England, who before the close of the century removed to Philadelphia, where, in 1703, he was Collector of the Port. In a letter written by him in 1715, he mentions having "spent a few evenings in festivity with my Masonic brethren." <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">1</font></a> This is the first vestige of Masonry in America, unless we accept as authentic a curious document in the early history of Rhode Island, as follows: "This ye [day and month obliterated] 1656, Wee mett att y House off Mordicai Campanell and after synagog gave Abram Moses the degrees of Maconrie." <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">2</font></a> On June 5, 1730, the first authority for the assembling of Free-masons in America was issued by the Duke of Norfolk, to Daniel Coxe, of New Jersey, appointing him Provincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and three years later Henry Price, of Boston, was appointed to the same office for New England. But Masons had evidently been coming to the New World for years, for the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>two cases just cited date back of the Grand Lodge of 1717.</p>  
 <p>How soon Coxe acted on the authority given him is not certain, but the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, published by Benjamin Franklin, contains many references to Masonic affairs as early as July, 1730. Just when Franklin himself became interested in Masonry is not of record—he was initiated in 1730-31 <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">1</font></a>—but he was a leader, at that day, of everything that would advance his adopted city; and the "Junto," formed in 1725, often inaccurately called the Leathern-Apron Club, owed its origin to him. In a Masonic item in the <i>Gazette</i> of December 3, 1730, he refers to "several Lodges of Free-masons" in the Province, and on June 9, 1732, notes the organization of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, of which he was appointed a Warden, at the Sun Tavern, in Water Street. Two years later Franklin was elected Grand Master, and the same year published an edition of the <i>Book of Constitutions</i>—the first Masonic book issued in America.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Thus Masonry made an early advent into the new world, in which it has labored so nobly, helping to lay the foundations and building its own basic principles into the organic law of the greatest of all republics.</p>  <h3 align="center">II</h3>  
 <p>Returning to the Grand Lodge of England, we have now to make record of ridicule and opposition from without, and, alas, of disloyalty and discord within the order itself. With the publication of the <i>Book of Constitutions</i>, by Anderson, in 1723, the platform and principles of Masonry became matters of common knowledge, and its enemies were alert and vigilant. None are so blind as those who will not see, and not a few, unacquainted with the spirit of Masonry, or unable to grasp its principle of liberality and tolerance, affected to detect in its secrecy some dark political design; and this despite the noble charge in the <i>Book of Constitutions</i> enjoining politics from entering the lodge—a charge hardly less memorable than the article defining its attitude toward differing religious creeds, and which it behooves Masons to keep always in mind as both true and wise, especially in our day when effort is being made to inject the religious issue into politics:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>In order to preserve peace and harmony no private piques or quarrels must be brought within the door of <a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></a> the Lodge, far less any quarrel about Religions or Nations or State-Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic Religion above mentioned (the religion in which all men agree); we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds and Languages, and are resolved against all Politics as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This charge has always been actively enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the Reformation in Britain or the dissent and secession of these Nations from the communion of Rome.</small></div>  
 <p>No sooner had these noble words been printed, <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">1</font></a> than there came to light a secret society calling itself the "truly Ancient Noble Order of the Gormogons," alleged to have been instituted by Chin-Quaw Ky-Po, the first Emperor of China, many thousand years before Adam. Notice of a meeting of the order appeared in the <i>Daily Post</i>, September 3, 1723, in which it was stated, among other high-sounding declarations, that "no Mason will be received as a Member till he has renounced his noble order and been properly degraded." Obviously, from this notice and others of like kind—all hinting at the secrets of the Lodges—the order was</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>aping Masonry by way of parody with intent to destroy it, if possible, by ridicule. For all that, if we may believe the Saturday Post of October following, "many eminent Freemasons" had by that time "degraded themselves" and gone over to the Gormogons. Not "many" perhaps, but, alas, one eminent Mason at least, none other than a Past Grand Master, the Duke of Wharton, who, piqued at an act of the Grand Lodge, had turned against it. Erratic of mind, unstable of morals, having an inordinate lust for praise, and pilloried as a "fool" by Pope in his Moral Essays, he betrayed his fraternity—as, later, he turned traitor to his faith, his flag, and his native land!</p>  
 <p>Simultaneously with the announcement that many eminent Masons had "degraded themselves"—words most fitly chosen—and gone over to the Gormogons, there appeared a book called the <i>Grand Mystery of Freemasons Discovered</i>, and the cat was out of the bag. Everything was plain to the Masons, and if it had not been clear, the way in which the writer emphasized his hatred of the Jesuits would have told it all. It was a Jesuit <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">1</font></a> plot hatched</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>in Rome to expose the secrets of Masonry, and making use of the dissolute and degenerate Mason for that purpose—tactics often enough used in the name of Jesus! Curiously enough, this was further made evident by the fact that the order ceased to exist in 1738, the year in which Clement XII published his Bull against the Masons. Thereupon the "ancient order of Gormogons" swallowed itself, and so disappeared—not, however, without one last, futile effort to achieve its ends. <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">1</font></a> Naturally this episode stirred the Masons deeply. It was denounced in burning words on the floor of the Grand Lodge, which took new caution to guard its rites from treachery and vandalism, in which respects it had not exercised due care, admitting men to the order who were unworthy of the honor.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></a></p>  
 <p>There were those who thought that the power of Masonry lay in its secrecy; some think so still, not knowing that its <i>real</i> power lies in the sanctity of its truth, the simplicity of its faith, the sweetness of its spirit, and its service to mankind, and that if all its rites were made public today it would still hold the hearts of men. <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">1</font></a> Nevertheless, of alleged exposures there were many between 1724 and 1730, both anonymous and signed, and they made much ado, especially among men who were not Masons. It will be enough to name the most famous, as well as the most elaborate, of them all, <i>Masonry Dissected</i>, by Samuel Prichard, which ran through three editions in one month, October, 1730, and called out a noble <i>Defence of Masonry</i>, written, it is thought, by Anderson, but the present writer believes by Desaguliers. Others came later, such as <i>Jachin and Boaz</i>, the <i>Three Distinct Knocks</i>, and so forth. They had their day and ceased to be, having now only an antiquarian interest to those who would know the manners and customs of a far-off time. Instead of injuring the order, they really helped it, as such things usually do, by showing that there must be something</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>to expose since so many were trying to do it. But Masonry went marching on, leaving them behind in the rubbish of things forgotten, as it does all its back-stair spies and heel-snapping critics.</p>  
 <p>More serious by far was the series of schisms within the order which began in 1725, and ran on even into the next century. For the student they make the period very complex, calculated to bewilder the beginner; for when we read of four Grand Lodges in England, and for some years all of them running at once, and each one claiming to be the Grand Lodge of England, the confusion seems not a little confounded. Also, one Grand Lodge of a very limited territory, and few adherents, adopted the title of Grand Lodge of <i>all</i> England, while another which commenced in the middle of the century assumed the title of "The Ancients," and dubbed the older and parent Grand Lodge "The Moderns." Besides, there are traces of an unrecorded Grand body calling itself "The Supreme Grand Lodge," <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">1</font></a> as if each were trying to make up in name what was lacking in numbers. Strict search and due inquiry into the causes of these divisions would seem to show the following results:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></a></p>  
 <p>First, there was a fear, not unjustified by facts, that the ancient democracy of the order had been infringed upon by certain acts of the Grand Lodge of 1717—as, for example, giving to the Grand Master power to appoint the Wardens. <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">1</font></a> Second, there was a tendency, due to the influence of some clergymen active in the order, to give a distinctively Christian tinge to Masonry, first in their interpretations of its symbols, and later to the ritual itself. This fact has not been enough emphasized by our historians, for it explains much. Third, there was the further fact that Masonry in Scotland differed from Masonry in England, in details at least, and the two did not all at once harmonize, each being rather tenacious of its usage and tradition, Fourth, in one instance, if no more, pride of locality and historic memories led to independent organization. Fifth, there was the ever-present element of personal ambition with which all human societies, of whatever kind, must reckon at all times and places this side</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>of heaven. Altogether, the situation was amply conducive to division, if not to explosion, and the wonder is that the schisms were so few.</p>  <h4 align="center">III</h4>  
 <p>Time out of mind the ancient city of York had been a seat of the Masonic Craft, tradition tracing it back to the days of Athelstan, in 926 A. D. Be that as it may, the Lodge minutes of York are the oldest in the country, and the relics of the Craft now preserved in that city entitle it to be called the Mecca of Masonry. Whether the old society was a Private or a Grand Lodge is not plain; but in 1725 it assumed the title of the "Grand Lodge of All England,"—feeling, it would seem, that its inherent right by virtue of antiquity had in some way been usurped by the Grand Lodge of London. After ten or fifteen years the minutes cease, but the records of other grand bodies speak of it as still working. In 1761 six of its surviving members revived the Grand Lodge, which continued with varying success until its final extinction in 1791, having only a few subordinate Lodges, chiefly in Yorkshire. Never antagonistic, it chose to remain independent, and its history is a noble tradition. York Masonry was acknowledged by all parties to be both ancient and orthodox, and even to this day, in England and over</p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>the seas, a certain mellow, magic charm clings to the city which was for so long a meeting place of Masons. <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Far more formidable was the schism of 1753, which had its origin, as is now thought, in a group of Irish Masons in London who were not recognized by the premier Grand Lodge. <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">2</font></a> Whereupon they denounced the Grand Lodge, averring that it had adopted "new plans" and departed from the old landmarks, reverted, as they alleged, to the old forms, and set themselves up as <i>Ancient</i> Masons—bestowing upon their rivals the odious name of <i>Moderns</i>. Later the two were further distinguished from each other by the names of their respective Grand Masters, one called Prince of Wales' Masons, the other the Atholl Masons. <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">3</font></a> The great figure in the Atholl Grand body was Lawrence Dermott, to whose keen pen and indefatigable industry as its secretary for more than thirty years was due, in large measure, its success. In 1756 he published its first book of laws, entitled <i>Ahiman Rezon, Or Help to a Brother</i>, much of which was taken from the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>Irish Constitutions</i> of 1751, by Pratt, and the rest from the <i>Book of Constitutions</i>, by Anderson—whom he did not fail to criticize with stinging satire, of which he was a master. Among other things, the office of Deacon seems to have had its origin with this body. Atholl Masons were presided over by the Masters of affiliated Lodges until 1756, when Lord Blessington, their first titled Grand Master, was induced to accept the honor—their warrants having been left blank betimes, awaiting the coming of a Nobleman to that office. Later the fourth Duke of Atholl was Grand Master at the same time of Scotland and of the Atholl Grand Lodge, the Grand Lodges of Scotland and Ireland being represented at his installation in London.</p>  
 <p>Still another schism, not serious but significant, came in 1778, led by William Preston, <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">1</font></a> who afterwards became a shining light in the order. On St. John's Day, December 27, 1777, the Antiquity</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Lodge of London, of which Preston was Master—one of the four original Lodges forming the Grand Lodge—attended church in a body, to hear a sermon by its Chaplain. They robed in the vestry, and then marched into the church, but after the service they walked back to the Hall wearing their Masonic clothing. Difference of opinion arose as to the regularity of the act, Preston holding it to be valid, if for no other reason, by virtue of the inherent right of Antiquity Lodge itself. Three members objected to his ruling and appealed to the Grand Lodge, he foolishly striking their names off the Lodge roll for so doing. Eventually the Grand Lodge took the matter up, decided against Preston, and ordered the reinstatement of the three protesting members. At its next meeting the Antiquity Lodge voted not to comply with the order of the Grand Lodge, and, instead, to withdraw from that body and form an alliance with the "Old Grand Lodge of All England at York City," as they called it. They were received by the York Grand Lodge, and soon thereafter obtained a constitution for a "Grand Lodge of England South of the Trent." Although much vitality was shown at the outset, this body only constituted two subordinate Lodges, and ceased to exist. Having failed, in 1789 Preston and his friends recanted their folly, apologized to the Grand Lodge, reunited with the men whom they had expelled, and were</p>  
 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>received back into the fold; and so the matter ended.</p>  
 <p>These divisions, while they were in some ways unhappy, really made for the good of the order in the sequel—the activity of contending Grand Lodges, often keen, and at times bitter, promoting the spread of its principles to which all were alike loyal, and to the enrichment of its Ritual <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">1</font></a> to which each contributed. Dermott, an able executive and audacious antagonist, had left no stone unturned to advance the interests of Atholl Masonry, inducing its Grand Lodge to grant warrants to army Lodges, which bore fruit in making Masons in every part of the world where the English army went. <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">2</font></a> Howbeit,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>when that resourceful secretary and uncompromising fighter had gone to his long rest, a better mood began to make itself felt, and a desire to heal the feud and unite all the Grand Lodges—the way having been cleared, meanwhile, by the demise of the old York Grand Lodge and the "Grand Lodge South of the Trent." Overtures to that end were made in 1802 without avail, but by 1809 committees were meeting and reporting on the "propriety and practicability of union." Fraternal letters were exchanged, and at last a joint committee met, canvassed all differences, and found a way to heal the schism. <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>Union came at length, in a great Lodge of Reconciliation held in Freemason's Hall, London, on St. John's Day, December 27, 1813. It was a memorable and inspiring scene as the two Grand Lodges, so long estranged, filed into the Hall—delegates of 641 Modern and 359 Ancient or Atholl Lodges—so mixed as to be indistinguishable the one from the other. Both Grand Masters had seats of honor in the East. The hour was fraternal, each side willing to sacrifice prejudice in behalf of principles held by all in common, and all equally anxious to preserve the ancient landmarks of the Craft—a most significant fact being that the Atholl Masons had insisted that Masonry erase such distinctively <a href="errata.htm#9">Christian</a> color as had crept into it, and return to its first platform. <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">1</font></a> Once united, free of feud, cleansed of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>rancor, and holding high its unsectarian, non-partisan flag, Masonry moved forward to her great ministry. If we would learn the lesson of those long dead schisms, we must be vigilant, correcting our judgments, improving our regulations, and cultivating that spirit of Love which is the fountain whence issue all our voluntary efforts for what is right and true: union in essential matters, liberty in everything unimportant and doubtful; Love always—one bond, one universal law, one fellowship in spirit and in truth!</p>  <h4 align="center">IV</h4>  
 <p>Remains now to give a glimpse—and, alas, only a glimpse—of the growth and influence of Masonry in America; and a great story it is, needing many volumes to tell it aright. As we have seen, it came early to the shores of the New World, long before the name of our great republic had been uttered, and with its gospel of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity it helped to shape the institutions of this Continent. Down the Atlantic Coast, along the Great Lakes, into the wilderness of the Middle West and the forests of the far South—westward it</p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>marched as "the star of empire" led, setting up its altar on .remote frontiers, a symbol of civilization, of loyalty to law and order, of friendship with school-house and church. If history recorded the unseen influences which go to the making of a nation, those forces for good which never stop, never tarry, never tire, and of which our social order is the outward and visible sign, then might the real story of Masonry in America be told.</p>  
 <p>Instead of a dry chronicle, <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">1</font></a> let us make effort to capture and portray the spirit of Masonry in American history, if so that all may see how this great order actually presided over the birth of the republic, with whose growth it has had so much to do. For example, no one need be told what patriotic memories cluster about the old Green Dragon Tavern,</p>

 <p>in Boston, which Webster, speaking at Andover in 1823, called "<i>the headquarters of the Revolution</i>." Even so, but it was also a <i>Masonic Hall</i>, in the "Long Room" of which the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts—an off-shoot of St. Andrew's Lodge—was organized on St. John's Day, 1767, with Joseph Warren, who afterwards fell at Bunker Hill, as Grand Master. There Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, Warren, Hancock, Otis and others met and passed resolutions, and then laid schemes to make them come true. There the Boston Tea Party was planned, and executed by Masons disguised as Mohawk Indians—not by the Lodge as such, but by a club formed within the Lodge, calling itself the <i>Caucus Pro Bono Publico</i>, of which Warren was the leading spirit, and in which, says Elliott, "the plans of the Sons of Liberty were matured." As Henry Purkett used to say, he was present at the famous Tea Party as a spectator, and in disobedience to the order of the Master of the Lodge, who was actively present. <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>As in Massachusetts, so throughout the Colonies—the Masons were everywhere active in behalf of a nation "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." Of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence, the following are known to have been</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>members of the order: William Hooper, Benjamin Franklin, Matthew Thornton, William Whipple, John Hancock, Philip Livingston, Thomas Nelson; and no doubt others, if we had the Masonic records destroyed during the war. Indeed, it has been said that, with four men out of the room, the assembly could have been opened in form as a Masonic Lodge, on the Third Degree. Not only Washington, <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">1</font></a> but nearly all of his generals, were Masons; such at least as Greene, Lee, Marion, Sullivan, Rufus and Israel Putnam, Edwards, Jackson, Gist, Baron Steuben, Baron De Kalb, and the Marquis de Lafayette who was made a Mason in one of the many military Lodges held in the Continental Army. <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">2</font></a> If the history of those old camp-lodges could be written, what a story it would tell. Not only did they initiate such men as Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall, the immortal Chief Justice, but they made the spirit of Masonry felt in "times that try men's souls" <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">3</font></a>—a spirit passing through picket-lines, eluding sentinels, and softening the horrors of war.</p>

 <p>Laying aside their swords, these Masons helped to lay wide and deep the foundations of that liberty under the law which has made this nation, of a truth, "the last great hope of man." Nor was it an accident, but a scene in accord with the fitness of things, that George Washington was sworn into office as the first President of the Republic by the Grand Master of New York, taking his oath on a Masonic Bible. It was a parable of the whole period. If the Magna Charta demanded rights which government can grant, Masonry from the first asserted those inalienable rights which man derives from God the rather of men. Never did this truth find sweeter voice than in the tones of the old Scotch fiddle on which Robert Burns, a Master Mason, sang, in lyric glee, of the sacredness of the soul, and the native dignity of humanity as the only basis of society and the state. That music went marching on, striding over continents and seas, until it found embodiment in the Constitution and laws of this nation, where today more than a million Masons are citizens.</p>  
 <p>How strange, then, that Masonry should have been made the victim of the most bitter and baseless persecution, for it was nothing else, in the annals</p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the Republic. Yet so it came to pass between 1826 and 1845, in connection with the Morgan <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">1</font></a> affair, of which so much has been written, and so little truth told. Alas, it was an evil hour when, as Galsworthy would say, "men just feel something big and religious, and go blind to justice, fact, and reason." Although Lodges everywhere repudiated and denounced the crime, if crime it was, and the Governor of New York, himself a Mason, made every effort to detect and punish those involved, the fanaticism</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="green">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p>would not be stayed: the mob-mood ruled. An Anti-Masonic political party <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">1</font></a> was formed, fed on frenzy, and the land was stirred from end to end. Even such a man as John Quincy Adams, of great credulity and strong prejudice, was drawn into the fray, and in a series of letters flayed Masonry as an enemy of society and a free state—forgetting that Washington, Franklin, Marshall, and Warren were members of the order! Meanwhile—and, verily, it was a mean while—Weed, Seward, Thaddeus Stevens, and others of their ilk, rode into power on the strength of it, as they had planned to do, defeating Henry Clay for President, because he was a Mason—and, incidentally, electing Andrew Jackson, another Mason! Let it be said that, if the Masons found it hard to keep within the Compass, they at least acted on the Square. Finally the fury spent itself, leaving the order purged of feeble men who were Masons only in form, and a revival of Masonry followed, slowly at first, and then with great rapidity.</p>  
 <p>No sooner had Masonry recovered from this or-deal than the dark clouds of Civil War covered the land like a pall—the saddest of all wars, dividing a nation one in arts and arms and historic memories,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 229</font></a></p>  
 <p>and leaving an entail of blood and fire and tears. Let it be forever <a href="errata.htm#10">remembered</a> that, while churches were severed and states were seceding, <i>the Masonic order remained unbroken</i> in that wild and fateful hour. An effort was made to involve Masonry in the strife, but the wise counsel of its leaders, North and South, prevented the mixing of Masonry with politics; and while it could not avert the tragedy, it did much to mitigate the woe of it—building rainbow bridges of mercy and goodwill from army to army. Though passion may have strained, it could not break the tie of Masonic love, which found a ministry on red fields, among the sick, the wounded, and those in prison; and many a man in gray planted a Sprig of Acacia on the grave of a man who wore the blue. Some day the writer hopes to tell that story, or a part of it, and then men will under-stand what Masonry is, what it means, and what it can do to heal the hurts of humanity. <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>Even so it has been, all through our national history, and today Masonry is worth more for the sanctity and safety of this republic than both its army and its navy. At every turn of events, when the rights of man have been threatened by enemies obvious or insidious, it has stood guard—its altar lights like signal fires along the heights of liberty, keeping watch. Not only in our own land, but everywhere over the broad earth, when men have thrown off the yoke of tyranny, whether political or spiritual, and demanded the rights that belong to manhood, they have found a friend in the Masonic order—as did Mazzini and Garibaldi in Italy. Nor must we be less alert and vigilant today when, free of danger of foes from without, our republic is imperiled by the negligence of indifference, the seduction of luxury, the machinations of politicians, and the shadow of a passion-clouded, impatient discontent, whose end is madness and folly; lest the most hallowed of all liberties be lost.</p>

 <p>Truly, the very existence of such a great historic fellowship in the quest and service of the Ideal is a fact eloquent beyond all words, and to be counted among the precious assets of humanity. Forming one vast society of free men, held together by voluntary obligations, it covers the whole globe from Egypt to India, from Italy to England, from America to Australia, and the isles of the sea; from London to Sidney, from Chicago to Calcutta. In all civilized lands, and among folk of every creed worthy of the name, Masonry is found—and everywhere it upholds all the redeeming ideals of humanity, making all good things better by its presence, like a stream underflowing a meadow. <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">1</font></a> Also, wherever Masonry flourishes and is allowed to build freely after its divine design, liberty, justice, education, and true religion flourish; and where it is hindered, they suffer. Indeed, he who would reckon the spiritual possessions of the race, and estimate the forces that make for social beauty, national greatness, and human welfare, must take account of the genius of</p>

 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="green">p. 232</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Masonry and its ministry to the higher life of the race.</p>  
 <p>Small wonder that such an order has won to its fellowship men of the first order of intellect, men of thought and action in many lands, and every walk and work of life: soldiers like Wellington, Blucher, and Garibaldi; philosophers like Krause, Fichte, and John Locke; patriots like Washington and Mazzini; writers like Walter Scott, Voltaire, Steele, Lessing, Tolstoi; poets like Goethe, Burns, Byron, Kipling, Pike; musicians like Haydn and Mozart—whose opera, <i>The Magic Flute</i>, has a Masonic motif; masters of drama like Forrest and Edwin Booth; editors such as Bowles, Prentice, Childs, Grady; ministers of many communions, from Bishop Potter to Robert Collyer; statesmen, philanthropists, educators, jurists, men of science—Masons many, <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">1</font></a> whose names shine like stars in the great world's crown of intellectual</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></a></p>  
 <p>and spiritual glory. What other order has ever brought together men of such diverse type, temper, training, interest, and achievement, uniting them at an altar of prayer in the worship of God and the service of man?</p>  
 <p>For the rest, if by some art one could trace those invisible influences which move to and fro like shuttles in a loom, weaving the network of laws, reverences, sanctities which make the warp and woof of society—giving to statutes their dignity and power, to the gospel its opportunity, to the home its canopy of peace and beauty, to the young an enshrinement of inspiration, and to the old a mantle of protection; if one had such art, then he might tell the true story of Masonry. Older than any living religion, the most widespread of all orders of men, it toils for liberty, friendship, and righteousness; binding men with solemn vows to the right, uniting them upon the only basis upon which they can meet without reproach—like those fibers running through the glaciers, along which sunbeams journey, melting the frozen mass and sending it to the valleys</p>  
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></a></p>  
 <p>below in streams of blessing. Other fibers are there, but none is more far-ramifying, none more tender, none more responsive to the Light than the mystical tie of Masonic love.</p>  
 <p>Truth will triumph. Justice will yet reign from sun to sun, victorious over cruelty and evil. Finally Love will rule the race, casting out fear, hatred, and all unkindness, and pity will heal the old hurt and heart-ache of humanity. There is nothing in history, dark as much of it is, against the ultimate fulfilment of the prophetic vision of Robert Burns—the Poet Laureate of Masonry:</p>

 <p><a name="fn_132"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_132">201:1</a> Operative Masonry, it should be remembered, was not entirely dead, nor did it all at once disappear. Indeed, it still exists in some form, and an interesting account of its forms, degrees, symbols, usages, and traditions may be found in an article on "Operative Masonry," by C. F. Stretton (<i>Transactions Leicester Lodge of Research</i>, 1909-10, 1911-12). The second of these volumes also contains an essay on "Operative Free-masons," by Thomas Carr, with a list of lodges, and a study of their history, customs, and emblems—especially the Swastika. Speculative Masons are now said to be joining these Operative Lodges, seeking more light on what are called the Lost Symbols of Masonry.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_133"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_133">205:1</a> The Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland, it may be added, were self-constituted, without assistance or intervention from England in any form.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_134"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_134">205:2</a> A deputation of the Hamburg Lodge initiated Frederick—afterwards Frederick the Great of Prussia—into the order of Masons at Brunswick, August 14, 1738 (<i>Frederick and his Times</i>, by Campbell, <i>History of Frederick</i>, by Carlyle, Findel's <i>History of Masonry</i>). Other noblemen followed his example, and their zeal for the order gave a new date to the history of Masonry in Germany. When Frederick ascended the throne, in 1740, the Craft was honored, and it flourished in his kingdom. As to the interest of Frederick in the order in his later years, the facts are not clear, but that he remained its friend seems certain (Mackey, <i>Encyclopedia</i>). However, the Craft underwent many vicissitudes in Germany, a detailed account of which Findel recites (<i>History of Masonry</i>). Few realize through what frightful persecutions Masonry has passed in many lands, owing in part to its secrecy, but in larger part to its principle of civil and religious liberty. Whenever that story is told, as it surely will be, men everywhere will pay homage to the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons as friends of mankind.</p>

John Moore was the father of William Moore, whose daughter became the wife of Provost Smith, who was a Mason in 1775, and afterward Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, and whose son was Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania in 1796 and 1797 (<i>History of Freemasonry</i>, by Hughan and Stillson).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_137"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_137">207:1</a> <i>Benjamin Franklin as a Free Mason</i>, by J. F. Sachse. Oddly enough, there is no mention of Masonry by Franklin in his <i>Autobiography</i>, or in any of his letters, with but two exceptions, so far as known; which is the more remarkable when we look at his Masonic career in France during the later years of his life, where he was actively and intimately associated with the order, even advancing to the higher degrees. Never for a day did he abate by one jot his interest in the order, or his love for it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_138"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_138">209:1</a> This injunction was made doubly strong in the edition of the <i>Book of Constitutions</i>, in 1738. For example: "no quarrels about nations, families, religion or politics must by any means or under any color or pretense whatever be brought within the door of the Lodge . . . Masons being of all nations upon the square, level and plumb; and like our predecessors in all ages, we are resolved against political disputes," etc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_139"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_139">210:1</a> Masons have sometimes been absurdly called "Protestant Jesuits," but the two orders are exactly opposite in spirit, principle, purpose, and method. All that they have in common is that they are both secret societies, which makes it plain that the opposition of the Latin church to Masonry is not on the ground of its being a secret <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></a> order, else why sanction the Jesuits, to name no other? The difference has been stated in this way: "Opposite poles these two societies are, for each possesses precisely those qualities which the other lacks. The Jesuits are strongly centralized, the Freemasons only con-federated. Jesuits are controlled by one man's will, Freemasons are under majority rule. Jesuits bottom morality in expediency, Freemasons in regard for the well-being of mankind. Jesuits recognize only one creed, Freemasons hold in respect all honest convictions. Jesuits seek to break down individual independence, Freemasons to build it up" (<i>Mysteria</i>, by Otto Henne Am Rhyn).</p>

Gould, in his "Masonic Celebrities" series (<i>A. Q. C.</i>, viii, 144), and more recently, <i>The Life and Writings of Philip, Duke of Wharton</i>, by Lewis Melville.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_141"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_141">212:1</a> Findel has a nobly eloquent passage on this point, and it tells the everlasting truth (History of Masonry, p. 378). His whole history, indeed, is exceedingly worth reading, the more so because it was one of the first books of the right kind, and it stimulated research.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_142"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_142">213:1</a> A paper entitled "An Unrecorded Grand Lodge," by Sadler (<i>A. Q. C.</i>, vol. xviii, 69-90), tells practically all that is known of this movement, which merged with the Grand Lodge of London in 1776.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_143"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_143">214:1</a> Nor was that all. In 1735 it was resolved in the Grand Lodge "that in the future all Grand Officers (except Grand Master) shall be selected out of that body"—meaning the past Grand Stewards. This act was amazing. Already the Craft had let go its power to elect the Wardens, and now the choice of the Grand Master was narrowed to the ranks of an oligarchy in its worst form—a queer outcome of Masonic equality. Three months later the Grand Stewards presented a memorial asking that they "might form themselves into a special lodge," with special jewels, etc. Naturally this bred discontent and apprehension, and justly so.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_144"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_144">216:1</a> Often we speak of "the York Rite," as though it were the oldest and truest form of Masonry, but, while it serves to distinguish one branch of Masonry from another, it is not accurate; for, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a York Rite. The name is more a tribute of reverence than a description of fact.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_147"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_147">217:1</a> William Preston was born in Edinburgh in 1742, and came as a journeyman printer to London in 1760, where he made himself conversant with the history, laws, and rites of the Craft, being much in demand as a lecturer. He was a good speaker, and frequently addressed the Lodges of the city. After his blunder of seceding had been forgiven, he was honored with many offices, especially the Grand Secretaryship, which gave him time to pursue his studies. Later he wrote the <i>Freemason's Callender</i>, an appendix to the <i>Book of Constitutions</i>, a <i>History of Masonry</i>, and, most famous of all, <i>Illustrations of Masonry</i>, which passed through a score of editions. Besides, he had much to do with the development of the Ritual.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_148"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_148">219:1</a> The history of the Ritual is most interesting, and should be written in more detail (<i>History of Masonry</i>, by Steinbrenner, chap. vii, "The Ritual"). An article giving a brief story of it appeared in the <i>Masonic Monthly</i>, of Boston, November, 1863 (reprinted in the <i>New England Craftsman</i>, vol. vii, and still later in the <i>Bulletin of Iowa Masonic Library</i>, vol. xv, April, 1914). This article is valuable as showing the growth of the Ritual—as much by subtraction as by addition—and especially the introduction into it of Christian imagery and interpretation, first by Martin Clare in 1732, and by Duckerley and Hutchinson later. One need only turn to <i>The Spirit of Masonry</i>, by Hutchinson (1802), to see how far this tendency had gone when at last checked in 1813. At that time a committee made a careful comparative study of all rituals in use among Masons, and the ultimate result was the Preston-Webb lectures now generally in use in this country. (See a valuable article by Dr. Mackey on "The Lectures of Freemasonry," <i>American Quarterly Review of Freemasonry</i>, vol. ii, p. 297.) What a pity that this <i>Review</i> died of too much excellence!</p>
 <p><a name="fn_149"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_149">219:2</a> <i>Military Lodges</i>, by Gould; also Kipling's poem, <i>The Mother Lodge</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_150"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_150">220:1</a> Among the articles of union, it was agreed that Freemasonry should consist of the three symbolic degrees, "<i>including the Holy Royal Arch</i>." The present study does not contemplate a detailed study of Capitular Masonry, which has its own history and historians (<i>Origin of the English Rite</i>, Hughan), except to say that it seems to have begun about 1738-40, the <a href="errata.htm#8">consensus</a> of opinion differing as to whether it began in England or on the Continent ("Royal Arch Masonry," by C. P. Noar, <i>Manchester Lodge of Research</i>, vol. iii, 1911-12). Lawrence Dermott, always alert, had it adopted by the Atholl Grand Lodge about thirty years before the Grand Lodge of England took it up in 1770-76, when Thomas Duckerley was appointed to arrange and introduce it. Dermott held it to be "the very essence of Masonry," and he was not slow in using it as a club with which to belabor the Moderns; but he did not originate it, as some imagine, having received the degrees before he came to London, perhaps in an unsystemized form. Duckerley was accused of shifting the original Grand Masonic word from the Third Degree to the Royal Arch, and of substituting another in its stead. Enough to say that Royal Arch Masonry is <a href="#page_221">p. 221</a> authentic Masonry, being a further elaboration in drama, following the Third Degree, of the spirit and motif of old Craft Masonry (<i>History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders</i>, by Hughan and Stillson).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_151"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_151">221:1</a> It is interesting to note that the writer of the article on "Masonry" in the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>—an article admirable in many ways, and for the most part fair—makes much of this point, and rightly so, albeit his interpretation of it is altogether wrong. He imagines that the objection to Christian imagery in the ritual was due to enmity to Christianity. Not so. Masonry was not then, and has never at any time been, opposed to Christianity, or to any other religion. Far from it. But Christianity in those days—as, alas, too often now—was another name for a petty and bigoted sectarianism; and Masonry by its very genius was, and is, unsectarian. Many Masons then were devout Christians, as they are <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></a> now—not a few clergymen—but the order itself is open to men of all faiths, Catholic and Protestant, Hebrew and Hindu, who confess faith in God; and so it will always remain if it is true to its principles and history.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_152"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_152">223:1</a> As for the chronicle, the one indispensable book to the student of American Masonry is the <i>History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders</i>, by W. J. Hughan and H. L. Stillson, aided by one of the ablest board of contributors ever assembled. It includes a history of Masonry in all its Rites in North, Central, and South America, with accurate accounts of the origin and growth of every Grand Lodge in the United States and British America; also admirable chapters on Early American Masonic History, the Morgan Excitement, Masonic Jurisprudence, and statistics up to date of 1891—all carefully prepared and well written. Among other books too many to name, there are the <i>History of Symbolic Masonry</i> in the United States, by J. H. Drummond, and "The American Addenda" to Gould's massive and magnificent <i>History of Masonry</i>, vol. iv. What the present pages seek is the spirit behind this forest of facts.</p>

Few men have ever been more unjustly and cruelly maligned than this great patriot, who was the first to utter the name "United States," and who, instead <a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></a> of being a sceptic, believed in "the religion in which all men agree"—that is, in God, Duty, and the immortality of the soul.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_157"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_157">227:1</a> William Morgan was a dissolute, nondescript printer in Batavia, New York, who, having failed in everything else, thought to make money by betraying the secrets of an order which his presence polluted. Foolishly misled, a few Masons had him arrested on a petty charge, got him out of the country, and apparently paid him to stay out. Had no attention been paid to his alleged exposure it would have fallen still-born from the press, like many another before it. Rumors of abduction started, then Morgan was said to have been thrown into Niagara River, whereas there is no proof that he was ever killed, much less murdered by Masons. Thurlow Weed and a pack of unscrupulous politicians took it up, and the rest was easy. One year later a body was found on the shore of Lake Ontario which Weed and the wife of Morgan identified—a <i>year afterward</i>!—she, no doubt, having been paid to do so; albeit the wife of a fisherman named Munroe identified the same body as that of her husband drowned a week or so before. No matter; as Weed said, "<i>It's good enough Morgan until after the election</i>"—a characteristic remark, if we may judge by his own portrait as drawn in his <i>Autobiography</i>. Politically, he was capable of anything, if he could make it win, and here he saw a chance of stirring up every vile and slimy thing in human nature for sake of office. (See a splendid review of the whole matter in <i>History of Masonry</i>, by Hughan and Stillson, also by Could in vol. iv of his <i>History</i>.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_158"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_158">228:1</a> <i>Cyclopedia of Fraternities</i>, by Stevens, article, "Anti-Masonry," gives detailed account with many interesting facts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_159"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_159">229:1</a> Following the first day of the battle of Gettysburg, there was a Lodge meeting in town, and "Yanks" and "Johnny Rebs" met and mingled as friends under the Square and Compass. Where else could they have done so? (<i>Tennessee Mason</i>). When the Union army attacked Little Rock, Ark., the commanding officer, Thomas H. Benton—Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Iowa—threw a guard about the home of General Albert Pike, to <i>protect his Masonic library</i>. Marching through burning Richmond, a Union officer saw the familiar emblems over a hall. He put a guard about the Lodge room, and that night, together with a number of Confederate Masons, organized a society for the relief of widows and <a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></a> orphans left destitute by the war (<i>Washington, the Man and the Mason</i>, Callahan). But for the kindness of a brother Mason, who saved the life of a young soldier of the South, who was a prisoner of war at Rock Island, Ill., the present writer would never have been born, much less have written this book. That young soldier was my father! Volumes of such facts might be gathered in proof of the gracious ministry of Masonry in those awful years.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_160"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_160">231:1</a> <i>Cyclopedia of Fraternities</i>, by Stevens (last edition), article, "Free Masonry," pictures the extent of the order, with maps and diagrams showing its world-wide influence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="bui12.htm#fr_161">232:1</a> Space does not permit a survey of the literature of Masonry, still less of Masonry in literature. (Findel has two fine chapters on the literature of the order, but he wrote, in 1865, <i>History of Masonry</i>.) For traces of Masonry in literature, there is the famous chapter in <i>War and Peace</i>, by Tolstoi; <i>Mon Oncle Sosthenes</i>, by Maupassant; <i>Nathan the Wise</i>, and <i>Ernest and Falk</i>, by Lessing; the Masonic poems of Goethe, and many hints in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>; the writings of Herder (<i>Classic Period of German Letters</i>, Findel), <i>The Lost Word</i>, by Henry Van Dyke; and, of course, the poetry of Burns.</p>  
 <p>Masonic phrases and allusions—often almost too revealing—are found all through the poems and stories of Kipling. Besides <a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></a> the poem <i>The Mother Lodge</i>, so much admired, there is <i>The Widow of Windsor</i>, such stories as <i>With the Main Guard</i>, <i>The Winged Hats</i>, <i>Hal o’ the Draft</i>, <i>The City Walls</i>, <i>On the Great Wall</i>, many examples in <i>Kim</i>, also in <i>Traffics and Discoveries</i>, <i>Puck of Pook's Hill</i>, and, by no means least, <i>The Man Who Would be King</i>, one of the great short stories of the world.</p>
