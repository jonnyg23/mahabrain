 <p align="center"><b>A Description of the Ceremonies used in opening a<br> Lodge of Entered Apprentice Masons; which is the<br> same in all upper degrees, with the exception<br> of the difference in the signs, due-guards,<br> grips, pass-grips, words and their several<br> names; all of which will be<br> given and explained in their<br> proper places as the<br> work progresses.</b></p>  
 <p>One rap calls the lodge to order—one calls up the Junior and Senior Deacons—two raps call up all the subordinate officers, and three, all the members of the lodge.</p>  
 <p>The Master having called the lodge to order, and the officers all seated, the Master says to the Junior Warden, 'Brother Junior, are they all Entered Apprentice Masons in the south?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'They are, Worshipful.'</p>  
 <p>Master to the Senior Warden, 'Brother Senior, are they all Entered Apprentice Masons in the west?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'They are, Worshipful.'</p>  
 <p>The Master then says, 'They are, in the east,' at the same time he gives a rap with the common gavel or mallet, which calls up both Deacons.</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Deacon, 'Brother Junior, the first care of a Mason?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'To see the lodge tyled, Worshipful.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Deacon, 'Attend to that part of your duty, and inform the Tyler that we are about to open a lodge of Entered Apprentice Masons, and direct him to tyle accordingly.' The Junior Deacon then steps to the door and gives three raps, which are answered by three raps from without; the Junior Deacon then gives one, which is also answered by the Tyler with one; the door is then partly opened and the Junior Deacon delivers his message, and resumes his situation</p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>and says, 'The door is tyled, Worshipful.' (at the same time giving the due-guard, which is never omitted when the Master is addressed.)</p>  
 <p>The Master to Junior Deacon, 'Brother, by whom?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'By a Master Mason without the door, armed with the proper implement of his office.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Deacon, 'His duty there?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'To keep off all cowans and eaves-droppers, see that none pass or repass without permission from the Master.' (Some say without permission from the chair.)</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Deacon, 'Brother Junior, your place in the lodge?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'At the right hand of the Senior Warden in the west.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Deacon, 'Your business there, Brother Junior?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'To wait on the Worshipful Master and Wardens, act as their proxy in the active duties of the lodge, and take charge of the door.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Deacon, 'The Senior Deacon's place in the lodge?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'At the right hand of the Worshipful Master in the east.' [The Master, while asking the last questions gives two raps, which call up all the subordinate officers.]</p>  
 <p>Master to Senior Deacon, 'Your duty there, Brother Senior?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'To wait on the Worshipful Master and Wardens, act as their proxy in the active duties of the lodge, attend to the preparation and introduction of candidates, and welcome and clothe all visiting Brethren. [<i>i.e.</i>, furnish them with an apron.]</p>  
 <p>Master to Senior Deacon, 'The Secretary's place in the lodge, Brother Senior?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'At the left hand of the Worshipful Master in the east.'</p>  
 <p>Master to the Secretary, 'Your duty there, Brother Secretary?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'The better to observe the Worshipful Master's will and pleasure, record the proceedings of the lodge; transmit a copy of the same to the Grand Lodge, if required; receive all moneys and money bills from the hands of the Brethren, pay them over to the Treasurer, and take his receipt for the same.'</p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Master to the Secretary, 'The Treasurer's place in the lodge?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'At the right hand of the Worshipful Master.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Treasurer, 'Your duty there, Brother Treasurer?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'Duly to observe the Worshipful Master's will and pleasure; receive all moneys and money bills from the hands of the Secretary; keep a just and true account of the same; pay them out by order of the Worshipful Master and consent of the Brethren.'</p>  
 <p>The Master to the Treasurer, "The Junior Warden's place in the lodge, Brother Treasurer?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'In the south, Worshipful.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Junior Warden, 'Your business there, Brother Junior?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'As the sun in the south at high meridian is the beauty and glory of the day, so stands the Junior Warden in the south, the better to observe the time, call the crafts from labor to refreshment, superintend them during the hours thereof, see that none convert the hours of refreshment into that of intemperance or excess; and call them out again in due season, that the Worshipful Master may have honor, and they profit and pleasure thereby.'</p>  
 <p>Master to the Junior Warden, 'The Senior Warden's place in the lodge?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'In the west, Worshipful.'</p>  
 <p>Master to Senior Warden, 'Your duty there, Brother Senior?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'As the sun sets in the west to close the day, so stands the Senior Warden in the west to assist the Worshipful Master in opening his lodge, take care of the jewels and implements, see that none be lost, pay the craft their wages, if any be due, and see that none go away dissatisfied.'</p>  
 <p>Master to the Senior Warden, 'The Master's place in the lodge?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'In the east, Worshipful.'</p>  
 <p>Master to the Senior Warden, 'His duty there?'</p>  
 <p>Ans. 'As the sun rises in the east to open and adorn the</p>

 <p>day, so presides the Worshipful Master in the east to open and adorn his lodge, set his crafts to work with good and wholesome laws, or cause the same to be done.' The Master now gives three raps, when all the brethren rise, and the Master taking off his hat, proceeds as follows: In like manner so do I, strictly forbidding all profane language, private committees, or any other disorderly conduct whereby the peace and harmony of this lodge may be interrupted while engaged in its lawful pursuits, under no less penalty than the by-laws, or such penalty as the majority of the Brethren present may see fit to inflict. Brethren, attend to giving the signs.' [Here lodges differ very much. In some they declare the lodge opened as follows, before they give the signs:]</p>  
 <p><a name="img_01500"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/01500.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>The Master (all the Brethren imitating him) extends his left arm from his body so as to form an angle of about forty-five degrees, and holds his right hand transversely across his left, the palms thereof about one inch apart. This is called the Due Guard, and alludes to the position a Candidate's hands are placed in when he takes the obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason. The Master then draws his right hand across his throat, the hand open, with the thumb next to his throat, and drops it down by his side. This is called the penal sign of an Entered Apprentice Mason, (many call it sign) and alludes to the penalty of the obligation. (See obligation.) The Master Then declares the lodge opened in the following manner: 'I vow declare this lodge of Entered Apprentice Masons duly opened for dispatch of business.' The Senior Warden declares it to the Junior Warden, and he to the Brethren. 'Come, Brethren, let us pray.'—One of the following prayers is used:  
 <p>Most holy and glorious God! the great architect of the Universe; the giver of all good gifts and graces: Thou hast promised that 'Where two or three are gathered together in thy name, thou wilt be in the midst of them and bless them.' In thy name we assemble, most humbly beseeching thee to bless us in all our undertakings; that we may know and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>serve thee aright, and that all our actions may tend to thy glory and our advancement in knowledge and virtue. And we beseech thee, O Lord God, to bless our present assembling; and to illuminate our minds through the influence of the Son of Righteousness, that we may walk in the light of thy countenance; and when the trials of our probationary state are over, be admitted into the temple, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Amen. So mote it be.</p>  
 <p><i>Another prayer, as often used at opening as closing:</i></p>  
 <p>Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity; it is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garment; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forever more. Amen. So mote it be.</p>  
 <p>The lodge being now open and ready to proceed to business, the Master directs the Secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting, which naturally brings to view the business of the present.</p>
