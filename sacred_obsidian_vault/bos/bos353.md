 <h3 align="CENTER">Paganism at the Crossroads</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">
 by Skytoucher</p>
 <p>
 These are tricky and dangerous times. Paganism has grown in size to
 the point where we no longer enjoy the luxury of obscurity. We now
 face a choice that all initiatory paths face at some time in their
 development: Whether to remain a viable initiatory path, and if so
 under what circumstances; or to devolve into a mere religion.
 </p><p>
 I'd better backtrack--some readers may not understand what an
 initiatory path is, or how it differs from a religion. Others may
 think paganism is a religion already, and wonder what I mean by
 suggesting it is or could be something else.
 </p><p>
 A defense often used against fundamentalist Christians and others who
 attack paganism on a religious basis is to say, "We are not like you,
 only different in a few not-so-important ways. We are a religion, like
 you, another belief system, harmless, ordinary. We worship the Earth,
 the Goddess, the same way you worship your abstract God. You should
 extend tolerance to us for the same reason you extend it to Muslims or
 Buddhists or Catholics or Jews. When you single us as something weird,
 you are exhibiting hysterical paranoia." It's an effective defense,
 but somewhat disingenuous.
 </p><p>
 We are different. We aren't just a religion. We are at present, and in
 my view we should try to remain, a path of initiation. It may be
 inevitable that a religion grow up around us. It may even be desirable
 to employ such a religion as a cloak, or a doorway, to both. But a
 Pagan religion is also a threat to the Pagan path of initiation. We
 need to ensure that the growth, if it occurs, is that of a tree from a
 seed, not of a pearl from a grain of sand.
 </p><p>
 A tree produces more seeds.
 A pearl only hides the sand to
 save the oyster from discomfort.
 </p><p>
 What is an initiatory path? And what, then, is initiation? We touch
 here upon a word badly misunderstood by many Pagans. Initiation is one
 thing; an initiation ritual is another. A person is not an initiate,
 in the sense I mean here, just because he or she has passed through an
 initiation ritual. Initiation is a personal experience in which one
 becomes aware of mysteries--realities that were previously hidden, that
 cannot be communicated by one person to another in words or symbols,
 that must be experienced directly, firsthand. This last point is
 crucial. One finds "mysteries" communicated in coven initiations or
 even at festivals, but these are only hidden meanings of symbols and
 tools used in the Craft, or of stories told about the Gods. The fact
 that they can be communicated makes them not true mysteries, only
 secrets.
 </p><p>
 A body of teaching, practice and ritual that facilitates initiation is
 an initiatory path. Most religions start out as paths of initiation.
 Religion tends to be conservative. Initiation, however, is always
 revolutionary.
 </p><p>
 Initiation transforms a person's life, bringing inner peace, greater
 insight into the workings of fate, and awareness of the connections
 linking all things, as well as magical power. If it were a commonplace
 event, if people went through initiation as surely as they go through
 puberty, we would have a far different and better world.
 </p><p>
 Even if the circle of initiates included a significant minority of the
 population, the magical effect of such a number of altered minds on
 the world would be profound and positive. Of course, this very fact
 means that initiatory paths will be opposed by those interests, both
 human and non-human, that are opposed to positive change. The
 opposition is not really a conspiracy; it seems more than an automatic
 reaction, a law of nature.
 </p><p>
 Initiation is not an instantaneous event, but one that occurs through
 years of effort and devotion. It seems likely that there is no end to
 the process, and that the idea of there being a "fully enlightened
 being" is a peculiar Oriental fantasy. There are times, it is true,
 when revelation comes in a flash like lightning, but such moments are
 exclamation marks punctuating a story that unfolds chapter by chapter.
 </p><p>
 Many tools and methods for achieving initiation have evolved over the
 ages. Some are intellectual, aiming to expand consciousness through
 thought: Vedanta and the Qabala come to mind as among the most
 impressive. Others are ritual or devotional, such as Bhakti Yoga,
 chanting the names of the Gods, drawing down the Moon, the meditations
 of the monastics. Some are also physical: Hatha Yoga, Sufi dancing,
 some forms of the martial arts. Some aim at expanding consciousness
 directly by stretching it to its limits: meditation, Raja Yoga, guided
 visualization, vision quests. Then there is sex magic, drugs,
 drumming, austerities, the use of talismans, self-discipline, and so
 on. Most of these techniques evolved outside a pagan context, but they
 are amenable to incorporation in a pagan framework. Initiation
 rituals, of course, are another method, but they are seldom sufficient
 by themselves.
 </p><p>
 Initiates can be found in the context of any religion, including those
 least similar to Neopaganism. St. Francis of Assisi was an initiate,
 and many a Sufi and Qabalist, Buddhist and Yogi, Taoist and shaman. A
 modern Neopagan initiate has far more in common with them than with an
 illiterate, superstitious pagan of the Roman Empire, gobbling the
 flesh of sacrificed animals while contemplating how to backstab his
 competitors. All initiates of all paths have a common heart; it is
 religions that circle the periphery of the sacred that differ.
 </p><p>
 But, while Christian, Jewish, and Muslim initiates do exist, the
 established religions don't make it easy. For every illuminated
 Catholic saint, there are hundreds of burned heretics. Indeed, many
 post-Constantinian saints escaped burning themselves only by miracles
 greater than those for which they were canonized. Burning is passe
 nowadays, but condemnation for heresy is not, and thrives as well in
 most Protestant denominations. So bound about with the fetters of
 faith is the Christian that initiation is virtually impossible, except
 for their boldest and best minds.
 </p><p>
 This is no accident.
 </p><p>
 The tragedy of Christianity is that it began so well and decayed so
 quickly into such a parody of its beginnings. This is a recurring
 phenomenon. Again and again, the initiatory message has presented
 itself in some new form and met with some success, only to be hidden
 in a maze of illusion, crusted over with barriers and restrictions.
 There are always counterattacks from outside the new path, from
 established religions, but the truly effective counterattacks also
 come from within, so that what began as a bright new hope becomes a
 mere religion. The priests, the figures in authority, forge an
 instrument for the furtherance of their own authority, to which
 genuine initiation is a serious threat. The initiatory impulse is
 carefully bled into harmless channels, and all magic outside those
 channels is ruthlessly suppressed.
 </p><p>
 There is a great deal of magic in Christian monastic orders, and more
 still in Hindu and Buddhist ashrams, or wielded by wandering saddhus.
 But many of these illuminated souls, both Western and Eastern, are
 sworn to poverty, chastity and humility. Many do not reproduce,
 ensuring that, if there is a genetic component to magic, it will be
 weakened by removing its best practitioners from the gene pool. Too,
 in renouncing the world, they ensure that their spiritual insight will
 play a small role shaping events. In contrast, a few secret initiatory
 paths remain active and true to their original mission. These paths,
 which include Hermeticism, the Qabala, surviving shamanic traditions,
 and a few branches of Sufism, have made themselves nonthreatening in a
 different way. They continue to live in the world and to learn and
 teach practical as well as spiritual magic, but in such tiny numbers
 and in so furtive a fashion that they hold little promise of genuine
 large-scale transformation. There is not really anything wrong with
 this; such secret orders have acted over the centuries to preserve the
 Mysteries, not to spread them. Without them, efforts to break the
 chains on a large scale would be to no avail. But Paganism is
 different.
 </p><p>
 Neopaganism is unique--at this time, though not historically--in that it
 is a genuine initiatory path that has grown large. Moreover, in its
 diversity and flexibility, its protean and progressive nature, it
 promises to incorporate all the virtues of the other surviving paths.
 It may not be the most advanced, the most powerful, or the most
 aesthetically refined, but these characteristics can all be absorbed
 from the smaller paths that possess them, for Paganism is an
 all-gobbling magical amoeba, sucking up the myths, methods, and
 knowledge of every other path in existence. Once again, an initiatory
 path threatens to break out and make some changes in reality.
 </p><p>
 On schedule, opposition has begun to arise.
 </p><p>
 As always, some of the opposition is from the outside, but I don't
 think we need to be concerned about that. A strain of paranoia is
 built into our origin myths and traditions, and is always a greater
 danger than the persecution we fear. The external opposition has
 seldom been very effective against any path. Some right-wing
 Christians are beginning to engage in Witch-hunting of a relatively
 genteel sort, mostly involving propaganda. However, propaganda is
 legitimate (they have a right to express their opinions about what we
 do, as we have the right to speak in counterpoint). There may be more
 serious difficulties, even occasional violence, but the Burning Times
 are gone for good, barring a complete collapse of civilization. We
 have more important things to worry about within our own ranks.
 </p><p>
 The rapid increase in our numbers in the last few decades means there
 are many newcomers. Newcomers are ripe for exploitation, both
 monetarily and politically, and both have begun to occur. The first
 fills me with amusement and outrage. The second is more alarming.
 </p><p>
 There seems to be a growing desire in some quarters to commercialize
 Neopaganism and profit from it. That's only natural, but when crystal
 athames go for $1,400 and classes are taught in return for a pledge of
 a percentage of the students' income in perpetuity, somebody is
 getting fleeced. This is bad enough, but not nearly as bad as what
 might happen in reaction. Better a crowd of poorer and wiser novices,
 the hucksters filling the role of the Dweller on the Threshold, than a
 Paganism reduced from a path of initiation to a mere religion, its
 bright promise gone dull, as have so many others.
 </p><p>
 The seeds of this development lie chiefly in individuals we might call
 Pagan politicians, and in our response to them. They may not be high
 initiates or powerful magicians, but they are skillful at organizing;
 they like to strike poses in public, and they know how to work the
 media.
 </p><p>
 Sometimes they appear on television to say, "This is what Paganism is.
 This is what Witchcraft is ... ," self-appointed spokespersons for the
 entire Pagan community. Their power over the Craft may be small, but
 it could easily grow as the Craft grows, as they sink their hooks into
 more and more beginners.
 </p><p>
 An experienced initiate is unlikely to be moved by a picture on
 television, or a story in the newspaper. It is otherwise for a novice.
 When first appraising something, it is the surface one sees. And there
 are two dangers in this trend:</p>
 <dir>
 <p>
   1. Insightful, intuitive, independent people--the kind who would make
   good Witches--may be turned off by the media spectacle. (Analogy:
   What is your reaction to the words, "new age"?)
 </p><p>
   2. Those who are not repelled may develop a kind of mundane
   "Neopaganism," a mere religion, based as other religions are on
   faith, dogma, and prescribed observances, conservative (in the sense
   of resisting progress, not of voting Republican) and
   anti-initiatory. There may be points in common between it and us
   (such as an environmental ethic or "worship" [how I despise that
   word!] of a Goddess), as a baboon might wear a tuxedo, but the heart
   and soul would be gone. Anyone who sought initiation would have to
   pass the gauntlet of this other paganism first and then unlearn this
   religion to approach the new path. Few could be expected to do so.</p>
 </dir>
 <p>
 It is important to recognize these politicos for what they are. They
 are our would-be clergy who, like Christian priests, Muslim mullah and
 Jewish rabbis, would be religious leaders but, with rare exceptions,
 no initiates. Their authority would derive from knowledge of accepted
 doctrines and from political acumen, rather than spiritual awareness.
 Pagan pontiff pretenders are not necessarily malevolent, but they do
 not comprehend the purpose of initiation or the fundamental ways in
 which Paganism differs, not just from this or that religion, from all
 religions. Consequently, they do not understand that priests,
 ministers, rabbis, and so forth are not good role models for Pagan
 spiritual leaders, even if allowances are made for differing value
 systems. Paganism, as currently practiced, is not simply a different
 religion, but a different category of thing altogether.
 </p><p>
 The bishops who created the Catholic Church were not particularly evil
 men. But they were misguided, and the result of their labor was
 disastrous. Yet some movement on this road is inevitable. It is the
 fruit of growth, a sign that a path of initiation has matured into a
 serious threat to the status quo. It represents a counterattack by the
 forces of inertia.
 </p><p>
 Let's not be unduly alarmist. We are not in immediate danger, but the
 clouds can be seen on the horizon, and we need to prepare ourselves,
 and consider whether anything can be done to avoid the usual fate of
 an initiatory path at the crossroads. All our predecessors, on
 reaching this juncture, have taken the wrong turning. But we have
 advantages former initiatory paths lacked. That no one has succeeded
 up to now is not so imposing an an obstacle as it might seem.
 </p><p>
 One of our advantages is the First Amendment to the United States
 Constitution and similar provisions, in fact and tradition if not law,
 guaranteeing religious liberty in all Western democracies. It is
 literally impossible for a Pagan Catholic Church, even if one comes
 into existence, to exile or execute dissident Pagans, as was done to
 dissident Christians after the council of Nicaea. It is unlikely that
 any pagan organization, or that of any other religion, could get a
 modern Western government to do its dirty work to any significant
 degree. Overt persecution is reduced from a terror to a nuisance.
 That's no small achievement.
 </p><p>
 Another advantage is modern information technology. Communication of
 ideas is now so easy, and suppression of them so difficult, that to
 contain, channel, or eliminate the initiatory message will be harder
 than ever before, and may be impossible. Of course, the downside of
 this development is the proliferation of blatant nonsense. But I think
 that is an acceptable price. Better the truth be heard whispering
 through shouted lies and bellowed folly than that it not be heard at
 all.
 </p><p>
 The third, most subtle, and possibly the greatest advantage we have
 over our predecessors is science. By science I do not mean any
 particular bit of knowledge that has been uncovered by scientists,
 although all that is useful as well. I mean the attitudes of science.
 I mean the methods of science. Above all, I mean the vision of
 science. Thanks to science, we no longer think of all knowledge as
 being handed down to us from the past. Thanks to science, we can
 consider magic not only in its sacred and spiritual and aesthetic
 dimensions--though these are certainly important--but in its technical
 dimensions as well, and seek the laws and principles that underpin
 magic, analogous to the laws of physics that underpin technology.
 </p><p>
 And best of all--thanks to science--we are not limited to what we know
 today. We understand that even our best picture of reality is only an
 approximation, that we will have a better picture tomorrow. This gift
 promises to upset the creeping authoritarianism that has ruined so
 many paths of initiation and created so many religions.
 </p><p>
 These are potent advantages. I believe they allow us the possibility
 of success. But not the certainty. As we approach the crossroads,
 there are a number of things that need doing. Some of these steps are
 simply a matter of keeping our attitudes in the right places. Others
 involve research, development, and artistic creation. Others still
 involve magical tasks.
 </p><p>
 We need to understand that modern Paganism, though built on the past,
 is not limited by it, that we are capable of improving on our
 ancestors' wisdom--even to the extent that we can make sure that their
 wisdom is not just a product of our own romantic imagination, which in
 large measure it is. We need to recognize, once and for all (and say
 so), that our myths of origin are just that--myths. Wicca is not a
 survival from the pre-Christian past, but an eclectic/creative
 construct meant to imitate what such a survival should ideally be. Its
 resemblance, and that of Neopaganism in general, to ancient paganism
 in any of its multitude of forms is slight and ultimately beside the
 point.
 </p><p>
 We need to make these changes of mindset because they will allow us to
 take the next step, which is to expand Paganism, as a path of
 initiation, to its potential. We cannot do that as long as we are
 locked into an old model--real or romanticized. The initiatory paths of
 the past have failed. Therefore, we need something better than what
 has gone before. We can take the essentials of Neopaganism, the broad
 strokes of its mythology and ritual, as a starting point, but we must
 go beyond that start.
 </p><p>
 First, we need to penetrate beneath the level of religious symbolism
 to what might be called the physics of magic, the nuts and bolts and
 laws of nature that account for what magic does and is. Next to the
 initiatory experience itself, which can never be communicated or
 replaced by anything--that point cannot be emphasized too much or too
 often--the physics of magic would be the deepest level of
 understanding, accounting for all forms of symbolic knowledge.
 </p><p>
 Secondly, we need to improve our tool chest of spiritual methods. Much
 of the work has already been done by initiates outside Paganism. All
 we have to do is translate it and incorporate it within our own
 framework. At the same time, an expanded and improved body of poetic
 ritual would be useful.
 </p><p>
 These things have already begun to happen, but the pace should be
 accelerated. A common recognition of both the possibility and the need
 would be a valid step. We must acknowledge that yoga can meditate us
 into a corner, that the Qabala theorizes rings around us, and that any
 good shamanic lineage works magic to put us to shame. We must also
 insist that Paganism has advantages over these that should not be
 surrendered, and work to incorporate what other paths can teach us
 into our own framework.
 </p><p>
 These accomplishments would serve to strengthen and fortify the
 initiatory path of Paganism. It will need all the strength it can get
 if it is to resist turning into a religion. But there are other things
 that need doing as well, on both the communicative and magical fronts.
 </p><p>
 Those of us with active pens can communicate the idea of an initiatory
 path that lies within the mythical and ritual structure of the Pagan
 religion. There is, at present, no established Pagan doctrine or
 dogma, no established Pagan clergy, and no established Pagan pantheon,
 and this also must be made clear.
 </p><p>
 The magical side of the battle may be the most important one. Here,
 the guiding principle should be a clear visualization of what we want
 Paganism to be. Should exoteric Pagan religions grow up around the
 initiatory core, then, ideally, we would want the priests or
 priestesses of this religion to be initiates. But this may not be
 practicable. First, many of us are unsuited for (or uninterested in)
 the role of ministering to those who are unready for initiation.
 Second, there may be too many newcomers to Paganism (by some estimates
 the fastest-growing religion in North America) and too few initiates.
 </p><p>
 I believe we could agree on two goals. A viable and visible initiatory
 tradition must be maintained within the religion, and no exoteric
 priesthood must be allowed to gain preeminence over the path. To those
 ends, then, the following magical workings are suggested.
 </p><p>
 Weave the Net: There is a tenuous telepathic link among all initiates.
 This can be invoked as part of the opening of any major magical work,
 which will strengthen both the work and the net. Some covens and
 individuals already do this. Reach out the heart's fiery hand and feel
 the love of one another, both within the coven and beyond it, setting
 aside the quarrels of the mind, poles of a tipi each supporting each,
 moving faster and faster circles made of love. In this way, a
 synergistic entity, a collective consciousness, may be generated,
 incorporating all our diversity--yet stronger than any of us alone.
 This consciousness can be invoked like any deity, and can be a guide
 and an empowerment. We can give it names; there will be private names
 known to individual covens or solitaries, but among us all the name is
 Love.
 </p><p>
 Shine like a Beacon: Another working, which I feel is appropriate to a
 Full Moon ritual, is one to avoid the light-under-a-bushel syndrome,
 to illuminate all minds equipped with eyes to see. The metaphor of a
 lighthouse beacon seems appropriate; we can visualize this light
 shining brightly, overpowering any attempt to hide it, so that truth
 cannot be hidden from those able to understand it, initiation cannot
 be denied to those capable of attaining it.
 </p><p>
 Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom: Or, divide and rule. Assume that a
 mundane Paganism must arise; above all we must not allow any one sect
 or denomination of the Pagan religion to achieve preeminence over the
 others. It doesn't matter how much we like or dislike what the leaders
 of this or that sect are saying. Any Pagan doctrine will always be
 wrong, even if it's right, because initiation cannot be conveyed in
 words or symbols. We can, through our magic, encourage diversity and
 creativity in the ranks of newcomers and non-initiate leaders,
 preferring chaos to conformity, and subtly bend the path of discourse
 so that it leads towards initiation rather than away from it. We must
 avoid the temptation to encourage a unified, strong Paganism, and that
 temptation will arise! A fractious, splintered, disorganized, and
 confusingly multi-headed Paganism may be somewhat embarrassing when it
 appears on network news or in Time magazine. But if the initiatory
 tradition is clearly visible within, we will be far better served by
 chaos than by an order that serves its own purposes and not ours.
 </p><p>
 I believe--certainly, I hope--that these steps can preserve the Neopagan
 path of initiation, prevent its burial under the mantle of religion,
 and permit what has never before happened: genuine, large-scale,
 beyond-the-point-of-no-return breakout of the Mysteries, leading to
 the transformation of human culture and this planet--assuming, of
 course, that civilization survives the crisis of the coming years.
