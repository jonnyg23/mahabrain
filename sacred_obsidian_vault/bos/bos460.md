           blue...
           (1-6,HPS) perimeter]

           boot.

           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) that so little life was lost due to Hurricane

           the...
           (1-6,HPS) Lady tonight.

           them?

           bright with...
           (1-6,HP) the warmth of love.
           (1-6,HP) [I hand the candle to the HPS]
           (1-6,HPS) [HPS carves a pentagram in the candle and says]
           (1-6,HPS) With love and trust I charge this candle to burn bright and
           long. It...
           (1-6,HPS) is to represent the Lady, the moon, and of course the Lord.

           saying]
           (1-6,HPS) Now, with all of us across the distances, if you have a
           candle,...
           (1-6,HPS) please do as I did.  We shall wait...
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) blessed be

           those...
           (1-6,HPS) without should visualize one and procede along also.  The
           physical...
           (1-6,HPS) world NEVER INHIBITS the realm we are in now.
           (1-6,HPS) I want everyone to look into the flame of your candle.  Our
           computer...
           (1-6,HPS) desk is serving as an altar tonight, to make it a bit less
           hectic....
           (1-6,HPS) &lt;g&gt;.  Anyhow, look into the flame and see the moon.  So
           bright and...
           (1-6,HPS) full, this is the moon in your heart.
           (1-6,HP) Now look again into the flame of your candle, and see your-
           self in...
 
 
 
                                                                             2168
 
           (1-6,HP) that flame.  See your life energy as it really is.  The moon
           is your...
           (1-6,HP) heart, the flame, and you life energy.  It is one!
           (1-6,HPS) Let us pause for a moment and let yourself be one with the
           flame,...
           (1-6,HPS) the moon, and the Goddess.  Feel the warmth.  Feel the love.
           (1-6,HPS) Know the Goddess.
           (1-6,HPS) As the candle burns, remember not what was said, but remem-
           ber what
           (1-6,HPS) was done and felt.  You and the Goddess are one.
           (1-6,HP) For those with candles, let them burn till gone.  For those
           without,...
           (1-6,HP) let them burn in your mind till dawn.  For to snuff a flame
           before...
           (1-6,HP) it's time really pisses-off the fire faeries!
           (1-6,HP) Blessed Be!
           (1-6,HPS) So Mote It Be!
 
           (1-6,HP) [Speaking to the HPS]
           (1-6,HP) My Lady.  My Love. Does thou wish at this time to become one
           with...
           (1-6,HP) the Goddess?
           (1-6,HPS) Yes, I do.
           (1-6,HP) So Be It!
           (1-6,HP) [I raise my athame and point it towards the HPS while saying]
           (1-6,HP) My Lady, Tis I, once again, calling upon thee with the
           request for...
           (1-6,HP) thou to join us now in this, thy high priestess.  Lady of

           (1-6,HP) thee.  Our trust resides in thee.  JOIN US NOW!
 
           (1-6,HP) [Now for the online tricky part, I'll invoke the HPS and then
           type...
           (1-6,HP) her response, maybe it'll work &lt;g&gt;]
           (1-6,HPS) [Breathing deepens]
           (1-6,HPS) She weeps...  for the destruction and the pain, for she
           knows it is...
           (1-6,HPS) great.  &lt;sigh&gt; But all  is how it should be.  Know that from
           death...
           (1-6,HPS) comes rebirth...  And although much time is passing, we will
           be...
           (1-6,HPS) whole again.  A large green ball...  Greg...  See a large
           green ball...
           (1-4,Greg) OK
           (1-6,HPS) in front of you...  &lt;shaking head&gt; Greener, brighter... 
           Not...
 
 
 
                                                                             2169
 
           (1-6,HPS) Put your love inside and through me it shall go to your
           mother......
           (1-6,HPS) Your energies will double...
           (1-6,HPS) &lt;Deep breath&gt;
           (1-6,HPS) Good color greg...
           (1-6,HPS) &lt;Long deep breathing&gt;
           (1-6,HPS) It is done. It has been sent.
           (1-6,HPS) &lt;We're back!  Pardon us for a second while we do a good
           grounding...
           (1-6,HPS) hug&gt;
 
           (1-6,HP) Well, ...  Wow.
           (1-6,HP) Let's do a quick cakes and wine (or Ale), OK?
           (1-4,Greg) Sounds wonderful
           (1-9,Lars) ook...
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) sounds good to me!
           (1-4,Greg) I have doughnuts and Ale
           (1-6,HPS &amp; HP) Just got ours too!  Let's do it!
           (1-6,HPS &amp; HP) [HP and HPS face each other (OK Nan, get on the desk)]
           (1-6,HPS &amp; HP) [HPS hold the chalace, and HP pours the (oops) already
           poured ale...
           (1-6,HPS &amp; HP) into the chalace, and says]
           (1-6,HP) Let me fill your cup, as you my lady have filled my heart.
           (1-9,Lars) I want to thank you for this experience...A toast!
           (1-6,HPS) Like the cup and the wine, we are one wet seperate.
           (1-6,HPS) [HPS picks up the athame, dips it in the chalace]
           (1-6,HPS) Blessed be my lord!
           (1-6,HPS) [HPS sprinkles the cakes with the Ale from her Athame and
           says]
           (1-6,HPS) Blessings be upon these grains of life, sacred to the
           Goddess.
           (1-6,HPS) [She offers a piece to me (HP), and now I give her one.]
           (1-6,HPS) [HP now quaffs a bit of ale and passes it to the HPS]
           (1-6,HPS) Shadow Hawk, have some and pass it on!
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) (raising chalace)
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) (drinking a sip, with eyes raised to the moon
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) passing it on)
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) Jehana, will you chare the Chalice of Life with me?
           (1-7,Jehana Silverwing) Yes, I shall, shadow Hawk. &lt;takes chalice&gt;
           (1-7,Jehana Silverwing) &lt;drinks a sip; libates a portion&gt;
           (1-6,HP) Now that the celebration is almost through,
           (1-7,Jehana Silverwing) passes to Greg.
           (1-6,HP) And I would like to request of you,
           (1-4,Greg) &lt;taking chalice&gt;
           (1-4,Greg) Brightest Blessings to all of us and eryone who was unable
           to join us tonight.
           (1-6,HP) Oops...   Sorry to butt in on the party, Pass that chalace,
           we are...
           (1-6,HP) still in celebration mode, yes?
           (1-4,Greg) &lt;taking sip, and passing to Lars&gt;
           (1-9,Lars) Thankful for the love shared here (dizzy)...!
 
           (1-6,HP) Pass that on to granny O.
           (1-9,Lars) Big Gulp!!!
           (1-3,Annina) Greetings all, sorry I'm late.
 
 
 
                                                                             2170
 
           (1-9,Lars) &lt;passing chalice to Annina&gt;
           (1-3,Annina) &lt;taking a sip&gt;
           (1-3,Annina) &lt;smiles all around&gt;
           (1-6,HP) Blessed be Annina!
           (1-3,Annina) Blessed be to all!
           (1-6,HP) OK, can we continue, still a bit to do before we close...
           (1-4,Greg) Has everyone had cakes and wine?
           (1-7,Jehana Silverwing) yes.
           (1-3,Annina) &lt;taking a bite of cake&gt; Yes, thanks. :-)
           (1-6,Ted &amp; Nanette) yes.
           (1-4,Greg) Lets continue
 
           (1-6,HP) Now the celebration is almost through,
           (1-6,HP) And I would like to request of you,
           (1-6,HP) Work with me to make the sky blue.
           (1-6,HPS) The earth is our mother
           (1-6,HPS) From the start she has been there for us
           (1-6,HPS) And at the end she will remain
           (1-6,HP) As we care for each other in this physical world
           (1-6,HP) So must we care for our mother earth
           (1-6,HP) For now is a time with smoky air
           (1-6,HP)     now is a time with oceans of oil
           (1-6,HP)     now is a time with soil of garbage
           (1-6,HPS) Magic is in me.  Magic is in you.
           (1-6,HPS) Let us spend just a minute and think
           (1-6,HPS) For collective thoughts is the magic for all
           (1-6,HPS) Think and create.  For in our power lies enough to change
           (1-6,HPS) that which others deem a lost cause.
           (1-6,HPS) Think now, one and all, about the beautiful mother.  Healthy
           and...
           (1-6,HPS) happy and free from the diseases we have previously given
           her....
           (1-6,HPS) Let's make the magic happen.  See the mountains in the
           crystal clear...
           (1-6,HPS) sky.  See the clean oceans sparkling blue.  See her beauty
           under the...
           (1-6,HPS) full moon light.  Think...
           (1-6,HP) So Mote It Be!
 
           (1-6,HP) Greg, it was a bit unusual to see magic for you mom appearing
           in the...
           (1-6,HP) drawing down.  I've been under the belief that once magic is
           done is...
           (1-6,HP) should be left alone.  For any doubt will destroy the res-
           ults....
           (1-6,HP) Should we work more magic for her now, or should we call it
           done?...
           (1-6,HP) It's your call.
           (1-4,Greg) What we've worked felt pretty powerful...
           (1-4,Greg) I think it will do, my mother doesn't exactly know I asked
           for this.
           (1-6,HP) Well then, Thought of her will remain clear in all of us. 
           Thoughts...
           (1-6,HP) of her happy and healthy.  It is done.
           (1-4,Greg) Blessed Be!
 
 
 
                                                                             2171
 
           (1-6,HP) Does anyone want any other collective magic to be done, now
           is the...
           (1-6,HP) time.
           (1-3,Annina) I'd like you all to remember my husband's and my busin-
           ess. We are starting
           (1-3,Annina) it this week on a virtual shoestring as our venture
           capital deal fell through.
           (1-3,Annina) Your thoughts and meditations in your rituals would be
           very much appreciated.
           (1-6,HP) What is the business and where?  What are your goals?  I
           learned...
           (1-6,HP) long ago not to ask for vague things, they sneak up and bite
           you in...
           (1-6,HP) the butt.  That's an experience Loki taught me.
           (1-3,Annina) The business is a point of sales computer systems com-
           pany. We're in
           (1-3,Annina) Pensacola, Florida (on the Gulf Coast near Mobile, Ala.)
           (1-3,Annina) Our goals are to make 8 sales per month for the first 90
           days.
           (1-6,HP) Not too bad.
           (1-3,Annina) That will give us the capital to get things underway with
           an office and
           (1-3,Annina) a demo system.
           (1-6,HP) Everyone here please visualize Annina's company selling 30
           sales by...
           (1-3,Annina) We're running it out of our home at the moment. It's
           scary, but we KNOW
           (1-3,Annina) the business is there and we've done our homework and
           made the connections.
           (1-6,HP) the end of 90 days.  Envision happiness and of course wealth
           for...
           (1-6,HP) Annina and her husband.  From this thought in your heart turn
           it to...
           (1-6,HP) a color and send it to her now.
           (1-6,HP) Well Annina, I hope I didn't zap you.  In my vision I saw you
           so...
           (1-6,HP) busy after 60 days that you needed to hire help to handle all
           the...
           (1-3,Annina) WOW!! Green and pink and purple! Mostly green though. :-)
           (1-6,HP) work.  You will be successful.  As long as you remember that
           which...
           (1-6,HP) you want.
           (1-6,HPS) Great!
           (1-3,Annina) I definitely felt your strength!! Many thanks to all!
           (1-6,HP) Can we close or does anyone have naything else to add?
           (1-4,Greg) Best of blessings to you, Aninna, and your Husband
           (1-3,Annina) Thank you, Greg, and brightest blessings to you and your
           mother.
           (1-4,Greg) Many thanx!
           (1-6,HP) So be it!  Let us close this circle!
           (1-5,Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be!

           (1-6,HPS) [I will close this online circle, Starting in the East and
           working...
           (1-6,HPS) counter-clockwise with athame pointed to the circle border,
           I say]

           (1-6,HPS) As our blue light becomes a dim hue,
           (1-6,HPS) We have been protected, no harm due.
