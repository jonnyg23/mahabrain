                                      Prosperity Spell 
 
                                       Rowan Moonstone 
 
           The following is a quarterly prosperity spell given to me by Angel and
           Gracie,  my first two FamTrad teachers.  I have no idea where they got
           it, but I can  tell you that it DOES work.  I"ve used it for years and
           it never fails to  bring me some unlooked for money.  I find that I've
           overpaid a bill, or an old  debt which  I had written off as uncollec-
           tible gets repaid,  I find a $20 on  the  sidewalk, etc.    Try it, it
           works!
 
           The spell is to  begin at one  minute past midnight  SUN TIME (I  HATE
           daylight savings  time when I  do this.  Means  1AM!) on the  night of
           April 30 (May 1), July 31 (Aug 1), Oct 31 (Nov. 1) and Jan 31 (Feb  1)
           In other words, on the first minute of the cross quarter day.
 
           You will need the following:
 
           1 gold candle
           6 green candles  
           9 white candles
           Pine oil for anointing candles
           salt
 
           All candles  must be dressed with  pine oil and then  arranged as fol-
           lows:
 
           gold candle in the center
           green candles in a circle around gold candle
           white candles in a circle around green candles.
 
 
           At one minute past midnight on  the appointed day, trace a salt circle
           around the outermost circle  of candles, light the gold  candle first,
           then  the green candles, moving deosil, then the white candles, moving
           deosil.   Circle  the altar  three times,  chanting "Orbiting  Jupiter
           trine the sun, bring  money on the run."   Do the chant 3  times also.
           Sit  quietly  for a  few minutes  and  visualize your  monetary NEEDS.
           (needs, not desires).  The SNUFF (do not blow or pinch) the candles in
           reverse order.
 
           That's it.  That's all there is to it and it works beautifully.  Since
           Lammas  is coming up, thought  I'd post it for everyone  to see.  I've
           got a bunch more stuff from these two ladies if  anyone is interested.
           They  worked a  great deal   with  Archangels and  I suspect  a strong
           Kabalistic crossover in there  somewhere.  But the spells  and rituals
           DO work quite nicely.
