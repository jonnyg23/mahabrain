           *********** The Religion Forum  10/28/92 22:50:38 
            
           HPS  | Relax...  Let your body and mind be at ease... Breathe 
                | gently; regularly... 
                | This is the time of Inward turning, of saying goodbye to 
                | our Dead. 
                | We have descended into the night, and the veil between the
                | worlds is at it's thinnest. 
                | The Sun King has become the Lord of Shadows, sailing West:
                | We follow Him into the dark. 
                | Life declines; the season of barrenness is on us, yet we 
                | give thanks for that which we have reaped and gathered. 
                | We meet to turn the Wheel and weave the cord of life 
                | that will sustain us through the dark. 
                | I take these Creatures of Earth and Water, and do Cleanse
                | and consecrate them to bring into this Circle,
                | to do the Lady's Will. 
                | I purify this sacred space in the Lady's Name. 
 
           HP   | I take these creatures of Air and Fire and do Cleanse and 
                | consecrate them to bring into this Circle to do the Lady's
                | Will.  I do cleanse and consecrate this Circle in our 
                | Lady's Name, to do the Lady's Will! 
                 
           HPS  | I cast this Circle... 
                | a glowing blue orb... 
                | glowing, growing... 
                | surrounding all of us... 
                | surrounding us in protective blue-white light... 
                | expanding to touch all of us... 
                | connect us into the web... 
                | a place that is not a place, a place which is all
                | places... 
                | a time which is not a time, a time which is all times... 
                | connect us into the web . 
                | The Circle is Cast. 
 
           HP   | (facing the West, feeling the essense of Water rush
                     through me) 
                | (hearing the sound in the blood of my veins) 
                | Hail Guardians of the Watchtowers of the West, Spirits of 
                | Water... 
                | I call upon you to come this night 
                | and attend this our Lady's Rite... 
                | Guard us and Guide us in this request 
                | that we might tonight... 
                | Do the work by Her great Light.

                | ritual tonight 
                | You, the force from which all life springs, 
                | Hold us in your heart through the winter

                | That we may be re-born with you at Beltaine 
                | Empty us of fears so that we may be strong 
                | Strong in the Goddess' light to do her work 
 
           nise nekheba: facing the east I call upon the powers of the
                | air, the winds to join our 
                | sacred circle.  Come obatala, Olofi, and chango, ancient 
                | orishas of the east 
                | come and bless us 
                | uplift us 
                | caress us with your powerful, forceful breeze 
                | and guard us through the Spring. 
                | go ahead south 
 
           Frodo: Spirits of the South Remember. 
                | Spirits of the South, hear my call... 
                | Spirits of the South, Remember. 
                | Spirits of the South, you are here. 
                | South. 
                | Red. Fire. 
                | The heat of summer. 
                | The passion of adolescence. 
                | Feel the South. 
 
           HP   | (turning to HPS) 
                | Blessed Be thy feet, that walk in the Way of the Wise 
                | Blessed Be thy knees, that kneel at the sacred altar 
                | Blessed Be thy Womb, without which we would not be 
                | Blessed be thy Breasts, formed in Beauty 
                | Blessed be thy Lips that shall speak the Sacred words 
                | Blessed be thy Eyes, that they shall see the truth 
                | and Blessed be thy Mind, that it shall know and
                | understand. 
                | Gracious Goddess, Holy Maiden, Mother, and now, Crone... 
                | Descend upon this thy Priestess, we do humbly beg... 
                | Join us tonight in your circle as we assemble to once
                | more... 
                | Spin the Wheel of Life and Death.  Great Goddess, mother
                | of us all, you have brought us to life, and you walk with
                | us to Death's Door and beyond. 
                | Goddess of Life and Goddess of Death, Cerridwyn, I call
                | you Home! 
                | (kneeling) 
 
           Cerridwyn: (greets HP, looks upon him) 
                | By the Flame that burneth bright O' Horned One! 
                | We call thy name into the night, O' Ancient One!
                | Thee we invoke, by the moon-lit sea, by the standing stone
                | and the twisted tree. 
                | Thee we invoke, where gather thine own, by the nameless 
                | shrine forgotten and alone. 
                | Come where the round of tdance is Trod. 
                | Horn and Hoof of the Goatfoot God! 
                | By moon-lit meadows on dusky hill, when the haunted wood
                | is hushed and still. 
 
 
 
                                                                             2181
 
                | Come to the charm of the chanted prayer. 
                | As the moon bewitches the midnight air, evoke thy powers, 
                | that potent bide. 
                | In shining stream and the secret tide, in fiery flame by 
                | starlight pale, in Shadowy host that rides the gale, and
                | by the fern-brakes fairy-haunted of forest wild and woods 
                | enchanted. 
                | Come!  O' Come! 
                | To the heart-beat's drum! 
                | When the broad white moon is climbing slow. 
                | Through the stars to the heaven's height. 
                | We hear thy hoofs on the wind of night! 
                | As black tree-branches shake and sigh, 
                | By Joy and terror we know thee nigh, 
                | We speak the spell thy power unlocks, 
                | At Solstice, Sabbat, and Equinox. 
                | Word of Virtue the veil to rend, 
                | From Primal Dawn to the wide World's end, 
                | Since time began, the blessings of Pan 
                | Blessed be in strength and love, 
                | Blessed be, wher'ere we rove, 
                | Vision fade not from our eyes 
                | Of the Pagan Paradise. 
                | Past the gates of Death and Birth, 
                | Our inheritance of Earth. 
                | From our soul the song of Spring 
                | Fade not in our wandering, 
                | Our life is one, 
                | By blackest night or the noonday Sun. 
                | Eldest of Gods on thee we call, 
                | Blessing be on thy Creatures all. 
                | I call upon thee, O' Ancient Horned One 
                | Who art the Comforter and the Consoler of Men 
                | I call upon thee, O' Great God of the Witches. 
                | Ruler of the Sabbat, Lord of the Wild Woods, 
                | I call upon thee, for I am thy Lady. 
                | Come out of the North upon the back of the Winds. 
                | And join the Lady Cerridwin at this Holy Sabbat/Esbat. 
                | I call thee by thy most ancient name Cernunnos. 
                | Descend upon this thy Circle NOW! 
                | We welcome thee Home! 
                | We welcome thee, Cernunnos! 
                
           Cernunnos: I am here. 
                | My Children call, from woods and from stream    
                | from fields fair and snow crested mountains. 
                | Once more the Wheel of Life has turned, the Gods of Spring
 
                | and Summer are gone.  Now's the time of the long night... 
                | and my white cloak spreads forth upon the land. 
                | Breath shoots steaming into the night, moonlight glints
                | off shining horn. 
                | Strength answers strength as I bugle my challenge... 
                | Calling you to me I bring you nigh 
                | Walk with me a while, 
 
 
 
                                                                             2182
 
                | and dance the dance of Life awhile. 
 
           Cerridwyn: It is Samhain... 
                | It is the year's ending. 
                | The crops have all been gathered in, 
                | those few remaining on the vines and stalks allowed to
                | seed next year's crops. 
                | It is Samhain. 
                | It is the year's ending. 
                | It is time to take new stock of ourselves 
                | It is time to allow our roots to grow quietly, 
                | deep and strong. 
                | The year's ending. 
                | The new year's beginning 
                | signified in that ending. 
                | Silence.

                | around you, 
                | with point facing West, and the ties of the past year

                | Look around you, see the threads of Life and Death that 
                | connect you with the world.

                | Seed becomes fruit; fruit becomes seed. 
                | In birth, we die; on death, we feed.
                | Know Me, and be free of all fear.  For My womb 
                | is the Cauldron of Rebirth, 
                | in Me, the Circle is ever Turning."

                | you, and the love that you have for us. 
 
           Cerridwyn: Hunter, you who trod the paths of the Wild and
                | untamed, I thank you for your presence here tonight.
