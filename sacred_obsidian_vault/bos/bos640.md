                       ADF BASIC RITUAL NUMBER ONE 
               by P.E.I. Bonewits, Sally Eaton and others
 
 Procession, lead by D1 and D2:
 
     D1: Ta muid anseo leis na Deithe a adhradh.
     D2: We are here to honor the Gods.
     D1: A Dheithe, an Airde, a Thabharthoiri ar Bheatha - eistigi
     agus freagairt orainn!
     D2: O Gods, High Ones, Givers of Life - hear and answer us!
 
 Processional song:
 
     We come from the mountains,
     Living in the mountains,
     Turn the world around.
 
     We come from the oceans,
     Living in the oceans,
     Turn the world around.
 
     We come from the fire,
     Living in the fire,
     Turn the world around.
 
     We come from the breezes,
     Living in the breezes,
     Turn the world around.
 
 Settling song:
 
     She changes everything she touches,
     And everything she touches changes.
 
 
 Tree Meditation:
 
     When e'er we stand in a sacred place
     Beneath the Sun's or Moon's bright face,
     In a circle's rim or shady grove,
     Our spirits go to the Gods we love.
 
     Let all our minds go clear and free,
     and form the image of a treee,
     A youthful sapling of the glade,
     Whose budding branches cast no shade.
 
     Around this tender, supple youth,
     Are seen its sturdy forbearers growth,
     Those forest Elders strong and wise,
     Who nurture those of lesser size.
 
     So close your eyes, and in your mind
     Become one of the spirit kind.
     Cast off your cares and disbelief,
     and enter tree from root to leaf.
 
 
 3089
 
     Relax and breathe and center will,
     Then let the peace within you swell
     Until it is a thing profound.
     Now send it deep in the ground.
 
     In every little tender root
     Feel water flow, and and then transmute;
     The sap will flow through ever vein,
     Our links to our ancestors regain.
 
     Now let the sap rise in a flood,
     And race to every branch and bud;
     Each branch extend into the air,
     Each leaf unfold in green so fair.
 
     The gentle zephers toss each bough,
     And to you calming breaths endow,
     While rays of golden summer light
     Give warmth and lend their power's might.
 
     Let water rise and fire descend,
     And lively air the branches bend;
     Thus firmly planted in the Earth,
     The elements give us rebirth.
 
     Now let the green entwine,
     And form our sacred grove devine.
     With branch and root our circle form,
     And magic from mundane transform.
 
     We all are rooted just the same,
     We feel the same supernal flame,
     We drink the water free to all,
     We hear the gentle airy call.
 
     Now let us feel our spirits surge,
     And into one great spirit merge
     To let the Lord and Lady know
     That we are ready below.
 
     And let us all link hand to hand,
     Before all of the gods we stand,
     And in this hallowed space we start
     To show all that is in our heart.

 3095
 
 Reversing the Tree meditation:
 
     Our sacred grove the Gods do love,
     The Earth beneath, the sky above,
     But now this ritual must end,
     Toward our home and hearthstone fend.
 
     Again we cleat our mind and heart;
     The branches shrink and pull apart.
     The roots untie and backward turn,
     And spirit fire less brightly burns.
 
     Let water sink, let fire go,
     Let gentle zephers homeward flow,
     And as if in a cleansing rain
     Become a single tree again.
 
     Then from this solitary tree
     Your soul breaks loose, a being free.
     Your body calls, your spirit flies,
     Returns, you slowly open your eyes.
 
 
 Libation:
 
         D1: To thee we return this portion of thy bounty, o NAME our
         Mother, even as we must someday return unto thee.
 
 Final Benediction:
 
         D1: Let us go out into the world,  secure in the knowledge that
         our sacrifices have pleased the Gods and Goddesses, and that we
         go forth upon the Earth under their protection.
 
     D2: We have finished this ceremony!
     D1: So be it!
     All: Biodh se!
 
 
 Recessional song/chant: Walk with Wisdom
 
     Walk with wisdom
         from this hallowed place.
     Walk not in sorrow,
         our roots shall ere embrace.
     May Strength be your brother,
         and Honor be your friend.
     and Luck be your lover until we meet again.
