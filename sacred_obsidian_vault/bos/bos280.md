           ** MAGICK 8 -- HEALING AND BANISHING ** 
 
            
 
                           Psychic or spiritual healingis a human potentialwe all
 
           possess.  Some people  are  especially good  at this.  It  is probably
 
           easier to heal someone else by occult means than yourself. In addition
 
           to healing in the presence of the person, there is 'absent healing' in
 
           which the healing 
 
           occurs  at a  distance.  Note that  there are  some who  maintain that
 
           influence on another person without his specific knowledge and permis-
 
           sion (yes, even  in healing and helping) is black  magick. (After all,
 
           everybody is living according to his own true will, so that healing or
 
           helping someone without permission is affecting  his will). This means
 
           it is important to tell the person  what you are planning to do and to
 
           ask his permission. The theory of psychic healing is that sickness  is
 
           characterized (although  not necessarily  caused) by a  deficiency and
 
           imbalance of vital  energy. Psychic healing transfers  energy from the
 
           healer to the  sick to repair and rebalance his  energies. If an inept
 
           healer overdoes the  process, or if he doesn't take  the precaution to
 
           'disconnect' himself afterwards, he may find himself 
 
 
                                            1348
 
 
           becoming  sick due  to  energy drain  and a  linkage  to his  subject.
 
           Similarly, the healer should always be in a good state of health or he
 
           could unintentionally transfer his illness to the subject.

                           Thebasicmethods ofpsychichealingare: 1)creativevisual-
 
           ization, 2) prayer,  3) ritual. Creative visualization  is one of  the
 
           easiest techniques. Mild illness may  yield to only one or  two treat-
 
           ments; serious  ills will require  many treatments over  time. Psychic
 
           healing should always  be combined with medical care and treatment. It
 
           does not replace 
 
           doctors, medicine,  or hospitals, since different  levels (worlds) are
 
           involved.  In creative  visualization, we  visualize the  person being
 
           well. It may be helpful to utilize the appropriate color from the aura
 
           chart (such as bright apple-green, rose pink, or white) sent as a beam
 
           to the person  or as a  cloud surrounding him.  This technique can  be
 
           extended to include a simple kind of yoga in which we feel energy sent
 
           as we  exhale explosively; the  energy sent either  via the  breath or
 
           from one of the chakras such as the solar plexus.  Sometimes in absent
 
           healing it  is helpful  to arrange  a time  for treatment  in advance,
 
           asking your subject to be in a receptive state of mind and to sit back
 
           and close his eyes. 
 
            
 
           THE BANISHING RITUAL 
 
            
 
                           Oneofthemost basicanduseful ceremonialritualsof magick
 
           is called the *banishing ritual*, or lesser ritual of the pentagram. A
 
           pentagram (or pentacle) is a five-pointed  star with the point up. The
 
 
 
 
                                            1350
 
 
           banishing ritual is helpful in psychic protection and healing since it
 
           forms a protective barrier against malevolent forces. The psychic 
 
           barrier it  creates can  be made  to permit entry  of desired  (const-
 
           ructive) forces and the exclusion of negative ones.  Thus, the banish-
 
           ing ritual is an essential first step in almost any formal full magick
 
           ceremony.  The ritual  requires that  you use  a magical  implement or
 
           "weapon", such as a 
 
           ceremonial  knife, wand, or simply point  your index finger, to "draw"
 
           the pentagram in the air  at each of the cardinal points  (four direc-
 
           tions). Also, you  will be chanting ('vibrating') some Hebrew names of
 
           God.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1351
 
 
                           Holdingyour magicalweaponand facingeast,extend yourarm
 
           out straight in front  of you. In  this ritual you  will use the  full
 
           sweep of  your arm to draw the pentagram in  the air. Follow the desc-
 
           ription below by beginning at the lower left and sweeping your magical
 
           weapon up toward the 
 
           right, etc. as  shown. Do not  bend your  arm at the  wrist or  elbow.
 
           While you do  this, visualize  the lines  and eventually  the star  as
 
           vibrant white, floating  in the space before you.   You are projecting
 
           energy to  do this, and the  result will be a  gleaming 5-pointed star
 
           floating in  the east; visualize this  as vividly as you  can. Now you
 
           will energize it further 
 
           by piercing  the center of it  with your magical weapon  and vibrating
 
           (speaking  slowly in  a  slightly lower  than normal  pitch, remember)
 
           "Yod-He-Vau-He". 
 
            
 
           ============================================= 
 
                   -- DESCRIPTION -- 
 
            
 
           Approximate points on a round clock face -- 
 
           1. Begin at 7:30 position. 
 
           2. Point to 12 oclock position.  
 
           3. Point to 4:30 position. 
 
           4. Point to 10:30 position. 
 
           5. Point to 2:30 position. 
 
 
                                            1352
 
 
           6. Return to 7:30 position.] 
 
            
 
           ============================================= 
 
            
 
                           Thenturn slowlytothe nextcardinal pointinsequence, and
 
           as you do  so, with your arm still extended in front of you, visualize
 
           a white line connecting around to the  cardinal point. Trace a similar
 
           pentagram with the appropriate words and following the same procedure:
 
                   South -- Adonai Tzaboath 
 
                   West  -- Eh-Ei-He 
 
                   North -- Agla. 
 
           Now complete  the white line drawn  back to the center  of the eastern
 
           pentagram. Note that the cardinal points must be followed  in a clock-
 
           wise order, and the pentagram must be drawn in the manner illustrated;
 
           to do otherwise would change the function of the ritual. The result of
 
           all  this should be a large  bright white pentagram visualized hanging
 
           in mid-air 
 
           at each  of the four directions,  all tied together by  a bright white
 
           line. You could  now, for example, visualize the pentagrams moving out
 
           to the circumference of your home, thereby protecting all within. 
 
 
 
                           Thereisalsoa somewhatsimplifiedversion ofthisritual in
 
           which the pentagram is traced only once overhead and then is energized
 
           with one of the four names, such as "Eh-Ei-He". Oftentimes the simpli-
 
 
                                            1353
 
 
           fied  version is  sufficient,  but naturally  the effect  of  the full
 
           version is more 
 
           complete.  
 
 
 
                           One ofthe primaryusesof thisritual istoward offpsychic
 
           attack --  that  is, when  another is  (consciously or  unconsciously)
 
           attempting to  harm you, cause  sickness, accidents, bad  dreams, emo-
 
           tional  upset, or  to force  you  to do  something against  your will.
 
           Fortunately this doesn't  happen very often. The world of the magician
 
           is fairly safe for the  pure of heart. Psychic attack usually  depends
 
           upon vulnerabilities.  If you are  not vulnerable  you are safe.  Thus
 
           unificaition with the  true will is the  greatest protection possible.
 
           And the use of the banishing ritual is never hurtful. You can even use
 
           it to hold off negative aspects of 
 
           yourself.  
 
                           Otherformsofprotection sometimeshelpful(depending upon
 
           one's model) are recitation of the 'Lord's Prayer', the 23rd, and 91st
 
           Psalms.

           ** MAGICK 9 -- ASTRAL PROJECTION ** 
 
            
 
                           Astral projection (OOBE,out of thebody experience) isa
 
           popular  area of occult literature; for  traveling to see other worlds
 
           and places  while  the physical  body  sleeps or  is entranced  is  an
 
           exciting  notion. Astral projection is not dangerous. It is as safe as
 
           sleeping.  Most  dreams are  probably unconscious  astral projections,
 
           anyway. Although there has 
 
           been  quite a  bit written on  the subject, astral  projection is dif-
 
           ficult for many people. The main  difficulty is the tendency to forget
 
           dream  consciousness  upon   awakening.  Accordingly,  the  successful
 
           practice of astral projection requires work. 
 
 
 
                           Modernpsychologydiscounts theideaofactual OOBE(thatthe
 
           spirit  temporarily vacates the physical body).   However, the idea is
 
           very ancient. The Tibetans have an entire system  of yoga (dream yoga)
 
           based upon astral  projection. And here we  have an important  assump-
 
           tion: you are involved  in an OOBE (at least to a degree) whenever you
 
           dream. What  sets it apart from a full OOBE is your hazy consciousness
 
 
                                            1356
 
 
           during the experience  and poor recall afterwards.  Many people forget
 
           most of their dreams completely. Learning astral projection requires a
 
           kind of inner mental clarity and alertness. 
 
 
 
                           Dreamsare adoor to thesubconscious whichcan beused for
 
           psychological  and spiritual insight,  and sometimes for precognition.
 
           Dream  content is  influenced by  external sounds and  sensations. For
 
           example, a loud external noise (such as a train) will likely appear in
 
           your dream (if it doesn't wake you up!). Dreams are also influenced by
 
           events of the previous day, by  your moods, and by suggestion.  Every-
 
           one  normally dreams 4 or  5 times a night (about  every 2 hours). The
 
           longest dreams  occur in the  morning. Everyone  dreams. You are  more
 
           likely to remember  the details of your dream when  you first wake up.
 
           By keeping a dream diary  you will improve dream recall.  Have writing
 
           equipment or  a tape recorder at your bedside for this purpose; also a
 
           light which isn't too bright. Suggest to yourself several times before
 
           you go to sleep, "I will  awaken with the knowledge of a  dream." Then
 
           when you do awaken, move quietly (sometimes 
 
           just turning over  drives the idea away).  Remember first, then  write
 
           the dream down, and then add as many details as possible. The next day
 
           check for objective facts and expand if you  can (by remembering 'what
 
           happened before that'). Once you start remembering your dreams in this
 
           way, it will become easier to do so. (If you are unsuccessful at this,
 
           and  *really* want  to  remember your  dreams, you  could  arrange for
 
 
                                            1357
 
 
           someone to sit  by your bedside all  night long with  a dim light  on.
 
           Then when he sees your  eyes moving back and forth -- rapid  eye move-
 
           ments,  a sign you are dreaming -- he can wake you and ask for a dream
 
           report.) 
 
            
 
           FORMS OF ASTRAL PROJECTION 
 
            
 
                           Astralprojection maybesubdivided intothree basictypes:
 
           mental projection,  astral projection (proper) and etheric projection.
 
           And  your OOBE may  shift between them.   Mental  projection is really
 
           simple clairvoyance ('remote viewing'),  and 'traveling in your mind'.
 
           Imagination  plays a key role. The  experience of mental projection is
 
           not particularly vivid, and you will more likely be an observer than a
 
           participant. Nevertheless, mental projection  is an important 'way in'
 
           to astral projection proper. 
 
 
 
                           Duringmentalprojectionandastralprojection youareableto
 
           travel through solid  objects, but are not  able to act directly  upon
 
           them  or to move them (if they are in the physical world). This is not
 
           true  during etheric  projection.  Whether it  is simply  subconscious
 
           expectation,  or whether  it  is a  true etheric  projection  which in
 
           theory means that part  of your physical body has  been relocated with
 
           your  projection  (the  etheric or  vital  part) may  be  difficult to
 
           determine.  Etheric projections generally  travel at or  very near the
 
 
                                            1358
 
 
           physical  world. There are even cases  reported (very, very rare ones)
 
           in  which the entire physical body  is transferred to another location
 
           (teleportation),  or cases in which the  physical body exists and acts
 
           in two separate places at once (bilocation)!  
 
 
 
                           But ourprimary interestis astral projectionproper, and
 
           mental projection to a lesser extent. Astral and mental projection are
 
           not confined to the  physical world. Travel  in the mental and  astral
 
           realms is  feasible, and often  preferred. Nor  are astral and  mental
 
           projection restricted to the realm of  the earth (you could even go to
 
           the moon and planets).

                           The electricalactivity ofthe brainhas beenobserved and
 
           classified with EEG  (electroencephalograph) equipment; signals picked
 
           up from the scalp by electrodes, then filtered and amplified,  drive a
 
           graph recorder.  Brain  activity has  been found  to produce  specific
 
           ranges for 
 
           certain basic states of consciousness, as indicated in 'hz' (hertz, or
 
           cycles/vibrations per second): 
 
                   delta -- 0.2 to 3.5 hz (deep sleep, trance state), 
 
                   theta -- 3.5 to 7.5 hz (day dreaming, memory), 
 
                           alpha-- 7.5to 13 hz(tranquility, heightenedawareness, 
 
           meditation), 
 
                   beta  -- 13 to 28 hz   (tension, 'normal' consciousness). 
 
 
 
           As you  can see, some  form of physical  relaxation is implied  in the
 
           alpha,  theta,  and  delta consciousness.  These  states  are in  fact
 
           reached through  deep breathing, hypnosis, and  other relaxation tech-
 
           niques. OOBE  occurs during these  states, and  delta is probably  the
 
           most important for it. 
 
           The  problem is really,  as we  have said,  one of  maintaining mental
 
           awareness  and  alertness while  experienceing  these altered  states.
 
           Experimental subjects hooked  to an EEG do not show  a discrete change
 
           from drowsy to sleep; it is very gradual.

                           Atthe thresholdbetweensleep andwakingconsciousness isa
 
           drowsy condition known  as the hypnogogic state.  OOBE seems to  occur
 
           during  this state,  or a  variant of  it. By  careful control  of the
 
           hypnogogic state  (not going beyond it)  it is possible to  enter OOBE
 
           directly. 
 
            
 
           BASIC TECHNIQUES 
 
            
 
                           Mostmethodsofastralprojectionaremethodsofconditioning.
 
           Some form of  trance or altered consciousness  is always involved.  No
 
           one  ever projects consciously while fully  awake (some may think that
 
           they do). Although there are many techniques used to produce an astral
 
           projection, 
 
           they boil down to ten of them. They all sort of overlap. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1361
 
 
                           1) Diet-- Certain dietarypractices mayaid in OOBE,esp-
 
           ecially at first. These include fasting, vegitarianism, and in general
 
           the  eating of  'light' foods  as discussed  in  a a  previous lesson.
 
           Carrots and raw eggs are thought  to be especially beneficial, but all
 
           nuts are  to be avoided.   Over-eating should be avoided.  And no food
 
           should be eaten just before an OOBE attempt. If you intend to practice
 
           during sleep, for  example, allow  2 to 4  hours of  no food or  drink
 
           (except water) before  bedtime. In general, we see  here the same kind
 
           of dietary restrictions advocated for kundalini yoga.  
 
 
 
                           2) Progressivemuscularrelaxation--This isoneofthebasic
 
           methods used  in hypnosis  and self-hypnosis. Physical  relaxation can
 
           assist  one in attaining the requisite  trance state. These techniques
 
           involve beginning at  the toes and tensing, then relaxing the muscles,
 
           progressively up the entire body. 
 
 
 
                           3)Yogaand breath-- Yoga,mantra, andbreathing exercises
 
           similarly aim at  physical relaxation. The practice of  kundalini yoga
 
           is  particularly relevant,  since it  is concerned  with altered  con-
 
           sciousness. In fact  the arousal of kundalini requires a similar state
 
           of consciousness to 
 
           OOBE.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1362
 
 
                           4)Visualization --This involvesa typeof extendedclair-
 
           voyance or picturing of remote surroundings. If you can experience the
 
           feeling of being there, so  much the better.  Although  this technique
 
           is  essentially mental  projection,  it is  possible to  deepen mental
 
           projection into astral 
 
           projection through  (you guessed it!) visualization.  Crowley taught a
 
           similar technique: a)  visualize a  closed door  on a  blank wall,  b)
 
           imagine a meditation symbol on the door, c) visualize the door opening
 
           and yourself 
 
           entering  through it.  And J.H.  Brennan describes  similar techniques
 
           wherein  the door is shaped and colored like a tattva, or alternately,
 
           a chosen tarrot card is visualized and the student visualizes entering
 
           into it. 
 
 
 
                           5) Guided imagery -- Inmany respects similar tovisual-
 
           ization. Except in this case, there is a guide (or perhaps a  voice on
 
           tape) directing you by  means of descriptions. As  with visualization,
 
           mental rather than astral projection is most likely. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1363
 
 
                           6)Body ofLight --The oldGolden Dawntechnique. Imaginea
 
           duplicate (mirror image)  of yourself in front  of you. Then  transfer
 
           your consciousness and sensation to the duplicate ('body of light'). 
 
 
 
                           7) Strongwilling -- Sort oflike creative visualization
 
           experienced in the  present. That is you express your strong desire to
 
           project through your willpower while you visualize yourself doing it. 
 
 
 
                           8) The Monroetechniques -- These are a series of steps
 
           developed by Robert Monroe: a) relax the body, b) enter the hypnogogic
 
           state, c) deepen the state, d) develope the senstation of 'vibration',
 
           e) separate  from the body.  The Monroe  Institute has developed  some
 
           cassete tapes which are claimed to help in this. 
 
 
 
                           9) Dreamcontrol --This isone ofthe mostimportant tech-
 
           niques. It involves  becoming aware that you  are dreaming. There  are
 
           several ways to do this. Oliver Fox says to look  for descrepancies in
 
           the dream  to realize you are  dreaming. One occult student  I know of
 
           visualized a white horse which he could ride wherever he wished to go.
 
           After a  time, when the  horse appeared in  his dreams it  was his cue
 
           that he was actually dreaming/projecting.  Don Juan tells Castaneda to
 
           look at his hands while he is  dreaming. And even the tarot and Cabala
 
           may be used as dream signals. 
 
 
 
 
                                            1364
 
 
           Another method is to tell yourself each night as you go  to  sleep, "I
 
           can fly"; then when you  do, you will know you are dreaming.  Once you
 
           know you  are dreaming you can control your dream/OOBE and go anywhere
 
           you  want.  Repetitive  activities  will also  likely  influence  your
 
           dreams.  For example, if you are on  an automobile trip and spend most
 
           of the  day driving, you will  probably dream about driving.   You can
 
           condition yourself to be aware you are  dreaming by doing a repetitive
 
           activity many times (walking across 
 
           the room or a  particular magick ritual, for  example). Then when  you
 
           dream about it, you will know you are dreaming.  
 
 
 
                           10)Dream expansion--Avariation ondream control.A dream
 
           may be  *extended* by imagining  it continuing from where  it was when
 
           you awaken.  Then it is  just a simple  step   to 'astral project'  by
 
           directing you 'dream'.  
 
 
 
                           Althoughallthesetechniques
                                                    mayappearstraightforward,they
 
           all require effort. Astral projection is generally learned. 
 
 
 
                           The astral worldis the "ghostland"into which onepasses
 
           after death. It is sometimes  possible to visit with the dead,  or you
 
           might be called upon to reassure and assist those who have just passed
 
           over  (died) or  those who  are consciously  projecting for  the first
 
           time. Many spirits, 
 
 
                                            1365
 
 
           elementals  and ghosts exist in the  astral world. The magician should
 
           feel comfortable there. Tibetan belief is that through proficiency  in
 
           OOBE, you  no longer need reincarnate after death. The astral world is
 
           extremely 
 
           changeable and subject  to your thoughts. Your  will can control  your
 
           movements in the astral world,  and if you seem to be  going somewhere
 
           non-volitionally  ('astral current')  it  is probably  your true  will
 
           causing  it  anyway.  You  might also  experience  heightened  magical
 
           ability while in the astral realm.

           ** MAGICK 10 -- CABALA ** 
 
            
 
                           Western magick isbased uponthe Cabala,a Jewishmystical
 
           traditon  first written down in 12th  and 13th century southern France
 
           and  Spain.   It was  oral  before that;  and it  contains the  "lost"
 
           knowledge of the  ancients, possibly going back  to Egypt and  before.
 
           The most important Cabalistic 
 
           books are SEPHIR YETZIRAH (The Book of Creation), and  the ZOHAR (Book
 
           of  Splendor).  Through Cabalistic philosophy  we are able to classify
 
           and "pigeon-hole" all of existence. 
 
 
 
                           The fourworlds are recognizedin theCabala, but theyare
 
           given Hebrew  names.   Thus  --  Assiah, physical;  Yetzirah,  astral;
 
           Briah, mental; and Atziluth, spiritual; as shown in the chart.

           The divine  name of God  is TETRAGRAMMATON  (or name of  four letters)
 
           made from the Hebrew letters YOD HE VAU HE (English YHVH). Of the four
 
           letters, YOD corresponds  with Atziluth and the  element of fire;  the
 
           first HE  corresponds with Briah  and water.  These first two  letters
 
           make up  a yang-yin pair  (respectively). The  other two letters  also
 
           form a yang-yin 
 
           pair (respectively), with the VAU corresponding with Yetzirah and air;
 
           while the second HE corresponds with Assiah and the element of earth.

           "Tree of Life", Otz Chieem).   The Sefirotic Tree is a diagram  of the
 
           universe made  up of  the ten  SEFIROTH (primal numbers  or orders  of
 
           creation) drawn as  circles upon the Tree in a  decending pattern from
 
           the highest aspect  of God at the  top to the most  physical aspect of
 
           our world at the bottom.  As can be seen in the  accompanying diagram,
 
           the sefiroth are connected together with numbered lines, called paths.

                           Above theTree is theinfinite void-- the unknowable,un-
 
           manifest God as Divine Light -- the three veils of negative existence:
 
           Ain, Ain Sof, and Ain Sof Aur.  The Divine Light (Ain Sof Aur) is made
 
           manifest by  the first sefira  where it  is transformed into  positive
 
           existence.  Emanations of energy (magical current) flow from the first
 
           sefira  (Source) along the  paths into other  sefiroth which transform
 
           and emanate to  lower and lower  sefiroth. In  Adam Kadman (primal  or
 
           ideal man) the sefiroth fit upon the 
 
           physical body; note  the similarity  to the chakras.   The process  of
 
           creation is one of emanation from the spiritual at the top of the Tree
 
           to the  physical world  (Sink) at  the  bottom. All  current which  is
 
           Sourced into the Tree must also be Sinked (earthed).  That is, magical
 
           energy set in motion 
 
           by  ritual shoud be used  up in the physical  world whether or not the
 
           ritual was a success. 
 
 
 
                           Sefiroth1, 2,and 3on theTree form theSupernal Triangle
 
           which is beyond normal human experience in the world of Atziluth.  The
 
           first sefira, KETHER, is the supreme *crown* of God; it signifies pure
 
           Being, and  is the Source. Kether is  androgynous. Immediately arising
 
           from Kether are 
 
           two  further emanations. The second sefira  is HOKMAH, the *wisdom* of
 
           God  and the  masculine force  of the  universe. Third  is BINAH,  the
 
           *understanding* or intelligence of God; this is the supernal mother. 
 
 
                                            1373
 
 
                           Between theSupernals and theother seven sefirothis the
 
           Abyss  -- a  great  gulf which  forever separates  ideal  from actual.
 
           Within the  Abyss an  11th sefira,  DAATH, the *knowledge*  of God  is
 
           sometimes placed. 
 
 
 
                           The second triangle, comprised of the 4th,5th, and 6th
 
           sefiroth in the  world of Briah, is  sometimes called the Mental  Tri-
 
           angle. Sefira  4, HESED,  the  *love* or  mercy of  God,  is male  and
 
           positive.  The 5th  sefira, GEVURAH,  the power  or *strength*  of God
 
           complements Hesed as  justice. Sixth is TIFARETH, as the compassion or
 
           *beauty* of God; the heart of the universe.

                           Thethird orAstralTriangle containssefiroth7, 8,and 9in
 
           Yetzirah.  Sefira 7, NETSAH, is the  lasting endurance or *victory* of
 
           God. Complementing Netsah is 8, HOD, the majesty or *splendor* of God.
 
           The 9th  sefira, YESOD, the *foundation* of  the world, is linked with
 
           the  moon, hence  the tides  and the  libido. Yesod is  experienced as
 
           dream  consciousness,  and  is very  important  in  magick  and astral
 
           projection. 
 
 
 
                           Finally,at thephysicalworld ofAssiah isthe10th sefira,
 
           MALKUTH, the *kindgom* of God, and the basis of all material creation.
 
           We experience Malkuth as sense consciousness. 
 
 
 
                           TheSefirotic Treehasthree verticalcolumns or*pillars*.
 
           As you  face the tree, the  pillar on the right, headed  by Hokmah and
 
           ending with Netsah, is called the Pillar of Mercy and has light/mascu-
 
           line (yang)  qualities. The  pillar on the  left, headed by  Binah and
 
           ending with Hod,  is the Pillar of  Severity with dark/feminine  (yin)
 
           qualities.  The  Middle  Pillar  between them  equilibriates  the  two
 
           opposites,  and is  the *Shekhinah*, or  feminine counterpart  of God.
 
           The *klippoth*,  or evil  demons, generally  in Assiah,  represent un-
 
           balanced forces or excesses.

           upon the Sefirotic Tree.   Each numbered part is a numeric key  to the
 
           various correspondence tables, such as Crowley's '777'.  The sefirotic
 
           tree has its  parts variously colored and each sefira  has a color; in
 
           fact the paths  which run between  the sefiroth have their  own colors
 
           too.   There are  four major color  scales for the  sefirotic tree and
 
           each color scale corresponds  with one of the four worlds.  That means
 
           we  are dealing with not just one  sefirotic tree, but actually with a
 
           separate tree  for each of the  four worlds; although it  is easier to
 
           think  of it as the same tree  with a different color scale. The Queen
 
           (Briah) and King (Atziluth) scales are 
 
           the most important. There is also  the Empress scale (Assiah), and the
 
           Emperor scale (Yetzirah).

                           The 22 paths connectthe sefiroth together. These paths
 
           correspond with the  22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet,  as based upon
 
           the SEFIR  YETZIRAH. Due to  the nature of  the Hebrew  alphabet (some
 
 
                                            1377
 
 
           letters can take two forms) SEFIR  YETZIRAH divides each of two of the
 
           letters into  two (dual) parts.  For this reason,  it is  necessary to
 
           divide each  of the two related paths into two (dual) parts. These are
 
           numbered 31, 31b (bisected); 32, 32b.   Yet when these paths are drawn
 
           on  the sefirotic tree they are  usually shown undivided (and numbered
 
           simply 31, and 32).  The following 
 
           table shows  the colors and location  of the paths in  relation to the
 
           sefiroth. You will want to add the path numbers to the illustration of
 
           the sefirotic tree, or draw a new  tree. Some writers may refer to "32
 
           paths", by calling the sefiroth "paths" 1-10.

           scale sefiroth will  find the king scale as paths  and vice versa. The
 
           use of complementary scales is based upon the idea of  balance. A tree
 
           composed of sefiroth in the queen scale and paths in the king scale is
 
           all  you need for most magick.  Although correspondences are what work
 
           for you,  there is  said to  be an ancient  tradition surrounding  the
 
           conventional  color scales  and it  may be  helpful to  lock into  the
 
           energy associated with them.

                           From themagical pointof view,the Treeof Lifeis a mapof
 
           consciousness which is useful  for understanding and attaining various
 
           states of  consciousness. In cabalistic  magick we are  concerned with
 
           the linking  of higher energy to  lower levels on the  tree. That very
 
           thing takes place naturally as well, in nature and in  life. A subject
 
           in  itself is cabalistic meditation (pathwork,  or the way of return),
 
           in which we attempt to climb up the tree (ladder of lights) to  attain
 
           union with divinity.

           ** MAGICK 11 -- PSYCHIC ENERGY ** 
 
            
 
                           We have seen in the theories of magick, that there isa
 
           definite relationship between  the 'inner' and 'outer' worlds.  We saw
 
           this in  the theory of  the microcosm and  the macrocosm; in  the four
 
           worlds; in the theory  of correspondences; and also in  the Cabala and
 
           Tree  of Life.   This  relationship between  inner and  outer is  very
 
           important.  And it means quite simply that  success (or lack of it) in
 
           one  world (inner or outer) influences success  (or lack of it) in the
 
           other. Therefore developing of magical ability is more than meditation
 
           and magical practice, for it 
 
           implies mastery of the four worlds. The developed magician is not only
 
           master of the inner worlds; he is also master of himself. 
 
 
 
                           Thisis notto implythat successfulmagicians areall mil-
 
           lionaires (or  whatever standard  people measure  success by),  but it
 
           should  mean that  they are  basically pleasant  people, at  least; no
 
           serious hangups. The  developed magician is described  as a 'king'  in
 
           the Book of the Law.  This means simply that he has full  control over

           all aspects of his physical  and inner life. He should be who he wants
 
           to be, doing what he wants to do.

           *correspondence tables*  (such as Crowley's '777').  One important set
 
           of correspondences for the planets, is shown below...

           Notice that  we have included  the metal which is  associated with the
 
           planet,  as well  as common attributes  of each planet.  The theory of
 
           Cabalistic magick is  to select the appropriate planet for the desired
 
           result. The  attribute column will  assist in  that selection. Once  a
 
           particular  planet  is  determined,  an entity  is  selected  from the
 
           correspondence tables by  matching the key number. A set of correspon-
 
           dence tables may be available on this board as a separate file (777.A-
 
           RC). Additionally,  a list  of selected deities  from several  popular
 
           pantheons and with a brief description about them  may be available on
 
           this board as GODS.LST. 
 
 
 
                           AlthoughHebrewMysticismistheoriginalsourceofCabalistic
 
           ideas, it is mostly unconcerned with the magical implications of those
 
           ideas. How  can  a religious  philosophy  which is  monotheistic  lend
 
           credibility to a polytheistic approach? Various deities are understood
 
           as *aspects* or  *qualities* of the  Supreme God. This  is not a  con-
 
           tradiction, merely a restatement  of the microcosm-macrocosm idea once
 
           again. The Sefirotic Tree, in its representation of the universe is 
 
           the Macrocosm. While it could be said that any single sefiroth has its
 
           own  separate qualities, it remains, nonetheless,  a part of the whole
 
           tree, and 
 
           a part of the macrocosm. As a result, virtually any pantheon or belief
 
           system is compatible with the Cabala.

           WILLPOWER AND MAGICK 
 
            
 
                           Western magick has traditionallyplaced a great deal of
 
           emphasis upon  the use  of  willpower as  a means  of development  and
 
           self-mastery.  But this may  not be the  best method in  the long run.
 
           Isaac  Bonewitz describes  how the  subconscious will  sometimes rebel
 
           against willpower with  'spectacular results'. It is far better to run
 
           one's life democratically. 
 
 
 
                           HawaiianKahunamagick describesthe'threeselves', ie.the
 
           lower self  (or subconscious), the  middle self (or  normal conscious-
 
           ness),  and the high self (spirit  or Holy Guardian Angel). Enlighten-
 
           ment  in the  Hawaiian  system consists  of unification  of  the three
 
           selves. They become 'buddies'. Enlightenment does not  come from great
 
           change. It comes from  great acceptance. Continual effort at  becoming
 
           better takes  you nowhere.  For  becoming it  is not  being  it.   The
 
           unification  is achieved  by first  developing communication  with the
 
           subconscious and later  with the high self also. Simple exercises with
 
           a pendulum, automatic writing, raised finger responses, self hypnosis,
 
           recording and  analysis of  dreams etc. facilitate  communication with
 
           the subconscious. At  first communication with the  high self must  be
 
           via the subconscious, but later it is possible to go direct to it.

           PSYCHIC ENERGY 
 
            
 
                           Manyoccult groupsfollowan energymodel formagickand the
 
           physical  body. This  model  (or theory)  equates psychic  energy with
 
           kundalini/prana/sexual or  life force  energy. The ideal  of kundalini
 
           yoga is thus  to raise the kundalini to the higher chakras (especially
 
           ajna and 
 
           sahasrara) thereby  enhancing psychic/magick  powers.  The release  of
 
           psychic energy  is also relevant  to mental  control, good health  and
 
           longevity, and  the attainment  of 'cosmic  consciousness'. Meditation
 
           and yoga is used to 
 
           liberate psychic energy  so that it can be used  for magical purposes.
 
           But there  are other ways  to liberate psychic  energy. Many  of these
 
           techniques will act as a mental catharsis in the sense of invigorating
 
           the psyche and 
 
           resulting in improved intellectual and physical performance.

                           Wehave seenhowmagical theoryis baseduponthe assumption
 
           that psychic phenomena  is real. If  this is so,  then magick is  also
 
           real. And  we have  also seen how  magick is  the art  and science  of
 
           causing  change in  accordance  with the  will by  non-physical means.
 
           Magical philosophy is the 
 
           working system of  terms, theories, and symbols  upon which magick  is
 
           based. But magick goes further than  that, for as an ancient system of
 
           psychology,  magick may be used as is  a means of self improvement and
 
           spiritual  growth. For magick  and mysticism are  parallel paths, each
 
           ultimately leading to transcendence. 
 
            
 
           REVIEW QUESTIONS 
 
            
 
           1) What do we mean by the relationship between the inner 
 
              and outer worlds? 
 
           2) What is wrong with willpower? 
 
           3) Explain the energy model of magick.
