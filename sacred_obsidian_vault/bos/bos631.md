                        BRIGIT OF THE CELTS
                        -------------------
    Brigit was one of the great Triple Goddesses of the Celtic people.
 She appeared as Brigit to the Irish, Brigantia in Northern England,
 Bride in Scotland, and Brigandu in Brittany. Many legends are told
 about Brigit. Some say that there are three Brigits : one sister in
 charge of poetry and inspiration who invented the Ogham alphabet,
 one in charge of healing and midwifery, and the third in charge of the
 hearth fire, smithies and other crafts. This catually indicates the
 seperate aspects of her Threefold nature and is a neat division of
 labor for a hard-working goddess.
    Brigit was probably originally a Sun Goddess, and a charming story
 of her birth is that she was born at sunrise and a tower of flame
 burst from the forehead of the new born Goddess that reached from
 Earth to Heaven. It was likely She who inspired the line in the famous
 Song of Amergin: "I am a fire in the head." Her penchant for smithcraft
 led to her association by the Romans with Minerva/Athena. As a warrior
 Goddess, She favored the use of the spear or the arrow. Indeed, various
 interpetations of her name exist including, "Bright Arrow," "The Bright
 One," "the Powerful One" and "The High One," depending upon the region
 and the dialect.
    As a Goddess of herbalism, midwifery and healing She was in charge
 of Water as well as Fire. I don't beleive that anyone has ever
 counted all teh vast number of sacred wells and springs named after
 or dedicated to this Goddess. A story is told of how two lepers came
 to one of her sacred springs for healing and She instructed one Leper
 to wash the other. The skin of the freshly bathed man was cleansed
 of the disease and Brigit told the man who was healed to wash the man
 who had bathed him so that both men would be whole. The man who was
 healed was now too disgusted to touch the other Leper and would have
 left him, but Brigit herself washed the leper and struck down the
 other arrogant fellow with leperousy once more before he could leave.
 Offerings to the watery Brigit were cast into the well in the form
 of coins or, even more ancient, brass or gold rings. Other sacrifices
 were offered where three streams came together. Her cauldron of
 Inspiration connected her watery healing aspect with her fiery poetic
 aspect.
    Brigit is clearly the best example of the survival of a Goddess
 into Christian times. She was cannonized by the Catholic church as
 St. Brigit and various origins are given to this saint. The most
 popular folktale is that She was midwife to the Virgin Mary, and thus
 was always inviked by women in labor. The more official story was
 that She was a Druid's daughter who predicted the coming of
 Christianity and then was baptised by St. Patrick. She became a nun
 and later an abbess who founded the Abbey at Kildare. The Christian
 Brigit was said to have had the power to appoint the bishops of her
 area, a strange role for an abbess, made stranger by her requirement
 that her bishops also be practicing goldsmiths.
    Actually, the Goddess Brigit had always kept a shrine at Kildare,
 Ireland, with a perpetual flame tended by nineteen virgin priestesses
 called Daughters of the Flame. No male was ever allowed to come near
 it; nor did those women ever consort with men. Even their food and
 other supplies were brought to them by women of the nearby village.
 When Catholicism took over in Ireland, the shrine became a convent
 and the priestesses became nuns but the same traditions were held
 and the eternal flame was kept burning. Their tradition was that
 each day a different priestess/nun was in charge of the sacred fire
 and on the 20th day of each cycle, teh fire was miraculously tended
 2983
 
 by Brigit Herself. There into the 18th century, the ancient song
 was sung to her : "Brigit, excellant woman, sudden flame, may the
 bright fiery sun take us to the lasting kingdom."
    For over a thousand years, the sacred flame was tended by nuns,
 and no one knows how long before that it had been tended by the
 priestesses. In 1220 CE, a Bishop became angered by the no-males
 policy of the Abbey of St. Brigit of Kildare. He insisted that nuns
 were subordinate to priests and therefore must open their abbey
 and submit themselves to inspection by a priest. When they refused
 and asked for another Abbess or other female official to perform
 any inspections, the Bishop was incensed. He admonished them to
 obediance and then decreed that teh keeping of the eternal flame
 was a Pagan custom and 6rdered the sacred flame to be extinguished.
 Even then, She remained the most poular Irish saint along with
 Patrick. In the 1960's, under Vatican II modernization, it was
 declared that there was insufficient proof of Brigit's sanctity
 or even of her historical existance, and so teh Church's gradual
 pogrom against Brigit was successful at last and She was thus
 decanonized. It is very difficult to obtain images or even holy
 cards of ST. Brigit outside of Ireland anymore.
    Her festival is held on Febuary 1st or 2nd. It corresponds to
 the ancient Celtic fire festival of Imbolc or Oimelc which
 celebrated the birthing and freshening of sheep and goats (it really
 is a Feast of Milk). This festival was Christianized as Candlemas
 or Lady Day and Her Feast day, La Feill Bhride, was attended by
 tremendous local celebration and elaborate rituals. Her festival
 is also called Brigit. Brigit (the Goddess and the Festival)
 represents the stirring of life again after the dead months of the
 winter, and her special blessings are called forth at this time.
 Since She was booted out of teh Church for being Pagan, it is
 incumbant upon us Pagans to restore Her worship to its former glory
 especially those of us of Celtic ancestory. Here is an ancient rite
 to invite Brigit into your home at the time of her Holiday:
    Clean your hearth thoroughly in teh morning and lay a fire
 without kindling it, then make yourself a "Bed for Brigid" and
 place it near the hearth. The bed can be a small basket with covers
 and tiny pillow added as plain or fancy as you like. If you have no
 hearth, you can use the stove and put the bed behind it. Then at
 sundown light a candle rubbed with rosemary oil and invite Brigit
 into your home and into er bed; use the candle to kindle your
 hearthfire if possible. Make your own poem to invite Her or use
 the ancient song mentioned earlier. Let the candle burn at least
 all night in a safe place. You might even want to begin the custom
 of keeping the eternal flame; it is a popular custom in some
 magickal and Wiccan traditions. AFter all, it's up to us now to
 keep the spirit of Brigit alive and well for the next thousand
 years at least!!!
 
 Brigid is not really a Celtic Mother Goddess.  She is generally
 considered a Goddess of fire/smithcraft, of poetry and of healing.  One
 of her roles is as midwife, but although she has a son, she is not
 usually seen as a mother.
 
 I don't know any books that deal specifically with Brighidh, but please
 look for a book called "Celtic Mythology" by Proinsias MacCana and for
 "Gods and Heroes of the Celts" by Marie Lousie Sjoestadt for more
 information about Celtic deities.  They are both VERY good sources.
 
 2984
 
 Brighidh is a Goddess of healing, smithcraft and poetry, brewer of mead
 and ale, a lawgiver, a midwife, supposedly daughter of the Daghda,
 mother of the poet Cairbre, and of the Gods Brian, Iuchar and Iucharba.
 She was transformed into a Christian Saint and became the foster mother
 of Christ.  Some sources say that the healer/smith/poet were embodied in
 one Goddess, other sources claim that she was three sisters, all named
 Brighidh.
 
 Her holy day falls (on our calendar) on February 2nd (I wonder if She
 likes groundhogs...) called Imbolc, Oimelc or Lady Day.  Candles are
 blessed that day in the Catholic churches.

 Re: Somethnig about Brighid:
 
 Brigit/Brigid/Bride was the daughter of Dagda. She was the proctector of the
 poets, the forge and the healing persons. Her son Ruadan, which she had with
 Bres, was killed by Goibnui. For her died son she sounds the first kenning of
 Eireland. She also was put into the cult and the person of Brigit from
 Kildare, which made the first female parish after Christianity falls into
 Eireland. The convent of Kildare has had a neverending fire, which was
 protected by the sisters of the parish. The saint Brigit is the second patron
 saint of Eireland.  within the scottish tradition Brigit belongs together
 with the time of the year "Season of the lambs" and the comming of spring.
 Brigit overcomes the control of the Cailleach Bheur.
