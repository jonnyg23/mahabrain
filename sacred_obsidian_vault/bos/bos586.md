 Re: Re: House Blessing notes
 
 In the spirit of house blessings, and because I'm basically a kitchen
 witch at heart, and like little projects over serious ritual, I offer
 some selections gleaned from Cunningham's The Magical Household. I'm
 typing these without permission but with the hope that they'll
 inspire you to pick up the Cunningham book, because it's wonderful
 stuph... :&gt;
 
 For the doorway:
 
 o Suspend over the door a fresh sprig of dill, tied with a blue cord (or
   red, if you prefer), to prevent those who mean you harm from entering.
 
 o Cross two needles, and stick into or tie onto a corner of your
   doormat, to prevent evil from entering.
 
 o Grind Dragon's Blood herb into a powder and sprinkle it on door and
   window sills, to protect your house from harm.
 
 "Witch Bottles"
 
 o Powder some more Dragon's Blood herb with a small quantity of sugar
   and salt, and place in a small corked or screw-lidded bottle. Shake
   and seal with red wax, then place it where it won't be found (or at
   least not easily seen). This will ensure harmony and peace within
   the house.
 
 o Place three new needles, three new pins, and three new nails in a
   glass jar. Fill with salt and shake vigorously nine times. Seal with
   white wax and place in kitchen cupboard where it will not be seen.
   This protects your food from contamination.
 
 o Gather rosemary, along with several needles and pins, into a small
   glass jar with a tight-fitting lid or cork. When full, pour in red
   wine and shake. Seal with black or red wax, and place in an
   inconspicuous place in the apartment. If you own your own house,
   bury this at the furthestmost corner of your property. The book
   also adds this:
           As you're filling the jar, say these words...
           "Pins, needles, rosemary, wine,
           In this witch's bottle of mine;
           Guard against harm and enmity;
           This is my will; so Mote it Be!"
   Personally, I'm not hip on anything but, "Hey, Gods? It's me again",
   but I know, I'm CONSIDERABLY less formal than most!

 An Anti-Theft Sachet
 
 o Mix caraway, rosemary, juniper berries, and elder leaves or mistletoe,
 and place into white square of cloth. Tie with white yarn and hang
 prominently. I'd assume either at the place you think thieves are most
 likely to enter--this being an anti-theft sachet--or at every entrance
 and doorway. This will require more cloth and more herbs, but most of
 the above are fairly inexpensive.
 
 Finally, on Moving Day itself:
 
 o  Bring two things into the house first: a small amount of salt, half
 to be scattered upon crossing the threshhold, and a small loaf of bread.
 Break the bread into as many pieces as you have people moving in, with
 one extra piece for the gods' portion. Sprinkle a dash of salt on each
 piece; share, when you have a moment. (I'd say have water on hand as
 well--at the very least, to clear the salt!) Next, bring in an apple and
 do the same thing--Cunningham recommends a fruit and cheese basket--I'd
 stick with just the apple and maybe a few slices of cheddar, or
 something. Lastly, bring in a sturdy chair and place it either near the
 apple and bread bits, or facing the door. This ensures that you will
 never know poverty, for there is bread and salt, hunger, for there is
 fruit (and cheese), and instability (for there's your stable chair
 guarding the door. After that, heave and lift until you're moved in!
 
 -------
 A Note: I think ritual is very important, and I do admire rituals I've
 picked up here and those I've found on my own. In the long run, though,
 I know myself well enough to think that if I have to wait for a certain
 day and have a certain robe on, or need a special tool or altar lay-out,
 it'll never happen. But I can put my hands on needles, pins, wine and
 spices at virtually any time, and can easily make up witch's bottles for
 the shelves and cupboards, sachets for the windows, and incenses for
 household protection and cleansing. These simple items can have just as
 much power as just about any major ritual, and are sometimes easier to
 "whip up" for the busy pagan... :&gt;
 
 -------
                            Cleansing Incense 
 2 parts Dragon's Blood 
 1 part Valerian Root 
 1 part Sulphur 
 1 part Asafoetida 
 In conjunction with any banishing ritual this WILL remove ANY psychic or
 magical impression from your home.  Then you can start fresh filling it
 with the energies you want. 
 It may sound strange but it works! (Though it WILL GAG a Maggot!)
