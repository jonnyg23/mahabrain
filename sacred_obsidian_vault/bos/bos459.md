           FULL MOON RITUAL
           October 12, 1992
           Led by Baba Yaga (Grandmother Owl) with Shadow Hawk and Rilla
 
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) I also wanted to remind everyone that if you are
           someone who feels
           ...
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) that Columbus isn't your A#1 hero, we can put in a
           polite bow to the
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) residents of Turtle Island were here to greet him.
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) The strange words you'll see in the ritual are Chero-
           kee for the
           Spirit
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) guardians of the Quarters, the God, Goddess and
           Ancestors/Community/Totems.
 
           (1-1,S.H.) striking chime once
 
           (1-1,S.H.) Relax your bodies, feel the tension flow out of them....
           (1-1,S.H.) send your awareness down, down, into your feet...
           (1-1,S.H.) and from your feet, feel the connection to the earth
           pulling at you
           (1-1,S.H.) slowly, begin to breath deep...
           (1-1,S.H.) and with each breath you take, fill your body with en-
           ergy...
           (1-1,S.H.) and with each exhale, push it down through your feet into
           the earth...
           (1-1,S.H.) the connection grows stronger, and the barriers break down
           (1-1,S.H.) breath by breath, wall by wall, and the earth becomes alive
           (1-1,S.H.) beneath you.
           (1-1,S.H.) Now, as you inhale, let the energy flow completely through
           you into the
           earth...
           (1-1,S.H.) and as you exhale, begin to pull energy from the earth up
           into your
           body...
           (1-1,S.H.) you are awash in the energies of Father Sky and Mother
           Earth, they
           (1-1,S.H.) are cleansing and balancing your body with each breath you
           take.
           (1-1,S.H.) Air and Earth, you are balancing, you are grounding, you
           are 
           (1-1,S.H.) attaining peace and harmony with our Mother and our Father-
           ...
           (1-1,S.H.) Breath gently, and be at one.
 
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) (moving to the east and raising my athame high)
 
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) This athame is the symbol of Air, the element of the
           East. 
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) I summon the powers of the East, the winds of thought
           and
           intelligence,...
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) the storms of inspiration and learning. Here arises
           Awahili, the
 
 
 
                                                                             2157
 
           Eagle,...
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) where the sun does ever shine. Give to us the wisdom
           of the east.
           ...
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) We invite these spirits to this our celebration of
           their powers.
 
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) (Walking around circle drawing it with the Athame)
           (1-3,Baba Yaga) (lighting candle)
 
           (1-1,S.H.) (moving to the South)
           (1-1,S.H.) (taking breath, and raising Wand high)
 
           (1-1,S.H.) This Wand is the symbol of Fire, the Element of the South. 
           I
           (1-1,S.H.) summon the powers of the South, the fires of directed will,
           of
           (1-1,S.H.) energy and spirit.  Here dwells Tsistu, the Rabbit, the
           Trickster
           (1-1,S.H.) in the direction we are always facing.  Grant us the
           ability to
           (1-1,S.H.) attune ourselves to the energy of the South.  We invite
           these
           (1-1,S.H.) Spirits to lend us their aid in our work tonight.

           ...
           (1-3,BYaga) Holding water over head facing west)
 
           (1-3,BYaga) This water is the essence of Water, the Element of the
           West. ...
           (1-3,BYaga) I summon the powers of emotion and love, understanding and
           caring.
           (1-3,BYaga) Here dwells Yanu, the Bear, where the sun lies down and
           dies ...
           (1-3,BYaga) It is the home of the thunders: the source of knowledge of
           our inner
           (1-3,BYaga) beings. Grant us thy inner peace and understanding. ...
           (1-3,BYaga) We invite these spirits to permeate all that we do here.

           with stream of
           water)

           (1-1,S.H.) ~(I move to the North and raise a container of Salt high)
 
           (1-1,S.H.)  This Salt is the symbol of Earth, the Element of the
           North.  We
           (1-1,S.H.) summon the strength and protection of the rocks and the
           trees, the
 
 
 
                                                                             2158
 
           (1-1,S.H.) stability of the stones which are the bones of the People. 
           Here

           from
           (1-1,S.H.) whose mouth streams the cleansing wind.  Grant to us thy
           strength,
           (1-1,S.H.) ancient wisdom, cleansing and stability.  We invite these
           Spirits

           EXPLANATORY NOTES
 
           Awahili is Cherokee for Eagle, the spirit keeper of the East. This is
           the messenger
           to the powers and the bird of the chieftain.
 
           Sistu is Cherokee for Rabbit. the spirit keeper of the South for the
           Eastern
           Woodland Indians. Western Indians use the Coyote her. In any case it
           represents
           teaching through humor or by showing how NOT to do things. Think of
           the B'rer Rabbit
           stories: "Please 
           don thro me in dat briar patch!"
 
 
 
                                                                             2162
 
           Yanu is Cherokee for Bear, the spirit keeper of the West. Yanu is the
           healer, she
           who gave the sweat lodge to the people and the bear is the chief of
           the council of
           the four-leggeds. The thunders are 'chancy' powers, sometimes good and
           sometimes
           evil.
 
           Yunsu is Cherokee for Buffalo, the spirit keeper of the North. Yes,
           buffalo once
           roamed a lot of the East! The buffalo provides for our mundane needs
           with food,
           clothing, shelter and, in the planes, fuel. For the Sioux (Lakota) the
