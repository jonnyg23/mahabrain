                                      Wedding Ceremony 
                                          The Bard 
 
                    THE ORDER OF SOLEMNIZATION OF MARRIAGE (GENERAL) 
            
           The Altar shall be dressed with a white cloth, with a  Cup, and an un-
           sheathed  Sword. A small lectern  should be provided  to the Minister,
           that he may  hold the Sword and read the ceremony. One candle shall be
           unlit upon the altar, and two lit candles shall be provided, to either
           side. 
            
           Smaller candles shall be  provided to at least the wedding  party, and
           to the whole congregation, if possible. 
            
           %         Ministers take Altar 
           %         Groom and attendants take altar 
           %         Processional music starts 
           %         Bridesmaids process 
           %         Bride and father process 
           %         Bride and father take altar 
            
           MINISTER:  Dearly beloved,  today you  are surrounded by  your family,
           your friends, and your loved ones, all of whom have gathered     here
           today in the sight of the ONE to share your joy and         witness
           your marriage. 
            
                     Who gives this woman to be wed? 
            
           FATHER:   I do. 
            
           %            (the Bride's  father shall give  the Bride's hand  to the
           Groom, and then take his seat) 
            
           MINISTER 2: This most sacred of bonds is not to be entered into 
           lightly, but soberly and advisedly, with openness and       honesty. I
           require and charge you both now, upon your        honors,  to disclose
           any reason or impediment why you may not          be  lawfully  joined
           this day. 
            
           BRIDE/GROOM: By our honors, there are none. 
            
           %         (The Minister shall turn to the congregation and say:) 
            
           MINISTER: Likewise, I charge all of you now, upon your honors, that if
           any            know a reason that these two may not be lawfully joined
           this day,           to speak now or forever hold your peace. 
            
           %         (There shall be a short pause for any response) 
            
           MINISTER: (N)  and (N), life has no singular  meaning so much as it is
           made up of many meaningful events, some of which may be 
           specified and planned for. One of these is Marriage. As you      know,
           no minister, no priest, no rabbi, no public official        can  marry
           you; you can only marry yourselves. By a mutual        commitment   to
           love each other     and to create an atmosphere of          considera-
           tion and respect, you can make your marriage come           to life. 
            
 
 
                                                                             1527
           
 
 
           MINISTER 2:  On this, the  day of  your marriage,  you stand  somewhat
           apart from all other human beings. You stand within the 
           charmed Circle of your love, and this is as it should be,        b u t
           love is not meant to be the possession of two people        alone.
           Rather it should serve as a source of common energy,        a  form in
           which you can find the strength to live your lives          w  i  t  h
           courage. From this day onward, you must come closer         together
           than ever before, yet your love should give you the         strength
           to stand apart; to seek out your own unique des        tinies,  and to
           make your own special contribution to that        which  is  always  a
           part of us, and more than us. 
            
           MINISTER:  A marriage that lasts  is one which  is continually develop
           ing, in which each person is continually developing while 
           growing in understanding of the other. Deep knowledge of 
           another is not something that can be achieved in a short         time.
           Real understanding can only develop fully with years        of     in-
           timacy. This wonderful knowledge of another grows out       of  really
           caring for the other so much, that one wants to        understand   as
           completely as possible the intricacies of the          other. 
            
           MINISTER 2:  May you be blessed with this deep knowledge of each other
                     through all the days of your lives. 
            
                     Would you now give your vows? 
            
           BRIDE/GROOM: We will. 
            
           MINISTER: What tokens do you give that you will keep these vows? 
            
           BRIDE/GROOM: We give these rings. 
            
            
           %          (The rings shall be  given to the Minister, who shall  take
           them in hand.) 
            
           MINISTER 2:  The ring is used  in this ceremony because  the Circle is
           our symbol for Spirit; that which was in the Beginning, is       now,
           and ever shall Be, Love, without end. In this ceremony,          it is
           that love which is deathless and eternal. 
            
           %           (Both  Ministers shall join hands,  holding the Rings, and
           shall say:) 
            
           MINISTER: We  ask now the Blessing  of the One upon  these rings. They
           are bands of silver with the Tree of Life cast in relief         upon
           their surfaces.  Let the bands represent eternity, love 
           without end, and let the trees represent the nurturement you     will
           share in that Love, now and always. 
            
           BOTH:     And so it is. 
            
           %         (The Rings shall be taken by the second Minister.) 
           %          (And if it is a Swordfasting, then the Minister  shall take
           up the Sword, and flourish it aloft, and then place it 
           point-down in front of him.) 
            
 
 
                                                                             1528
           
 
           %         (The Bride and Groom shall face  each other, and place their
           %         hands upon the Sword's pommel, with both Ministers placing %
                their hands over the Bride and Groom's.) 
           %         (the Minister #2 shall turn to the Groom, and say:) 
            
            
           MINISTER 2: (N), repeat after me: 
            
                       (N), I take you as my wife. 
                       I pledge to share my life openly with you 
                       To speak the truth to you in love

                       For as long as we both shall live. 
                       I promise to respect your needs,

                       Now and forever.
