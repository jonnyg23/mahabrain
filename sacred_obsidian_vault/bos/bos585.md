                     HOUSE BLESSING 
 Assemble:
 1.  Salt &amp; Water
 2.  Incense (fire and air)
 3.  Milk &amp; Honey
 4.  Oil (for anointing)
 5.  Wine (for offering)
 6.  Bells, Pots, Pans, Whistles, etc.
 
 Cast a circle in the main room (livingroom) and after casting, visualize
 the circle expanding to include the entire house. Call upon the spirits
 and energies living in the house (or apartment). Invite those who will
 be harmonious with the new household and its energies to remain.
 Invite/ask those who will be happier elsewhere to depart.  Release all
 "energies" not compatible with the new household.  (This may be
 expressed as a "release" in order to unbind anything that may be stuck.)
 
 Then call upon, greet, and invite ancestors, patron deities, and all
 harmonious spirits and energies to dwell in the house as they please.
 
 Gather up the pots, pans, and all the noise-makers.  Go to each door and
 window, not forgetting the fire-place and dog-door, making as much
 racket as humanly possible--to shoo out anything unwanted.  (This is
 hysterical fun, and also raises lots of energy for the next important
 step.) Go again throughout the house and at each portal (door, window,
 etc.) sprinkle salt-water and cense, saying: "By the Elements I purify
 and charge this portal."  Then anoint the portal with milk and honey,
 saying: "By Milk and Honey I ensure prosperity and peace within this
 place."  Finally, anoint the portal with oil, saying: "With Oil I seal
 this portal and protect all within."  At the front door a special prayer
 is said, asking the guardian deities (God &amp; Goddess) to freely grant
 entry to all frien ds and loved ones, and to prevent passage (turn
 aside) to any who would do harm." Then, if it's a house--pour wine
 across the width of the threshold; if it's an apartment anoint the
 threshold with light touches of wine.
 
 The house-holders then each take a sip of wine, leaving some as an
 offering to the Gods, and the Circle should be closed.  The remaining
 wine, milk, and honey should be offered to the Gods.  (In our case to
 
 the fruit tree and the oak tree in our yard.)
 
 Addenda: This is very effective if done as part of a house-warming
 party, followed by much  feasting.  It has also been done very
 effectively by two people.  It only takes about 30 minutes to do a large
 house.  You _can_ take the time.
 
 Do make certain to "ground" afterward, by closing the circle and by
 eating.  This ritual can "stir" up everybody and make the house feel
 full of "buzzy" energy.
