 Introduction
 
 Less than a thousand years ago the elders of Iceland made a fateful
 decision.  Under political pressure from Christian Europe and faced
 with the need for trade, the Allthing or national assembly declared
 Iceland to be an officially Christian country.  Within a few centuries
 the last remnants of Nordic Paganism, which once stretched through all
 of Northern Europe were thought dead.  However, Iceland was a tolerant
 country and the myths, stories, and legends of Pagan times were left
 unburnt to kindle the fires of belief in later generations.  In 1972
 Iceland once again recognized Nordic Paganism as a legitimate and
 legal religion.
 
 Iceland and Sweden were the last two bastions of the Pagan religion
 originally practiced by the people of the various Germanic tribes.
 Today Nordic Paganism also known as Odinism, Heathenism, Northern
 Tradition, or Asatru (an Old-Norse term meaning .loyalty to the Gods.)
 is practiced in virtually all the countries where it originally
 flourished as well as America and Australia.  It is one of a body of
 religions calling themselves Neo-Paganism which include Druidism, the
 revival of ancient Celtic Paganism, and Wicca or Witchcraft.  However
 Asatru remains largely unknown even within the community of Neo-Pagan
 believers.
 
 This book is intended as a basic manual to the beliefs and practices
 of the Raven Kindred of Asatru.  We do not pretend to be experts and
 won.t act as if we were.  Rather we are simply believers in the Old
 Gods seeking to share our practice and research with others who are
 true to the Aesir.  Our aim is to present a simple guide which will
 allow easy understanding of the principles behind Asatru and to give
 hints for further study and exploration.
 
 While we attempt to be historically accurate to our religion's roots,
 it.s important to note that there are many things that we simply don.t
 know or which aren.t written in stone.  While we occasionally need to
 flesh out our systems where we don.t have direct evidence of our
 ancestors ways, we are not likely to simply make up things.  It is
 very important to us to stay as true to the ways of the old Pagans as
 is possible.  In those places where the various myths, legends, and
 folklore are not clear we have tried to indicate this.  We do not
 present our way as the .true. Asatru, but we do feel that all Asatru
 should be solidly connected to its roots in ancient Norse practice.
 Where we do not know the certain answer to a quesation, there is room
 for exploration, but not for simply making something up out of whole
 cloth.  While inspiration from the Gods is an important part of our
 movement, this is not make believe and any additions to the historical
 2833
 
 system should be made with respect to our ancient roots.
 
 The most important thing for modern people to remember about Asatru is
 that it is a religion.  It is not a system of magick or spirituality
 or .New Age Practice. which can be grafted onto something else or onto
 which other .systems. can be grafted wholesale.  Asatru is a word
 derived from .As. a God of the Aesir family and .tru. meaning troth.
 To be Asatru is to be bound by loyalty and troth to the Old Gods of
 the North.  While we may believe in the deities of other religions and
 peoples, and even respect them, these are not our Gods.  While we may
 take part in rituals dedicated to other Gods at ecumenical Pagan
 festivals or gatherings which encompass many other religions, we must
 not forget that Asatru is our religion and our primary concern.  One
 simply does not collect membership in Asatru (or any other religion)
 as if one were collecting stamps.  Our Gods are real and worthy of our
 respect.
 
 Today many people .practice. a number of different religions feeling
 that this is the best way to avoid intolerance, we have a completely
 different view of the world.  Asatru is not a universal religion.  We
 do not see ourselves as a path for everyone.  We are true polytheists
 and see the world as encompassing many religions which worship many
 Gods.  While we do not deny the beliefs of others, we also do not
 confuse them with our own.  The idea that .it is all one. is anathema
 to the true Heathen.  To claim that Odin is the same God as Zeus is
 madness.  Would one claim that green and red are the same merely
 because they are both colors? If one disagrees with this perspective
 or finds it limiting so be it.  Our belief is also that Asatru is not
 a path for everyone and it is better to find ones own way rather than
 bend the religions of others to fit ourselves.
 
 In accordance with this non-universalist conception, as much as we
 have been able to, we have not adopted the practices of other Pagan
 religions or magickal systems.  Those familiar with Wicca will note
 that most modern Neo-Pagan systems are derived from it.  This is not
 the case with Asatru.  Our religion began with reconstruction based on
 written sources dating from the Pagan period.  This has been followed
 by 20 years of innovation and practice within the Heathen community.
 While we make no pretensions that this has resulted in a system that
 is identical with that of our spiritual ancestors, it is at least a
 system that is our own.
 
 In saying this I would reiterate that we do not put down any religion
 for it.s beliefs.  We merely ask for the integrity of our own.  We are
 not rejecting other systems because they are wrong or because we think
 ill of them, we are rather choosing Asatru because of our love and
 devotion to it.
 
 The Rituals of Asatru
 
 The Blot
 
 The Blot is the most common ritual within Asatru.  In its simplest
 form a blot is making a sacrifice to the Gods.  In the old days this
 was done by feasting on an animal consecrated to the Gods and then
 slaughtered.  As we are no longer farmers and our needs are simpler
 today, the most common blot is an offering of mead or other alcoholic
 beverage to the deities.
 2834
 
 Many modern folk will be suspicious of a ritual such as this.  Rituals
 which are deemed sacrifices, such as the blot, have been falsely
 interpreted by post-Pagan sources in order to denigrate the ritual or
 trivialize them.  The most common myth about ritual sacrifice is that
 one is buying off a deity e.g.  one throws a virgin into the Volcano
 so it won.t erupt.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In
 Asatru it is believed that we are not only the worshippers of the Gods
 but that we are physically related to them.  The Eddas tell of a God,
 Rig, who went to various farmsteads and fathered the human race so we
 are physically kin to the Gods.  On a more esoteric level, humankind
 is gifted with .ond. or the gift of ecstasy.  Ond is a force that is
 of the Gods.  It is everything that makes humans different from the
 other creatures of the world.  As creatures with this gift, we are
 immediately connected to the Gods, we are part of their tribe, their
 kin.  Thus we are not simply buying off the Gods by offering them
 something that they want, but we are sharing with the Gods something
 that we all take joy in.  Sharing and gift giving was an important
 part of most ancient cultures and had magical significance.  Giving a
 gift was a sign of friendship, kinship, and connection.  By sharing a
 blot with the Gods we reaffirm our connection to them and thus
 reawaken their powers within us and their watchfulness over our world.
 
 A blot can be a simple affair where a horn of mead is consecrated to
 the Gods and then poured as a libation, or it can be a part of a
 larger ritual.  A good comparison is the Catholic Mass which may be
 part of a regular service or special event such as a wedding or
 funeral, or it may be done as a purely magical-religious practice
 without any sermon, hymns, or other trappings.
 
 The blot consists of three parts, the hallowing or consecrating of the
 offering, the sharing of the offering, and the libation.  Each of
 these is equally important.  The only tools required are mead, beer or
 juice, a horn or chalice, a sprig of evergreen used to sprinkle the
 mead, and a ceremonial bowl known as a Hlautbowl into which the
 initial libation will be made.
 
 The blot begins with the consecration of the offering.  The Gothi
 (Priest) or Gythia (Priestess) officiating at the blot invokes the God
 or Goddess being honored.  This is usually accomplished by a spoken
 declaration with ones arms being held above ones head in a Y shape, in
 imitation of the rune elhaz.  This posture is used for most
 invocations and prayers throughout Asatru.  After the spoken
 invocation an appropriate rune or other symbol of the God or Goddess
 may be drawn in the air with the finger or with the staff.  Once the
 God is invoked, the Gothi takes up the horn.  His assistant pours mead
 from the bottle into the horn.  The Gothi then traces the hammer sign
 (an upside down T) over the horn as a blessing and holds it above his
 head offering it to the Gods.  He then speaks a request that the God
 or Goddess bless the offering and accept it as a sacrifice.  At the
 least one will feel the presence of the deity; at best one will be
 able to feel in some inner way the God taking of the mead and drinking
 it.
 
 The mead is now not only blessed with divine power but has passed the
 lips of the God or Goddess.  The Gothi then takes a drink of the horn
 and it is passed around the gathered folk.  Although it sounds like a
 very simple thing, it can be a very powerful experience.  At this
 point the mead is no longer simply a drink but is imbued with the
 2835
 
 blessing and power of the God or Goddess being honored.  When one
 drinks, one is taking that power into oneself.  This is the essence of
 the rune Gebo.  After the horn has made the rounds once, the Gothi
 again drinks from the horn and then empties the remainder into the
 hlautbowl.  The Gothi then takes up the evergreen sprig and his
 assistant the Hlautbowl and the Gothi sprinkles the mead around the
 circle or temple or onto the altar.  If there are a great number of
 the folk gathered, one may wish to drop the drinking and merely
 sprinkle the various folk with the mead as a way of sharing it.  In a
 small group one might merely drink as the blessing.
 
 When this is done the Hlautbowl is taken by the Gothi and poured out
 onto the ground.  This is done as an offering not only to the God
 invoked at the blot, but it is also traditional to remember the Earth
 Mother at this time, since it is being poured onto her ground.  Many
 invocations mention the God, Goddess, or spirit being sacrificed to,
 and then Mother Earth, as in the Sigrdrifa Prayer .Hail to the Gods
 and to the Goddesses as well; Hail Earth that gives to all men..
 (Sigrdrifumal 3) With this action, the blot is ended.
 
 Obviously this is a very sparse ritual and if performed alone could be
 completed in only a few minutes.  This is as it should be, for blots
 are often poured not because it is a time of gathering or festivity
 for the folk, but because the blot must be poured in honor or petition
 of a God or Goddess on their holiday or some other important occasion.
 For example, a father tending his sick child might pour a blot to Eir
 the Goddess of healing.  Obviously he doesn.t have time to waste on
 the .trappings. of ritual.  The intent is to make an offering to the
 Goddess as quickly as possible.  At some times a full celebration
 might not be made of a holiday because of a persons hectic schedule,
 but at the least a blot should be made to mark the occasion.  However,
 in most cases a blot will at least be accompanied by a statement of
 intent at the beginning and some sort of conclusion at the end.  It
 might also be interspersed with or done at the conclusion of ritual
 theater or magic.
 
 The Sumbel
 
 One of the most common celebrations noted in tales of our ancestors is
 the Sumbel or ritual drinking celebration.  This was a more mundane
 and social sort of ritual than the blot, but of no less importance.
 When Beowulf came to Hrothgar, the first thing they did was to drink
 at a ritual sumbel.  This was a way of establishing Beowulf.s identity
 and what his intent was, and doing so in a sacred and traditional
 manner.  At the sumbel toasts are drunk to the Gods, as well as to a
 persons ancestors or personal heroes.  Rather than a toast, a person
 might also offer a brag or some story, song, or poem that has
 significance.  The importance is that at the end of the toast, story,
 or whatever, the person offering it drinks from the horn, and in doing
 so .drinks in. what he spoke.
 
 The sumbel is also an important time for the folk to get to know each
 other in a more intimate way than most people are willing to share.
 Modern society is at two extremes.  At one end are the emotionless
 beings who have been robbed of their soul by modern industrial secular
 culture.  On the other side are those pathetic .sensitive New-Age
 guys. who spend their lives consciously attempting to stir their
 emotions and who force an unnatural level of intimacy between
 2836
 
 themselves and others.  There are some levels of emotional intimacy
 which are not meant to be openly shared with strangers.  Doing so
 reduces their meaning to the mundane.  At sumbel, barriers can be
 lowered in a place which is sacred to the Gods and the Folk.  Thoughts
 can be shared among companions and friends without embarrassment or
 forced intimacy.
 
 One format for the sumbel with a history in tradition is to drink
 three rounds.  The first is dedicated to the Gods, the second to great
 heroes of the folk such as historical figures or heroes from the
 sagas, and the third to personal ancestors, heroes, or friends which
 have passed from this world.
 
 Another theme for a sumbel is past, present, and future.  This type of
 sumbel is more of a magical ritual than one of celebration.  The idea
 is to make toasts which bring up some aspect of your past, and present
 situation, and a third toast or brag which represents your wishes for
 the future.  One might make a toast to the first Asatru ritual one
 attended as the past, a second to the companions and kindred then
 gathered, and for his third toast might state that he intends to be
 initiated as a Gothi in the coming year.  The purpose would be to link
 the coming event of his initiation with the two already accomplished
 events of pledging Asatru and finding a kindred . two other important
 rites of passage.  In this case initiation as a Gothi then becomes
 something which is linked to a chain of events that have already
 occurred, rather than an isolated action which might occur.  Thus
 magically, this moves the person towards his initiation.
 
 A third and everpopular type of sumbel is a free-for-all where stories
 are told, toasts are made, and bragging is done until all the gathered
 Odinists are under the table.  Perhaps this is not quite so esoteric
 or purposeful as the previous ideas, but it.s certainly in keeping
 with the examples of our Gods and ancestors! Joy is better than guilt!
 
 These are only ideas.  The sumbel is a very open ended type of thing
 and the framework is very simple to adapt.
 
 One thing important to note about any Asatru ritual is that ours is a
 holistic religion.  We do not limit our Gods or spirituality to a
 certain time and place.  While the sacrament of the blot is usually
 poured as part of a ceremony, the feast afterwards, singing of sacred
 songs, reciting of poetry, Morris Dancing, etc are all part of our
 religion.  A truly traditional celebration might begin with a rather
 informal greeting of the dawn, involve May Dancing and .mystery
 plays,. then move on to a more structured Blot, and finally to a feast
 capped by a sumbel.  On the other side of things, there.s no reason
 why at a family feast one might not simply pour a bottle of beer or
 mead as an offering without the other trappings of a blot.
 
 Profession
 
 Profession is one of the most important ceremonies in Asatru.  To
 Profess one.s belief in and kinship to the Gods should be an important
 turning point in ones life and the beginning of a new understanding of
 the self.  Profession is, however, a very simple and rather short
 ceremony.  In our kindred we usually profess people after beginning
 the ritual, but before we offer the formal blot.
 
 2837
 
 Profession is not an occult or initiatory ceremony.  It is nothing
 less than it.s name: one professes (declares, affirms) his wish to
 become one of the Asafolk.  This oath is usually taken by the
 Kindred-Gothi on the oath ring or some other Holy object as follows:
 
 The Gothi stands in front of the altar and says .Will [insert name
 here] please come forward.. After he or she does so .Are you here of
 your own free will? Is it your intention to solemnly swear allegiance
 and kinship to the Gods of Asgard, the Aesir and Vanir?. If the answer
 to both these questions is in the affirmative the Gothi takes up the
 oath ring and holds it out to the person professing and says .Repeat
 after me.  I swear to ever uphold the Raven Banner of Asgard, to
 follow the way of the North, to always act with honor and bravery, and
 to be ever true to the Aesir and Vanir and to Asatru.  By the Gods I
 so swear.  By my honor I so swear.  On this Holy Ring I do swear.
 Hail the Gods.. The kindred then replies .Hail the Gods!. and the
 Gothi finishes .Then be welcome to the service of Asgard and the Folk
 of the Asatru..
 
 There may be other celebrations connected to a Profession, just as
 other religions hold Bar Mitzvah or Confirmation parties.  When
 someone joins our kindred, we hold a Sumbel of nine rounds, each
 dedicated to one of the values of Asatru (see below) and toast those
 values to the new kinsman.
 
 
 The Holidays
 
 The ancient Norse knew four major holidays the Spring and Autumn
 Equinoxes which we call Summer and Winter Finding, and the two
 solstices which we call Midsummer and Yule.  However, there were many
 other minor festivals and modern Asatru have added even more.  A
 calendar of our kindred.s rituals is provided in an appendix and I
 also encourage anyone to find as many as one is willing to meet for.
 We meet monthly, but some groups meet 8 times a year and also
 celebrate the cross-quarter days of May Day/Walpurgis,
 Halloween/Samhain, February eve or The Charming of the Plow, and
 Lammastide or Freyfaxi,
 
 Most of our rituals also honor only one or a few Gods or Goddesses at
 any one time.  However, there is no reason why the entire pantheon
 should not be offered prayers and thanks at any occasion.  This would
 be particularly appropriate at the major holidays.  Unlike most other
 groups in the Neo-Pagan movement, we do not necessarily honor Gods in
 male/female pairs.  The boy/girl notion is one taken from the Pagan
 fertility religion of Wicca and isn.t necessarily appropriate to our
 Gods, who often represent things other than fertility.  So while a
 Spring ritual held in honor of Freya and Frey as fertility deities
 might wish to honor them together, there is no reason to include Frigg
 in a ritual dedicated to Odin as the God of War.
 
 Yule
 
 Yule is the most important holiday of the year.  Everyone is familiar
 with the shortness of the deep winter days, but in the Scandinavian
 countries this is of even greater importance.  At the Yuletide there
 is almost no sunlight at all, and the climate would have people bound
 in their homes waiting for the return of Spring.
 2838
 
 Yule is a long festival, traditionally held to be 12 days or more.
 After Yule the days began to get longer and the festival represented
 the breaking of the heart of winter and the beginning of the new year.
 Yule was the holiday of either Thor or Frey, although there is no
 reason not to honor both Gods in modern practice.  Frey is the God of
 fertility and farming and was honored at Yule in the hopes that his
 time would soon return.  Thor was the sworn enemy of the Frost Giants
 and Jotunn who ruled the winter months, and as such was honored as the
 God who.s actions fought off these creatures and brought back the
 spring.  Sunna, the Goddess of the Sun, should also be honored at
 Yule, although she is held at more important during the summer months
 when she is at her strongest.
 
 The most important symbols of Yule are still with us today.  Most of
 the supposedly secular customs of Christmas are actually Pagan in
 origin.  Evergreen trees and holly which remained green throughout the
 long nights and cold were a promise that spring would once again
 return to the land.  These symbols may also have been a connection to
 the nature spirits who have sway over the return of the warm days.
 The modern conception of Santa Claus as an elf, for whom offerings of
 milk and cookies are left, is probably a modern continuation of
 leaving offerings for the Alvar and other nature spirits.  The idea of
 children staying up all night in the hopes of catching a glimpse of
 Santa Claus may be a remnant of people staying awake to mark the long
 night and remind the sun to return.  (In the latter case it.s
 considered an adequate substitution to leave a candle going all night
 to light the way for the returning sun.)
 
 Yule is a weeks long festival, not just a single holiday.  The Yule
 season begins on the solstice, which is the Mother Night of Yule, and
 ends with Twelfth Night on January sixth.  As a point of interest,
 January seventh is St.  Distaff.s day, which Nigel Pennic has
 suggested may have been a day sacred to Frigg, whose symbol is the
 distaff.
 
 While one might expect a rather dour theme to a holiday held in the
 darkness and cold, Yule is a time of feasting and gladness.
 
 In various places different Gods were held to be the most important at
 Yule.  Thor was honored because it is he who fights and kills the
 Jotunn, who surely are the ones responsible for the loss of warmth in
 the world.  Yule was when Thor broke the back of winter and allowed
 the warmth to slowly return to the world.  Frey was also honored
 because it was he who married Gerd and warmed her heart, returning
 fertility to the world.
 
 There are simply so many different Yule customs, both ancient and
 modern, that one has almost limitless possibilities even when staying
 within Scandanavian and Germanic customs.  In modern practice one
 might honor Sunna on the Mother Night, then hold a blot a few days
 later to Thor, a feast for New Years day which is shared with the
 house and land spirits, and then finish on Twelfth Night with a ritual
 to Frey, whose time is then officially beginning.
 
 Summer Finding
 
 Summer Finding is also known to many groups as Ostara, the holiday
 sacred to the Goddess for whom the modern Easter is named.  She is a
 2839
 
 fertility Goddess and her symbols are the hare and the egg.  She was
 an important Goddess of spring to the ancient Saxons, but we know
 little else of her other than this.  Some have suggested that Ostara
 is merely an alternate name for Frigg or Freya, but neither of these
 Goddesses seem to have quite the same fertility function as Ostara
 does.  Frigg seems too high class to be associated with such an earthy
 festival and Freya.s form of fertility is more based on eroticism than
 reproduction.
 
 The obvious folk tradition at this time of year involves eggs.  These
 were colored as they are today, but then they were buried, or more
 appropriately, planted in the earth.  Some have suggested that the act
 was purely magical, the fertility of the eggs would then be
 transferred from the animal realm to the plant realm and would
 increase the prosperity of the harvest.  It.s also possible that they
 were left as an offering to the alvar and the spirits of the plants.
 
 In any case a blot should be prepared to the Goddess of Spring,
 however one wishes to honor her, and also to the spirits of the land.
 
 Midsummer Day
 
 The summer solstice was second only to Yule in importance to the
 ancient Northmen.  Some groups mark this day as sacred to Balder, but
 we disagree with this.  While Balder can be seen as a dying and
 resurrected Sun God, in the mythology we are most familiar with, he
 does not return to life until Ragnarok and it seems like .bad karma.
 to symbolically kill the sun when you know he doesn.t come back until
 the end of the world.  Instead, we mark this day as sacred to the
 Goddess Sunna, who is literally the sun.
 
 One idea for midsummer is to remain awake all night and mark the
 shortest night of the year, then at sunrise to perform a .Greeting of
 Sunna. and a blot to her.
 
 Another midsummer custom is the rolling of a flaming wagon wheel down
 a hill to mark the turning of the wheel of the year.  If fire would
 otherwise be a hazard, one could parade a wheel covered with candles
 for similar effect.  It is also a time for general merriment and in
 the Scandinavian countries many of what we know as the traditional May
 Day rituals such as May Poles and Morris Dances were instead
 celebrated at Midsummer.
 
 Winter Finding
 
 I have not come across a great deal of traditional lore about the
 Autumn Equinox which we know as Winter Finding.  It seems to have been
 overshadowed to some extent by the Winter Nights which we celebrate at
 the equinox rather than at the more traditional time of mid-November.
 
 If one wishes not to do this, the Winter Finding would be a festival
 of harvest.  One should hold a Blot to whichever Gods of fertility
 seem most appropriate and then hold a large feast, concerntrating on
 vegetables that are currently in season.
 
 Winter Nights
 
 The Winter Nights are the traditional festival honoring the Disir or
 2840
 
 family spirits.  It is a time to remember your family, the dead, and
 your ancestors.  (For more information on the Disir see the chapter
 .Elves and other Spirits..)
 
 A Freyablot may be performed at this time as Freya is known as the
 Vanadis (i.e.  the Dis of the Vanir) or the Great Dis, and she seems
 to be the Goddess of the Disir themselves.  This is probably connected
 to Freya.s position as recipient of half the battle-slain.  One might
 also simply want to honor the Disir as a whole, or attempt to summon
 and pour offering to your own family.s Dis.  A sumbel which toasts
 ones ancestors and passed on friends would also be in order.  If a
 feast is held, it should be quiet and respectful of the character of
 the season.  Another idea is a silent .mum feast,. a custom which is
 found the world over.
 
 The various Halloween customs such as dressing in costume or
 celebrating this time as a time where the worlds of the living and the
 dead connect are more Celtic in origin than Nordic and probably should
 not be part of an Asatru celebration.
 
 
 The Gods of Asgard
 
 The Old Norse reckoned that there were three races of Gods: the Aesir,
 the Vanir, and the Jotunn.  The Aesir are those beings most often
 referred to in the ancient literature simply as .the Gods.. They are
 the Gods of society, representing things such as Kingship, Craft, etc.
 The Vanir are more closely connected to the earth and represent the
 fecundity of the land and the natural forces which help mankind.  Once
 there was a great war between the Aesir and the Vanir, but this was
 eventually settled and Frey, Freya, and Njord came to live with the
 Aesir to seal the peace.  The Jotunn are a third race of Gods and at
 constant war with the Aesir, but there is and never will be peace in
 this battle.  The Jotunn are never called Gods, but rather referred to
 as giants.  They represent the natural forces of chaos and destruction
 as the Aesir represent forces of order and society.  Just as fire and
 ice mix to form the world, this creative interaction of chaos and
 order maintains the balance of the world.  In the end the two sides
 will meet in the great battle of Ragnarok and the world will be
 destroyed, only to be reborn.
 
 The Norse Gods were not held to be all powerful or immortal.  Their
 youth was maintained very precariously by the magickal apples of the
 Goddess Idunna.  More importantly at the end of the world a good
 number of the Gods will die in battle.  The Northern view of the world
 was a practical one with little assurance for the future and little
 perfection and the Gods are no exception.
 
 The Gods in the Temple: Odin, Thor, and Frey
 
 The three most important Gods were held to be Odin, Thor, and Frey.
 These were the deities whose statutes stood at the altar of the temple
 at Upsalla.  They are considered the most important because of what
 they represent.  Mythologer Georges Dumezil has linked these three
 deities with the three classes of Indo-European culture: the Kings,
 the Warriors, and the Farmers.  Although the fit is not an exact one,
 it is probably true that these three deities most concretely
 symbolized the various aspects of life and culture and most people
 2841
 
 would have found a God who represented their life-experience in one of
 these three deities.
 
 Odin is the Allfather, remembered today best as a God of war and of
 the berserk rage of the Vikings.  However, he has other aspects which
 are just as strong or stronger.  In the Eddas, he is the King of the
 Gods, but this is a position which most of the Germanic peoples
 attributed to Tyr.  It.s likely that Odin only became King during the
 Viking Age.  Being the Allfather, his original position of leadership
 was probably familial rather than legislative.  Most importantly he is
 a God of transcendent wisdom and in relation to that a God of magick.
 He is the God of the Runes, the magical alphabet which holds the
 mysteries of the universe within it.  In most of the non-Viking
 countries, Odin.s warrior aspect was played down.  In England, where
 he is known as Woden, he is a gray cloaked wanderer (the inspiration
 for Tolkien.s Gandalf) who travels the country, usually alone,
 surveying his land.  Here again we see him in the position of a father
 figure, a warder of the land but not necessarily a King.  Odin is also
 a God of the dead.  Half of the slain in battles go to him to prepare
 for the Ragnarok.  (The remaining half go to Freya.) He also has
 associations with the dead as a practitioner of Seidhr, a form of
 shamanic magick which he learned from Freya and used on various
 occasions to travel to Hel and seek the knowledge of those who have
 passed from this world.  It.s difficult to classify Odin simply
 because he was such a popular God during the last stages of Norse
 Paganism and thus absorbed many traits of other Gods.
 
 Thor is probably the best known of the Norse Gods.  He is a simple
 God, the patron of farmers and other folk who are .wise, but not too
 wise. as the Eddas advise us to be.  Thor is best known for wandering
 the world in search of adventure; usually found in the form of giants
 or other monsters to kill.  He possesses tremendous strength and the
 hammer Mjolnir, which was made for him by the Dwarfs.  Mjolnir is
 considered to be the Gods greatest treasure because it is sure
 protection from the forces of chaos.  Using Mjolnir, Thor is a warrior
 figure, but he is less a professional warrior than a common man called
 upon to defend his land.  He loves battle not for itself as do the
 berserkers of Odin, nor does he have a strong code of honor such as
 that of Tyr.in fact he chronically breaks with honor and kills giants
 whether they have the protection of .hospitality. or not.  Thor is
 associated with thunder, and is also the God of rain and storms, but
 it.s important to note that he is not the God of destructive storms.
 Thor is nature as a benefit to man.  The Jotunn are held to be the
 source of the destruction found in nature.  Thor was the God of
 .everyman.. He was simple in purpose, strong, and free.  He was most
 beloved of the freemen farmers who populated the Germanic lands.
 
 Frey is a God of peace and fertility.  If Thor is the God of the
 farmer, then Frey is the God of the crops themselves.  His symbol is
 the priapus and his blessings were sought at planting and other
 important agricultural festivals.  The word .frey. means .Lord. and
 it.s unsure if this is the Gods name or his title.  He is also known
 as Ing.  We do not known a great deal more about Frey as few myths
 have survived which give us any insight into his character.  As much
 as he is a God of fertility, he is also a God of peace and Ing was
 said to have brought a Golden Age of peace and prosperity to old
 Denmark.  Horses are held to be sacred to Frey, probably because of
 fertility connections.
 2842
 
 Goddesses
 
 In general we know much less about how our ancestors worshipped the
 Goddesses than the Gods.  Later Norse culture was very bound up with
 the vikings and it is likely that the Goddesses were deemphasized at
 this point.  More importantly, virtually all the mythology we have
 today was recorded during the Christian period and Christian culture
 had little respect for women, least of all independent and strong
 women like those of Nordic society.
 
 Freya is the most important of the Goddesses or at least that Goddess
 about which we known the most.  She was the sister of Frey and along
 with him was sent to live with the Aesir in order to seal a peace
 agreement.  Freya is a Goddess with two distinct sides to her.  First,
 she is the Goddess of love and beauty and second a Goddess of war who
 shares the battle-slain with Odin.  Unlike our modern culture, the
 ancients saw no contradiction in this.  She was also a sorceress who
 practiced the shamanic magick known as Seidhr, which she taught to
 Odin.  Freya is the Goddess most often invoked by independent women.
 While she is a Goddess of beauty, she is not dependent on men as is
 the stereotype of so many love Goddesses, but is strong and fiercely
 independent.  She is also known as the Great Dis and probably has
 connections to the family spirits known as the Disir.  In many ways
 she is like Odin in that she is a Goddess of many functions which are
 not always obviously related.  In modern Asatru, many groups have
 replaced Frey with Freya to stand with Odin and Thor on the altar.
 
 Frigg is a most misunderstood Goddess.  She is the wife of Odin and
 many people are too willing to let her be known simply as that.
 However, the old Norse had a much different idea of the place of women
 and of marriage in general.  While marriages for love were certainly
 known, marriage was also a business and social arrangement and there
 were important duties for a wife.  These were symbolized by a set of
 keys which hung at the belt of all .goodwives.. This symbolized that
 the home was under the control of the woman of the house, who was
 equal to her husband.  Today we think these duties as very minor, but
 a thousand years ago they were far from trivial.  Up until this
 century most of Europe lived in extended families.  A house,
 especially a hall of a warrior, was not merely a small building with a
 nuclear family, but an entire settlement with outbuildings, servants,
 slaves, and an entire clan.  The wife of the house was in charge of
 stores and trading with other clans.  It was she that saw to the
 upkeep of the farm, the balancing of the books, and even to the
 farming itself if her husband was away trading or making war.  It was
 as much a job of managing a business as it was being a .wife.. For
 these reasons Frigg is still very important and can easily be invoked
 beyond the home.  She would, for example, be a natural patron for
 someone who owned a business.  Frigg also shares a lot of
 characteristics with her husband.  She is the only other God who is
 allowed to sit in Odin.s seat from which can be seen all that goes on
 in the nine worlds.  It is said that she knows the future, but remains
 silent, which is entirely in keeping with the way women of the time
 exercised their power: namely indirectly.  While in a better world
 this might not be necessary, it is still an important tool for women
 who must exist in a world where men are sometimes threatened by them.
 While Freya is a Goddess who acts independent of .traditional. roles,
 Frigg is a Goddess who works within those roles, but still maintains
 her power and independence.
 2843
 
 Other Gods
 
 There are of course many other Gods and Goddesses.  Some of these have
 important places in the myths, while some others are mentioned only
 once along with their function.
 
 Loki
 
 The most perplexing God of Asgard is Loki.  He was probably originally
 a fire God, but he is best known as the troublemaker of Asgard.  In
 various minor scrapes Loki arranges to get the Gods into trouble,
 usually by giving away their treasures and then arranging to return
 them.  This is very much in the traditional role of a trickster, who
 keeps things interesting by causing trouble.  However, it.s sometimes
 difficult to see Loki merely as a trickster because his actions are
 sometimes simply too evil to be ignored.  Balder was the most
 beautiful and beloved of the Gods and a pledge was extracted from all
 the things in the world that they would not harm him.  The sole
 exception to this was the mistletoe which was deemed too tiny to be a
 threat.  Amused by his invulnerability, the Gods took turns throwing
 objects at Balder, which of course had no effect on him.  Loki took
 the blind God Hod and put a spring of mistletoe in his hands and
 guided him to throw it.  The dart pierced Balder.s breast and he died.
 Later a deal was arranged wherein Balder would be allowed to return to
 life if all the creatures of the world would weep for him.  Only one
 refused, an ogress who said she cared not a whit for Balder when he
 was alive and thought him just as well off dead.  The ogress is
 believed to have been Loki in disguise.  For these actions Loki was
 chained beneath the earth and it was arranged that venom would drip
 upon him in punishment that would last until the end of the world.
 With the death of Balder, Loki goes beyond the level of trickster and
 becomes a truly evil figure.  It is known that when Ragnarok comes,
 Loki will lead the legions of chaos against the Aesir and bring about
 the end of the world.
 
 Indeed Loki.s actions certainly do seem harsh, but they are entirely
 in keeping with the Norse way of looking at things.  One of the
 functions of a trickster God is to keep things going.  The trickster
 causes trouble so that people may evolve, for nothing brings about
 ingenuity like need.  The Norse did not believe anything was eternal.
 The Gods were mortal and only maintained their youth through the
 magick of Idunna.s apples.  In the end they would die in the battle of
 Ragnarok which would destroy the world.  Balder.s invulnerability was
 not natural.  As the Edda says .Cattle die, and men die, and you too
 shall die.... It was deemed much more wise and valiant by the Norse to
 live up to one.s fate than to try to avoid it.  Likewise to return
 from the dead would be equally wrong.  It.s against nature for
 something to be impervious to harm or for the dead to return to life.
 Loki was merely acting as the agent of nature to return things to
 their normal and correct course.  It was not an act of evil, but an
 intervention to stop an evil against the natural order.  Likewise
 Ragnarok must come.  It is in the nature of the world to be destroyed
 and then be reborn.  Loki is merely acting as an agent of fate:
 exactly the function which a trickster is supposed to perform.
 
 On the other hand, as far as we know Loki was not worshipped, at least
 not in the same way as the other Gods were.  Recognition of his action
 and his place in the universe is essential, but Gods of this type are
 2844
 
 seldom welcome.  It is .fashionable. today to laugh at trickster Gods
 and see them as a sort of jester figure, but we must not forget that
 their nature is much darker than this even when it does serve a
 purpose.  Change is important, but nothing changes the world faster
 and more thoroughly than war.
 
 Tyr
 
 While seldom reckoned today among the most popular of the Gods, Tyr is
 extremely important.  He is the God of battle, of justice, and
 (secondary to Odin) of Kingship.  The most important myth concerning
 Tyr shows both his bravery and honor.  He gave his hand as surety to
 the Fenris Wolf that no trickery was involved in the Gods binding of
 him.  When the fetter in fact did bind the wolf, Tyr lost his hand.
 The honor and reliance on ones word is often overlooked in this myth
 in favor of an interpretation of self sacrifice.  However, throughout
 the myths various deals are made and the Aesir easily get out of them.
 It.s likely that Tyr could have escaped his fate as well, but one.s
 word is one.s word and thus Tyr lost his hand.  Tyr was held to be the
 God of the Thing or assembly.  While the ancient Norse were not truly
 democratic and in fact held slaves, within the noble class all were
 reckoned to be roughly equal.  The Thing was a place where the
 landholders would meet for trade and to iron out disputes among them,
 in the hope of avoiding feuds.  Tyr was originally the chieftain of
 the Aesir and the God of Kingship, but he has been gradually
 supplanted by Odin, especially during the Viking Age.  It is likely
 this was because of Tyr.s strong sense of honor and justice.  For
 raiding and pillaging, Odin, the God of the berserker rage, was a much
 better patron than Tyr, the God of honorable battle.  This is an
 important thing to note about Northern religion: it is extremely
 adaptable.  There are not hard and fast rules about who is what and
 while the nature of the Gods cannot be changed they are more than
 happy to have the aspects most important to their worshippers
 emphasized.  Just as a person uses different skills and .becomes a
 different person. when they move or change jobs, so the Gods too have
 adapted to new climates and needs.
 
 Baldr
 
 While we only know the myth of Balder.s death, it is clear that he was
 a God of some importance.  Unfortunately, modern writers, coming from
 a Christian background, have tried to turn Balder into a Christ
 figure.  Balder was a God of beauty and goodness, but his name also
 translates as .warrior.. It is a mistake to turn him into a .Norse
 Jesus.. The mere fact that he died and will return after Ragnarok is
 not enough for this equation.  Another interpretation of Balder is
 that of the dying and resurrected God of the Sun.  This also seems a
 mistake, as Balder does not return from the land of death.  It makes a
 poor symbol to honor Balder on solar holidays, lest the sun not
 return! The remaining major interpretation of Balder is as a God of
 mystic initiation.  While this fits to some extent, we unfortunately
 no longer know.  The equation with Christ has wiped out a great deal
 of lore about Balder and we are left to rediscover his place in our
 modern practice.
 
 Minor Gods
 
 Of the other important Gods, Heimdall is the guardian of Asgard.  He,
 2845
 
 as Rig, is also one of the Gods who fathered mankind.  Njord is the
 God of sailing and sailors.  Unless one travels on the sea, he is
 probably of little importance to you, but if one does sail, he is your
 natural patron.  If Njord is the God of sailing and of man.s use of
 the sea, then Aegir is the God of the sea itself.  He is married to
 Ran who takes drowned sailors to her home after their death.  Aegir is
 considered to be the greatest of brewers, and our kindred honors him
 in a special holiday due to the importance of mead in our modern
 religion.  Bragi is a much overlooked God who is the patron of
 taletellers and bards.  Other Gods more or less overlooked in the
 myths include Forseti, who renders the best judgments, Ull, a God of
 hunting who is the male counter to Skadi, Vithar, the son of Thor who
 is as strong as his father, Vali, Odin.s son who will avenge his
 fathers death at Ragnarok, and Hod, the blind God who was led to slay
 Balder.
 
 While we might say that certain Gods are more important than others,
 this is in many ways not accurate.  We would be better served to say
 that some are more popular.  The Norse concept of the relationship
 between men and Gods was one of friendship.  A man would honor all the
 Gods as worthy and existent, but would usually find one as his special
 patron.  It is not surprising, considering this, that Thor is the most
 popular of Gods.  If the average person was searching for a God very
 much like himself, Thor would be the obvious choice.  Likewise, a God
 such as Njord would have been extremely important to sailors and
 fishermen, but would have been almost completely unimportant as a
 patron to inlanders.  The less well known Gods are just as powerful as
 their more well known contemporaries, they merely have power over a
 less well known aspect of life.
 
 There are also many Goddesses other than Frigg and Freya, but we know
 very little of them.  Eir was said to be the greatest of healers, and
 is for this reason very important.  There is no healer God as the
 ancients held that medicine was a craft for women and not for men, but
 modern male healers should certainly invoke her.  While Skadi has a
 very small part in the myths, many modern Asafolk find her a
 compelling figure.  She is the snow-shoe Goddess, who travels in the
 isolated mountains hunting with her bow.  She is married to Njord, but
 they are separated as Njord can.t abide the mountains, and Skadi can.t
 sleep in Njord.s hall where she is kept awake by the pounding of the
 sea.  She is an excellent role model for women who work alone and who
 are independently minded.  Oaths are sworn to the Goddess Var, but
 little else is known of her.  Lofn might some day be of importance to
 you, she is known to bring together lovers who are kept apart by
 circumstance.
 
 I have merely touched upon the Gods here.  It is important for
 everyone who would practice the religion of the North to get to know
 the myths and the Gods.  An appendix is included which outlines
 various sources for more information.
 
 
 Elves &amp; Other Spirits
 
 The world of ancient Paganism was hardly limited to the worship of the
 Gods.  There are various other beings who were honored, and .Elf
 worship. was often the hardest part of Paganism for Christians to
 destroy.  It was easy enough to substitute one God for another, but it
 2846
 
 was quite another to tell the common people that the elves which
 brought fertility to the land were not real!
 
 In the various folktales and sagas we find very little which would
 lead us to a concrete system of what spirit was responsible for
 exactly what.  We are sure of the place of the Valkyries, who were
 responsible for bringing the slain to Valhalla, and also for choosing
 who in battle would die.  They seem, judging by their actions, to be
 supernatural beings of some type.  However, Valkyries appear in
 various places as very human figures and their exact nature is
 difficult to determine.  Sigrdrifa was a Valkyrie who was cursed by
 Odin because she refused to bring victory in battle to those whom he
 had chosen.  Her punishment was to be married to a mortal, and the
 implication is clear that this would end her days as a Valkyrie.  It.s
 equally clear that she has great knowledge of the runes as she tutors
 Sigurd after he awakens her.  In most respects she seems to be a
 normal human woman, although a very wise and independent one with
 great powers.  Elsewhere, Voland and his brothers are said to have
 found three Valkyries sunning themselves without their swan-coats.
 When the brothers steal their feather-coats and hide them, the
 Valkyries again appear as otherwise normal women.  This does not seem
 entirely in keeping with a supernatural origin, and it.s possible that
 some kind of magickal order of Priestesses has become confused over
 time with the supernatural beings we know as Valkyries.  The swan-coat
 seems very similar in description to Freya.s falcon-coat and the
 entire issue may be something related to the practice of seidhr.  As
 far as we know, the Valkyrie were not worshipped as such, but were
 considered more the messengers of Odin.  They also serve the mead at
 Valhalla, and because of this whoever pours the mead into the Horn at
 Blot or Sumbel is today known as .the Valkyrie..
 
 The other spirits whose place seems fairly clear are the Disir.  These
 are spirits who are intimately linked with a family.  There is also
 some indication that they are linked with the land, but this would be
 in keeping with the old ways.  We forget sometimes that many
 landowners in Europe have been living in the same place since before
 this continent was discovered.  The land becomes an intimate part of
 the family and its identity, so it is natural that family spirits
 would also oversee the family land.  Disir inevitably are seen as
 women who appear at times of great trouble or change.  They are
 somehow linked to the family bloodline, and seem most closely linked
 to the clanchief.  There is one scene in one saga where a spirit,
 apparently a Dis, is passed on from one person to another who are not
 blood relations.  However, these two friends are closer than brothers,
 so while the link is apparently not genetic, it is definitely
 familial.  We know the family Disir were honored with blots at the
 Winter Nights and that they have great power to aid their family.  As
 far as their origin, it.s possible that they are ancestral in origin.
 They may be ancestors whose power was so great that they were able to
 continue to see to their clan.  Or it.s possible that the Disir are
 the collective spirit of the family ancestors.  Freya is called the
 great Dis and there may be some linkage here to her position as a
 seidhrwoman.  We know from the sagas that Seidhr was involved with
 talking to various spirits (including the dead) and its possible that
 this is the source of Freya.s name.  It is also possible that she
 performed much the same function as a Dis to her tribe the Vanir.
 
 Closely linked to the idea of the Disir is the Fylgia.  These spirits
 2847
 
 are attached to an individual person in much the same way that the
 Disir are associated with a family.  Fylgia usually appear either as
 animals or as beautiful women.  They correspond to the .fetch,.
 .totem,. or .power-animal. in other cultures.  Most of the time the
 fylgia remains hidden and absent, it is only with truly great or
 powerful persons that the fylgia becomes known.  They may have
 something to do with Seidhr as well, because many sagas offer evidence
 of spirit travel in the shape of animals.  This corresponds exactly to
 notions of shamanism found in other cultures.
 
 The remaining spirits include Alvar or elves, Dokkalvar or dark elves
 or Dwarfs, kobolds, and landvaettir.  While some have defined one
 being as doing one thing and another serving a different function, I.m
 not inclined to draw very sharp distinctions between these various
 creatures.  They all seem .elfish. in origin, and there seems to me to
 be no pattern of associating one name with a specific function.  We
 know that various landvaettir or land spirits were honored with blots.
 We also know that Frey is the lord of Alfheim, one of the nine worlds
 where the alvar are said to live.
 
 Of all the remaining spirits, the dwarfs are the most consistent in
 description.  We know that the dwarfs are cunning and misanthropic in
 character and incredible smiths, capable of creating magickal objects
 so valuable they are considered the greatest treasures of Asgard.
 Thor.s hammer Mjolnir, Freya.s necklace Brisingamen, and Sif.s golden
 hair are all creations of the dwarfs.  They live beneath the earth and
 have little to do with mankind or the Gods unless one seeks them out.
 What place they had in the religion we no longer know.  It would seem
 wise to invoke them as spirits of the forge, but I can think of little
 other reason to disturb them.
 
 Elves are the most difficult magickal race to pin down.  Mythological
 sources tell us that the Alvar or light elves live in Alfheim where
 Frey is their Lord.  However, we also have the enduring belief in
 folklore of the elves as faery-folk: beings associated with the
 natural world.  These two conceptions of elves might still be linked,
 however, as Alfheim is known to be a place of incredible natural
 beauty, and Frey, their leader, is an agricultural deity.  To further
 confuse this issue, Norse folklore has a strong belief in the
 Landvaettir, or land spirits who may fit into either or both of these
 categories.  I.m inclined to lump them all together as similar beings
 that we simply don.t know enough about to tell apart.  What is
 important is that Asatru, like all Pagan religions, honors the natural
 world and the earth very deeply.  Whether one calls the spirits of the
 land as the elves, the faeries, or the landvaettir, or uses all of
 these terms interchangably, respect is all important.  Asatru is known
 for being one of the most politically .conservative. of the modern
 Pagan religions, but you.ll find few of us who aren.t staunch
 environmentalists.
 
 One of the most important spirits to honor is the house-spirit.
 Folklore is also filled with stories of various spirits variously
 called faeries, elves, kobolds, brownies, tom-tin, etc who inhabit a
 house and see to its proper conduct.  In the usual form of the tale,
 they offer to perform some housekeeping functions, but eventually turn
 on the owners of the house when they are insulted by overpayment.  We
 don.t have any concrete evidence for how our ancestors honored these
 beings, but this is not surprising because such a thing would not be a
 2848
 
 public observance and it.s unlikely it would be recorded in the sagas
 or Eddas.  Folklore indicates that such beings should be honored with
 a simple bowl of milk or perhaps beer, but no more.
 
 In general folklore does not paint the various elves and spirits as
 particularly benevolent figures.  With the exception of house spirits,
 who as spirits of a manmade object are bound to us on some level, they
 seem most interested in staying out of the dealings of mankind.  There
 are numerous stories of people who spy upon elf women and force them
 to become their brides.  Inevitably the women are unhappy and
 eventually escape, leaving their husbands devastated.  There are also
 numerous stories of spirits who haunt the woods and who will drag
 wayward travelers into rivers to drown or to some other untimely
 death.  When people do have dealings with the elves these beings seem
 to operate on an entirely different set of expectations than we do.
 Most of us would be gratified by the gift of a .bonus. from our
 employer, yet time and time again in folklore this is the easiest way
 to anger a house spirit.  We know that elves were honored with blots,
 but it.s just as possible that these ceremonies were made in
 propitiation to them rather than in kinship as are our blots made with
 the Gods.  We suggest caution in dealing with beings with a set of
 values so foreign from our own.  They should be approached in the same
 way one would approach a person from a country whose ways are very
 different.
 
 In general, we.re also very reticent to make decisions about
 classifying the various .other peoples.. It would be very easy to draw
 lines and place certain spirits into little boxes which label their
 function, but that seems overly mechanical and of little utility.
 Elves and other .wights. are not human, and it might be too much to
 try to classify them in other than subjective terms.  It.s probably
 best to simply make your intent clear, experiment, and use the terms
 which work for you, remembering only to be true to the sources.
 
 Demi-Gods
 
 There are a whole classification of Gods which are not truly part of
 the Aesir, Vanir, or even the Jotunn.  Wayland the Smith is the best
 example of this that we can offer.  Wayland, called Volund in the
 Norse version, is the greatest of smiths, but it.s clear in the
 mythology that he was more or less a human man.  The myth tells of how
 he lost his wife and was enslaved by a human King.  While his powers
 allow him to outwit and take vengeance on the king, it.s clear
 throughout that he.s not on the level of a Thor or an Odin.  What one
 does about these demi-Gods or local Gods is a good question.  I see
 nothing wrong with pouring a blot in their honor and dealing with them
 as you would any other God or Goddess.  On the other hand, they are
 not part of the Aesir and I think it might be disrespectful to honor
 them with the Aesir or as part of a ceremony dedicated to the Aesir as
 they seem of a different nature.
 
 Ancestor Worship:
 
 Honoring ones ancestors was one of the most sacred duties of the
 Norsemen.  One of the most important parts of greeting new people was
 the exchanging of personal lineages at sumbel.  The worship of the
 Disir is closely linked to ancestor worship.  However, it is difficult
 for modern day Pagans to seriously engage in ancestor worship.  We are
 2849
 
 for the most part without a strong connection to our heritage, and
 even if we feel motivated we would probably need to skip at least a
 thousand years back to find ancestors who would not have been appalled
 by our Heathen beliefs.  One substitution for ancestor worship in the
 modern Asatru movement has been the veneration of heros from the Sagas
 and legends of our people.
 
 The manner of how we honor ancestors is also somewhat troubling.  I
 reserve the blot ritual to Gods and other powers, and I.m not sure if
 it.s appropriate to pour a blot to an ancestor, no matter how
 important he was.  It.s touchy when you are honoring someone that you
 knew was a mortal.  I think the most important part of ancestor
 worship is remembering, and the sumbel seems the most important part
 of that.
 
 While we discuss ancestry, I must mention that some modern Asatru
 groups, in part because of holdovers from 19th century cultural
 movements, have placed a great deal of emphasis on ancestry in terms
 of race.  Many have held that Asatru was a religion for whites or
 Northern Europeans only.  In my not particularly humble opinion, this
 is pure idiocy.  The basic argument for this is that people of other
 cultures do not share the same background and values.  This is
 certainly true, but the key word in my opinion is culture, and all
 Americans by definition share a culture.  Also, while I admit I would
 think it doubtful that people from outside of our own cultural
 heritage would be attracted greatly to Asatru, if they are it is for a
 reason and they should be welcomed and not shunned.  It proves the
 worth of our religion and way of life that it is so strong that one
 would leave his own cultural path behind to take up ours.
 
 As far as culture is concerned, the ancestry of the ancient North is
 alive and well in modern America.  A thousand years ago settlers
 sailed to Iceland to avoid the growing influence of powerful kings and
 centralized government.  This centralization of power was one of the
 things which Roman Christianity brought with it.  Two hundred years
 ago we in America rebelled against our king for much the same reasons.
 Our culture is much more profoundly influenced by the Vikings than
 most would care to admit.  Our law is based on English common law,
 which in turn has roots in Norman and Saxon law.  (Both the Saxons and
 Normans were descended from Germanic tribes.) Our culture is based on
 many of the same ideas which the Northmen held dear: the importance of
 the individual and the belief that individual rights outweighed
 collective rights.  Thus, it is my assertion that we are all
 descended, at least in part, spiritually from the ancient Norse.
 
 The Jotunn
 
 The Jotunn or giants are the sworn enemies of the Gods.  While the
 Aesir represent order and the Vanir represent the supportive powers of
 nature, the Jotunn represent chaos and the power of nature to destroy
 man and act independent of humankind.  In the end, it is the Jotunn
 who will fight the Gods at Ragnarok and bring about the destruction of
 the world.
 
 In essence despite being called Giants or Ogres, the Jotunn are Gods
 just as much as the Aesir or Vanir.  In many cases they correspond
 very closely to the Fomoire in Celtic mythology.  Most simply put, the
 Jotunn are the Gods of all those things which man has no control over.
 2850
 
 The Vanir are the Gods of the growing crops, the Jotunn are the Gods
 of the river which floods and washes away those crops or the tornado
 which destroys your entire farm.  This is why they are frightening and
 this is why we hold them to be evil.
 
 The Jotunn are not worshipped in modern Asatru, but there is some
 evidence that sacrifices were made to them in olden times.  In this
 case, sacrifices were probably made .to them. rather than shared .with
 them. as was the case with the Vanir and Aesir.  It would be
 inappropriate to embrace them as friends and brothers in the way we
 embrace our Gods.  One doesn.t embrace the hurricane or the wildfire;
 it is insanity to do so.  However, we must also remember that fact
 that we see their actions as bad, they are not inherently evil.  The
 storm destroys the crops, but it also brings cleansing and renewal.
 We humans are only one species on this planet and in the end we are
 both expendable and irrelevant to nature.  This is the manner in which
 the Jotunn act, and it is not surprising that we see this as evil.
 
 However, one must also take into account the premonitions of Ragnarok
 recorded in the eddas.  If the Jotunn are merely amoral, why are they
 the sworn enemy of the Aesir and why will they bring about the end of
 the world? It.s possible that Jotunn was more of a catch-all term for
 dangerous Gods rather than a reference to a specific family.  (It is
 the case in many languages that there is one word for people that
 speak the language, usually translating as .people,. and another term
 for those persons of other cultures and tribes.) The dangerous forces
 of nature are .Jotunn. because we cannot control them, but there are
 other forces, principally those of chaos, that are considered .Jotunn.
 as well.
 
 There is abundant evidence for this in the Eddas.  Various Jotunn are
 seen to marry into the Aesir without a great deal of trouble from the
 Gods, but at other times the mere sight of one throws Thor into a
 rage.  The obvious conclusion is that they are more than one specific
 race of deities.  The destructive powers of nature were tolerated to
 some extent, and often married into the Aesir bringing them more under
 control.  However, other .outlander. Gods were completely destructive
 to the Aesir (and thus mankind) and the Gods only thought for them was
 death.
 
 
 The Religious Structure of Asatru
 
 The ancients, for the most part, did not have an organized system of
 Temples or churches in the way that our society does today.  Religion
 was a very personal affair, mostly between the Gods and their
 worshippers.  If there was a formalized temple or perhaps a grove that
 was dedicated to the Gods and tended as a temple it was most likely
 built by a wealthy landowner and dedicated to his or her patron God.
 Such a person would then, usually, become the Gothi (Priest) or Gythia
 (Priestess) of the temple.  Such temples were generally maintained by
 the family after the builders death, the title being more or less
 inherited by whomever was lord over the land.
 
 Today most Asatru groups are similarly unstructured.  This has been a
 problem because there is little in the way of religious education
 other than in books such as this one and personal research.  While
 this sort of learning is fine, there are always some things left out
 2851
 
 and I.m sure that mine will be no exception.  There are a few groups
 who are attempting to initiate training programs and present sets of
 standards for people who would declare themselves to be Gothi or
 Gythia, but these groups have unfortunately been somewhat inflexible
 and dogmatic, seeming more interested in creating hierarchies than
 with service to the Folk or Gods.
 
 Gothi is a honorary title only.  It does not mark any administrative
 power or rank within Asatru.  One would probably not call oneself
 Gothi unless one had some experience of deity and had led many
 rituals, but as it entails power over no one and it is up to no one to
 comment on ones qualifications or abilities.  Similarly there is no
 need for someone to be a Gothi or to have access to one in order to
 practice our faith.  While the more experienced might get more things
 .right. in the ritual, this is purely subjective and if your heart is
 true to the Gods this is enough.
 
 Most persons who were given the title Gothi in the old days were
 dedicated to a single God.  The title most often formed their last
 name: Thorolf Thorsgothi for example.  This dedication to a God or
 Goddess was usually part of one.s family heritage and was passed down
 to your children.  While there is no compelling reason why one cannot
 act as Priest to the entire community of Gods and Goddesses, it is
 most common for one to be dedicated to a single deity.  A kindred may
 have persons who are each dedicated to a different deity, or it may
 orient itself towards a single deity as did families in the Sagas.
 
 The most basic unit of Asatru religious worship is the hearth or
 homestead.  This is nothing more than it sounds like: a household of
 Asafolk who worship the old Gods and Goddesses.  Several individuals
 or hearths may group themselves into a .kindred,. which is a term that
 has many meanings to many different groups.  Some kindreds have many
 members and function like mainstream churches, others are more
 familylike and attempt to hold to their privacy.  The place of a
 kindred is more or less analogous to a clan or small tribal group.  A
 kindred is made up of people you are familiar with and with whom you
 meet in person and in it.s best sense it.s an organic grouping,
 however it.s not the same sort of bonding that one would find in a
 single family or even in an extremely close knit group of friends.  In
 a true Pagan society, the kindred would be found on the level of a
 farmstead or small village.
 
 The ritual blots are most commonly done on the level of the kindred,
 or in meetings where more than one kindred comes together.  The
 rituals of a Hearth might be less formalized and more .homey. in
 atmosphere.  The blot ritual is based on a religious observance that
 was part of the official public aspect of ancient Asatru, and its
 likely that there were many other private rituals that would not
 necessarily be appropriate for a kindred to take part in together.
 For example, a kindred might not honor the individual family Dis or
 the house-spirits unless all members of the kindred lived together or
 were tied by blood as well as companionship.
 
 Most persons will want to join or found a kindred in their area,
 however, before one runs out and begins to solicit people, you should
 think about what you are doing.  The very name of our groupings,
 .kindred,. implies a great deal more than does membership in a church.
 Today we are accustomed to religious institutions that are more or
 2852
 
 less anonymous and sterile.  A kindred should not be this way.  While
 we must be open to all, we need not act as if we were a public
 facility with no more intimacy than a department store.  It is best to
 start small and gather people as they come to you.  Once you are
 established, get involved in the local Pagan community if you are not
 already.  Attend a few events of the local Leif Erikson society or the
 Sons of Norway.  Open one of your blots to the public and take note of
 people who are attracted to Asatru.  A kindred is something which
 should form organically and cannot be pushed.  On the other hand,
 Asatru is not a secret religion or one open only to .initiates. as
 many Neo-Pagan faiths are.  We must be open to outsiders who are truly
 interested.  I am just cautioning against throwing people into a
 kindred because they are available or it is the only group around or
 they are too polite to say no.  A roommate of mine related to me a
 conversation he had with another person at an Asatru gathering.  The
 person remarked that .this is all very nice, but when do you think Joe
 will get tired of this stuff.. My roommate being a seriously committed
 Heathen straightened him out.  The person in question was just a
 friend of Joe.s who went to Pagan events because of Joe.s interest.
 He assumed that the rest of the group was .humoring Joe. just as he
 was.  The moral of this story is that if people are not interested,
 there.s nothing you can do about it.  We.re not the Christians who
 want anybody and everybody to join our faith, and we should pay just
 as much attention to dissuading the dabblers and the kooks as we do to
 attracting those who truly do have the love of the Old Gods in their
 hearts.
 
 As to what makes one a Gothi, the requirements would vary from group
 to group.  Some might have written criteria, while others might leave
 it up to the persons heart.  Certainly a Gothi is one who has a long
 term relationship with the Gods and Goddesses.  One does not, for
 example, simply read this book and then proclaim oneself Gothi! (I am
 writing this book and don.t consider myself to be a Gothi.) A
 competent Gothi should have studied the Eddas and Sagas and know the
 history of our religion.  He or she should also know a bit about the
 runes, and the other mysteries of our tradition.  One should also note
 that this is a public office and the Gothi of old had responsibilities
 as leaders of the community.  Most importantly one must be sincerely
 dedicated.  There.s no push to move to a .higher. level of the
 Priesthood as there are in religions or magickal orders with .degree
 systems. and if you do not feel compelled to take on the
 responsibilities of being a Gothi or Gythia, there is no need for you
 to and much to say that you should not.
 
 
 The Values of Asatru
 
 One of the basic functions of a religion is to offer a set of values
 on which mankind is to base it's actions.  This, sadly, is one area
 where Paganism has often failed.  The cult of anti-values has held
 sway, taking moral relativism to extremes perhaps even farther from
 common sense than fundamentalist moral legalism, even to the point
 where I have heard rape, murder, and genocide defended on the basis of
 "cultural differences."
 
 However, values remain important.  All one needs to do is look at the
 morning paper to see the results of a society that has in many ways
 embraced the cult of anti-values.  Thievery, murder, and plunder exist
 2853
 
 in our cities to extents which would have appalled our ancestors.no
 matter how many times they went a' Viking.  While this is hardly what
 the Pagans who have embraced the cult of anti-values had in mind, it
 is to my belief a natural outgrowth of the same basic philosophical
 concept.  The chaos in our country is the dark shadow of the modern
 rejection of moral legalism.  What should have been an evolution from
 a legalistic moral/religious culture to one of flexible honor based
 values and self-responsibility has instead become a morass of chaos
 and immorality.  The lesson we should all learn is that while there is
 no definitive list of sins; right and wrong still exist.
 
 As usual Asatru offers a sensible solution.  Our faith deals not in
 legalisms and rules nor in unchecked chaos and relativism.  We instead
 acknowledge the existence of right and wrong, good and evil, but we
 deal with actions according to basic philosophical concepts that are
 applied by the keen intellect of Odin, the simple common sense of
 Thor, and the solid honor of Tyr.the gifts of the Gods to us.
 
 Asatru posits that the basic place of moral judgment is within the
 human heart and mind.  We as human beings with the gift of
 intelligence are sensible and responsible enough to determine right
 from wrong and act accordingly.  The Gods teach us through the
 examples of their lives, as chronicled in the Eddas, and through
 various pieces such as the Havamal which directly offer us advice.  In
 the modern history of our faith, various Asatru organizations have
 outlined simple sets of values which they hold up as simple guidelines
 on how to live ones life.
 
 The Odinic Rite (the major Asatru group in England) has one of the
 most cohesive and sensible of all those we've seen and this set has
 been adopted by the Raven Kindred as an "official" statement of our
 beliefs.  We do this not only as a moral guide for our members, but
 also to say to the world what it is that we stand for.our good name in
 the community being important to us.  Finally, this list is used when
 someone formally joins the Raven Kindred and we hold a sumble and
 toast the 9 virtues to the new member in the hope that they will apply
 them to their life.
 
 The Odinic Rite lists the 9 Noble Virtues as Courage, Truth, Honor,
 Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Industriousness, Self-Reliance, and
 Perseverance.
 
 It would be hard to get much argument on any of these values from
 anyone.  They simply and briefly encapsulate the broad wisdom of our
 Gods and ancestors.
 
 Courage
 
 In virtually every statement of values applied to Asatru, Courage is
 listed first.  As Stephen McNallen has said, courage and bravery are
 perhaps the values which the Vikings are best known for.  However,
 despite our history, few of us face such turmoil as a literal battle
 for ones life.  In fact, I believe it might be easier to manifest
 courage in such a situation than to do so in the many smaller day to
 day occurrences in which courage is called for.
 
 The most common of these occurrences for modern Pagans, is the courage
 to acknowledge and live ones beliefs.  It is also, sadly, the one that
 2854
 
 we most often fail at.  While we may often be full of the type of
 courage that would lead us to face a shield wall, many of us quake at
 the thought of the topic of religion coming up at the office or a
 friend asking what church we attend.  We won't offer easy answers, but
 we ask this: if you toast the courage of your ancestors to fight and
 die for what they believed in, can you trade away your religious
 identity for a higher salary or social acceptance?
 
 In an essay on values there is also the question of moral courage.
 The way of Tyr is difficult.to lose ones hand for ones beliefs.but,
 Tyr thought the price worth paying.  In a million ways modern society
 challenges our values, not just as Asatruar who are estranged from
 mainstream religious practice, but for religious people in an
 increasingly not just secular, but anti-religious culture.  Values are
 also not in favor in modern society.  Breaking or getting around the
 rules is encouraged to get ahead.  Living honorably is simply too
 inconvenient.  I think most people, Asatru or otherwise, find this
 repugnant, but the only way to change it is to have the courage to
 refuse to take part in it.
 
 Truth
 
 The second virtue, that of Truth, is the one that most led our kindred
 to embrace the Odinic Rite's statement of values as our own.  Early in
 our discussions, we decided that no matter what values we chose to
 hold out as our own, truth must be among them.  It is a word that
 holds so much in its definition, and includes such a wide variety of
 moral and philosophical beliefs that we were all drawn to it as a
 simple statement of what we stood for.
 
 At least one of the reasons we wanted to adopt it was the simple issue
 of honesty.  As Bill Dwinnels said at a recent sumbel while toasting
 truth and honesty: if you don't want people to know about something,
 don't do it.  Truth, in the sense of honesty, is essential to personal
 honor and also to any system or morality that is not based on rigid
 legalism.  If one is to uphold an honor code, one must be brutally
 honest with oneself and with others.
 
 Truth is also the Truth that comes with a capital T.the kind of Truth
 that one talks about in terms of religion or morality.  It's common to
 talk of different peoples having different "truths," but it's equally
 important to remember that while we acknowledge that each person or
 people has their own belief as to what Truth is or where to find it,
 there finally is a single Truth.  This is not the Truth as we believe
 it, but ultimate Truth.  While we may respect other people's .truths.
 and seek our own, we must never forget our search for The Truth.  Like
 the Holy Grail of Christian legend, it may never be ours to reach, but
 when we cease to search we perish.
 
 Honor
 
 Honor is the basis for the entire Asatru moral rationale.  If anything
 comes out in the Eddas and Sagas it is that without honor we are
 nothing.  We remember two types of peoples from ancient times: those
 whose honor was so clean that they shine as examples to us and those
 who were so without honor that their names are cursed a thousand years
 after they lived.  Good Asatruar should always strive to be among the
 former.
 2855
 
 However, honor is not mere reputation.  Honor is an internal force
 whose outward manifestation is reputation.  Internal honor is the
 sacred moral compass that each Asatruar and God should hold dear.  It
 is the inner dwelling at peace which comes from living in accordance
 with ones beliefs and with ones knowledge of the Truth of what one is
 doing.  It is something deeply personal and heartfelt, almost akin to
 an emotion.  It's a .knowing. that what one is doing is right and
 decent and correct.
 
 In many ways while the most important of all the virtues it is also
 the most ephemeral in terms of description.  It is all the other
 virtues rolled together and then still more.  The best way I have
 found to describe honor is that if you are truly living with honor,
 you will have no regrets about what you have done with your life.
 
 Fidelity
 
 Fidelity is a word that is far too often defined by it's narrow use in
 terms of marital fidelity.  By the dictionary it simply means being
 faithful to someone or something.  In marriage this means being true
 to ones vows and partner, and this has been narrowly defined as
 limiting ones sexual experience to ones spouse.  While I have found
 this to be great practical advice, many treat fidelity as if there
 were no other ways in which one could be faithful or unfaithful.
 
 For we Asatruar fidelity is most important in terms of our faith and
 troth to the Gods.  We must remain true to the Aesir and Vanir and to
 our kinsmen.  Like marriage, Profession (the rite in which one enters
 the Asatru faith, similar to Christian confirmation or Wiccan
 initiation) is a sacred bond between two parties; in this case an
 Asatruar and the Gods.  In order for such a relationship to work, both
 must be honest and faithful to each other.
 
 Asatru, although currently being reborn, is at its roots a folk
 religion and we also uphold the value of fidelity to the ways of our
 ancestors.  This is why historical research is so important to the
 Asatru-folk: it is the rediscovering of our ancient ways and our
 readoption of them.
 
 Discipline
 
 In any discussion of the values of Asatru, discipline is best
 described as self-discipline.  It is the exercise of personal will
 that upholds honor and the other virtues and translates impulse into
 action.  If one is to be able to reject moral legalism for a system of
 internal honor, one must be willing to exercise the self-discipline
 necessary to make it work.  Going back to my earlier criticism of
 society, if one rejects legalism, one must be willing to control ones
 own actions.  Without self-discipline, we have the mess we currently
 see in our culture.
 
 Looking at discipline in terms of fidelity, we see a close connection.
 Many Pagans go from faith to faith, system to system, path to path.
 Asatruar are much less likely to do this.  The discipline of keeping
 faith with our Gods and the ways of our ancestors is part of our
 modern practice.  In this way, we limit ourselves in some ways, but we
 gain much more in others.
 
 2856
 
 Hospitality
 
 Hospitality is simply one of the strongest core values at the heart of
 virtually every ancient human civilization.  In a community/folk
 religion such as our own, it is the virtue that upholds our social
 fabric.  In ancient times it was essential that when a traveler went
 into the world he could find some sort of shelter and welcome for the
 night.  In modern times it is just as essential that a traveler find
 friendship and safety.
 
 In our modern Asatru community, we need to treat each other with
 respect and act together for the good of our community as a whole.
 This functions most solidly on the level of the kindred or hearth
 where nonfamilial members become extremely close and look out for
 each other.  It can mean hospitality in the old sense of taking in
 people, which we've done, but in modern times it's more likely to mean
 loaning someone a car or a bit of money when they need it (that's
 need, not want).
 
 Part of hospitality is treating other people with respect and dignity.
 Many of our Gods are known to wander the world and stop in at people's
 houses, testing their hospitality and generosity.  The virtue of
 hospitality means seeing people as if they were all individuals with
 self-respect and importance.  Or perhaps from time to time, they are
 literally the Gods in human form.  This has profound implications for
 social action in our religion.  Our response to societal problems such
 as poverty (that's poverty folks, not laziness) is in many ways our
 modern reaction to this ancient virtue.
 
 In terms of our modern community as a whole, I see hospitality in
 terms of frontier "barn raisings" where a whole community would come
 together and pool their resources.  This doesn't mean we have to
 forget differences, but we must put them aside for those who are of
 our Folk, and work for our common good.
 
 Industriousness
 
 Modern Asatruar must be industrious in their actions.  We need to work
 hard if we are going to achieve our goals.  There is so much for us to
 do.  We've set ourselves the task of restoring Asatru to it's former
 place as a mainstream faith and by doing so reinvigorating our society
 and culture.  We can't do this by sitting on our virtues, we need to
 make them an active part of our behavior.  Industry also refers to
 simple hard work in our daily vocations, done with care and pride.
 
 Here's a few concrete examples.  If you are reading this and don't
 have a kindred, why not?  Stop reading now.  Go and place ads in the
 appropriate local stores, get your name on the Ring of Troth, Wyrd
 Network, or Asatru Alliance networking lists, and with other Pagan
 groups.  Put on a workshop.  Ok, now you're back to reading and you
 don't agree with what I'm saying here?  Well, be industrious!  Write
 your own articles and arguments.  Write a letter to the editor and
 suggest this material be banned.better that than passivity.  Get the
 blood moving and go out and do it.  That's how it gets done.  The Gods
 do not favor the lazy.
 
 The same holds true for our non-religious lives.  As Asatruar we
 should offer a good example as industrious people who add to whatever
 2857
 
 we're involved in rather than take from it.  We should be the ones the
 business we work in can't do without and the ones who always seem to
 be able to get things done.  When people think of Asatru, they should
 think of people who are competent and who offer something to the
 world.
 
 This doesn.t just apply to vocational work, but to the entire way we
 live our lives.  It is just as much a mentality.  The Vikings were
 vital people.  They lived each day to its fullest and didn.t wring
 their hands in doubt or hesitation.  We should put the same attitude
 forward in all that we do whether it is our usual vocation, devotion
 to the Gods, or leisure time.
 
 Self Reliance
 
 Industry brings us directly to the virtue of Self-Reliance, which is
 important both in practical and traditional terms.  Going back to the
 general notion of this article, we are dealing with a form of morality
 that is largely self-imposed and thus requires self-reliance.  We rely
 on ourselves to administer our own morality.
 
 Traditionally, our folkways have always honored the ability of a man
 or woman to make their own way in the world and not to lean on others
 for their physical needs.  This is one of the ways in which several
 virtues reinforce and support each other.  Hospitality cannot function
 if people are not responsible enough to exercise discipline and take
 care of themselves.  It's for those that strive and fail or need
 assistance that hospitality is intended, not for the idle who simply
 won't take care of themselves.
 
 In terms of our relationships with the Gods, self-reliance is also
 very important.  If we wish the Gods to offer us their blessings and
 gifts, we must make ourselves worthy of them.and the Gods are most
 pleased with someone who stands on their own two feet.  This is one of
 the reasons for the Asatru .rule. that we do not kneel to the Gods
 during our ceremonies.  By standing we acknowledge our relationship as
 striving and fulfilled people looking for comradeship and a
 relationship, rather than acting as scraelings looking for a handout
 from on high.  It takes very little for a God to attract a follower,
 if worship simply means getting on the gravy train.  We, as Asatruar,
 are people who can make our own way in the world, but who choose to
 seek a relationship with the Gods.
 
 In mundane terms being self-reliant is a simple way to allow ourselves
 the ability to live as we wish to.  In simple economic terms, if one
 has enough money in the bank one doesn't need to worry as much about
 being fired due to religious discrimination.  We can look a bigot in
 the face and tell him just where he can put it.  It's also nice to
 have something in the bank to lay down as a retainer on a good lawyer
 so we can take appropriate action.
 
 On the other side of this is self-reliance in the sense of Henry David
 Thoreau, who advocated a simple lifestyle that freed one from the
 temptations of materialism.  Again, here we are able to live as we
 wish with those things that are truly important.  Religious people
 from all faiths have found that adjusting ones material desires to
 match one's ability to meet them leaves one open for a closer
 relationship with deity and a more fulfilling life.  While our
 2858
 
 ancestors were great collectors of gold goodies, they didn.t lust for
 possessions in and of themselves, but for what they stood for and
 could do for them.  In fact, the greatest thing that could be said of
 a Lord was that he was a good .Ring Giver..
 
 Being self-reliant also means taking responsibility for ones life.
 It's not just about refusing a welfare check or not lobbying for a tax
 exemption, but also refusing to blame ones failures on religious
 intolerance, the patriarchy, or an unfair system.  The system may, in
 fact, be unfair, but it's our own responsibility to deal with it.
 
 In societal terms, we have become much too dependent on other people
 for our own good.  As individuals we look to the government or to
 others to solve our problems and as a society we borrow billions from
 our descendants to pay for today's excesses.  Most problems in this
 world could be solved if people just paid their own way as they went.
 
 Perseverance
 
 The final virtue is Perseverance which I think most appropriate
 because it is the one that we most need to keep in mind in our living
 of the other values.  Our religion teaches us that the world is an
 imperfect place, and nothing comes easy.  We need to continue to seek
 after that which we desire.  In this imperfect world there are no free
 lunches or easy accomplishments.especially in the subjects we have set
 before ourselves.  If we truly wish to build an Asatru community that
 people will hold up as an example of what committed people can do,
 then we must persevere through the hardships that building our
 religion is going to entail.  We must be willing to continue on when
 we are pushed back.  If one loses a job for ones religion, the answer
 is not to go back and hide, but to continue until one finds a vocation
 where one can more forward and live as an Asatruar should.
 
 Finally we must persevere when we simply fail.  If one's kindred falls
 apart because of internal strife, one should go back and start over.
 Pick up the pieces and continue on.  If nobody had done this after the
 disintegration of the Asatru Free Assembly, this would probably never
 have been written.  We must be willing to continue in the hard work of
 making our religion strong.not just when it is convenient and easy to
 do so, but when it gets hard, inconvenient, or just plain boring.  To
 accomplish without striving is to do little, but to persevere and
 finally accomplish a hard fought goal brings great honor.

 Hailing the Sun: A Sample Blot to honor Sunna at the Summer Solstice
 
 This ritual would be ideally performed at sunrise on the day of the
 summer Solstice.  If possible the folk should gather while it is still
 dark or even better, remain awake throughout the night in vigil.  A
 secondary time would be at noon on the Solstice.  This ritual should
 not be performed at night.
 
 At any point in this ritual, within the realm of logic and dramatic
 flow, the parts marked as Gothi and Gythia may be shared among the
 2859
 
 folk.  In addition, the parts are not necessarily sex specific, but
 the terminology is used as a convenience.
 
 Set Up: An altar should be placed in the center and the folk should
 form a circle around it, leaving space in the center for the .action.
 to take place.  For this ritual you will need some sort of mead or
 beer, a horn or chalice, an offering bowl, a hammer for consecrations,
 and a wheel of some sort, preferably a wagon wheel to symbolize the
 turning of the wheel of the year.  Any reasonable tools may be
 substituted.  The Wheel is placed on the ground near the altar or on
 the altar with candles around the rim (unlit).
 
 Consecration of space
 
 The Gothi goes to the center of the folk and forms the invocational
 position of the elhaz rune, both hands in the air at a rough 45.
 angle.
 
 Gothi: We gather here to honor our sacred lady Sunna, who on this
 Solstice Morning, reaches her height of power.  All hail Sunna!
 
 All: Hail Sunna!
 
 The Gythia takes the hammer and walks to each of the four corners and
 consecrates the space.
 
 Gythia: Hammer, hallow and hold this holy stead, that it will be a
 fitting place for our worship of our sacred lady Sunna! Hammar, Helga
 ve thetta ok hindra alla illska!
 
 Gythia returns hammer to altar and faces the altar.
 
 Gythia: I consecrate and hallow this altar to the work of our sacred
 lady Sunna! Here on this Solstice morning may the might of the Gods be
 brought to our holy stead.  May the warm light of Sunna heat our
 hearts and hold our spirits.
 
 Gothi: Our holy lady watches and waits for the blot in her honor.
 Hail Sunna!
 
 All: Hail Sunna!
 
 (At this point it would be most appropriate for a song or reading to
 be performed.  It should obviously be about Sunna or the sun or
 something appropriate to the day.)
 
 Invocation
 
 Gythia: Our lady Sunna is the light of knowledge, the warmth of love,
 and the heat of our passion.  Let us spend a moment in silence,
 contemplating those things which she brings us.
 
 Leave a few moments for silent prayers and meditation.
 
 Gothi: Holy Sunna.  Lady of the Sun.  Light of the heavens.  Ever
 pursued and ever free.  We gather to greet and welcome you and offer
 you gifts on this day.  We offer to you our prayers and love, our
 devotion and strength, our kinship and honor.
 2960
 
 All face the sun and form the elhaz posture.
 
 All: Hail to thee Sunna, light of Har newly risen.  She whose holy
 light shone upon our ancestors of old and she who.s light will shine
 upon our children.  We give you hail and welcome.  Fill our hearts on
 this Solstice morning with your warm rays that your fires may burn in
 our hearts throughout the year.  Hail Sunna!
 
 A few moments of silence are appropriate here.
 
 Blot
 
 Gothi: Now it is time to offer sacrifice to our holy lady.
 
 Gythia takes horn and Gothi fills it with mead.  Gythia holds horn
 above her head, in the direction of the sun.
 
 Gythia: Here is our sacrifice, the essence of our love and spirit.  We
 offer it to you as a token of our kinship and our love.  As you drink
 of it, may your power fill this holy hlaut and feed our spirits.
 
 Gythia drinks from the horn and it is then passed around the folk,
 each taking a drink, with the horn returning to the Gythia.
 
 Gythia: Hail to thee Sunna!
 
 Gythia pours remainder of horn into the offering bowl.  Gythia and
 Gothi take the bowl and evergreen sprig and walk around the folk,
 sprinkling the mead to the four corners and on the folk.  Finally they
 return to the center and sprinkle the wheel.
 
 Gothi: Hail the sacred wheel of the sun.  Now it is the longest day of
 the year and the sun is triumphant, but all changes and the wheel
 turns.
 
 Gythia lights candles on the wheel and members of the folk take it up
 and parade it around the grounds.  A song or chant would be
 appropriate at this time.  .The sun burns, the wheel turns!. for
 example.  Once the procession is done (this decision should be based
 on the subjective feelings of those involved and not planned out) the
 wheel should be returned to the altar.
 
 Gothi &amp; Gythia assume the invocation position
 
 Gothi: Sacred Lady Sunna, Summer Sun now strongest.  We thank you for
 your blessings of warmth and light.  May you reign long.
 
 All: Hail Sunna!  Hail Sunna!  Hail Sunna!
 
 Libation
 
 Gothi takes up the hlaut bowl.
 
 Gothi: Now our rite is ended and the sacrifice is made.  The wheel
 turns.  To Sunna, to the Gods, to the Goddesses, and to Earth, mother
 of us all, we offer this holy mead, from the Gods to the Earth To us.
 From ourselves to the Earth to the Gods.  Hail!
 
 2861
 
 Gothi pours contents of the hlaut bowl on the ground, possibly in the
 center of the wheel.  If this ritual is done indoors, the libation
 should be poured outside afterwards.  We usually trek outside
 immediately even if the ritual is an apartment.  The physical action
 of pouring the libation is an important psychological trigger to both
 Gods and men that the ritual is over.
 
 
 What Is The Raven Kindred?
 
 The Raven Kindred is a non-incorporated religious organization
 dedicated to the worship and veneration of the ancient Nordic Gods and
 Goddesses and to the religion of Asatru.  We are centered around the
 Worcester county area of Massachusetts and Southern Maryland/suburban
 D.C.  areas, but have members in Western Massachusetts, the Boston
 area, and Connecticut.  We welcome members from other areas, including
 contacts through correspondence.
 
 The focus of the Raven Kindred is specifically the religion of Asatru.
 While we honor our Pagan relations in the Wiccan community, we are
 following a much different tradition.  Our rituals are the blot or
 offering and the sumble.  Also while we are primarily involved as a
 kindred in exoteric forms of worship, we have members who are
 interested in seidhr, rune magic, and other esoteric pursuits within
 the Nordic Tradition.
 
 We practice a fairly conservative version of Asatru trying to keep
 close to our roots in the Asatru Free Assembly and Asatru Alliance
 including a tribalist sense of who we are as a Folk.  However, we are
 also much more progressive in our social beliefs and politics and we
 welcome all persons regardless of ethnic origin, sexual preference, or
 political view.  We hope to be a link between the Old and the New,
 holding to our dear values of Faith, Folk, and Family while discarding
 the prejudices that have held our religion back.
 
 Our goals for the future are quite far-reaching.  We support the
 movement to bring Asatru out of the shadows and to spread the Troth of
 the Gods to all who are their natural children.  More immediately we
 intend to network with existing Asatru organizations, both local and
 national, while also setting up other chapters of the Raven Kindred
 and doing some networking on our own behalf.
 
 Attendence at Raven Kindred rituals is essentially open, although we
 reserve the right to eject anyone who is disruptive as well as the
 right to hold observances that are open only to Professed Asatru or to
 Kindred Members.  Full membership is available only to those who have
 Professed Asatru and place their membership in the Raven Kindred above
 other religious commitments.  Decisions about the Raven Kindred are
 made by a majority vote by Full Members.
 
 Currently the Raven Kindred holds a Blot on the first Saturday of each
 month in Sturbridge Massachusetts and Wheaton Maryland.  We also
 gather at other seasonally appropriate times for Blots and other
 activities.

 Raven Kindred Ritual Outline
 
 The Raven Kindred has developed a slightly different form of the Blot
 ritual which we use.  This has come to pass because of a desire for
 more personal involvement as well as a smaller group of people than
 would be appropriate for a major blot.
 
 The major change, outside of a few cosmetic differences, is that we
 have added a .mini sumbel. to the blot ritual in place of the
 sprinkling in which we offer three rounds of toasts: the first
 dedicated to the God or Goddess being honored and the remaining two to
 anything the participants deem appropriate which is not inimical to
 the purpose of the blot.  (i.e.  don.t toast the Jotnar during a
 ritual to Thor.)
 
 Setting the mood: Chant to Odin, Vili, Ve
 
 To begin each ritual we offer a three round chant of .Odin, Vili, Ve..
 This serves two purposes.  First we are linking ourselves to the Gods
 of creation and thus to the connections between Midgard and the Gods.
 Second and perhaps more appropriately it allows people to get
 themselves mentally prepared for the service.
 
 Hammer Rite
 
 We offer an invocation to Fire and Ice which are the central elements
 of the creation of the world.  We ask that the place we are meeting be
 blessed and Holy for the coming of the Gods.
 
 Statement of purpose
 
 We far too often ignore this, but it.s a good idea to have the Gothi
 or Gythia who is presiding greet the participants and state something
 general about the purpose of the ritual.  It need not be complicated
 .We gather together today to celebrate the Winter Nights as our
 ancestors did.  To honor our ancestors, the Disir, and Freya the Great
 Dis and to renew our bonds as a family [kindred]..
 
 General Prayer
 
 At this point one of our members usually offers up a prayer to the
 Aesir and Vanir collectively to thank them for their bounty since the
 last time we met and to ask their blessings upon the kindred and its
 members.
 
 Personal invocations
 
 We reserve a time between the opening of the ritual and the blot
 ceremony for people to offer any prayers or other invocations they
 feel necessary.  This is the time when we Profess new members of
 Asatru.  Other activities done at this time have included a kindred
 member thanking Saga, the Goddess of wisdom, for her recent graduation
 2863
 
 from college.
 
 Invoke deity of occasion
 
 At this point we make a point to specifically invoke and honor the
 deity that we are bloting.  We attempt to list as many names and or
 functions of the God as possible and this serves a dual purpose in
 reminding the attendees of who the God is and why we are honoring Him.
 This is, however, separate from the offering.
 
 Meditation
 
 At this point we like to remind ourselves why we are here and what the
 Gods mean to us.  We sit and someone either offers a spoken meditation
 or more often reads a story from the mythology.  While most of us
 enjoy the poetic edda, we usually use a modern prose version of the
 myth as it is easier to follow.
 
 Offer/sanctify mead
 
 The Gothi takes up the horn and his assistant (often called .The
 Valkyrie. by Asafolk) fills it with mead.  The Gothi then steps to the
 altar and holds the horn aloft and asks the God to partake of it and
 charge it with his power.
 
 Toast to the deity of occasion
 
 This is when we begin to deviate substantially from the standard
 Asatru blot ritual.  Beginning with the Gothi the horn is raised and a
 toast drunk to the God.  The horn is then passed around to the Folk
 and a personal toast repeated.  The only rule here is that the round
 is dedicated to the God invoked.  Many times the toasts are personal
 thanksgiving or requests for aid or wisdom.
 
 At the end of the round the remains of the horn (and there should be
 some) are poured into the blotbowl.
 
 Remaining toasts
 
 We then take two more rounds to toast whatever Gods, ancestors, and
 beings each person wishes.  There is not necessarily any continuity
 from one person to the next.  Brags or oaths are also appropriate at
 this time.  Professions, other major oaths, and major works of
 thanksgiving or praise are usually done before the blot.  The second
 and third toasts are usually reserved for small things.
 
 Thank deity
 
 Finally we always remember to thank the deity and ask for his
 continued blessings on the Folk present.
 
 Oath Ring ceremony
 
 Our kindred has a ceremony that affirms our dedication to each other,
 to the kindred, and to the Gods.  Each full Professed and accepted
 Kindred member comes forward and takes hold of the oath ring.  (We are
 blessed in having a 6. diameter brass oath ring made for us by a
 kindred member.) One person then recites a rede concerning itself with
 2864
 
 the symbol of a ring and something which connects us to the Gods, the
 Earth, and to each other.
 
 I should repeat, only kindred Members participate in this.  If you
 haven.t sworn on the oath ring, you don.t take part in the ceremony.
 We have enlarged this at public events to all Professed persons, but
 change the rede to remove references to the kindred.
 
 Pour libation
 
 Finally we leave the Hof and pour a libation on the physical earth,
 adjourning outside to do so if we are indoors.  The blot hitting the
 ground signals that the ritual is truly over.  When we are working
 indoors in a living room or other non-dedicated space I always make
 sure I am the first to return and extinguish candles, turn on electric
 lights, etc.  This provides a good hint to people.s minds that the
 ritual is, in fact, over.  If we had a dedicated space, the procession
 outside to pour the blot would also empty the Hof and we would adjourn
 to the feast rather than returning to the temple.

 Sources and Resources for Asatru
 
 2867
 
 Please note: This resource list is provided as is and is intended to
 be comprehensive. The Raven Kindred doesn.t necessarily endorse any of
 the following organizations, publications, etc.
 
 Organizations:
 
 The Ring of Troth P.O. Box 25637; Tempe, AZ 85285-5637 The Ring of
 Troth was founded by Edred Thorsson. He resigned in Spring of 2242
 (Runic Reckoning . 1992 C.E.) and has been replaced by Prudence
 Priest, most well known as the editor of Yggdrasil.
 
 The Ring is governed by an appointed High Rede of 9 persons who guide
 the national affairs of the Ring. They offer a number of programs
 include an Elder training program for prospective clergy, The Rune
 Ring for study of the magical properties of the Runes from within a
 Germanic Pagan context, and recognition for local Kindreds.
 
 The Ring of Troth requires that .its members affiliate for cultural
 and religious reasons rather than for racial and political reasons.
 The use of the Ring of Troth as a platform for any type of political
 or racial propoganda will not be tolerated.
 
 The Troth provides a quarterly magazine and a networking list. There
 are also regional gatherings put on by individual Kindreds. Work is
 currently underway on a book of rituals.
 
 Dues are $24 and include a subscription to Idunna. If one does not
 wish to join, Friends of the Troth may receive Idunna for $24 as well.
 
 The Asatru Alliance of Independent Kindreds P.O. Box 961; Payson AZ
 85547
 
 The Alliance is the linear descendent of the Asatru Free Assembly.
 They are a democratically run national confederation of independent
 kindreds who meet once a year in an Allthing to conduct business. It
 is essentially conservative and libertarian. .The Alliance is based
 upon the ancient model of tribal democracy known as the Thing, and
 member kindreds support a code of laws we feel necessary to preserve
 and protect Asatru from those who would dilute, subvert, or in any way
 harm our religion. Membership in the Alliance is encouraged for those
 who actively promote and believe in the Aesir and Vanir and our
 collective Heathen Heritage. Anyone interested in joining the Alliance
 should contact the kindred of choice for acceptance. There is no
 membership in the Alliance except through a kindred. Applicants must
 subscribe to the membership requirements of the kindred of choice and
 uphold the bylaws of the Asatru Alliance.. This group has recently
 adopted a declaration stating that Asatru is an ethnic religion, so
 membership now seems to be limited on the basis of race.
 
 The Odinic Rite BM Edda; London, WCN 3XX
 
 The Odinic Rite BM Runic: London WCN 3XX
 
 These two organizations are each claiming to be the .true. Odinic
 Rite. The BM Runic address is the older one, but the BM Edda address
 seems to be producing more publications. I.d suggest writing to both
 and figuring it out on your own. The Odinic Rite is an organization
 for the revival of Odinism in England. If one sends a few postal reply
 2868
 
 coupons I believe each will send you information. Both publish
 magazines.
