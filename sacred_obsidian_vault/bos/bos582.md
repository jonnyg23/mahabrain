                     THE LEGEND OF THE MAIDEN
 
                        The Mysts of Annwfn
                          Book of Shadows
 
 
      In Ages long past, the lovely Lady Brighid came to Hibernia
 to dwell in that land among her people.  She brought to them many
 special treasures from the Outer Realms to enrich their lives.
 She gave them the art of Smithcraft, Poetry, and Inspiration.
 Brighid also shared a sacred Cauldron that overflowed with
 inspiration and love.  She was adept at the healing arts, and in
 the Magick of Medicine.  Her people loved her deeply, and kindled
 a fire in her honor which was constantly attended by nineteen
 maidens, and was never allowed to go out.
 
      The Lady Brighid eventually became a mother, and her people
 rejoiced, knowing their lands would be fruitful just as their
 Goddess was fertile.  However, Brighid also knew the misery of
 loss.  When one of her beloved sons was killed, the whole land
 wept.  She lamented so deeply that she invented "keening," the
 mournful song of the bereaved women of Erin.  Her Flame burned so
 brightly, however, that happiness soon returned to the land.  She
 bestowed upon her people, yet, another gift:  The Art of
 Whistling.
 
      However, in the fullness of time, the beloved Lady could no
 longer dwell openly with her people, and she made her home in the
 Sidhe.  There, she would dwell close to her people and her land,
 and they could call upon her name at the appointed times, and
 keep her Flame burning within their hearts.
 
 
               The Eternal Flame continues to burn!
