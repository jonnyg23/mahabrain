 It's from a Pagan version of the song CIRCLES.  I'm not sure who wrote
 it - I want to say a group of women in Lansing, Mich. Unfortunately, my
 copy says "ANON".
 -----------------------------------
 
 I have recieved the following communication about the
 authorship of this song (June 2001):
 
 This song was written by Gwendolyn Lee Zak (aka Gwendolyn Zak Moore at
 the time) and Ann Cass (verse 5 only). The tune "Windmills" is by Alan
 Bell.
 
 Gwen does not object to the nonprofit reprinting of her lyrics,
 especially within the pagan community. But we ask that you please add a
 copyright notice after this fashion:
 
 Verses 1-4 and Chorus (c) 1979 by Gwendolyn Lee Zak. Used by
 permission.
 
 Best wishes,
 
 Michael P. Kube-McDowell

                           CIRCLES            TUNE: WINDMILLS
 
 (1) In days gone by, when the world was much younger,
     Men wondered at Spring, born of Winter's cold knife,
     Wondering at the games of the moon and the sunlight,
     They saw there the Lady and Lord of all life.
 
     CHORUS: Around and around, and around turns the good Earth,
             All things must change as the seasons go by,
             we are the children of the Lord and the Lady,
             Whose mysteries we know, but will never know why.
 
 (2) In all lands the people were tied to the good Earth,
     Plowing and sowing, as the seasons declared,
     Waiting to reap of the rich golden harvest,
     Knowing her laughter in the joys that we shared.
 
     Chorus.
 
 (3) Through Flanders and Wales and the green lands of Ireland,
     in the kingdoms of England and Csotland and Spain,
     Circles grew up all along the wild coastlines,
     And worked for the land, with the Sun and the rain.
 
     Chorus
 
 (4) Circles for healing, and working the weather,
     Circles for knowing the Moon and the Sun,
     Circles for thanking the Lord and the Lady,
     Circles for dancing the dance never done.
 
     Chorus
 
 (5) And we who reach for the stars in the heavens,
     Turning our eyes from the meadows and groves,
     Still live in the love of the Lord and the Lady,
     The greater the circle, the more the love grows.
 
     Chorus twice.
 
 Blessed be, and keep dancing.
   Keipa
