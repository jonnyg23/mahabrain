     Snow lies deep upon the Earth       
     Still our voices warmly sing        
     Heralding the glorious birth        
     Of the Child, the Winter King       
        Glo -- ria!

     In Her arms a holy Child            
     Promises a glowing Light            
     Through the winter wind so wild     
     He proclaims the growing Light.

     Of the greater Turning sings        
     Passing age of cold and fear        
     Soon our golden summer brings.

      CHRISTMAS TIME IS PAGAN!           
     (Gloria in Excelsius Deo)           
                                         
   CHORUS:                               
        Glorious!                        
        Christmas time is pagan!         
        Glorious!                        
        Christmas time is pagan!         
                                         
   Christmas time is here again,         
   Decorations everywhere.               
   Christmas carols ringing out,         
   Gentle pagans, we don't care.         
                                         
   Modern folks all celebrate            
   What they learned in Sunday School.   
   In December, they don't know          
   They are celebrating Yule!            
                                         
   Let them have their Christmas trees,  
   Decked in red and green and blue.     
   We rejoice at every one!              
   Christmas trees are pagan, too.       
                                         
   Bowls of bubbly Christmas cheer,      
   Fill your cup and quench your thirst. 
   They think the tradition's theirs.    
   Wassail bowls were pagan, first.      
 
 
 
      CHRISTMAS TIME IS PAGAN!                                                   
 
   Every door and window bears           
   Wreaths of holly, wreaths of pine.    
   Circles represent the Sun.            
   Every wreath is yours and mine.       
                                         
   Christmas lights on Christmas trees,  
   Candle flames burn higher and higher, 
   Let us cheer along, my friends,       
   As they light their Yuletide fire.    
                                         
   There's a possibility                 
   That this song is yours and mine      
   'Cause the tune was known to all      
   Back in A.D. one-two-nine.            
                                         
                 *                       
                 *                       
                                         
        GOD REST YE MERRY, PAGANFOLK     
        (God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen)   
                                         
   God rest ye merry, paganfolk,         
   Let nothing you dismay.               
   Remember that the Sun returns         
   Upon this Solstice day.               
   The growing dark is ending now        
   And Spring is on its way.             
   Oh, tidings of comfort and joy,       
   Comfort and joy!                      
   Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.       
                                         
   The Goddess rest ye merry, too,       
   And keep you safe from harm.          
   Remember that we live within          
   The circle of Her arms,               
   And may Her love give years to come   
   A very special charm.                 
   Oh, tidings of comfort and joy,       
   Comfort and joy!                      
   Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!       
                                         
                         *
